		<shortDescription>A thoughtful film for thoughtful viewers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. For some folks the idea of slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists, some part they long for contact with.I suppose it's a function of where I am in my own life these days, but I count myself in the camp of the latter group. I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological. This is indeed a journey story, a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days.Much as been written of Mr Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin Straight, though I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us. Knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not just for "acting" but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty.Given the realities of production economics, I'm not sure full credit has been given Mr Lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly. An outsider to film production, I nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression "time is money" is so accurately descriptive. Going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and to his credit Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story--he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality. No simple task, that.If you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with The Straight Story. And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting. These I got. What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.If you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Runs Likes a Deere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful and very emotional "Harry and Tonto"-styled movie experience as Oscar-nominee Richard Farnsworth (playing the real-life Alvin Straight) decides to travel on his old riding John Deere mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother (Harry Dean Stanton) because his driver's license has been revoked, he doesn't like public transportation and he has no one else to drive him. The two brothers have not been on speaking terms for many years and now the clock is literally ticking on one last chance for them to see one another and hopefully make amends for past mistakes. Sissy Spacek gives one of her finest performances as Farnsworth's slightly mentally retarded daughter and the supporting players are all real and heartfelt caricatures of America's heartland. Outstanding film-maker David Lynch (to me the finest living American director, along with Martin Scorsese) goes totally out-of-character with a 180-degree turn from whacked triumphs like "The Elephant Man", "Blue Velvet", "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Mulholland Dr.". He quietly and methodically creates a G-rated family film that has deep messages for people of all ages and backgrounds. He paints a picture of America where the old ways of life are still the most important. Farnsworth (who is a total revelation) was in excruciating pain throughout filming due to terminal cancer and terrible arthritis. Notice he stands very little in the movie and he is almost always filmed from the waist up. Sadly this would be his final performance as he committed suicide shortly after his Oscar nod. He did become the oldest nominee ever in the Best Actor category, but really that will become trivial as time passes and his role will be the thing that shines brightly forever. Truly a legacy production for all involved. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie Lynch stuff. Rather, it's for those who either appreciate a good story, or have grown tired of the run-of-the-mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and Oprah-ish "This is such a wonderful movie! You must see it!"-semantics (tho' she IS right, for once!).The story unfolds flawlessly, and we are taken along a journey that, I believe, most of us will come to recognize at some time. A compassionate, existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise.Acting is without faults, cinematography likewise (occasionally quite brilliant!), and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story.A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely gorgeous film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade. As much as the film is G-rated, it's pure Lynch in style, pacing, and tone. The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power.The cinematography is terrific, as is to be expected from a Lynch film, and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking. It's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly, kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either "good" or "evil".Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and 'Lost Highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH, and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'Mulholland Drive', considering the high praise it's received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch.'Straight Story' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I've ever seen. It's a loving story about family, friendship, and the kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shockingly-Straight Story From David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love" describes this odd David Lynch film. This was especially "odd" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those "dark" films, too.This was another supposed-true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an "odd" film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, low-key personality-wise, that just about everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released.The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much, and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his trip, the story picks up. I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them, it was a sleeping pill.I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story. It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this. Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way, such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but that's a joke: he's only in the final few minutes of the movie!The Iowa scenery is pleasant. I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil. It's a nice state with nice people....like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lyrical love poem of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of America. At one level a slow walk through the heartland, it's kind inhabitants, and amber grain, at another level about growing old and remembering what is important(and actively forgetting what isn't). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence. A remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuine rather than saccharine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my b.s. detector goes off. Usually, a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them, but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk. So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews, I was apprehensive, especially since I was not a fan of his other "uplifting" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN. For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film, it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us.I needn't have worried. THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one. Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part. There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without, and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much, but those are only quibbles. There's no heavy-handed message, no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions, and no condescension towards us and its characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build its own power, and it does, so by the final scene, we are genuinely moved.Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part. He really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still perseveres, and except for those homilies, the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental, because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long. And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make some peace, not only with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also does fine, unmannered work as Straight's daughter. And although I am a city and suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot, making me want at least to visit some day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, but steady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes patience to get through David Lynch's eccentric, but-- for a change-- life-affirming chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick with it. Though it moves as slow as Straight's John Deere, when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging, the painful regrets and secrets, and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth caps his career with the year's most genuine performance, sad and poetic, flinty and caring. And Sissy Spacek matches him as his "slow" daughter Rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad. Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slice of America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film I feel like I know just a little bit more about the USA. David Lynch is synonymous with shock value and weird for weirdness sake, and indeed these elements are not missing from The Straight Story. However it is in a light that I have not witnessed from Lynch before. We begin with a simple family living a quiet life but end up with an array of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be apparent from their introduction. Especially moving was the bar scene with two WWII veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current lives and emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, don't look here. But if you are looking for real people with real stories this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother, could possibly be good cinema? I certainly didn't. I thought I knew what to expect: one of the most boring experiences of my life. Well I was as wrong as I haven't been wrong too often yet, because this is one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've ever seen...Giving a short resume of "The Straight Story" isn't very difficult. It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke. That's already special on itself, but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument. In the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems, but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life. Despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks, not knowing if he will reach his goal: seeing his brother again before it's too late...I can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why I will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that... This movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes, it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no, you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either, because there isn't any. But why should you watch it then? Well, the simple answer is the story. I haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and - to make things even better - from the Disney Studio's (that's right, the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense) makes it even more special. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it, probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me.Some people will argue that the story is very shallow, but I really don't agree with that. Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don't want to think any further. If you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong, that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too, so they won't make the same mistake. If that isn't deep enough, how much deeper does a story have to go for you then? I would also like to add that this movie really had it all. Some beautiful landscapes (finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York, Chicago or some other big city), some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek,... and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie. I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste. It's one of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye. I give it the full 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Old Crows Live Here... A Road Trip movie from David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Titled after the family names of two brothers, The Straight Story is a true American classic. It would be a very good choice to watch, when you get together with your family.The Straight Story has its plainness and "straight"ness, as the first thing to say. The plainness segment includes no technical features; no audio or video aspects, no set decoration or cinematography work, no make-up and no costume. In fact with the use of this plainness David Lynch brings the restful country life to your view.Taking a road trip from Iowa to Wisconsin, a World War-II veteran plunges unhesitatingly into the river of his passion, driving his way with a 1966 John Deere lawnmower, and with his defect of eyesight. I didn't know the lawnmowers are made for traffic since I watch this film. Well, nothing is strange enough in David Lynch' s point of view. Despite this strangeness Lynch offers a complete sagacity through Alvin Straight(Richard Farnsworth)'s successful acting and Sissy Spacek as his daughter accompanying him. Thus, you get the straightness segment through those dialogues full of sagacity.Lynch has filmed his story along the roads that the real life Alvin Straight traveled in 1994. Wisely, Lynch dished out his work very economically except he has used a helicopter to let us see how slowly Alvin driving his lawnmower on the road from bird's eye-view. Still, Lynch could have cut some of the scenes which overshadow the smooth style of the film. His Straight Story taught us the importance of finishing whatever we started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful road trip with a man and his trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon The Straight Story release in 1999, it was praised for being David Lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal. Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere '66 mower, at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct. Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynch's trademark motifs coming through.Lynch's focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down. The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating. Incredibly significant, this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced.The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing. For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. Almost universally acclaimed, the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism, that it wasn't a typical Lynch film. "Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G-Rated story that isn't his own." Brundage claims, with his protagonist Alvin Straight "quoting lines directly from Confucious." He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead, Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive - all films which I also adore, The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible. If you are a Lynch fan, it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature.The narrative is slow and thoughtful, which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination. Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife, children and his brother. Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks, which only adds to the effect, which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents. The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch. The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti, makes me yearn to go to America. The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent. His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win. Regardless, however it is probably the finest swan-song for any actor. So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue, the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>End of a long road for Alvin Straight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch's (1999) film of John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin some time well before the film's eventual release.We come into the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) late on in life. His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it.This makes what he decides to do, even more remarkable and endearing. He decides (and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions) to put a few things straight.Alvin is, by this time in his life, a man of great experience but modest means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf. But it's worth it, because Rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses.This film is the story of a journey. But like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. Early on in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake.But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective. His objective is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him. He has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time.Along the way, Alvin meets many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film. We come to know who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film, we know who we are .. better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strychnine in the Candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Lynch lives in a very troubled world. His pictures are characterized by being presented through the mind of the protagonist. Here, the protagonist is a simple old man, who thinks slowly and simply. So that's what we get. He has long erotic meditations on fecundity on the path of life (14 kids!), so that is what we see.Lynch must be laughing into his gasmask at those who think this is a Hallmark card. Consider these Lynchisms:-- the deerslaying woman (killed the same number of deer as Straight had kids)-- the man in the bar sharpening his knife-- the graveyard-- the `twin' with the jaw prosthetic-- the burning house-- the fat useless woman from next door-- the WWII hauntings-- the retarded daughter who has had her children taken away (and the mirror of the pregnant runaway who likely will also)-- the brother's glance at the end. Look at it again if you think it is appreciative reconciliation. That glance is why they needed an actor of the caliber of Stanton who was also familar to Lynch.Add to this the notion that Farnsworth knew he was dying and had already planned suicide. This is a very disturbed world, reinterpreted through the elder Kurosawan eye of the determined elder Straight to seem more desperately rosey than it is. Consider this like the first half of "Mulholland Drive," and a more intelligent film it is, because it asks you to provide the last half.The magic in the movie is not that it is saccharin, nor that it has strychnine, but that it is an homage to other filmmakers: Altman, Kurosawa, de Palma, Greenaway. Straight has his memories which he plays over and over, and so does Lynch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen: I glowed inside throughout the whole film. The music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen. The slow pace was set by the mode of travel (a riding lawn mower with a big trailer) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow-paced lives of the other characters.The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters. Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across Iowa to visit his estranged brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. Alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way.The film underscores the importance of family to this man and, hopefully, to all of us. I eagerly anticipate seeing it again, and again. Directed by David Lynch, this films proves his directorial skill. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film about aging, regret, and redemption. A beautiful experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think about but they really don't gel in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin's slow journey toward realization.Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.Later Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with thanks.While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower. He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in it's simplicity. It's heartfelt because it's so straight, so real.The journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends. We want to know this world is full of forgiveness.This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can't help but to understand his pride, to listen to his wisdom, and to ultimately feel his pain. One becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in.If there's justice in the afterlife then Alvin Straight, his brother, and Richard Farnsworth are together sitting at a bar. I can picture them discussing their lives, regrets, hopes, and joys. As Alvin says in the film, "My brother and I used to look up at the stars." Well, I know they all are with the best view in the house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly heartwarming tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Straight Story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line. He decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he can't drive and he wants to make the rip by himself. The film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way. Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.At first I felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but I soon discovered that Lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie I would recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Extraordinarily Uncon-Lynch-tional!" (Not a Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a biographical account of an amazing journey made by seventy-three year old Alvin Straight in the mid-nineteen nineties. Straight is struggling to come to terms with his own mortality when he learns that his estranged brother is also having health issues that may ultimately leave them with unresolved issues.All of his associates seem to agree that Alvin remains of sound mind and, for the time being, that seems to be enough to counter balance his rapidly advancing physical deficiencies. That is until he reveals the unconventional and extremely dangerous method of travel that he plans to use to make the approximate three hundred and fifty mile trip to visit his brother Lyle.I can't imagine that there's anyone in Hollywood who could have played the leading role of Alvin Straight better than Richard Farnsworth, whose performance earned him an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. Sissy Spacek's portrayal of his mentally challenged daughter Rose, is phenomenal as well. They never pinpoint her affliction, but I'm guessing that it's some form of autism. She stutters badly and is somewhat slow-witted, but highly independent and has an uncanny knack for remembering facts, historical and otherwise. The brevity of her on screen appearance may well have been the only thing that kept her from receiving yet another Academy Award Nomination for her work here.Prior to seeing the opening credits I had no knowledge, whatsoever, of the actual making of the film. When I saw the "G Rating"; I was surprised. When I saw that it was a Walt Disney Production, I was intrigued, but you could have knocked me over with a feather when I realized that David Lynch was its director.This only helped to confirm what I'd felt all along. David Lynch's talents, in terms of style and imagery, are bound by nothing, including his lack of involvement in the writing of this piece. Despite the limitations of the MPAA rating and the guidelines of Walt Disney, which I imagine are at least somewhat restrictive, this was Lynch in his classic style and at his finest. What he's done, in effect, is produce a work for all ages and cinematic taste without compromising his own technique. By the way, those of you who aren't familiar with his other work have no idea what I'm talking about. I hope that those of you who are can relate.Although I only recently saw this film, over the years I had heard many wonderful things about its subject matter from individuals whose taste in movies I fully trust. With that in mind, there was little doubt that I would consider this to be anything less than tube time well spent. However, nothing anyone ever told me could have prepared me for the degree to which it would touch me on a personal level. Alvin Straight reminded me very much of my grandfather, who had a third grade education and is still the smartest man I've ever known. This film eloquently illustrates the patience, wisdom, courage and yes stubbornness of a generation that is all but extinct. While the elder generations are and will always be, in essence, living history, individuals like Straight are all but gone. Soon the option to listen and learn about past events, first hand, from the accounts of our contemporaries who remain uncorrupted by the influence of the modern age will be gone as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very not mainstream despite the 'straight' storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[No Spoilers]Being a David Lynch film, one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do. But it is a very straight story as the title might hint. Don't except to be caught in the usual Lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i.e. Lost Highway. It is a simple film but it is indeed a great film. That is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect. It's innovative because it so not Lynch. But maybe that IS Lynch. He likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avantgarde director, he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesn't give it to them. That would be crafty.The pace of the film is slow. I would almost say lawn mower speed... Don't expect an action orgy, but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film. Look carefully for those small details that Lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment. Look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life. And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that really animates the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes shown frequently. Farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film, making him one of the most likeable ol' men ever depicted on film. He doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an Oscar nomination. Need I say that his weak health in this film wasn't acted? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete. That knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to Farnsworth. All of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done. One could ask for homilies that aren't that obvious and a bit naive but it doesn't ruin the overall picture, being that it is a memorable motion picture. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alvin Straight was a stubborn old man. He lived with his daughter who had a problem on speaking. Although he fell because of diabetes and the doctor required further cure for him, he refused to do like that. After he knew that his brother Lyle had a sudden stroke, he decided to go to see Lyle alone with the lawn mower though it was more than 300 miles away. An unprecedented trip commenced.When Lyle finally saw Alvin and his lawn mower, Lyle's eyes were wetted. So did I. It was one of the touching scenes. Sometimes we may overlook family value. In fact the family always is the place you can rely on.It was really a pity that Richard Farnsworth did not win the Oscar award (the best actor). His impeccable performance will always stay in my mind.A masterpiece that worth watching many times. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Direction at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On of the aspects of pin-pointing a good director is by being able to notice their atmosphere an technique. David Lynch has made past films which were deemed "dark", "noir" or "disturbing", but this film distinguishes his ability to direct, and his diversity as a director. He maintains his atmosphere with the long shots, drawn out with little, to no sound, then adding in a climax to a certain scene, yet still maintaining a certain level of tension and wonder. Dialogue was sparse, but important, there was nothing left in there which was not needed to further the story and the philosophy of the story. The beginnings of Lynch's films are always so powerful and apparent, which sparks an interest in what follows. The noir-esque lighting was still apparent in such scenes as when Rose and Alvin were talking about the trip. Not too many films use quite a sleek filming style, and this one ranks Lynch up with the finest (Kubrick).</fullReview>

Its ridiculous to think that this is what this world has come to, and people see a movie like this and say "what a bore." Thats the problem with this world, because there was no extreme violence or somebody getting naked, people are impatient and end up walking out like the immature children they really are. You people make me sick, this is one incredibly well done film, thank you David lynch for helping me stifle my vomit for one more day. This film isn't only great for families but also good for all those ignorant movie goers to wake up from all the garbage in theaters and show some respect to a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is in some ways a very different David Lynch film. On the one hand, it features a story about family ties that even a, well, family could watch together. On the other, it has no violence or unnecessary adult language or content. Yet upon careful viewing, one finds the Straight Story has a sort of surreal realism, the kind that Lynch is so good at tapping into and bringing to life.Apart from its fine direction, rich cinematography and terrific acting, the Straight Story also features a spellbinding music soundtrack that adds to the film's atmosphere--one populated by ordinary people who ultimately prove themselves extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful tale of perseverance in the face of adversity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read a review of The Straight Story, I fell in love with the idea. An elderly man travels by lawn mower from Iowa to Wisconsin, over 370 miles, just to patch things up with his estranged brother, before it's too late.I have to admit to being an enormous fan of road movies, and The Straight Story is one of the more interesting. In more ways than one. For one thing, the director is David Lynch. He is credited for some of the most unusual films and ideas, ranging from Twin Peaks to Dune.The world of the surreal is nothing new to Lynch, but then, neither is the road movie. He already explored this genre with Wild at Heart, but The Straight Story is a polar opposite. The title in of itself is very appropriate, because the story is told completely straight. There is no oddball surrealism, so don't count on dancing dwarfs or red curtains for this one. In fact, this must be David Lynch's most accessible film to date.I was interested to discover this was based on a true story. Perhaps when I'm in my 70's, I might partake on such an adventure. The man in question is Alvin Straight (A marvellous final performance from Richard Farnsworth). A man who is not in the best of health. He has a bad hip, so must walk on two canes, and has very poor eyesight.He lives in a small Midwestern town, one of those towns where everybody knows everybody. Some of the people are eccentrics, which shows some of Lynch's trademarks are still intact. Alvin also lives with his mildly retarded daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek). Alvin is a friendly, decent man who seemingly wouldn't hurt a fly.But his personable demeanour hides some painful memories. He hasn't spoken to his brother, Lyle, in ten years. The film never gives a straight answer why they fell out. When Lyle suffers a stroke, Alvin decides to bury the hatchet, and make amends with Lyle.But as I've said, the two of them are 370 miles apart, Alvin doesn't have a drivers license, and Rose for obvious reasons can't drive him. But Alvin does have an automotive lawn mower. He hitches a trailer to the back of it, and sets off on a journey across America to be with Lyle.Alvin meets quite an array of interesting characters on his journey. Some of them are lonely, like Alvin himself. He meets a pregnant girl, unsure whether or not to have her child, a fellow WW2 veteran, a weird woman who's hit one deer too many, a couple of bickering brothers, etc.Even after watching the film for the first time, I can already tell this is a very nuanced film. There is a richness and multilayered approach to Alvin's encounters that resonate on many levels. Richard Farnsworth was really at the top of his game here. His good natured performance is perfectly attuned to the material, and his acting with his co-stars is superb. Some of the dialogue is almost poetic, and touches many emotional nerves, my favourite being the tragic story of Alvin's days as a sniper in WW2.I could describe the encounter, but you really need Farnsworth's performance to get the full effect. The cinematography is beautiful, showing golden sunlight that illuminates the whole picture, and the music compliments the tone of the film perfectly.The finale is curiously open ended, but it is perhaps best left that way. After following Alvin throughout his odyssey, and listening to him open his heart to so many people, he deserves some privacy with his brother.A truly marvellous film, and the best road movie since Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles. Both films are similar because they both have a lot of honesty to their central protagonists, as well as poignancy in light of Richard Farnsworth's death. A fitting epitaph to an extraordinary man.Richard Farnsworth was terminally ill during production. Diagnosed with cancer, he committed suicide once the film was completed. He came out of retirement to make it. I believe he'd made up his mind what he was planning to do afterwards. Farnsworth knew this was going to be his last film, and this is what makes it such a powerful fable. He poured every last drop of emotion into the project. It only makes Alvin seem even more poignant. And the story that much more potent.One last thing. I know I'll never look at a tractor driving on the road in the same way again. You never know where they might be going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Straight Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Straight Story directed by David Lynchis based on the true story of Alvin Straight, who in 1994 drove a lawn mower more than 300 miles from Iowa to Wisconsin to visit his sick brother. Both brothers are aged and in poor health. They haven't spoken to each other in 10 years due to an angry spat involving "alcohol" and "pride". But after brother Lyle suffers a stroke, Alvin decides it's time to swallow his pride and connect again with his brother, recalling how close and supportive their relationship used to be long ago. Alvin is determined, in a stubborn Midwestern cowboy manner, to make the trip independently on his own. But as his eyesight is bad and he's got no driver's license, and very little pension income, the only plan is the lawn mower, towing a makeshift trailer for his camp. The trip takes more than five weeks of slow going, with a few misadventures along the way. He also has a string of opportunities to dispense a basic earthy yet pithily eloquent wisdom to everyone he meets along the way.But excitement and danger are not part of Lynch's interest here. The plot is quiet, the pace slow, and the genuine suspense is built from a deep yet common situation: longing to reconnect with family members. What strikes me about this film is that we do experience it as slow and quiet, yet simultaneously as absorbing and suspenseful. We are really with Alvin all the way, and for him. Every reviewer has remarked the surprise of a David Lynch film that seems the opposite of his trademark style: rather than disturbing pathology beneath the fake veneer of American small town life, we have here a very different perspective: an almost sentimental appreciation of small town community: the fellow concern, neighborly intimacy, family closeness, the peaceful streets, etc. These are fully evoked and nowhere satirized, a real shock coming from Lynch's former postmodernist terror films in the same settings. "Straight" here is a pun on the man's name, and also on the narrative sensibility: without irony, a simple chronology, one good protagonist, and only universal mortality and individual shortcomings as the real antagonist. The miracle of this film is that this all works well as a film per se. It is a remarkable achievement. Lynch does have his old tongue in his cheek when overtly alluding to his former dark style, especially in the opening scene before we meet Alvin but only hear a mysterious thump to the tune of foreboding dissonant chords. But this allusion is a conscious ploy to remind us that Lynch could have gone there again, but he doesn't. The thump quickly turns out to be merely Alvin's fall on the floor as his cane slipped. The characters who find him on the floor are meant as a parody of the former Lynch audience expectations: terror. But this is all lightheartedly dispelled, and we are launched into a new perspective from there-- the straight story, based on a real-life heartwarming human interest piece. The film might illustrate a deeper point about postmodernism: it's not about "style" and narrative sophistication, but rather about what Nietzsche called "perspectivism". The deep feeling about simple values and family connections here is another perspective, just as perfectly valid in this vision as the darker perspective that made Lynch infamous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A charming and heartfelt story, based on real people and events. It's no surprise to see the Disney name attached but there is quite a bit of surprise (for me, at least) to see David Lynch directed this. It's certainly unlike any of his other work. It's a slow movie but a genuine and special one with a truly great cast and realistic dialogue. The story is about an elderly man named Alvin Straight who drives his riding mower hundreds of miles to see his estranged brother who recently had a stroke. Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin and gives an amazingly understated performance. Sadly, and perhaps fittingly, this would be his final film. Sissy Spacek is exceptional as his mentally disabled daughter. There's a wonderful supporting cast of fine actors, particularly those who play the many people that Alvin meets on his journey. That deer woman was something else. It's just such a good film. Not for all tastes, I'm sure, but rewarding for those who give it a chance.</fullReview>

Then he receives word that his estrange brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) had a stroke. He is determined to go see his brother in Wisconsin. He can't drive and there's no bus. So he decides to modify his lawn mower for the long trip.This is an interesting little indie. There are a lot of tiny oddities in this. First this is directed by David Lynch without any of his usual surreal touches. He is really gentle here letting Farnsworth do his acting. There are some quirky touches here and there. He puts in some beautiful music. Spacek makes an interesting choice with her stutter. She has a funny moment in the beginning. Alvin is an old self-reliant guy. He's charming in his old school ways. The story is funny and bitter sweet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story is a movie that's different from most I've seen. A man who's lived an aged life tries to enjoy every second to the fullest until the grave. After going to the doctor after one too many falls, though, he realizes his own mortality and the great impact it will have on those closest to him. As his life is slowly changing, he gets a call from his estranged brother, who's just suffered a stroke. People face numerous challenges throughout their lives. Some are overcome independently and some are even lifelong. Going across states while you can barely walk is one thing; driving across in a lawnmower is another. After facing turbulent weather, lonesome strangers and making unexpected friends along the way, this entire journey is a final reflection.Life is certainly short. It's best to make peace while we still can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Farnsworth's swan song; David Lynch on his best behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This project was launched by David Lynch's editor (and future wife), Mary Sweeney, who secured the rights and co-wrote the screenplay, then it really took off when Lynch himself signed on to direct and stuntman-turned-character-actor Richard Farnsworth was "coaxed out of semiretirement" (I read somewhere online) to play the lead. As often seems to happen with "based on a true story" movies, the script gets stretched pretty thin at times (the parable about the sticks that Straight tells the teenage runaway seemed familiar from grade school), and the backstory that slowly emerges may seem a little too pat, but Farnsworth's disarmingly natural acting style is just right for the part, and Lynch's eye for the hidden beauty of the nondescript landscape and his perfect pacing bring out all the drama and poignancy of Alvin Straight's journey. Straight's story made me think of what Woody Grant in Alexander Payne's "Nebraska" might have been like if he'd managed to turn his life around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Atmospheric Road-Movie about Endurance and Triumph over Obstacles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is commonly known for making surreal, twisted and ill-minded pictures in which reality often appears as a frightening place. The story usually begins regularly but then, out of the blue, gets nightmare-like elements of disgust and anxiety. However, The Straight Story is a whole new ballgame. It's the opposite to everything Lynch has ever made but still, paradoxically, attains to keep his unique cinematic style together. As an unusual Lynch film, The Straight Story is a slow and tender road-movie about an old man who decides to travel a long journey by a lawn mower to see an ill brother of his. At its heart, the film is a straight story about real life, which might still exist somewhere; life where people are nice to each other and don't only think of their own benefit; life where solidarity is no longer vanishing folklore. Due to this, the film even seems quite mythological -- for better and worse. Moreover, the film highlights the importance of family, friends and love, as well as wisdom and righteousness. To some, all this might sound a bit foolish and artificially cheery but, conversely, a director like Lynch achieves to create an actual presence of calm rest. The monotonous procrastination of the events is only there to tame the wildest viewer of modern hectic cinema. Even as being a total exception in Lynch's production, this atmospheric road-movie does still have many typical elements for the director too. Such as the significance of sounds and visuals; even at their most hypnotic. Furthermore, the emotional poetry of the film associates it with The Elephant Man (1980). Besides, and most importantly, there still is the Lynchian absurdity; only this time, it can be seen in the hectic hurry inside and the irrationality of modern life. Although The Straight Story doesn't reach on the level of Lynch's masterworks, it is, nonetheless, touching in all its authenticity and modest sincerity. At times, its sentimentality leads to idealistic interpretation but, however the old man's stubbornness, and the honesty of the story, balance it. In conclusion, The Straight Story tells about life with its ups and downs. Beneath the surface one doesn't find horror, as usual, but beauty. On the other hand, the story about an absurd adventure on a lawn mower -- through the South regions -- can also be seen as an ironic comment on the concept of mythical America. In any case, and above all, The Straight Story is a meditative and highly personal journey into the clarity of what is important in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch tells this story plain and simple .. and slowly. For typical moviegoers, this gem of a movie could seem unbearably ploddy; but its great beauty and depth are revealed through its pacing, when one is able to breathe with it and let reflection and thoughtfulness rule rather than the need to be entertained. The first scene sets up what will be the flow and tempo of the rest of the film. Silently and without music, the camera seems to move at super slow-motion as it zooms in on Rose's house and yard, then her neighbor as she settles into her lounge chair to sun herself. No added drama or orchestral flourishes, just real life. That's how the movie unfolds to its end. It is acted superbly and with great humanity by Richard Farnsworth (who died just a year later) as Alvin Straight and also by Sissy Spacek as his slightly retarded daughter Rose. It's a compelling and true story of a 73 year old man who drove over 300 miles from Iowa to Wisconsin on a John Deere lawn mower hitched to a trailer in order to try to reconcile with his estranged brother, who had suffered a stroke. Along the way, he meets a number of people, some of whom aid him in the long trek as his tractor breaks down, and others with whom he shares the wisdom of 73 years of living, and his own mistakes and failures. Especially moving is his conversation with another World War II veteran as they remember their harrowing experiences and the heartbreaking loss of their comrades. Throughout the entire movie, Lynch retains his focus and ability to keep things simple and unaffected. Some of the scenes are set up so naturally and organically, one feels as if they've stumbled onto the real event or conversation as it was taking place. This is my favorite kind of movie-making, because it allows the viewers to come their own conclusions and experience their own emotions without ever telling them how they should feel. I've seen the film twice and it has made me cry both times, both for its truthfulness and resolve, and for Farnsworth's incredible portrayal. He was 80 years old at the time and had already been diagnosed with cancer during the filming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only weird thing David Lynch had left to do was make this movie, and it's amazing.An old man sets out across the country riding his lawn mower, in order to visit a brother he hasn't seen in years. He's too old to legally and drive and doesn't have the money to pay for travel. The trip of only a matter of states will take him almost a year by mower, and he will meet a myriad of characters along the way.Lynch's absurd and dark humor works gently here, but still rears it's head at the right moments (the woman who always hit's deer). Still though, it's worlds away from Eraser Head and Blue Velvet, but feels like an artist expanding his horizons, than trying to make a "traditional film". The movie has a unique perspective and natural beauty and earnestness, that's stirring and never sappy. It's a straight forward, emotionally engaging movie about the absurd, miraculous, and honest in life. Beautiful</fullReview>

He takes you immediately into the story, so the only solution is to see the movie out. I saw the movie already seven or eight times, but the movie keeps on moving me.What touched (and touches) me the most in this movie, is the thin line between the humor and the drama. Both are always present. Everebody always says that David Lynch' best movie is 'Lost Highway', but for me is this movie a much greater achievement.

		<fullReview>In an age of ever larger explosions, gaudy but unconvincing CGI, and endless 'wire-fu', it is a pleasure beyond words to find a film that foregoes these things and concentrates on a story that is nothing but human. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), a 70-yr-old farmer with a speech impaired daughter (Sissy Spacek), has a stroke, and this reminder of his mortality spurs him to find and make peace with his estranged brother. The problem is that to do this, he must travel 320 miles across America. Without a driver's licence. Ever resourceful, Alvin mounts his lawnmower and begins his quest. And that, really, is all you need to know. The beauty of this film lies in the majestically serene view that director David Lynch takes of Middle America; the picturesque vistas without echo the innate human goodness within. The elderly Alvin Straight, wonderfully underplayed by Farnsworth, is impossible not to like, and on his journey we learn, via his episodic meetings with assorted strangers (who never remain strangers for long), more about him and the reasons behind his voyage. If you're after sound and fury, forget it. The closest to conflict you'll find here is a some haggling over a repair bill, and even that is fairly good natured. But the real trick that Lynch pulls off is the warmth and honesty with which the story is told. Never for a moment does it descend into sentimentality, and it says quite clearly that not every problem has a solution. For fans of less-is-more film-making, this is for you. For everyone else, this is still for you. Unreservedly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of David Lynch, and obviously was aware that this film was "not very Lynch-y", which is to say that there are no dancing dwarfs, no surreal dialogue, no surreal scenes, it is, as many have already punned, a straight story. However, it is still recognisably a Lynch film ? Lynch Unplugged, maybe? It is also a simple story, beautifully told. Everett McGill is the only Lynch regular (that I spotted, anyway ? oh, hang on, Harry Dean Stanton gets a couple of seconds) on screen, although the score is recognisably Angelo Badalamenti, and this helped streamline and focus the story, by removing the distractions, actor spotting or references that I usually enjoy in Lynch films.The lack of clutter allows Richard Farnsworth's great performance room to breathe, and while some may find the film too slow (come on ? he was on a lawn mower!), I thought that the pacing was spot on and would recommend that, Lynch fan or not, there is something in this film for anyone who has ever taken a long time to admit they've been a fool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the way it used to be, the way it could be, the way it should be, today, Plain, and Simple. You don't need bells, whistles, and popcorn, just a good straight story, and Real Acting, which by the way, Ain't Actin.... ;) Why Anyone would give this anything less than a 10 I do not know. I sat for years and judged the International Angel Awards, and was taught what the word; "Production Value" meant, by a real pro in the business, Jimmie Baker, Executive Producer of ABC Television for over 50 years, on the board of directors, so I know what I'm talking about, but all the credentials, awards, hoopla, and fanfare don't really matter. Its the story, the acting, the Message it sends out to us that counts.Did it touch you where you live? Will it change the way you think? Are you a better person because of it? Those are the questions I ask, when I watch anything, because if it doesn't have any of those qualities - what am I spending my time which is all I have, watching it?Worth your change.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Road Movie About An Old Man And A Lawnmower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alvin Straight is an old man who lives in Laurens, Iowa and hasn't spoken to his brother Lyle in ten years. When he hears Lyle's health is fading, Alvin, whose own health isn't the greatest, is determined to visit him by himself and make amends. With no driver's license, he sets out to make the three-hundred-mile trip to Mount Zion, Wisconsin on a sturdy green 1966 John Deere lawnmower ...Well, I never thought I'd see the credits, "Walt Disney Pictures Presents A Film By David Lynch", but that's just the beginning of the charm of this beautifully made and extremely touching movie. Based on a true story (and dedicated to the man it is about), it's a great odyssey movie as Alvin slowly travels across the picturesque Iowa farmlands and shares his accumulated wisdom with those he meets. Watching this reminds me just how formulaic so many movies are, and how refreshing it is to see a movie where almost all the cast are senior citizens, and the pacing takes plenty of time to develop the characters. It's extremely well edited by Mary Sweeney (who also co-wrote and co-produced it), and masterfully directed by Lynch. Whilst it may not be as stylish and exotic as some of his other work, it captures the beauty of the landscapes and the dignity of old age without ever resorting to sentiment or cliché. The deceptive simplicity of his technique here, such as in the many shots of the night sky, create a tremendous spiritual depth to the film whilst simultaneously serving the story. Farnsworth, after a long career as a stuntman, somehow managed to specialise in playing feisty old codgers (see The Grey Fox, Misery, etc); this was his last and perhaps his greatest performance, ably supported by Spacek as his daughter (she and production designer Jack Fisk are old pals of Lynch from his Eraserhead days). The haunting traditional violin / guitar score by Angelo Badalamenti and the fabulous photography by Freddie Francis (himself an octogenarian) top off what is almost a perfectly realised film. Not to be missed. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The box from the video store said, "Also recommended: *Spitfire Grill*, *Fried Green Tomatoes* and *On Golden Pond*." But if you've seen those, you've seen this. And, if you *like* those (and I do), you'll like this. This is not really Sissy's story, though ? it belongs to Richard Farnsworth, who died shortly afterward. An unexpected turn by director Lynch (*Blue Velvet* and *Wild At Heart*), without any of the irony and surrealism that he thrives on. A gorgeous score emphasizes the endless sweeping shots of America The Beautiful, with the attendant spacious skies and amber waves of grain. This is the backdrop for the story of Alvin Straight (Farnsworth), who, for a variety of reasons, decides to drive his lawnmower 300+ miles to see his brother. It is a true story, and you know right off the bat, that this is going to be a tearjerker ? Alvin is increasingly infirm at 73, and learns that his estranged brother has had a stroke. He lives with his daughter, Rose (Spacek), who is "slow." This is the most mature Sissy yet ? she could rest on her laurels and still be hailed as a major actress entering her fourth decade of movie-making ? though in this, she is a minor, but unforgettable, character, and has excellent assistance from the other supporting cast. The reunion between the elderly brothers looms large throughout the last half. As snapshot-like vignettes spin by, we are propelled towards the inevitable meeting, which promises to be a gusher ? but isn't. Though it ends rather abruptly when Alvin shows up at his brother's place six weeks later, the story has been told, gloriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different Lynch once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I like Lynch it's because every now and then he makes a movie that's either highly creepy and Lynch-ish, but in a good way (say "Lost Highway) or because he has talent for making the most touching and heart-breaking movies ever ("The Elephant Man"). "The Straight Story" belongs to the second category as it's a very moving story. Although very slow at first and although never actually any faster, the movie grabbed me because Lynch simply found a way to make it interesting. Alvin Straight becomes more and more deep a character as the movie unwinds and as it does so do the teary eyes. This script is marvelous if you want to simply feel the movie and the characters, and Richard Farnsworth, somebody I knew nothing about prior to watching the movie, seems like he's been doing these kind of pictures for years. He just shines, period. The ending was a little confusing at first, but now somehow it just makes sense. The bundle had to be repaired, that's all. Simple, straight, life enriching. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch is full of surprises. The Straight Story is a film you definitely wouldn't expect from him: it's true, straight and sentimental, but not too sugary at any point.The movie looks and sounds wonderful. Freddie Francis makes probably the greatest long shots of his career, and Angelo Badalamenti's music is. Sissy Spacek and Richard Farnsworth reach performances beyond compare. Harry Dean Stanton has only one line, but it's possibly the most touching as well. But still the best part is the film's script; it's just incomprehensibly good. There isn't much dialogue, but every conversation is filled with little big words of wisdom. "The worst thing of being old is remembering what it was being young." All these little things form a genuinely touching portrait of a man's life.I definitely think The Straight Story would've earned more awards the year it came out. It's good to see that more and more people are slowly starting to find it, and now it's getting the respect very well deserved.My score: 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read about The Straight Story in 99', and have been searching for a copy of it since then. After having watched it recently, I must say this slow-paced, idilic, real film has not disappointed me in anyway.My only complaints about this film is the sometimes amateurish directing of David Lynch, where we see some cliche' executions and camera works, but overall the film is a spirited vision. Not everyone will like it; it isn't the usual hollywood fare. It's the type of movie you'd catch by accident on a lazy hot afternoon by yourself, and one that after watching, you'll surely never forget.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The Straight Story director David Lynch, has usually been seen as the envoy of the avant-garde in Hollywood, his characters in his films are usually outcasts from society. He is best known for taking audiences into a mysterious almost dreamlike state during a film, just like Mulholland Drive (2001) - but The Straight Story does not fit into his previous desires. From the outset the story sounds ridiculous. A 73 year old man known as Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), is a small community man living in a small stereotypical mid-west town, where of course nothing interesting really ever happens! Alvin Straight becomes determined to see his elderly brother Lisle (Harry Dean Stanton) who he hasn't spoken to in ten years. Rose (Sissy Spacek), Alvin's daughter conveys the message to Alvin that his brother has recently had a bad stroke, and Alvin is deeply shocked by the news of his brother's sudden illness. Despite news from a doctor regarding his own poor health, Alvin becomes determined to travel 300 miles to visit his brother, he says sentimentally `A brother is a brother.' So what?, we might think, but the twist to the story is that he intends to make this journey on the back of a ride-on lawnmower! To use a lawnmower to travel 300 miles was proof of Alvin's stubbornness, courage and determination. He doesn't have a driving license, he dislikes travelling on buses, he's short of cash, and he will not be driven there.On his travels, he meets a variety of different characters, such as a young girl runaway, a group of old age tourists, an hysterical woman, and World War II veterans. On arrival in his destination, Mt. Zion, and after six weeks of breakdowns, unforgettable characters, and the despair of his daughter Rose, he finally sees his brother and the pair are reunited together - everything seems complete once more.The Straight Story, is a very heart-warming, affectionate and sentimental film. Alvin Straight's determination to defy age, his dauntlessness, his courage to travel for six weeks to see his brother -makes him worthy of at least some admiration. Also, you feel a sense of warmth about Sissy Spacek's character, Rose. Her inability to communicate effectively, her slowness, makes her a loveable and humorous. Through the use of various characters, the use of high camera angles, and the beautiful mid-west autumn harvest scenery make you feel a part of the film. The Straight Story is one of those Sunday afternoon films something they'd put on instead of another 1970s version of Columbo. A film your Gran, favourite Aunt, or mother would enjoy, just because its nice to watch - and there's no gory violence or sex. It's back to the days when films were moral and sentimental, or full of old characters just dying to reminisce about the good old days - just because they were good, it's similar in a way to The Whales of August (1987). Perhaps even to make you feel happier as a person, rather than shock you, as most films arguably do today. The only criticism I would have is that the great Academy Awards winning actress Sissy Spacek, disappears from the film after about thirty minutes, and she hardly appears much after that. She's only seen again when Alvin phones home to tell Rose he's fine after five weeks on the road! Wasn't she worried at all? What daughter in her right mind would let her Dad make such a journey? Its a shame the film doesn't explore her character more, as we only hear brief stories of her past, it never really mentions why she has learning difficulties, and what she must be truly feeling because her Dad has gone? David Lynch argued that there is no one best scene in The Straight Story, he says that, `Its like music, every note (scene) is important.' If we wanted to choose the best scene, the scene where Alvin arrives in Mt. Zion and goes to a bar and has a beer for the first time in a long time - his sense of achievement is clearly shown here. Overall, The Straight Story is slow, nostalgic, highly backward looking, showing emotions of the human heart. Mothers would love you for taking them to see it, because it's a splendid, sensitive to need kind of movie. Those who find reminiscing, nostalgia, old people, no sex and violence all a bit dull - well just don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Straight Story: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some things you don't expect from some people. You don't expect a light, quick ?n easy movie from Oliver Stone, nor do you expect something serious and dramatic from Wes Craven. That's why most people would not believe you if you told them that The Straight Story was directed by David Lynch. That's right, the person who brought you backwards talking dreams, fetus children, and midget cowboys connected to the mafia now has directed a small, quite story about a 73 year old man who travels 350 miles on a lawnmower to visit his brother, who has had a stroke.At about a two-hour length and multiple shots of just Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) riding his mower across beautiful landscapes, it's easy for people to complain that The Straight Story is boring and pointless. Yes, it doesn't have a quick pace, but if you can put up with that, you'll see that The Straight Story is one of the most refreshing and, so to speak, intoxicating movies of a long time. Alvin Straight is just one of the people you would love to get to know. It's even great to know that there actually was an Alvin Straight in real life, and he's a character that may not be perfect, but he's one hell of a guy.The cinematography is spectacular. Rightly done in a complete wide screen, it was simply beautiful. I'm not one to gush at landscapes, but?wow! It was spectacular. It's hard to believe that there are still actual places like those still left in America. The camera perfectly captured the area that Alvin Straight drove through.What really got to me was just how simple everything was, and instead of letting it all go to shame, it was actually presented simply. There was nothing that was unbelievable about it, and everything was done realistically. Alvin Straight had faults, no doubt, but all people do. There seems to be something almost cosmic about The Straight Story, something hard to explain. It's flowing with some sort of rhythm, everything just comes together.Farnsworth got an Oscar nomination, well deserved. He didn't have to play someone mentally slow (as Sissy Spacek did in The Straight Story) or anything that's usual Oscar grabbing material. He just played an average guy on a mission to perfection. Although Kevin Spacey won for his outstanding job in American Beauty, I think many actors could have done his role. Farnsworth is one of a kind in The Straight Story, just like the movie itself.My rating: 10/10Rated G.</fullReview>

David Lynch surprised me again, he truly is an artist who doesn't only fascinate the brain, he also fondles the heart. Like all his films, it contains somethings that are present in all his films. Because it is a true story, it shows how beautiful and remarkable life can be even at its most mundane and (seemingly) boring. And when Lynch tells it, there is not even an hint of a cliche, like in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!When I saw this movie, I was blown away. The script and acting are both excellent. It is filled with emotion. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek give breathtaking performances. One notable scene is where Alvin Learns that Lyle is very sick. He simply says "I gotta go see Lyle". So simple and determined, great line. At the end, when Alvin finally gets to Lyle's house, the look on his face will bring tears to your eyes. but the real tear-jerking scene is when they are sitting on Lyle's porch, two brothers who haven't seen each other for years, both very old now. Lyle looks at the lawnmower, and says "Did you ride that thing all the way here to see me?". Alvin simply replies "I did, Lyle.", then Lyle's eyes start to fill with tears. What's even more emotional is that this was Richard Farnsworth's last movie before he died. He ended his career in the best scene of any movie he's ever done. That is one of the most beautiful scenes in movie history. Only movie that has EVER made me cry, EVER. I recommend it to everyone. David Lynch is a genius</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brothers, rather than Leonard, that is.Lynch here ditches the surrealism of Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet for the beauty and melancholic Americana of, well, Fargo. And it works a beauty.This is one of the slowest movies you are ever likely to see. Not a lot happens. Guy has stroke. Brother gets on lawn mower. Sad music plays. Nice sunsets. Duo meet. The end.And therein lies the beauty of The Straight Story. It is a movie of reflection and tenderness (tenderness being a recurring feature in Twin Peaks oddly enough), rather than fear or evil or suspence and questioning. Just as Fargo - to my mind the brothers Cohen greatest work - hides and merges beauty with horror, hilarity with melancholia, so does David Lynch in this utterly gorgeous study of lost American relations.I really love The Straight Story, it has happy bits and it has sad bits and the music is great.

		<fullReview>How anyone can be cynical enough to put down this movie is beyond me. Richard Farnsworth had one of the best voices ever to grace the silver screen. The scene where he's sharing a glass of milk with a beer drinking war veteran (like himself) was one of the most moving moments I think I've seen on film. It should be required for anyone who blindly supports war as gung ho revenge. (hint: soldiers return from combat plagued by guilt and trauma that never go away.) Every word Farnsworth speaks is simple and eloquent and he never lets anyone get the best of him. (Spoiler? I love the part where those 2 lawn mower repairmen twins were trying to swindle him and he turns it all around on them to remind them how important family is.) Truly one of the best American films in years as well as one of Lynch's best efforts, this is also a fine swan song to one of the most flawless natural actors since probably Spencer Tracy. As for one reviewer claiming Alvin's journey made no sense, watch it again and hear how he explains why he's doing it. It's to atone for the way he behaved in the past. All very easy to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch has done well by himself and the world by choosing to take on "The Straight Story". This movie came out when I was in Britain, and nearly every critic there was falling over themselves with praise for it- a mystery to me when it seemed like such a dull, Disneyfied yawner ( I didn't know at the time that it was a David Lynch film). When I got back to America, I thought it would be the same story, but instead, hardly anyone here was talking about it. Typical of us Yanks to pass off as boring, sappy shlock what is in fact one of the greatest commentaries in recent times on human existence and, ironically, the American psyche. I don't mean to make it sound like this is some overly intellectual, artsy-fartsy lecture film, as some of Lynch's other works have threatened to be. Just about anyone could find something here that will stay with them if they are open to it. Intellectual value aside, "The Straight Story" is at least a gentle, beautiful, inspiring tale of one man taking the rare initiative, in the form of a journey, to right the wrong in his life rather than simply accept it, complain about it or run from it. Along the way of this journey, we are literally assaulted with compelling, emotional imagery, most notably Angelo Badelamenti's heart-wrenchingly gorgeous score, which provides the perfect backdrop to the rolling poetry that isthe American midwest when portrayed in this light. I'm not sure how he did it, but I'm sure only a director like David Lynch could take such ordinary-seeming people and settings and transform them into fascinating characters, drawing you further and further in and investing you in them more than you thought you ever would. It takes a hard heart indeed to deny the arresting, humbling honesty of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some misgivings about this movie when I first read about it. A G-rated David Lynch movie? However, I trust Lynch to never let me down with a watered-down movie, and once again my faith was borne out. I'm glad this movie recieved that rating, because EVERYONE should see this film.It works on so many levels, I plan to see it at least twice more just so I can pick them all out. The central theme of the movie is The Journey, the literal one that was taken by Alvin Straight and the metaphorical one which everyone takes through life. The recurring image in the film of the stars slowly advancing, which is always displayed when someone is sitting still, indicates that even when you're doing nothing, you're still travelling, both literally and figuratively.Everyone in the movie does a superb job, especially Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek, who starts off as one of Lynch's cartoonish, oddball people who always pop up in his movies, and then develops through the movie into a fully fleshed-out human. This role, as well as her role in Affliction, reveals Spacek to be one of, if not the most underrated actors working today.There is the usual Lynchian imagery and characters, and some of the best cinematography and scenery I've seen since Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter. Where Egoyan's film was starkly beautiful, however, this one is varied, showing all the colours and textures of rural America in the last days of summer. Sheer magnificence.The moods are well-balanced. At different times one is laughing, horrified, saddened, but most of all it is affirming.For people who see Lynch as just a purveyor of weirdness, this will either be a refreshing change or a disappointment. But people who see film as a true art form will be overjoyed by this simple, yet beautiful, bit of storytelling by an artist who is obviously developing and continuing to mature and improve on his craft. Lynch has taken an inspirational story and packed it with so much more that this has now displaced Being John Malkovich as my favourite movie of the year. These two movies have proven that film is still a vital art form, and in the age of grand spectacle movies with no real plot or acting, this is food for a very hungry soul. 99 was a great year, let's hope it continues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utterly warm movie from the master of eeriness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The magic of David Lynch has struck again. I've never left a theatre untouched after seeing a film by this remarkable director. The brilliant weirdness of 'Lost Highway' or the creepy atmosphere of 'Twin Peaks', are experiences that leave solid prints in your mind. And with 'Straight Story', new and even deeper prints are added, but this time in a whole new way. Previously he affected us by exploring the dark sides of the human mind, but this time it is through an utterly warm movie.'The Straight Story' is based upon a lovely and heart-warming story. And it is told through beautiful photography of the American outback, accompanied by the always exquisite music of Angelo Badalamenti, who has stacked away his synthesizers and brought out an acoustic guitar and some violins. Lynch' well recognizable way to conduct the camera is perfect for his more eerie movies, but it works just as well here. And further - superb acting all the way, especially by Richard Farnsworth. His face is filled with so much experience and wisdom, that when he starts talking, you listen.All this contributes to make 'Straight Story' an astounding movie. It is a homage to compassion - to human goodness. It is a gentle movie - follows the pace of Alvins lawn mower, but it constantly nourishes your mind and never becomes boring. You feel like joining Alvin on his journey, and share some of his experiences and wisdom. I recommend that you do join his trip - in the hands of David Lynch it can't go wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After all the details, it comes to this: IT'S A MAN THING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a man. I had to play some video pinball to get to the essence of "The Straight Story". I saw it some time back, but the details of the entire film had gotten jumbled up in my mind, and I knew that what this movie was really about was somewhere in my thoughts but all in a fog.So on the computer screen I flipped a flipper here and there, scored some points and drained a few steel pinballs. But that hazy picture was clearing the whole time. I was catching glimpses of the details and substance of this film, which I remember as being at times silly, but mostly riveting. The silly allowed you to be glad to smile in the midst of the necessary slow pace of the story. After all, just how fast can Alvin the old geezer (Richard Farnsworth) travel, anyway, on a riding lawn mower hundreds of miles across several states? (Oh, and pulling a trailer, too!)And so now, I do remember that I had forgotten the cool lesson Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) teaches a roadside runaway who, in turn, finds herself ready to correct some decisions she had made in fear and shame (good quality); that I had forgotten that the famous cigarette man-in-the-saddle rides much of the range in middle America (not so good quality); that I had forgotten that even though all's supposed to be fair in love and war, that both of those arenas of life are strewn with the hurting wounded who will NEVER believe that time-tattered saying, for Rose (Sissy Spacek) was trampled in love, and Alvin was shaken in war, and life -- both of them nursing niggling memories that will not go away, caused by unfairnesses in earlier years that robbed her of hope and him of innocence, and tenderness for a brother; that I had forgotten that the seemingly endless and sometimes corny journey on which Alvin embarked was also seemingly endless in real-time movie-watching-in-the-theater minutes; that I had forgotten about the sweeping panoramic photography in which you get lost, and in which your own real-time troubles get just as lost.Since seeing this film several weeks ago, I really HAD gotten fuzzy on all these things. But even so, now, I realize that by the end of the film, absolutely none of all the above even matters. These are only the garments the film is dressed in...For, you see, the film is really about only one thing: a man's softening heart intent on fixing a rotted bridge suspended over a horrible, deep gap of disgust and blame, which, if not repaired in time, is going to be the source of unfixable regret.And the last 10 minutes of the film: simple, haunting, and tension filled, with excruciating silences. Only a man willing to be a real man will understand the language of that kind of silence.See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know you've just seen a very special movie when the ending credits begin to roll, the lights come up...but nobody leaves. Instead, the entire audience just sits very still and reads every single credit. That's "The Straight Story."After several years of being lost in the wilderness (or maybe lost on the highway), director David Lynch has come back with a vengeance. This is his most powerful movie since "The Elephant Man" and if there is any justice in this world it will earn him his third Oscar nomination for Best Director.As someone who was born in Iowa and now currently lives in Wisconsin, I was amazed at how well Lynch captured this area of the country. I knew the roads that Alvin Straight was traveling and I knew the people he met along the way. Some might call Alvin's (and Lynch's) trip overly-sentimental, but maybe we're just not used to positive movies bringing us positive messages these days.And while the Academy is considering Mr. Lynch for an Oscar nomination, I hope they also consider the performances of Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek and the music of Angelo Badalamenti. And I certainly hope they will be able to consider a G-rated Disney flick for Best Picture as well.David Lynch, welcome back. Where have you been?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch's "The Straight Story" is the tale of a 73-year-old man named Alvin Straight that travels from Iowa to Wisconsin in order to see his estranged brother who has suffered from a stroke.Alvin Straight collapses in his kitchen and it's a sign that he must see a doctor and begin to take care of himself. He doesn't eat right and he smokes too much. He is a man who is clearly uncomfortable with his age.His friends and his "slow" daughter, played by Sissy Spacek, try to comfort him to the best of their abilities. Alvin finds out that his brother has had a stroke and this incident drives him to take a journey to reclaim the relationship he has lost with him.Being old, half-blind and without a license, Alvin begins to ride to Mt. Zion, in Wisconsin, riding on his lawn mower. Attached to the mower is a small trailer where he stores food, a chair and a blanket.He begins the trek only to have his mower die. He buys another mower and is well on his way to make the trek that will surely take him weeks to accomplish.The film is very slow in the beginning but it is not until Alvin begins to encounter individuals on his journey that you realize that this film is a masterful character study of a man coming to terms with the meaning of his life.He encounters a young lady on the road and Alvin relates to this pregnant-runaway how family is one of the most important things that she has going for her. After imparting to her his views, the girl disappears the next morning. Alvin is happy that he has steered this girl in the right direction.For the rest of the story, Alvin encounters such individuals. He tells a cyclist that "the worst part of being old is remembering when your young." In a town where he stays at after a near accident he teaches twin mechanics to appreciate their brotherhood.Also in this town he tells one character his story of how he was in the war and how he accidentally killed a friend of his. This is a beautiful scene not only because it sets up the reasoning behind Alvin's alcoholism but also because Richard Farnsworth acts the part like a true master of cinematic acting.Farnsworth easily gives the greatest male performance of the year as a man coming to terms with his life and the importance of all the time he has left on this earth.It is a very slow film but utterly engrossing. Certainly vastly different from we have seen from Lynch in the past--but I won't dwell on that. Lynch captures landscape and the journey this man takes to re-claim stability in the final moments of his life with an introspection that is rarely seen in character-study films.Farnsworth emits so much emotion through every movement, every smile and every tear. He is a humble and simple man needing closure in his life. This is the story of a man whose place in the world has been already carved but must amend the relationships that are scared before he goes into the gentle starry sky. A beautiful, heart-warming and touching film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is just one of those perfect films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I should be more specific. This film is great because of it's incredible story. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is an elderly man living with his daughter Rose Straight (Sissy Spacek) in Iowa. When he hears that his brother Lyle Straight (Harry Dean Stanton) had a stroke he heads over to his home in Wisconsin to check on him. But Alvin has no driver's license so he drives on a John Deere 110 lawn mower. It is based on the true story of Alvin Straight who drove his lawn mower to check on his suffering brother. What I like about this film is the story, the cinematography and especially the acting. Alvin drives and meets many people on his way, including a runaway girl, a bunch of cyclists, and a friendly family who fixes his tractor when it breaks. I don't want to give away the ending but it's really great. Check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Read the comments of Michel O'Neil in this IMDb site about this movie and would like to register it is exactly what I would like to say about it. Bye the way I see that Michel is from Boulder - Colorado, a city that is forever immortalized in song by the great Emmylou Harris, when he produced "Boulder To Birmingham" - a sublime moment in American music - a tribute to Gram Parsons, deceased, perhaps the greatest love of your life at that time (early 70s). I'm here in Brazil, thousands of miles away, but thanks to music and movies, I have all very close to me, in my heart. But I will talk about this wonderful film. Alvin's journey to review your brother, sick, piloting a small garden tractor, is something that hits bottom our hearts and minds. It is impossible not to be infected by the admirable spirit of Alvin. The stages of the journey are also steps to reflect. Alvin, demonstrating a huge detachment and an uncommon strength of character, embarks on a journey that is a true epic. In his small tractor is slowly going through a beautiful area, finding the most different people in their way. And Alvin influences the life of each of them, with their way of being, with its observations and with his charisma. But it is also affected by what he sees and the people with whom they live. It is undoubtedly a powerful film. It is one of the best and most touching films ever made, a true masterpiece of cinema, a time of great inspiration from David Lynch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Journey to the beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing review about a film that I haven't watched for about a year. However before that it had been 4 or 5 times I had that pleasure and it's just now when I decided to comment. The straight story is the tale about the journey to the beginning. Well , they say that childhood comes two times in life. Once in the first years of life and another at the end of the life, off course if you're lucky enough to reach old age. But that's not the childhood i want to talk about, but the thing around the childhood, cause that's the time when you're i guess "Truest" of all. And you are also part of family, part of what gave you a birth and what in fact you are. And all the family members are part of you. But then comes the time when you go away, you become a little bit stranger. However when you become old you want to rejoin your roots. And that's what Straight Story's magic is. Alvin Straight is making journey through the beautiful landscapes of America but also he's making journey to the past , and that past is future, and both of them are the combining parts of that "Truest". And what Alvin does on the road is just to share everything he learned during his life with people who still have time to go that road. Straight story has the most natural philosophy of all. Here are neither suffered Bergmanic faces talking about the deep spiritual emptiness, nor the half smiling Godaric faces talking about the meaning of life in metro. Here everything is clear, everything comes to the surface and that's what makes the movie a masterpiece. Lynchs dynamic a little bit bleak directing, Badalamenti's masterful score and photographer's outstanding work off course are also in business. I do really think that it's the greatest Lynch film ever. And probably the best picture of all 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road trip with heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been countless road trip movies made over the years, some were great, a lot were not so great. This 1999 road trip movie is based on a true story... the story of an old man's determination to visit his sick brother. The problem is he cannot drive a car, so, he elects to take the trip driving a John Deer ride on mower. Given that premise. it could be mistaken for a comedy scenario, but it is definitely not. It is a warm and touching story that hold your interest for the entire journey. The great Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight and his character portrayal is excellent. The people he encounters along the way and the awesome scenery make this movie work. The acting is natural and believable. Notable cast members include Sissy Spacek as Rose Straight (Alvin's daughter) and Harry Dean Stanton as Lyle (Alvin's brother). Although their roles are small, they shine as their characters. I have watched this movie several times.... it just works for me. There is nothing to dislike and there are a lot of life lessons to be learned from watching it. Sadly. this was to be Richard Farnsworth's final movie.. he couldn't have finished on a finer note.</fullReview>

Besides suffering from emphysema and loss of vision, has severe hip problems that prevent almost stand. Upon receiving the news that his brother "Lyle" (Stanton), with which it is estranged for ten years, has suffered a heart attack, despite his poor health, he decides to visit him in Wisconsin. You will have to travel about 500 kilometers, and does so in the only means of transportation available: a lawnmower."The Straight Store" is a film that departs downright common type in David Lynch film. It was shot without much fanfare, that is, as plainly as he could, Lynch presents a story of the old days, of which just abound in today's cinema.Every scene of this masterpiece is full of life, every sentence of his great script and characters belong to them alone. The music fits perfectly with the beautiful photography. Lynch's genius is to find the simplicity of storytelling in a mind full of complexity like yours. One of the best and deepest Lunch films as The sensation produced to finish watching it is almost insurmountable.The extraordinary photograph is measured and adjusted perfectly to the story, without fanfare, the music follows the journey of the protagonist brilliantly, the slow tempo narrative could not be more accurate ... But the best, without question, are the characters that fill this book and the way they tell us their experiences and stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Straight Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is one of America's strangest and most compelling directors, but in the 90's his film career was heading in an ugly direction. 1990's Wild at Heart and 1997's Lost Highway both had flashes of off-kilter Lynchian brilliance, but both also seemed rather cruel, soulless and calculated in their weirdness. It would seem that Lynch had lost much of his natural talent for gripping surrealism found in Blue Velvet and Eraserhead, and all of his humanism and compassion found in The Elephant Man. In comes The Straight Story, a shockingly simple and clean breath of fresh air in his career. While many Lynch fans were likely (and understandably) disappointed by the lack of bizarre, dark elements in this gentle, G-rated tale, The Straight Story represents everything I love about Lynch films - his artistry, his eye for oddball details, and his quiet sense of compassion. It also is far more Lynchian than many give it credit for. While there are very few menacing elements here, it still is an evocative, mythic story of a physical and spiritual journey - just played in a far quieter, mellower key than past Lynch efforts.Just about every element of The Straight Story comes together beautifully. Richard Farnsworth is incredible as Alvin Straight, a stubborn old man with years of experience and wisdom etched on his face. The dependably great Sissy Spacek is also wonderful in the unusual, touching role of Alvin's daughter. Angelo Badalamenti's music fits beautifully with the serene images of the Midwest that Alvin slowly crosses on his lawnmower - there are long scenes of nothing but music and scenery that are breathtaking. The Straight Story is, along with The Elephant Man, easily Lynch's most humanistic film. Convincing humanity is found in every corner of this movie - in Alvin's face, in the people he meets who all are carrying their own scars and fears, in the near-wordless but deeply moving final scene. The Straight Story is heartbreaking and tender - an enormously emotional movie that never even verges on melodrama or unearned sentiment. While I do appreciate David Lynch's rare gift for twisted surrealism, I think his gift for expressing deeply-felt emotion is even rarer and more valuable. Films as mature and heartfelt as The Straight Story are few and far between. It quietly snuck up on me and became one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People are nice, the world is a beautiful place and sometimes the simplest things in life can be the most fulfilling. This is the general whiff given off by The Straight Story, David Lynch's most straightforwardly decipherable film to date. Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight, a 73-year-old living with his speech-impaired daughter in Laurens, Iowa. After receiving word that his older brother has suffered a stroke, Alvin feels compelled to visit him. Lacking a driver's licence, and too stubborn to let anyone else take him there, Alvin attempts to make the 240 mile journey to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin on a 30 year old lawnmower. On the way, he meets a variety of strangers, most of whom are just as kind as he is. Whilst many people have pointed out how uncharacteristically simple and sweet this is for a David Lynch movie, his signature is still very much on the film. We get the long takes, brooding mechanical noises and an affecting visual sense. Only this time, they work to create a sense of peace rather than horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, Touching and Moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Straight Story is a beautiful, simple movie, a reflection about life and growing old. The story is simple: 73-year-old Alvin Straight makes a 500 km journey in a lawn mower to mend his relationship with his ill brother. During the way, he reflects about growing old, his life and his mistakes. The subtle way this is done is effective and gives the movie beauty, but the story is sometimes too slow, with nothing happening. The dialogs are good, sometimes quotable, even if once or twice I spotted obvious stories that could have been avoided. The characters are all very natural, and you believe them from the first minute you see them on the screen. They are all likable because they are normal people, but always hopeful and with a certain innocence and able to accept life. The ending is, too, very simple but it works extremely well leaving you touched and moved.The acting is very good. Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful performance. His character, on paper, isn't very interesting, but he's able to give Alvin dramatic nuances. He creates a man that slowly accepts growing old, ignores his pride and goes in a journey to meet his brother. He is stubborn, with a simple but pure morality. He has an amazing delivery of his lines, slowly, realistically, showing his character's controlled emotions in a touching way. Sissy Spacek gives Rosie vulnerability and barely visible pain, never overacting. All the other cast members that make brief appearances do a good, even if not remarkable job, with good delivery of their lines.The direction is brilliant. Lynch fills the movie with gorgeous shots and camera angles, that allow you not only to see the meaning of the screenplay and the great work by the actors', but you can see the beautiful roads and vegetation all around. His shots are steady and reflective just the right style for this movie.The cinematography is very good, capturing the beauty of Lynch's wide shots and the faces in a clear way. The music is beautiful, giving the movie a nostalgic feeling. This is slow moving and sometimes boring; even so, it's technically impressive, beautiful and meaningful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story straight from the heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the mark of a good director who continually succeeds in producing films that are discussed, analysed, awarded and often puzzled over. Such is the case with the more well-known Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, all directed by David Lynch.This film could not be more different. Instead of complexity, there is simplicity; instead of delving into the depths of human depravity, this one soars to the stars as two men try to come to an understanding; instead of moral nihilism and isolation, there is affirmation of the very human need to communicate with one another as we all partake of life's journey.Other directors would ? or could -- have turned this film into a tearjerker. In the hands of Lynch, however, this is a straight story, told simply, a short episodic road movie with a difference: in this case, the true story of an old man who uses a ride-on lawn mower to drive hundreds of miles to see his sick brother. There are none of Lynch's usual techniques of flash forwards or backwards, out of sync scenes, dark corridors or rooms, discordant music or long, inexplicable silences or looks.This is a movie you should see, and I don't say that lightly, because there are four scenes that stand out. The first is when old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) stops for the night and is joined by a girl hitchhiker; during the course of their conversation, Alvin deftly shows her the error of her ways. A second scene is when Alvin pauses to listen to a frenetic woman (Barbara Robertson) who's just smashed into a deer on the road and killed it; Alvin's face is a study as she rants and raves about always hitting deers on that road, a road she must use every day. A third, and very powerful one, is when Alvin has a beer, for the first time in many years, and recounts a traumatic war experience with another veteran; Farnsworth was always a good actor, but here, he just shines. The final scene is when Alvin meets his estranged brother, Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton ? in what must be Stanton's shortest film appearance), and the camera stays on the latter most of the time, as Alvin advances. Hardly a word is spoken, as Stanton's facial expressions do most of the 'talking', from rejection to puzzlement to final acceptance.The supporting cast is uniformly down-to-earth and low-key, as befitting a story set in rural America, and the camera lovingly takes in the beauty of nature without overdoing it, too. Farnsworth carries the movie, of course, and it's a shame he didn't get many awards for it; it was arguably his finest performance before his tragic death in 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the autumn of 2000, my wife and I crossed most of America by road. We filmed our trek, which was the culmination of a lifelong dream. Many of the techniques I used as an amateur were to be found here in this wonderful little movie. I say 'little' only because I'd never heard of it before today - I read the synopsis in my daily newspaper and just had to watch it. 'A man embarks on an interstate journey on a lawn mower!' Just how quirky can one get? It's the ultimate road movie, because it's slow and dwells on the journey itself as much as what happens along the way. Fantastic performances from the leading roles and all I was left with was a warm heart and moist eyes. Yet somehow this was brought about not by mawkish sentimentality, more by realistic responses to an old man on a mission. Definitely life affirming and in a world of trouble this movie provided an island of gentle escape for a couple of hours at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a sweet simple movie from the man of bizarre,disturbing movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been longing to see a "David Lynch" movie for a long while and I got "Blue Velvet" this morning but somehow I just could not stand watching it after the fifteenth minute.I just asked myself whether somebody can be really interested in a "severed ear" he found on the grass. Well then I visited the movie's page here on IMDb and I read the comments of those who hated the movie. Among the adjectives which were used to describe the movie were "bizarre,terrible,pathetic,sick etc..." This could have been a long shot end to my Lynch odyssey but I decided to see another movie by him and it happened to be "The Straight Story". I love simple sweet stories and that was such a story.The veteran actor Richard Farnsworth plays an old man-Alvin Straight-who can't walk and see properly.Alvin is really an unyielding man who does not give in to the wishes of her adult daughter that he should undergo a strict treatment. Alvin lives with this adult daughter of his and she seems to be only family member around. One day Alvin hears that his estranged brother has had a stroke then makes up his mind to go visit him and hopefully make up for the ten years they have not talked to each other.Because he has no driving license, he can barely walk and he has a poor sight he hitches a trailer to his 30-year-old riding lawnmower and sets off on the 300-mile journey from Laurens, Iowa to Mount Zion, Wisconsin. He meets different people on the road. He listens to their stories and he tells about the small private details of his own life. That's such a nice road story. It does not give you the whole details but it's up to you to add up the whole from the little pieces scattered. I do not really think that the veteran actor Richard Farnsworth acts in this movie he seems to be really experiencing the ambiance of the celluloid.The fact that "he was terminally ill with cancer during the shooting of the film" confirms my observation,I believe. It's so sad to learn that he committed suicide the following year, at age 80. I wish he had got the Academy award because I believe it was not enough to be the oldest person ever to be nominated for an Oscar for this performance.Just like I said this was my first Lynch movie but I'm glad he made a movie at least this one by leaving aside the disturbing,bizarre imagery and horrid themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie where the visuals and the bare essentials of a compelling and basic story carry you. Even its title plays down an easy double entendre. David Lynch lets the camera and Farnsworth do most of the talking here, though Sissy Spacek is quite good as his faithful and slightly retarded daughter Rose. The characters who come along Alvin Straight's path are homespun and prototypically Midwestern salt-of-the-earth types who would give the shirt off their backs to a complete stranger. Lynch's dark, surrealist bent is not at all in evidence in here; he simply luxuriates in the Midwestern landscape which seems to echo the slow and steady movement of a John Deere mower across a vast, endless plain. He literally plays the story "Straight." The only Lynch-style scene is the opening one, which cleverly demonstrates Alvin Straight's condition without saying a word.This is the kind of movie I think more people want to see: A clean, simple, plain story about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Even the climactic final scene where Alvin Straight finally sees his ailing brother is perfectly underplayed."The Straight Story" is an easy one to watch with friends and family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanity and Humility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was channel surfing on a lazy Sunday afternoon when I came across this movie. It was during the fire exercise and we see two couples who have set up as spectators to witness this sight and then we see an elderly man losing control of his tractor as he speeds helplessly down a hill. It was the look on his face that kept me from changing the channels and it was his humanity of this character that kept me mesmerized the rest of the time. Richard Farnsworth portrayal of Alvin Straight is one of the most honest performances I have seen in a long time. And true, the storyline itself does go at a very slow clip, but it is deliberate. I realized when he finally reaches his destination of why this was. It gives us a chance to experience first hand what a long journey it was for him, both physically and emotionally, and how long it can take to rectify things in our own lives. I am rarely so touched by performances and screenplays but this is a 'bible', if you will, to live by. Acts of kindness, forgiveness, humility and love propel this story to its touching and subdued climax.I intend to find a copy so I can watch it from the beginning and also to use it as a tool in my daily life to aspire to be a better human being to others and and most importantly to myself.Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this film and story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, uplifting movie in this horrid post-hurricane life!! (2006)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an odd turn for David Lynch: Rated G, no violence, no language, no complicated twists.This is the true (!!) story of Alvin Straight, a real-life Iowan who, in the 1990s at age 76, set out on a journey of hundreds of miles...on a 1966 John Deere mower. Straight had not spoken to his brother, Lyle, in 10 years. When Lyle suffered a stroke, Alvin decided that it was time to make amends, for he had long forgotten what had made him angry with his brother, who lived in Wisconsin. Alvin's eyes were too bad to permit him to drive, and he didn't trust public transportation, so he rigged up his mower with a trailer and several weeks worth of supplies, and headed out. He drove days, and camped nights in cornfields.Veteran actor Richard Farnsworth is TOTALLY, TOTALLY EXCELLENT as Alvin Straight. He is warm, wise, compelling, patient, kind. He is clear-cut, simple in his delivery. He makes you feel like he's enveloping you in sunny warmth as he imparts bits of wisdom to you, or tells you a tale. This guy is really genuine. He did win a Best Actor nomination for his performance.Along the way, his character comes across an interesting assortment of strangers, several of whom are sort of typical "weird" David Lynch out-of-left-field characters...yet who all have a strange degree of compassion, for David Lynch folk. (There are no sexually violent psychopaths, for example.) This movie could have been full of maudlin clichés about family, life experience, old age, war--but all topics are approached just perfectly, with the best choice of words. During Alvin's encounters with these various originals, you pause for a moment to reflect on your own life and values.Different layers of Alvin's life are unfolded slowly before you during his conversations, each a little gift you unwrap. There's his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), with whom he lives, who is thought to be mentally retarded but in fact has a speech impediment. There's a secret he's carried since WWII. There are just factoids here and there about his life, all told in such an interesting fashion. Each person with whom he interacts similarly reveals interesting aspects of his/her life, like an exchange of presents. David Lynch beautifully demonstrates the slowness of the journey without being tedious, through breathtaking Iowa landscapes. You feel like Straight is just taking his trip one day at a time, not trying to force it. The whole time you're really rooting for him to make it to his brother's house "in time", yet you also feel like if his brother isn't there, you won't consider the journey wasted or fruitless.This movie was really uplifting in this time of hurricane-related misery. It made me feel like there are many out there with plenty to offer in terms of unconditional love, random acts of kindness, good advice. You just have to make it your duty to find them. I love this film, and think Richard Farnsworth was a perfect choice for the lead.I think religious moviegoers will like this movie, too, because there's no cursing, and there's a lot about family, friends, and kindness in this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this quite some time ago but was thinking about it all day today for some reason. It is a wonderful heartwarming film about one man's journey back through his life stopping at key points along the way. I felt that the character almost had some higher power guiding him. For example in the scene when all the cyclists fly past him in their droves he chugs along at his usual pace. Then later he looks up and sees a storm coming and he is in the middle of nowhere. No shelter anywhere. Then he glances over and sees a small barn. Heading towards it he parks inside at the moment the Heavens open. Safe and protected from the force of nature. It is such a simple moment but is executed so well. The pace of the film is wonderful and quite frankly I could watch Farnsworth for hours as he has that kind of face. Lynch has found the perfect balance for his story here and made a solid memorable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>G-rated David Lynch film is a gem. The wonderful Richard Farnsworth, who was so awesome in "The Grey Fox" and "The Natural", stars as Alvin Straight, a kind-hearted gent who crosses America to visit his brother on a lawn mower. Beautifully written, directed and photographed (by the great Freddie Francis), it is a celebration of human kindness and life's unexpected joys. Angelo Badalamenti creates a gorgeous, touching score to mark Alvin's adventure and subtly underlines the film's purest of emotions. Sissy Spacek is, as usual, compelling as Alvin's daughter Rose, who is initially reluctant to encourage her father to take the trip. Jack Fisk, who production designed Lynch's "Eraserhead", returns here for another fine job. Though not a "typical" Lynch film, it is still Lynchian in its affectionate and authentic depiction of rural life.</fullReview>

Not the America of the shallow rich and famous but the America of the ordinary people with a heart and soul. It is also full of pure poetry and wisdom. Haven't we all once sheltered from the rain, smelled the fragrance of the wet dirt at least once in our childhood, just like Alvin does in the open fields?This movie also holds the fundamental rhythms of life.

		<shortDescription>Tops my list of personal favorite films, and that's not said lightly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a hard time putting this into words. In order to convey what I want to say, I'm going to have to give some information about me.I have been a film buff all my life. Before I went into Information Technology, I spent four years being a film major at both BYU and the University of Utah. I estimate that I have seen over 6000 films in my lifetime. I have many personal favorite films of all genres. I am considered by my friends and family the most reliable (and un-shut-up-able) source when it comes to gauging, rating, and examining films.So, when I say that The Straight Story TOPS THE LIST OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FILMS, it really, really means something.This movie is directed by David Lynch, who I consider one of the top five American filmmakers, right up there with Martin Scorcese and Stanley Kubrick. Likely, unless you're a film buff or an old Twin Peaks fan, you've never heard of David Lynch. Most of David Lynch's movies are considered cult films. Ever heard of Blue Velvet? Wild At Heart? Lost Highway? Eraserhead? Or even the recent film Mulholland Drive? If you haven't, it just means you're neither a small-film connoisseur nor a David Lynch fan. And, unless you have a taste for unusual, dream-like, sometimes unsettling (a.k.a. 'artsy-fartsy') cinema, then you never need to remember the name David Lynch.However, to everyone else in this entire world who is willing to devote 2 hours of their short life to watching a movie, there are two films David Lynch has made that should appeal to anyone: The Elephant Man (made in 1980), and The Straight Story.The Straight Story is about the true life experience of a man named of Alvin Straight. He lived in a small town in Ohio. He was 73 years old when he decided to visit his younger brother in Michigan who had suffered a stroke. He hadn't spoken to his brother in 11 years, due to an old quarrel. Alvin had bad eyes, he could not drive himself in a car there. He doesn't like others driving for him. So, he hitches a trailer to his riding-mower for use as a sleeping compartment, packs lots of hotdogs and braunaschwerger, and starts out towards his brother's place -- at a speed of roughly 10 to 15 miles per hour.Many things happen along the way. We discover more about Alvin, the way he sees things, what he's been through in his life. We learn more about he and his brother. At a couple points, he must swallow his pride and graciously accept the help of good-hearted strangers. At times, he is able to provide assistance to others. Richard Farnsworth (who was nominated for the best actor oscar for this movie) plays Alvin Straight. He died less than one year after it was finished. Sissy Spacek plays his sensitive daughter in a hugely underrated performance.This movie, to me, represents filmmaking at its highest form of art. It is an absolutely perfect blend of visual mastery, appropriate musical scoring and musical placement, a well-presented tale truly worth telling, and it is filled with material that the thoughtful viewer can derive personal interpretation from. Most others that have seen this film really like it -- on the surface it is sweet and simple. It is a well made, slow-paced but entertaining film, free of anything that could possibly offend even the easily offendible person. For many viewers, that's all it is and all it will ever be for them. In my case, when I watch the film, I find in it all the sublimities of life. I want to get on my hands and knees and weep and thank God for every day I live, all that I have, and all the trials I've been through. I want to embrace my loved ones and pour all the love of my soul on them. I want to look into the eyes of every stranger and say "I genuinely care about your welfare, I respect you no matter what our differences, and I would love to get to know you better." I am full of love and patience for all mankind. It is one of the only films I have ever seen that truly influences me to be a better human being, and it doesn't have one single preachy moment in it.Maybe it won't do the same for you, but that is the power I feel in this remarkable film. Although it is rated 'G', it would be tedious for short-attention-spanned kids 12 and younger to sit through. It would be tedious for short-attention-spanned adults to sit through as well. If you're the kind of person who'd rather see two hours of Alvin Straight using his riding-mower 'Jackass-style', like shredding melons, pinecones, shoes and other assorted items with the blades, or flying off ramps into muddy pits, then this is not your movie. Only those who are capable of enjoying a transcendary film experience may apply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's least typical movie and one of his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of David Lynch ever since 'Blue Velvet's original release back in the mid-80s. That movie knocked me out then and still impresses me to this day. I followed his subsequent career intently, and went back and rediscovered the astonishing 'Eraserhead'. But even being the fan that I was, and only ever being disappointed with one of his movies ('Dune' - a flawed, but still interesting failure), I was very dubious when I first heard about 'The Straight Story'. I thought it sounded like a Disney-fied sell-out, and yet another maverick being neutered by the mainstream. I shouldn't have worried. Fifteen minutes into the movie and I was convinced. The plot may not be full of Lynch's usual disturbing, surreal pessimistic outlook, but everything about it is vintage Lynch. Beautiful, haunting images, and a hereto unseen humanistic quality.Richard Farnsworth gives one of the most compelling performances you'll see in any movie. Even the close ups of his face speak volumes. Sissy Spacek is also notable as Farnsworth's daughter, a woman who has seen more than her fair share of tragedy and still radiates a quiet dignity. Veteran actor Harry Dean Stanton only features in one scene, but it is one of the most memorable and touching in recent memory. This is a truly wonderful film that should be watched by every movie lover. Another remarkable achievement from David Lynch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When "The Straight Story" came out, many critics called it a solid masterpiece. I don't know whether I would call it that, but it's definitely worth seeing. The true story of Midwest farmer Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth, in his final role) driving his tractor down a highway to visit his estranged brother, the movie makes us call into question our own lifestyles. Alvin may be about at the end of his rope, but he knows that he has to make amends sooner or later.All in all, this is a very interesting change of pace for director David Lynch. The man usually known for the likes of "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet" and "Mulholland Dr." looks at the rustic life and how certain things in it may have to change. It's certainly a movie that I recommend to people. Equally as good as Farnsworth are Sissy Spacek as Alvin's speech-impaired daughter Rose, and Harry Dean Stanton as Alvin's brother Lyle. Also appearing (as the tractor salesman) is Everett McGill, whom you may recognize from "Silver Bullet" and "The People Under the Stairs".A very unique movie indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching, heartfelt celebration of life -- totally non-Lynch and yet, at the same time, very much so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard of "The Straight Story" at all, really, and was shocked to see it on the Top 250 listed as a David Lynch G-rated movie. Not only that -- it was a true story! It's one of Lynch's better films in my opinion. As kind of a flip-side to Blue Velvet, it is a celebration of America rather than an exposure. I saw it a few nights ago and found myself moved and alienated at the same time - similar, actually, to The Elephant Man. I think the way Lynch creates a feeling of detachment, while still evoking a lot of subtle emotion, in both these movies is particularly effective. It's strange, but not just for the sake of being so.Richard Farnsworth (RIP) is excellent in the film. Sissy Spacek is rather annoying -- but the character calls for it, I suppose. We also get a small role at the end by the great Harry Dean Stanton, playing Farnsworth's estranged brother.Farnsworth committed suicide shortly after the movie's release and it's strange to watch this knowing it was his last film, because the general theme of the movie -- old-age, the acceptance of death and the search for affirmation -- is made all the more significant and haunting.In a way, a very eerie, unsettling movie -- but also a beautifully photographed, wonderfully directed character piece and an ode to life -- which is really out of the norm considering it's a Lynch film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone else but David Lynch would have made "The Straight Story" a dripping, sentimental road movie/modern picaresque, but instead he makes it a visually beautiful, leisurely character study through the fly-over states with an unsentimental ending. Richard Farnsworth as The Grey Fox is marvelous in the central role, particularly in his moving monologues as he reflects on his life.The production design is outstanding; every detail of every character and town and building is evocative to a T. The camera lingers over the amber waving grain in a way that recalls a Woody Guthrie song. Angelo Badalamenti manages to find some Americanesque melodies to wrap the soundtrack in; though it's beautiful, I might have preferred a more conventional Americana approach.Sure it's rated G but no kid will sit through it.(originally written 10/30/1999)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years of not just watching this film over and again,but utilizing in treatment, I can find few that match it for it's spiritual content without being a preachy film. Lynch utilizes his typical symbolism, but the writing is what really stands the test of time. It is like a biblical parable that captures the Americana message of a journey into redemption. Farnsworth was absolutely brilliant in his portrayal and takes the audience with him in a trip across the heartland. I have equated this movie to the principles that are the guidelines for a person in recovery, including the honesty, hope, faith, and ultimately, absolute humility, that is the touchstone of 12 step recovery. No other film that I have seen so brilliantly displays these concepts. Even if it is a bit slow for our AD-D world, the individual who is willing to focus on the perfect symmetry of the message against the beauty of the cinematography and characters portrayed will be rewarded. The end result is a subtle renewal of the soul in a simple story of truth and rural enlightenment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, yet beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story- First of all, the premise for this movie is excellent. It's heartfelt, simple, and very charming and likable. What can be said about the premise can also be said about the entire story. It's very simple (the exact opposite of David Lynch's usual style). I believe it's simple to match the simple message that it's getting across, and possibly to mirror the simplicity of life as an elder (I'm just theorizing here), but either way, the simplicity of the story also makes it very likable, as it makes it all the more relatable. Characters- The characters are all so likable. Alvin, the protagonist of the story, is both extremely likable and interesting. In a way he's a stereotypical old man, but he's also given so much depth, making him relatable to even the youngest of children. His daughter is also very likable, and their dynamic between each other is just amazing. The characters Alvin meets throughout his journey are all so interesting, many of whom Alvin connects with on an emotional level, making it so we explore the depth of their personality (even having a short amount of screen time with them). My personal favorite is the fellow world war II veteran that Alvin connects with in the bar. It's such an emotional moment, and in only about three minutes we feel deeply invested and connected to both of the characters. It's absolutely brilliant.Performances- Every single performance in this film is incredible. They're all so genuine and relatable. Of course I particularly like Richard Farnsworth. He deserved an Oscar win for his portrayal of Alvin. I mean it when I say every single actor/actress in this movie completely knocks it out of the park, despite how little screen time some of them had. Atmosphere/Tone/Imagery- Like the story, the tone of the film is very simple, yet likable. It's difficult to describe, but it just has a very straight forward way of presenting its content. The beautiful country landscapes are amazing to look at as well. It's just a beautiful film. In conclusion, The Straight Story is a nearly flawless film. It's heartfelt, simple, and likable in every aspect of the film. The performances are Oscar worthy, the landscapes are wonderful, and it even has a little of David Lynch's quirkiness. It's a beautiful movie that everyone should be privileged enough to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In real life we just assumes that all people are selfish and don't spend time for helping others, but when i saw this movie the people who found by the old Alvin Straight's is just opposite which i thought of, they listen and care for him. You'd think it was a fantasy, this kindness of strangers, if the movie weren't based on a true story. Richard Farnsworth is just wonderful, a world of emotions conveyed in every detail of his face and expression. Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is a 73-year-old man from in Laurens, Iowa, who learns that his brother is dying and wants to see him one last time. His eyes are too bad to allow him to drive. He lives with his daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), who is somewhat retarded and no good behind the wheel. Nor do they have a car. But they have a tractor-style lawn mower, and the moment Alvin's eyes light on it, he knows how he can drive the 300 miles to Mt. Zion, Wis. The first mower engine blows out, but he gets another one, a John Deere, hitches a little trailer to it, and stubbornly sets off down the road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight story is one of my favorite movies, even though it can be a weird movie for some. It surely takes few minutes before you get into the movie but the feel from the 1st scene is like there is some good quality stuff ahead. It is about an old man's journey and somewhat similar to 'Into the Wild' or 'Harry and Tonto' where you learn a lot from one man's experience with strangers, when he's on journey to a destination which he thinks is the ultimate destination. There are not many characters or dialogues in the movie but still is quite effective. The lawn mower idea makes it a unique movie at least for me. I wish the lead had won the Oscar because he pretty much single handedly carried this movie and does more than justice to the story and screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do yourself a favor and schedule an hour and a half into your busy agenda to watch The Straight Story. With captivating simplicity, the movie tells the true story of an elderly Alvin Straight, who back in the 1990's, traveled over 250 miles to visit his ailing brother. Alvin's driver's license had been revoked because of his age and he wasn't about to let someone else drive him because of his stubbornness, so he sets out on his journey using his trusty lawn mower.I'd expect a movie featuring an elderly man to be full of Disney-style, heart-wrenching sympathy traps, but instead the story is genuine and straightforward, coupled with a refreshing message of principle and priority. It also has the best acting performances I've seen in a very, very long time and this only adds to the richness of the movie.So make sure you watch and listen to The Straight Story. It's a movie masterpiece about a journey we call life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is different from many others. It is about a stubborn old man and his special trip to see his brother. The old man didn't have a driver's license so he had to ride a special car (made of a old tractor and wood) on the highway very carefully. Although he met many terrible difficulties, one of the worst was that he even didn't know if his brother was alive, he overcame all of them and finally made it.This movie, if judged by most of today's audience, may not be a very good one because the plot was not very intense and there were no bombs, blood, or beautiful women in it. However, it tells us how powerful love, affection, and persistence are, which distinguish us as human beings but we are continuously losing them in the last few decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Lynch with love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard not to consider this movie as one of Lynch's best. The only reason not to give it a full 10/10 is that Lynch as a movie maker has done better in terms of virtuosity. This movie is made with such warm, heart-felt love by every single member of the crew that it oozes out of every scene, angle, sound and dialogue. And yet, the splendid low-key performances are helping it not to become a trip to a candy store and lifts it up to the point where you have to be a very cold person not to feel just a slight sting or gentle push somewhere in the broad register of emotions that a person can feel. The story touches almost any aspect of getting to terms with who you are and the life you've lived. It's about love, hate, family, nature, humanity at its best, and it's all told with generosity and broad smile. Herein lies the sound proof of Lynch as a master at his craft. As a road movie, it doesn't come better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not straight at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is famous for such movies as Blue Velvet and of course his student film Eraser head. I don't mind Lynch's work but I often find him a little bit too obvious when it comes to the emotional content of his work.Despite his love of making movies that leave most people completely baffled and loving it he decided to make a movie based on a simple true story of a man who travels by ride on lawn mower to visit his brother.That fact alone is all the surreality this movies needs. The pace is as slow as both the tractor and Alvin Straight, but this pacing is perfect. Funny, touching and both ordinary and different at the same time. A nice movie to watch on a lazy rainy Sunday afternoon.One of the funny stories is that many older people enjoyed this movie so much that they decided to see David Lynch's next effort, Mulholland Drive.....many also left by the time of the first lesbian love scene of that movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talking about an odd turn for David Lynch, the man who has brought us some seriously weird and unpleasant stuff like "Lost Highway" and "Twin Peaks" has made one of the warmest and most touching movies of the nineties.The plot is just to strange to not be true: an old man visits his brother by riding a lawnmower through several states of America. Sure this film may not suit every one, many people who love Lynch's other movies might feel alienated when they watch this, but if they can sit through the first half hour or so they will probably start liking it. The story is both full of joy and sorrow, and really hard not to like. The only problem I had with this movie was the slow pace, it was often relevant to have the movie as slow as it was, but sometimes it just didn't work very well.It's also very well acted. Richard Farnsworth didn't play Alvin Straight, he was Alvin Straight, clearly one of the most memorable performances I've seen.One you shouldn't miss, though it is somewhat slow at times.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally like David Lynch's films, but sometimes find myself shouting at the screen, wishing he'd use a straightforward script rather than simply trying to weave a bunch of weird scenes into something that makes sense on the second or third viewing.Well, "The Straight Story" gives it to you straight.It's a great movie that tells a touching, true story that is, dare I say it, heartwarming. Great dialogue, great acting, great-looking film. It's funny and tragic at the same time, and Lynch's few irritating touches (scenes with barely audible dialogue, etc.) -- which, unneeded here, come off like the stunts they are -- don't ruin the movie.If you want dancing dwarves, moody music and scary woods, rent the first season of "Twin Peaks," and spend the weekend burning rope and searching for Laura Palmer's ghost. If you're hankering for a solid story you can watch with your 9-year-old or your Bible-toting folks, put this one in your machine. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

Thank you David Lynch, and thank you Richard Farnsworth, I have never seen an actor who can express such emotion and gravity by way of whiskers and mournful-wise eyes alone.Be patient, be calm, and go on Alvin's journey with him.

Not your "average" over-the-top mind blowing David Lynch movie, but no less wonderful. This movie relativates. Not suitable for all tastes, but quite worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Straight Story" is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged, dying brother. But that's just the basic synapsis...this movie is about so much more than that. This was Richard's Farnworth's last role before he died, and it's definitely one that he will be remembered for. He's a stubborn old man, not unlike a lot of the old men that you and I probably know. "The Straight Story" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. It will reach down and touch some part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it definitely is unlike anything else directed by Lynch. No supernatural stuff, no violence, no profanity. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful flick. It's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6-week(that's my best guess for its duration) journey. The characters are everyday people and thus, they are believable. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Everyone who has a sibling can relate to it. Lyle and Alvin don't even have to say anything. For a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring. The idea of a 75-year-old man traveling the country-side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than "The Straight Story."The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl. She's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells her a story about his own kids, long ago. He had them each take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them. "That bundle," he said, "is family." So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions.Alvin's journey across Iowa is full of such refreshingly un-Hollywood character interactions. Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey. It's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets--to their benefit and ours. It's a slow, simple, relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with the urbanization of America."The Straight Story" is the rare live-action "G"-rated movie that truly should not be missed.

		<shortDescription>Lynch playing it beautifully straight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like his early masterpiece "The Elephant Man" Lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight, simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of an elderly retired man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at death's door. A beautiful score from Badalamenti, exquisite photography of rural life (love those aerial corn-field shots), and a sly director's hand that reveals man's basic humanity, this is a beautiful slice of life film. Its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep, but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER IT.The title says it. This odd David Lynch movie (in fact, a very conventional movie for Lynch standards, and a very odd one precisely in account of that) follows the adventures of Alvin Straight, a 73-years-old man who decides to go see his brother Lyle, who he hasn't spoken to in years, in a rather unusual way.The movie has a beautiful photography and some great shots of the American roads, but that's not enough. Although it has its absolutely great moments, it lacks of easy sentimentalism in some parts. The good and the bad, then.The good. The acting: Richard Fansworth and Sissy Spacek are great. The opening thirty minutes are priceless and one of the most enjoyable ones I've seen recently, with a very subtle humor and genuine moving scenes. And the brilliant scene with the deers.The bad. Some of the conversations are too "cry, goddamn it, cry" specially the ones with the pregnant girl and the WWII vet. And when the old man rejects a lift because he wants to travel by himself, it just doesn't seem too believable with the character.A good movie anyway. I wouldn't have put it into the first 250, that's it. But the fact is, "Shawshwank redemption" and "Lord of the Rings" rank in the first 10 places, and they are crap. This one is pure gold in comparison.SAY NO MORE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>****1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes there are two things that when put together you think it just isn't right but after you see the results the wonder how they have avoided contact all these years. Such is the case with David Lynch directing a Disney movie. With is project Lynch has been able to put his talent to use in order to empower people instead of frighten them and is very effective. What we have here is the tale of Alvin Straight, a 73 year old man who's brother who he hasn't talked to in 10 years has had a stroke. Feeling that time may be running out Alvin wants to travel from his home to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother before it is to late, but he can hardly walk, he needs two canes and with his eyesight slipping he can't get a drivers liscense. But bound and determinded Alvin decides he will ride his ageing lawn mower to Wisconsin. But short into his trip his lawn mower quite on him and he is forced to hitch a ride back home where he blowing the mower up and buys a new one to once again set out for Wisconsin. Along the way Alvin meets and touches charcters in many different shapes and forms including a mislead youth who is running away form home, a kind man who takes him in after the belt on his lawnmower snaps, an elderly WW1 vet who can't seem to shake the horrible memories that plage him and a priest. The film is like a living breathing Halmark card with such powerfuly moving lines like "I used to play a game with my kids, I'd give them all a stick to break and of course they could, then I would tie the pieces into a bundle and they couldn't break in then I would tell them that bundel is a family." and when he tells that the worst part of being old is "remembering when you were young." Richard Farnswerth plays Alivn and he recieved a well diserved Oscar Nomination for his heart shatter performance that hits the nail dead on with believablity. Lynch is perfectly suited for this film and all of his fans will no doubt see his trademark style in here just somewhat more subdued than usual, what can be said then man is a genious. Although the G rating makes it suitable for family viewing younger children will probably not find much to be desired here as the humor is light and will probably mostly appeal to adults who are looking for something a little deeper than your average teen movie or more goofy Dinsey movies like the Kid but nevertheless is a treat from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal Yet Accessible Lynch Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is his most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, stricken brother, there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes (some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland, filmed by veteran cinematographer Freddy Francis) to make it an undeniable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter (whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances, one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time. But that's vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best. To those unfamiliar with Lynch or know him only by his violent, disturbing reputation, this is an excellent place to begin; for those who know his work, this is one of the finest in his repertoire.</fullReview>

Usually if a movie doesn't interest me, I start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake.At first I thought that's what I had to do since this movie's pacing started off slow, along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time. But after a bit, I start getting more into the movie, as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling. By the end, you feel like you've known him your whole life.

The music and long, loving shots of the country he travels through are wonderful. I don't think I have ever seen Richard Farnsworth in anything before and I was pleased to see him give an extraordinary performance. Striking a blow for older actors! I very much liked this film. The only problem I had was that Lyle was played by Harry Dean Stanton. Now, I love HDS but I had spent the whole film praying for Alvin to make it to see Lyle in time and when Lyle calls out "Alvin?" from his shack I was so relieved. But when he shuffles out all I could think was "No way, Harry Dean Stanton. I didn't know he was in this" and it kind of detracted from the moment for me.

		<shortDescription>Small Moments And Grace Notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how well this movie would play on repeat viewings, but I've got a feeling it's best viewed by an audience caught off-guard, without any expectations as to subject matter or its director's prior excesses. THE STRAIGHT STORY is a slight one, its characters unassuming and its tone decidedly muted. If you can de-accelerate down to the film's slow tempo, you'll be rewarded with moments of quiet profundity. Though generally derided even by those who like the film, Farnsworth's scenes with the pregnant runaway are deeply touching: his analogy of a lone individual as a twig easily snapped, a family as a bundle of sticks tied tightly together and near-unbreakable, is a lovely moment that embodies the film's understated virtues. A beautiful Badalamenti score aids director Lynch immeasurably in achieving these grace notes, as does the sweeping imagery captured by cinematographer Francis. Farnsworth's face - a tintype of a vanished America - almost makes appraisals of his performance superfluous. While it's hard to say if THE STRAIGHT STORY would work the same magic on the second or third viewing, seeing it once in the properly attentive frame of mind should be enough to leave you with an indelible memory of it.</fullReview>

The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower, but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson Alvin's going to offer.Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy.

		<fullReview>This movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that I have ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. One suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to life.I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was sceptical. I thought the plot sounded contrived and I was afraid that the story would be banal. But being a David Lynch fan I decided to give it a go. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema feeling that I had truly learned something valuable about life.This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because I also thought he managed that very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and I think The Straight Story is his best yet. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible story but worth seeing(spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching this movie I was confused. I didn't understand why this guy felt he needed to ride his lawn mower the whole way to his brothers house. He spent over 300 dollars to get a new lawn mower, which would have been more than enough for a plane ticket. And he was offered a ride to his brothers house and turned it down. Which makes me wonder if he really cared for his brother or if he was just looking for publicity. It took him about 2 months to go see his brother who just had a stroke. This doesn't make sense to me. You would think he would want to see him as soon as he could. But other than this ridiculous story the movie is good. I said it is worth seeing because it shows you how stupid people are, and how nice people are, the people he meets. It also shows you the power of silence. Don't expect anything from this and you might not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicate brilliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The zenith of two brilliant careers. David Lynch, better known for less accessible material, crafts a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise. A man travels to see his estranged brother. Having no other means of transportation, his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his last film, delivers a stunningly layered and nuanced performance in the starring role. Achingly beautiful in its exultation of small things, Straight Story is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed. Sissy Spacek is notable as Farnsworth's daughter, an impaired middle-aged woman living with the loss of her children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's incredible to see that the director of this tender story of love for a brother is the same nightmare painter of "Eraserhead" and "Twin Peaks". David Lynch here portrays the true story of Alvin Straight (1920-1996) an old man from Laurens, which went on a lawnmover to the house of his brother Lyle, after 10 years of hate. Alvin is a man who suffered a lot but who has in his eyes the will to go on and to forgive. It's a wonderful story with the beautiful images of Freddie Francis (82 years old director of photography) and the great interpretation of Richard Farnsworth: in his eyes you can see life, with all his problems and happiness. there are beautiful moments like the dialogue with the pregnant girl and the story of the woods like the family and his memories of war. It's a fantastic story about how life would be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly this is a slow paced movie. We are so geared to lots of action that when we get into a movie that is less than hectic and where a scene doesn't change every few seconds we begin to think we should be bored. A slow paced movie gives us a chance to reflect and to observe the surroundings, something we don't often give ourselves a chance to do in "real" life. The Straight Story is indeed a chance to be involved with a variety of people and their impact on us and us on them. Having said all of that I think the pace could have been faster than it was (I think of the pace of Patch Adams). Still, glad I saw it. I still think about it and the lessons I can learn from it.</fullReview>

What really annoys me is how easy it seems to be to get an average film into the top 100 by making it so inoffensive and actionless ...and actually plotless..the premise is so week that we never find out really why he stopped talking to his estranged brother ..all down to drink apparently, which the main character (who's name escapes me due to film induced narcolepsy) has given up of course. A disney film I note, so good wholesome on track messages. ARGGGGGH! Bring back the Love Bug!!

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is beautiful, emotional and dreamlike, qualities a child can notice. But there is a heck of a lot more to it. What makes this film such a powerful statement about aging is its attention to detail and its sly self-depreciating satire. The idea that as you grow older, everything has a hint of foolishness to it, from driving your tractor across two states, to not speaking to your brother for 30 years. (I wasn't the only person in the theatre laughing hysterically at the end of the film.) Like most Lynch movies, this one has lots of levels to it. What is so unique about this one is that my grandmother can enjoy it as much as I do.</fullReview>

The characters met along the way, can easily be applied to real life. People we meet each day, even if just for a second and never really knowing why, if we will see them again, or what we may have done for them with just a few simple words.

		<shortDescription>It's Never Too Late To Go Home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** It's a journey of the soul as a man goes home in his heart, in this dramatization of the true story of Alvin Straight, who drove a lawn mower over three-hundred miles through the state of Iowa and into Wisconsin, to see his brother, a stroke victim with whom he had not spoken for ten years. `The Straight Story,' directed by David Lynch, recounts the story of Alvin (Richard Farnsworth), who set out to see his brother, Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton), upon hearing of his stroke. Alvin is prevented from driving because of poor eyesight, and he won't take a bus because he doesn't trust another's driving. A widower who lives with his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), Alvin, not a man of means, resorts to the only way he knows how, to get to Lyle. He needs to put the bad blood behind them before it's too late; an estrangement born of `anger and pride.' Hauling a make-shift trailer, and with three five-gallon cans of gas and a cooler full of hot dogs, Alvin sets out, alone and determined, on his lawn mower. Now in the twilight of his life, having learned to `separate the wheat from the chaff,' the trip affords Alvin plenty of time to reflect on his life, and steels him in his quest to do what he feels he has to do. Along the way he befriends and is befriended by the strangers he encounters; a testimony to the bountifulness of the human spirit. When a young man asks him what the worst thing is about being old, he replies, `Remembering when you were young.' Richard Farnsworth gives the performance of a lifetime as Alvin, this stubborn, prideful man, who has learned humility with age, and you can see the wisdom of his years in his eyes. Farnsworth connects with the audience from the beginning, aptly conveying the yearning of a soul in need of atonement, and the determination of the man to effect his amends. Sissy Spacek, also, gives a terrifically nuanced performance as Rose, the `slow' daughter who lives daily with demons of her own. That the members of the Academy failed to nominate her for best-supporting actress for her work here is nothing short of criminal; her Rose is a beautiful piece of work. David Lynch, as well, has done a remarkable job of bringing Alvin's story to the screen. He has woven a rich visual and emotional tapestry, all poignantly delivered with a gentle hand. Beautifully photographed, the lush vistas of the Midwest reflect Alvin's state of mind, underscoring the deeper meanings of what is really a spiritual journey, during which the past mingles with the present. Lynch has taken a wistful, almost poetic approach throughout, which, together with the story is reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's `Wild Strawberries.' The scene in which Alvin finally meets up with Lyle is perfectly and touchingly executed, and is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. The supporting cast includes James Cada (Danny), Everett McGill (Tom), Barbara E. Robertson (Deer Woman), John Farley (Thorvald), and Kevin P. Farley (Harold). With an artistic hand, Lynch has crafted an unforgettable film. `The Straight Story' is Alvin's story, but the journey belongs to us; a reminder of what is really important in life, and the needs we all share at one time or another. It's an entertaining movie that will touch you and make you think, as well; and as far as I'm concerned, that's about as good as it gets. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully quiet, well casted, and emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Straight Story" is one of the few films these days that uses quiet to make a point, rather than explosions, loud music, or shouting scripts to distract the viewer, and form the illusion that you are being kept attentive. It takes guts to make a film this in an age where everyone in Hollywood thinks the average attention span of a viewer is five minutes, tops. The camera uses extremely long, unbroken shots, rather than fast cutting from scene-to-scene and a quiet, slow paced script. The film follows the trail of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), the seventy-three-year-old father of a middle-aged slightly mentally disabled daughter, Rose(Sissy Spacek). Straight sets off across Iowa in a lawn tractor pulling a trailer to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to visit his estranged brother, before it's too late. Along the way Alvin encounters bickering twin mechanics, a runaway pregnant teenager, a catholic priest, and several other genuine and sincere characters. The story is sad, but makes you happy as well. It's not a good film for someone without a long attention, though, but if you're that someone, give the film a chance. It means a lot of things in this hectic, fast-paced, obnoxious world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story is among the best movies I've ever seen...period. I never thought I would say this about a Lynch-directed film, but I say it without hesitation here. The acting is a bit stiff in the first few minutes, but once it gets settled in, I'm not sure I've seen finer performances. The film moves slowly, but deliberately, as Lynch demonstrates the power of silence. Angelo Badalamenti's score complements the film perfectly. The cinematography is unusual but is never distracting. The character development is outstanding, and the biggest surprise of all: the dialog is very strong and very intelligent. The emotional performances by the actors together with the very genuine dialog made the movie personal for me. Our kids even sat through its slow pace because the characters are so interesting. I just can't say enough positive things about this movie. If you want a good family film, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the commenst like "Lost me in ten seconds". only highlight the subtle strength of this film. It's not for everyone, and even if it is for you, don't watch it with people who aren't into it. The nuances of the performances demand your attention. But you'll be rewarded with a experience that truly highlights the power of film. I live in the prairies up here in Canada. Those shots of combines harvesting, the rolling landscape, they hammer home again the sublte beauty of the landscape. Sure we don't have mountains but as you can see, rolling prairie has it's only thing about it. Oh and further to richard Farnsworth, I highly recommend his performace in the movie The Grey Fox. It's a Canadian classic and a true story about the train robber Billy Miner after he gets out of jail. Agian he is a man out of sync with the times and struggles. Great film as well. OOK eh?

		<shortDescription>A memorable story that goes straight to your heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess something here. "The Straight Story" was the first David Lynch film that I did see and I would like to see it on the big screen again. At a time where people were saying "American Beauty" is a classic when it really is an overrated film. Sam Mendes maybe a good film director, but he's nothing like David Lynch or David Cronenberg.In "The Straight Story", the story starts out in the small town of Laurens, Iowa where Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth - "Misery", "The Natural") overhears his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek - "Affliction"), who finds out on the telephone that Alvin's brother, Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton - "The Green Mile") had a devastating stroke.A few seconds later, Alvin tells Rose that he needs to see Alvin before it's too late. However, there are a few obstacles that stands in Alvin's way. One, he's seventy-three years old. Two, his eyesight is so bad that he can't drive a car. Three, his hips are in terrible shape and getting up is hard enough. Despite that, he's determined to get to Mount Zion, Wisconsin, that's the town where Alvin lives nearby. The vehicle that Alvin chooses to use on the road is his Reds' lawnmower, is the surprise choice. When the lawnmower breaks down, Alvin buys a '66 John Deere lawnmower from Tom the John Deere dealer, nicely played by Everett McGill, who has a couple good lines.Alvin gets out on the road again and whoever he meets is very interesting to watch. The heart and soul of the film rests in Alvin's eyes. My personal favorites were the bickering twins, pregnant runaway, the deer woman, a former WWII vet, and the priest. The scene between the priest and Alvin is heartwarming and the line that Alvin makes is very clear.The last scene where Alvin arrives at Lyle's house is priceless and the conversation that Lyle and Alvin have is well written. Angelo Badlamenti conducts one of the best musical scores that I've heard and Freddie Francis' cinematography is wonderfully dune. Overall, the performance that Farnsworth should have earned him an Oscar for Best Actor and why he didn't get it is a disgrace. David Lynch, too, deserved an Oscar as well and the film should have gotten a Best Picture award. This film is the best one of 1999.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Lynch's best, but one of 99's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge David Lynch fan, I couldn't wait to see this. For the most part, I wasn't disappointed.First off, let me say two things: First of all, I'm 16, which proves not all teenagers demand rapid-fire editing and loud explosions (just most of them). Second of all, everyone thinks it's "weird" for Lynch to direct a film like this, but I don't think so. They always say "Oh, but his films are so mean and cruel, he never pays attention to charcters, blah blah blah...". Um, have you even bothered to see Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks? TP in particular is filled with great characters who evolve and grow and are fleshed out as the series goes on. Plus, he's no stranger to leisurely paces used to build atmosphere. Eraserhead does it beautifully, and one only has to watch the title sequence for Twin Peaks to see this talent in action. He has a real knack for creating a place that seems real.So with that out of the way, the movie: It's great. Alvin Straight is a 73 year-old man who's brother has a stroke, so he drives out on a riding mower to see him. Period. That's it. There's plenty more to it, of course, but it none of it involves the basic plot...the real treasures are hiding in the corners and the background. The film gets off to a wonderful beginning, with a loooooong tracking shot through a back yard. We finally end up in front of a window, and the shot is held for a while. Then we hear someone inside fall. Perfect. Another little treat that will pass by viewers is that in most road movies there's a shot of the highway, flying past the camera. Here we get the same shot, except it's crawlling by at 5 miles per hour. There's also a shot of a reverend leaving a house in a cemetery (is it a funeral home or what?) that looks like Lynch is going into a dream sequence. But he isn't...it's just finding a surreal beauty in everyday things, something that anyone familiar with his photos can attest to.The real star of the film, though, is Richard Farnsworth. Denzel Washington was good, Kevin Spacey was good, but Farnsworth acchieves one of the best performances of the decade. Strong words, I know, but I stand by it. There are two important things about what makes a great performance, and they are subtlety and believability. Farnsworth achieves both. To imagine anyone else as the character would be impossible. At first he's just your loveable stubborn Southern coot, but later when you look at his face you always know what he's thinking about. He speaks in a slow drawl that sounds like every word is chosen ahead of time. He is not slow, just very weary, and very very tired. The best scene in the entire movie (besides the ending) is an astounding scene in a bar in which he and another man trade WWII stories. To watch is face while he tells the story leaves you absolutely spellbound. You can almost see the pain inside. This scene alone should have cemented his prize, but to no avail.I have only two complaints. First of all, I love it when directors take the time to establish a setting and atmosphere...but only to a certain point. This film crosses that line a little. There's only so much corn one can take. The other thing is the scenes where Alvin spouts advice to people he meets, teaching them valuable lessons. It's just much much too blunt for Lynch. It could have been handled more realistically, but instead it comes off as preaching...is this a movie or an episode of Seventh Heaven?But those are small complaints. The ending is without a doubt one of the best and most perfect I've ever seen, and I've seen a LOT of movies. To watch these two actors sit and you can literally see the weight lifting from their shoulders...it's beautiful. Two lines of dialogue never sounded so right.See it. Now.</fullReview>

A simple true tale about an arthritic lawnmower man named Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), the G-rating and overall pure goodness of the film automatically lends itself to gooey sentimentalism, but it triumphs for being eerie when it could have easily been dull, heartfelt when it could have been trite.And the director does not go unnoticed: the small-town aesthetic, the opening and closing shots of outer space and, of course, the deer lady, all make for a quintessential Lynch-ing experience. Together with Angelo Badalamenti's spooky score and Freddie Francis's sumptuous cinematography, this is one of the greatest American filmmaking accomplishments of 1999.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was quite simply a marvel of a film in every way. It, to me, personified and illustrated perfectly Spencer Tracey's quote "Acting is alright, just don't let anybody catch you doing it" Sissy, and Farnsworth were not caught. There performances were subtle, powerful and beautiful. In a word! Brilliant!... What is more, BELIEVE ABLE...never once did I doubt them or lose touch with their characters. Sissy Spacek was totally overlooked by the Academy...she is I believe along with Holly Hunter, Judi Dench &amp; Joan Plowright probably the greatest actress alive. I have never been a big fan of David Lynch, but what ever his detractors might say about him , he cannot be convicted of not knowing how to portray people sensitively, one must just look at Elephant Man to know he does "sensitive" and "personal" with the best of them. He certainly did that here. I also liked in this film a little nuance of his, that when the camera was a few yards away from the subject the sound went down....forcing one to listen carefully to the dialog....much like it would be if you were actually standing 30 or 40 feet from someone trying to hear what they were saying. I have long ago lost faith in the Academy, but It should be criminally prosecutable to have compared the acting in this film, that is to say, the acting of Farnsworth with that of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. Those who awarded and voted for Kevin should be sentenced to the chain Gang, Long Sentences with water and dried bread. THIS FILM SHOULD BE A 10 on anyones story board. And an 11 in the heart. Oh Yes, and I have never seen a better ending to a film like this...nor a better choice as the leads brother than Harry Dean Stanton. David Lynch proves and sees with a clear eye that "less is more" it is a magnificent Ending....Perfect....Flawless BEAUTIFUL! Hey! It just dawned on me.....Perhaps I am a David Lycnh Fan Afterall? ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to put a qualified damper on the outpouring of acclaim I find here. I had read so many superlative reviews of this movie that I suppose I should have known it could not live up to such high expectations. I found it to be a very good film, and certainly against the Hollywood studio standard of pacing and action, in that it is lyrical, understated to the point of being laconic, and moves at a - to put it gently - extremely relaxed pace. The movie seems to take as much time as Alvin took to get from Laurens to Mount Zion. Having said that, the characters keep us engaged and we need to see how Alvin finishes up (it is worth remembering that this is based on a true story). There is also some extremely dry humor (the scene in which Alvin walks through the kitchen with a shotgun is a howler). Richard Farnsworth is absolutely perfect in this role, and Sissy Spacek should have gotten some sort of award for her straight-on and sympathetic portrayal of a smart women perceived as "challenged". To sum up, this is a tender, touching story about family relationships that is worth seeing, but it helps if one really enjoys watching fields of wind-swept corn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Straight Up Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard David Lynch was directing a Disney movie I cracked up, but when I saw The Straight Story I realized that it was probably his best. I am a big Lynch fan and if you aren't familiar he is the man behind such macabre and disturbing films as: Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, and the T.V series Twin Peaks. I wouldn't think that resume would put him at the top of the list for a Disney movie. The Straight Story is about a 74 year old man who upon learning that his brother who he hadn't spoken to in years, had been stricken with a stroke travels 400 miles to see him. Because he doesn't have a drivers license he sets out on his riding lawn mower.The film is packed with beautiful scenery of Iowa and stellar performances by Sissy Spacek and Richard Farnsworth who was nominated for an Ocsar for his performance as Allen Straight. That along with Lynch's direction, a wonder score by Angelo Badalamenti, and a heart-warming script sends not only Allen Straight on an emotion journey, but the viewer as well. The film is about family and the strength there of. You may want to call a loved one after you see The Straight Story so keep the phone and a box of tissues close. The Straight Story will touch you in a way no other film has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some ways, The Straight Story reminds me of The Apostle - the slice-of-life story, the rural locales, several characters who truly can be described as characters...and the most telling of all - the Oscar nominated lead actors were robbed. Just as Robert Duvall was robbed by Jack Nicholson in 1997, Richard Farnsworth (who I loved in Anne of Green Gables) was robbed by Kevin Spacey in 2000.I love movies that are based on true stories and/or character studies, and The Straight Story fits either bill. Sissy Spacek does such a good job, I would've loved to see more of her in the movie. Richard Farnsworth carries the movie and does a wonderful job as the stubborn yet determined Alvin.A very good effort by David Lynch and all involved. Cuddle up on a lazy day with The Straight Story. Hop in the lawn mower beside Alvin and enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Then Came Alvin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was an old TV show, Then Came Bronson, about a fellow who traveled around the country, dispensing wisdom and pithy commentary that helped folks straighten our their lives. The Straight Story definitely has some great moments, and some beautifully-filmed work (love that early camera sweep through Alvin's yard to his kitchen window) and the acting is generally very good. But most of the film is given over to Alvin's worldly wisdom, shared with a runaway girl, a couple of bickering brothers and a WWII veteran. "Corny" is the word that comes to mind (appropriately, given the landscape).Frankly, I was let down. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of David Lynch's work, so when I heard that he had directed "The Straight Story" I was put off from the beginning. However, a friend of mine said that it was nothing like the usual Lynch blend of weirdness (and sometimes incoherence), and I was also attracted to the story itself so I decided to give it a try. Wow - am I glad I did! It is by far one of the finest movies I have ever seen. Everything about the film is top drawer - the acting is superb (how Farnsworth didn't receive an oscar for best actor is beyond me), the cinematography excellent, and the music is fabulous. Add all of these to a great story and you have one hell of a movie. The pace is slow without becoming tedious, and the characters are all uniquely interesting. I could watch it again and again......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like they used to say, they don't make 'em like this anymore. This movie was very good, in the message it sent, and the job that Richard Farnsworth did. He deserved an Oscar. The only problem I had about it was the pacing. I never realized, after watching some of David Lynch's weird work, that he had so much patience. At times, the long shots of trees and clouds nearly made me lose interest. But Farnsworth's bright eyes, and great smile kept me interested all the way to the end. And the end was just perfect. We need more movies like this one today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best film of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long admired the work of David Lynch--"Eraserhead" and the original "Twin Peaks" TV movie being my favorites--and I expected from word of mouth that I would like "The Straight Story", but I was not expecting to be as touched as I was by this thoughtful, lovely work of cinematic art. Perhaps I am simply at the right time and place in my life to appreciate the movie's messages (I can imagine some people, especially younger viewers, not having the patience for its leisurely pace and "plot"), but I feel privileged to have shared in a little of the journey (both literal and figurative) of Farnsworth and Lynch's Alvin Straight. One of the most resonant aspects of the movie for me was how it depicted the "American heartland" and its people and their very sturdy moral code (a major theme of "Fargo", also). And it isn't a religious moral code either, though it does adhere to the basic Protestant tenet of "doing unto others as you would have them do unto you". In this movie there is a definite sense of people wanting to do the right thing for themselves and for others--an all-for-one attitude. This is, for my money, the type of movie that we of the spiritually-conflicted new millennium need right now, for it brings it all down to a basic level. We need to take personal responsibility for ourselves and for others. Alvin Straight knows what he needs to do for himself and his brother and it is a testament to his character that he lets nothing stand in the way of his doing it. Alvin and all the others like him are the true heros of life. This story could have, in the hands of many other directors, been quite an intolerable affair (Rob Reiner? Steven Spielberg? Sorry to be insulting, but they would have laid it on thick!). Luckily Lynch was the one to do it, bringing both his keen, at times hokey (here appropriately so) sense of humor and his commitment to acknowledging life's "dark side" with him. Yes, Lynch does Disney, but rather than leaving out the dark side, he simply subverts it (imagine a G-rated "Blue Velvet"). From the Olsen twins to the deer lady to that surreal star-dotted sky, things are, as usual, a bit off-kilter in Lynchland....and thankfully so! Final thoughts: It was really nice to have Sissy Spacek back in such an interesting (and, unfortunately, supporting) role. I'd like to thank David for that. And as good as Kevin Spacey and Denzel Washington were in their Oscar-nominated performances last year, I'd have been thrilled to see Richard Farnsworth win the Best Actor award. Now that this gem is out on video I look forward to seeing it again. When you are in the mood for a such an experience, I urge you to do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful human interest story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Farnsworth has been acting 63 years. That's a long time as a supporting and character actor. He gets his big opportunity to be a leading man at age 79 and he nails it. Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight who takes a cross country odyssey on a riding mower to see his ailing brother with whom he has not spoken in ten years.This is a warm and touching story that takes its time unfolding. Alvin's journey is a journey for the viewer as well. It is an excellent character study of a proud and cantankerous old man who is determined to cling to his self sufficiency and dignity and for whom failure is not an option. It reminds us that behind the eyes of those old faces that we so often push aside, there are real people with strong principles, wisdom, experience and emotions worth far more than the value we place on them.Director David Lynch is to be commended for transcending his own usually bizarre mold in this film. Though his pacing is decidedly slow, so is the lawnmower, so it is appropriate. The prelude to Alvin's getting on the road was particularly deliberate and might have been condensed a bit, but once on the road the pacing was perfectly adapted to the story. The locations were terrific, with numerous aerial shots of our beautiful heartland. The story was presented with sensitivity and simplicity without a lot of visual gimmickry. It's good to see a film where the story and not the filmmaking is the point.Farnsworth gives the performance of his career. His portrayal makes Alvin determined and stubborn, but in a way that is lovable and charismatic. His ability to distill complex emotions into simple expressions was masterful.My only real criticism was that Sissy Spacek gave what I thought was a sub-par performance for her. I thought she overdid the speech impediment to the point where it hindered the dialogue.This is an absorbing and wonderful human interest story. I rated it a 9/10. For those looking for fast paced action, this is not your movie. For everyone else, see it soon and enjoy its simple enchantment.</fullReview>

Thing is, old and tired Alvin does not have the eyesight or license to drive, or trust in buses. Therefore he hops on a lawn mower to make the trek from one side of Iowa to the other side of Wisconsin. The acting is great, and there are plenty of old fashioned values dashed around to make this a pleasant movie to relax and enjoy. Nothing gets too boring, unless you enjoy action, and the story is very touching indeed. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alvin Straight--old, stubborn, and in failing health, decides one day to visit his brother with whom he has been estranged for ten years. Problem is, all practical means of transportation seemed closed to Alvin, so he sets out on the 350-mile journey from Iowa to Wisconsin on his riding lawn mower. Straight, played by Richard Farnsworth who received an Oscar nomination and deservedly so, is stoic and quiet on his journey. He has a lifetime of wisdom, but dispenses it sparingly and without judgment to the locals he meets on his way.Director David Lynch who made a name for himself studying oddball characters in everything from ERASERHEAD to BLUE VELVET and TWIN PEAKS captures Straight's story with just the right touch. In a refreshing departure from his normal style of film making, Lynch finally tells a story without raising the quirkiness level of everyone in the movie to irritating levels. As I watched Alvin go on his journey, the fact that his is on a lawn mower didn't faze me for very long. This film encompasses many big issues---aging, family ties, regrets of the past, and deeply buried secrets, but works them in an unobstructed simple manner.Shot beautifully in the cornfields of the Midwest, Lynch uses the grandness of the land to seemingly contrast how all of us have very small lives in the grand scheme of life's major struggles. Just when it was looking as if Lynch could never reel himself in, he gives us a beautiful film about the quiet dignity of an old man, and for one day anyway Lynch is forgiven for his bombastic prior contributions to American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A moving, bittersweet film from David Lynch. Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek are terrific in this emotional comedy/drama that portrays the situation I believe everyone faces later in life: How to deal with the past, recent and distant, and how to make amends.I can't say enough about Farnsworth in this role. His facial expressions and tone convey almost as much as his words, and he nicely balances the comedic and dramatic aspects of the narrative, particularly when he embarks on his trip. The scene where he has a beer with a new friend about his age is particularly moving, as the stories and memories they share have been in the news the past few years but never discussed in this fashion.Of note also are the scenes near the film's conclusion, when he visits with some very kind people while waiting for repairs. Without going into detail, I found them to be an almost melancholy commentary on our society, as we realize that there aren't many neighborhoods or people who are like this anymore. The film's final scene is very well done, as the veteran actors "show their stuff."All in, a memorable viewing experience that is recommended. An "8."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Straight Story' is to David Lynch what 'M. Butterfly' was to David Cronenberg: a showcase of talent. Both directors are acclaimed, but some just love them for the way those movies are special. Movies like 'Straight' or 'Butterfly' show you what is left of these directors when all the special bits are filtered out. Nevertheless these are movies which are unmistakably made by these directors. In this case, you can see David Lynch in the slow pace of the movie. 'The Straight Story' is a movie you can take your parents to. Afterwards you can say: "See, this is why I like David Lynch."

The acting was phenomenal and Richard Farnsworth should definitely win the oscar for his stunning portrayal of Alvin. He explored the themes of family and growing old so well, particularly in silence. He did the job so faultlessly that you could understand what was being said when nothing was being said. The score by Angelo Badalamenti contributed so much to the emotion of the story. I especially liked the 'road theme' which recurred throughout the film.

		<fullReview>Thank goodness for David Lynch, because no Hollywood studio would ever make this movie. I could imagine the reaction of a producer at a megastudio being pitched The Straight Story script: "Rural midwest setting? Old man driving cross-country through cornfields on a lawnmower? Are you completely meshugah???"The beauty of The Straight Story is that it is simultaneously pedestrian yet compelling. It works because it neither plays into nor overplays its material. It's a classic "real frog in the magic garden" story about an ordinary person dealing with extraordinary, but not outlandish, circumstances.Freddie Francis' gorgeous photography, Lynch's laid-back direction and Richard Farnsworth's fantastic treatment of Alvin Straight tell a compelling "less is more" Odyssey-style zen-filled tale. It's not light viewing -- there are no rapid intercuts or quick payoffs -- but bear with the low-key pacing, because this picture really earns its dramatic moments, unlike the oversentimentalized schmaltz of "Forrest Gump" or "The Cider House Rules".This movie, in a sense, is the antithesis of Fargo. Fargo and The Straight Story share the same setting, but unexpectedly, Lynch never devolves into treating rural midwesterners as sinister caricatures like one would expect based on his previous work. Neither does he nor do his writers, Roach &amp; Sweeney, fall into the trap of Disney-fying the story. The characters are portrayed realistically and three-dimensionally: flawed but basically good-hearted people.Finally, the ironic thing about this movie is that it would be completely unbelievable if it weren't based on a true story!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first film by David Lynch that I've seen, but back in 1990-91 I had a roommate who was devoted to "Twin Peaks," so I am somewhat familiar with his storytelling style and preoccupations. Those are visible here, but I guess that telling a true story reigned him in a little.My reasons for wanting to see the film were quite personal. I grew up in Chicago, but my father is from California, and when I was little we used to drive out there and back every summer to see relatives. We usually took Interstate 80, which goes through central Iowa. Those fields and that that endless sky are my landscape, and 'The Straight Story' captures them perfectly. If you think that the Midwest isn't beautiful, see this film.'The Straight Story' is not for young children, however; the fact that it received a G rating in the U.S., and the equivalent of same in several other countries, suggests once again that the values and priorities of the Motion Picture Association of America and its sister agencies are grossly misplaced. Consider: Alvin witnesses a road accident that is bound to be upsetting; some far from jolly wartime memories are discussed; and above all, Alvin smokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* * * * * (5 out of 5)The Straight StoryDirected by : David Lynch, 1999`Tenderness can be just as abstract as insanity´ - David LynchThe Straight Story is a movie with such a rare form of momentum and style, a methodical lyricism, that it is not only the result of a somewhat directorial restraint (this is Lynch after all), but of true, unabashed artistry and inspiration.In perfect rhythm - chugging along - Lynch takes us to the beautiful golden farm country of America's heartland as in Laurens, Iowa.We engage on a seductive journey (based on a true story), the journey of one Alvin Straight, an elderly man with bad hips but a positive approach to life, who decides to make ends meet with his brother. With whom he hasn't spoken to in years. The Straight Story touches and addresses human traits such as forgiveness, humility, success and love, without ever missing a beat. You are not laughing at the movie or because of a funny scene, but because you may have been there yourself. That kind of moviemaking is not a first at all, but seldomly is it this engaging, charming or rewarding. The movie rests nicely into its own, it glitters with a kind of self reliance and plausible charm, amidst the many organic characters and lush visuals. Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight is endlessly endearing, while Sissy Spacek is touchingly vulnerable as his daughter.The impeccable musical score - by famous Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti - a tender mix of violin, guitar and simple orchestration - is also a peak performance. Not only does it play to the movie's strengths, but adds texture and depth when not enhancing or enriching already mesmerizing visuals. When viewing this movie and as the ending draws closer, you may find yourself wondering just how exactly Lynch will round it up. Don't. Neither unwillingly celebrational nor inappropriately dark, Lynch brilliantly goes full circle : the mother lode unfolds in a fashion that I doubt any one who would have deemed otherwise.A riveting journey; one of pure and vibrant human poetry. A classic in every sense of the word, The Straight Story is an absorbing and atmospheric masterpiece. A true heartwarmer.Note : kudos for going against hindering odds : based on a true story and also produced by Disney. Normally a dangerous cocktail. However, David Lynch and his superb cast pull it off : Alvin wins you over immediately and the Disney shadow? You never even think about that for a second. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love almost everything about this film. It is funny, beautifully acted, has wonderful cinematography,and a fine score. There are scenes in this movie that could only have emerged from Lynch's deranged, but tender, sensibility: the "deer Lady', the scene where Farnsworth haggles with the twin lawn-mower repair men, "whats the number for 911", to name only a few. However, the revelation of this film is Richard Farnsworths beautiful, exquisitely modulated performance. He says more things with a single glance of his eyes than many other actors can say with a hundred words. Perhaps the greatest scene in the film is his conversation with his fellow veteran, when he tells the truth about the episode in World War two which made him an alcoholic. In short, this is an exquisite, deeply humane film,. those who complain that "nothing happens in it', should give up on reviewing films and turn to reviewing video games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual poem from Blue Velvet creator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Straight Story has the look and feel of a foreign film, and I mean this as a compliment. It's a very simple story of an independent old man from the Midwest, who decides that he's going to set out to visit his estranged brother. Richard Farnsworth plays the old man, too blind to drive and too independent to rely on Greyhound, and he should be rewarded with an Oscar nomination. In one sense it's hard to believe that this G rated film is created by the same director that brought us Blue Velvet, but look again. The film itself has David Lynch's trademark style and sound, and he obviously loves to take on small Midwestern Americana. It has a lyrical quality about it that held my interest throughout, occasionally bring dampness to the eyes with Farnsworth's homespun wisdom and stories. This will play well on the small screen when it comes to video. I'm definitely planning to add it to my personal collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond the contents of the film, the most interesting thing is, that it is a David Lynch movie. There are questions: Have we seen here his future as a film maker? Did the message of "The Straight Story" already appear on the underground of his earlier work? Did he become schizophrenic? I've heard, that his wife urged him to use a material, that she had found in a newspaper, as a screen-play. At least a likable trait. But my prophecy is, that the friendly spirit of this movie will take influence later on... We'll see! I can understand the people, who found fault with the film's slowness. That's not my point. I had some difficulties with the episode structure, because not every episode is (can be) as strong as the war veteran talk in the middle of the film. The scenes in the biker camp, for example, have no urgency. I am old, you are young, o.k., and what else? At the other hand, it works, that this wise old man uses to speak in "sentences" (I can't say it in English, in German it's "Sinnsprueche" or "Sentenzen", "Schiller-Sprache"). He is our teacher for life, and the spectator submits willingly to the role as his student. The acting is superb, but Sissy Spacek is spectacular. For her autistic Rose I give thousands of Dustin Hoffmans. Ambivalent is the effect of the Badalamenti-music, in the road-movie-scenes ist fantastic, in the emotional moments (the campfire-scene with the pregnant runaway) it is unfortunately sentimental rubbish. What a distance to the true emotionality and the loving spirit between the moved brothers at the end of the film!... It's a good Seven for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to go and see this film, I was wondering if Lynch would put in any of his trademarks 'weirdness' at the beginning or end of the film, like he did with 'The Elephant Man', and practically the whole of 'Eraserhead', and when I saw that he didn't, I knew that this was going to be quite a refreshing movie.I loved the bit where Lynch shows Rose looking out the window near the start at the ball rolling across on the road, with the child following shortly, then later on when we find out about her past experience with children we're given the shot of the ball rolling across again. Brilliant. I also liked the way Lynch didn't push it over the top with emotion at the end when Alvin finally got to see Lyle. He said he was going to see Lyle, and he did. No boo-hooing or 'I'm sorry, I'm sooo sorry!'.Farnsworth puts in a well suited performance as Alvin, pulling off the humour of the story with great style, as well as the more sincere parts of the film. I'm wondering why it was only on in just about one cinema in the whole of Northern Ireland. Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, economical and hearfelt movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great keys to telling a great story on film lies in not what is said and done, but often what isn't. The Straight Story is exactly that: a story about sticking to the essentials of story telling and leaving out anything extra. It is so promising that this film was made even at all. All too often, Film makers treat their audiences like idiots and feel that every motivation, thought and reaction must be dictated through rapid editing, snappy one-liners, super stunts and CGI effects all set to a blaring soundtrack. The Straight Story is a movie about quiet truths and requires the audience to fill in the blanks. Fine case in point: in the film, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) listens to a woman vent about running over deer. As she screeches off in her compact car, Alvin simply stares down at the deer. Usually, the filmmaker will insist upon some quick quip that comments on the action and the character, but not here. We simply move on to see Straight cooking a piece of venison over a campfire while being stared at by deer molded lawn sculpture. There are many other sequences just like that in this rich film. Sissy Spacek, Richard Farnsworth and the rest of the cast give fully fleshed out and three dimensional characters. The film is quietly moving without the slightest hint of sentimental seasoning. Thank you David Lynch for creating a genuine work of American Film Art. A 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story marks a very important landmark in David Lynch's film career, a very welcome changing point, in my opinion. Lynch has finally broken free from his post - modern shell in which he has been locked up and what we get is an explosion of humanity, in story and (for the first time) in visuals. The Straight story is a love declaration between Lynch and America. There are no negative characters, from the priest to the redneck, they all get a fair, compassionate, treatment. There's no trace of cynicism in the somewhat off beat characters (no cynicism? in the 90's? can that be?). Its nice to see that on the dawn of the new millennium there are still some frank, feeling people in the movie industry. It has been a long time since I've seen the audience stand up in the theater and applaud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story is the best film of 1999, a truly oustanding achievement in Performance, Photography, Writing, and Directing. Like visual poetry, Lynch draws you into the world of Alvin Straight, a man not much unlike himself, recklessly determined to do things his way despite the comments of others. This film is a statement of the will of the individual despite age and the importance of family. This film is one of the most heartfelt, sincere works of cinema I have ever seen, beautifully and meticulously crafted from begining to end. Gorgeous color cinematography by Freddie Francis, score by Angelo Badalamenti, this film looked beautiful projected in the Lumiere at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, where it should have won the Palm D'Or. Hopefully Lynch, Farnsworth, Francis, and Badalamenti will get well deserved oscar nominations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch meets A Trip to Bountiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying that The Straight Story is a film by David Lynch, even though it might seem far removed from anything Lynch would ever create. The Straight Story is about a 73 year old man facing the fact that he is not immortal and that death could very well be upon him. As the story opens, he is found lying on his kitchen floor. He has been there for hours because he had fallen and there was no one to help him up. He visits his doctor who warns him that his unhealthy lifestyle has caught up with him and that if he doesn't shape up soon things are only going to get worse. And then, the final blow, a message about his brother, who he hasn't spoken with for several years, comes in, telling him that the man had a stroke. Richard Farnsworth plays title character, Alvin Straight. He creates a stir in the small town he lives in when he decides to go an visit his brother who lives almost 300 miles away. With no bus access, and with Alvin unable to drive a car (poor eyesight) he hitches a trailer up to his lawn mower and begins a trek across two states. Sissy Spacek plays his daughter Rose. While she seems to be burdened with a mental handicap, she is his caretaker and knows him better than anyone. Yet despite her feelings about his trip, she is not able to stop him.The Straight Story is filled with David Lynch's creativity as a director. As usual, Lynch captures the essence of small town living, highlighting the quirkiness of seemingly normal circumstances.The only Lynch trademark that is missing from this film (and I can't say that I necessarily missed it) was that element of danger he brings to his films. Here is a story about a man meeting people as he travels the back roads of Iowa. There is no violence and nothing to be afraid of. The Straight Story is very funny and at times had me laughing out loud. But at the same time, there are several heart wrenching moments, as Alvin reveals some of the pain that he has experienced in his life. Richard Farnsworth has been the second banana throughout his career. His performance in this film had me wondering, "Where has this guy been all this time?" Certainly Farnsworth is Oscar-bound with this role.Anyone going through a mid life crisis might find The Straight Story to be an interesting experience. In one scene a cyclist asks Alvin "What is the worst thing about getting old?" Alvin replies, "Remembering when you were young."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, charming and deeply touching picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Straight Story begins with a view of the night sky and many stars, and then a dazzling sweeping shot of the vast corn fields of the Mid West. The story is about a seventy-three-year-old stubborn but likable man, Alvin Straight, played charmingly by Richard Farnsworth, who at least deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance. Alvin's brother, Lyle, has had a stroke in Wisconsin, and Alvin decides it is his duty to travel from his home in Iowa and see him for the first time in ten years. But the problem is Alvin does not have a driving licence and his eyes are bad and so is his hip. So he decides the solution is to drive his lawnmower along with his trailer. The first attempt is doomed when the lawnmower expires and fails him. Alvin then shoots it with his gun to get some satisfaction. He then buys a 1966 green John Deere tractor which is more reliable. The journey is slow as you would expect, but is enlivened by the people Alvin meets, including a pregnant runaway girl, a lady driver who knocks down a deer, some bickering twin mechanics and a former World War Two soldier. The scene in which Alvin describes an incident to him he had in France in the war is very moving. There is another scene where Alvin is slowly moving along and is passed by a huge speeding truck which blows his hat off, as if it is a sign of the modern scramble to go faster and quicker, where as Alvin is content to travel at his own pace and still get to his destination eventually like the good old days. After a scrape descending a hill and meeting some other kind folks Alvin finally arrives in Wisconsin, and on the journey we are treated to wonderful cinematography from Freddie Francis, beautiful sound and music as always from Lynch's regular composer, Angelo Badalamenti, and a humble and delightful central performance. A very charming picture and an absolute pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson in directorial restraint and methodical lyricism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Farnsworth gives a straight-ahead performance as Alvin Straight, 73 years old, grizzled, proud, stubborn, yet gentled by his long life. To describe Farnsworth's performance is to describe the movie itself: ruggedly golden, deliberately paced, methodical, focused, and deeply touching. Straight learns that his brother Lyle, with whom he hasn't spoken in 10 years, has been hit with a stroke, and after some thought determines to go see Lyle again. Hampered by bad eyes, Alvin cannot drive, and he is too proud and reticent to take a bus or receive a ride. His conclusion: to drive his old riding lawnmower to Lyle, more than 300 miles away in Mount Zion, Wisconsin. His journey takes a steady six weeks, and director David Lynch slowly paints his movie while Farnsworth slowly reveals Alvin's past, his family's history, his mistakes, his life philosophies.This movie never begs you to empathize, to shudder, to smile, or to sob; you cannot help yourself. Lynch has made a marvel: a movie that is undeniably human yet completely inoffensive. Like the simple rows of Iowa wheat, the steady lines of the combines, the pulsing whirr of the blades, "The Straight Story" slowly guides us to a bountiful harvest of forgiveness, humility, and love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This truly is one of the most honest, emotional movies of today. As Alvin Straight makes the trek to find his brother, he exudes good will and this is reciprocated by those around him. The screenplay and acting was mostly impeccable. It was in general so good,in fact, that I would forget I was watching a movie until, occasionally, a not-so-perfect line would disrupt the flow for a brief moment. In any other movie, such a line would go unnoticed. Farnsworth, playing the 72 year-old, gave the performance of the year, here. On the other hand, I'm sure Sissy Spacek could've given an equally effective performance without being so irritating.All in all, one of the best character-driven films I've ever seen, along with Stand By Me and Show Me Love. If you're one who grew up with attention deficit disorder, and can't concentrate on a movie unless it's an endless array of gratuitous sex and violence, then no, you might not like this movie. But if you've ever been enthralled by the stories your grandfather tells you in front of a fire, then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story of Alvin Straight, a 73-year old man who traveled six weeks on a lawnmower to visit his ailing brother. A G-rated film by David Lynch, you say? Indeed. Lynch's style, including some long, disturbing shots, really amps up the tension in this film. I kept expecting some ear-slicing psychopath to show up in a Cadillac, but it never happened. The film is more G-rated than "2001" is, but it ain't for the kiddies, either.This is a really fun and touching film. After seeing it, I felt like going on a walk down a deserted highway myself, just taking in the world one step at a time. Alvin meets an interesting assortment of characters along the way, some whom he helps and some who help him. Sissy Spacek plays his mentally disabled adult daughter, the most Lynchian character in the movie. And does a bang-up job, I might add.It's refreshing to watch a simple movie where you're rooting for the guy to get his lawnmower into that barn by the side of the road before the rain starts. And lots of (to help you feel like you've been on a lawnmower for a few weeks) sweeping shots of beautiful farmland that make you want to move to Iowa and drive a tractor. If it's in your neighborhood, definitely take an evening or afternoon and go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that while appreciation of David Lynch films is largely an adolescent phase, I still enjoy watching them now and again. What I like most are the elements that betray immature fantasy - the Surrealism, the hysterical perversity, the childish darkness, the shallow enigma. So while the idea of a 'straight' David Lynch film intrigued me (THE ELEPHANT MAN, for all its 'quality', was still about a man with the head of an elephant), every shot of THE STRAIGHT STORY was imbued with a foreboding of strangeness. I don't think the film is as folksy and gentle as people make out, but it is oddly reactionary and sterile - there is no growth in character - everyone begins nice and ends nice; there is no idea of the journey narrative as moral progression; there is no tension or conflict in Alvin's aims and ultimate result.The film is a feast of pleasures, and for that should not be missed. The opening sequence is sheer Lynch genius - beautiful, methodical establishing and long shots, setting the scene. We've seen pretty openings like this in BLUE VELVET, and the sickly sweet lullaby score recalls TWIN PEAKS, so we expect this idyll to be destroyed. The style is distanced and foreboding, as the camera's god's eye creeps fearfully forward and the music stops. Alvin's neighbour seems like a typical Lynch caricature, fat and blowsy, sunbathing and stuffing her face. The sound we expect comes; it is a horrible thumping sound, possibly a muffled gunshot. When we find out that Alvin has only slipped and can't get up, this defeating of real darkness with whimsy sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Also masterly are the bursts of real pain in the film, even if the emphasis on telling rather than showing is disappointing in so visual a director as Lynch. The relationship between Alvin and his daughter tends initially to cornball movie-of-the-week, until a moving, yet slightly odd, shot, shows her watching a bouncing ball outside her window, followed by its owner, a little boy. We might conclude that she has been a spinster, even a virgin, all her life, never emerging from the shadow of her father, a suggestion strengthened by all the bird-houses (traditional images of female captivity)she makes. The truth is even more numbingly shocking than this.Alvin's final admisssion of his long-exorcised demons, the horrific blunder during the War, the hard drinking to forget after, the intimation of domestic violence, the never-explained rupture with his brother - all these have a jolting emotional power because of the whimsical framework that surrounds them. They also make slightly less queasy scenes such as those with the pregnant teenager, or the priest, which are either so hicksy conservative as to be offensive, or so ironic as to betray or make redundant the rest of the film. One brilliant scene features Alvin's talking with cocky young cyclists - his melancholy ruminations on death and the transience of youth cast a dark shadow over their greedy, bouyant hope.The other pleasures lie in character and image. Although EVERYone is unbelievably decent, caring and concerned (except for Alvin's hilariously saturnine, walrus-moustached friend), they are blessed with sufficient quirks to entertain. The delightful scene with the twin mechanics is like something out of Lewis Carroll.As for the film's visuals, Lynch's eye has not deserted him. There is one extraordinary scene early on, when Alvin and his daughter sit in the dark living room to watch, like a film, a lightening storm. This is a scene of tremendous emotional revelation, as well as vivid visual excitement. The way Lynch frequently ignores Alvin's journey to concentrate on the autumnal bounty of Mid-West agriculture is sublime, and verges on the abstract. And yet there is an unusual solidity to the film, as if Lynch had to remain faithful to Richard Farnsworth's honesty by recording every concrete detail of this seemingly insignificant man's life.Still, for all these, and many other good things, the film seems oddly pointless. Alvin is far too wise and almost saintly to convince as a character. His journey is either meaningless, or so obvious in it meaning (he certainly talks about it often enough) as to be redundant. The final sequence reaches for a manly, understated emotional power it only retains because of the rare presence of the great Harry Dean Stanton. STRAIGHT is frequently hilarious, always beautiful in its evocation of a timeless, sun-dusted world, but it just seems, to me, too easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sweet sustained moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I see that other commenters have mentioned various scenes, I wish to compel those who collect sweet moments to watch this dear movie. We all know that the most delicious moments in our lives, if we have the sense to savor them, are small and perfect. The first time I attended this movie I went for David Lynch's talents and was moved completely by the cinematography.The second time I saw the movie was to collect the sweet moments that the dear old guy in the film recognized and savored. His road trip satisfied him down to his toes, every silly mile he putt putted down the highways. His moments also included his ability to take stock of difficult memories of his past, and extract perfect understanding of the human condition. I liked &gt; his brief wise stories that left new enlightenment in each person he came in contact with. They were told in a self-deprecating crusty way, as old guys (we hope) are wont to do, but everyone who had contact with him was somehow enriched. Words were spare, though, in this precious movie, and I'll see it again in a heartbeat if any theatres ever take a chance</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply, The Straight Story is a beautiful movie. From David Lynch's magnificent cinematography to Alvin Straight to the wonderful characters he encounters on the road, The Straight Story conveys beauty in a way I have yet to see in a movie. At its core, The Straight Story expresses a fondness for patience that is truly powerful. Take the time to soak up the beautiful moments when they occur, take the time to remember the good things in life instead of focusing on the bad. While certainly sentimental and optimistic, Lynch's willingness to find the good in people is powerful because it is so genuine. And moreover, its refreshing.As a word of advice, some people may grow weary of scene after scene of Iowa landscape and little dialogue. These people may find The Straight Story tedious and without beauty. If you are simply unwilling to take the time to appreciate life's good offerings and lack the patience to bask in its beauty, then you will not enjoy this movie. Perhaps that is the ultimate irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, as others have said, do not go to see this movie if you are looking for action. The pace is veerryy slow - but this is a good thing in this case. You feel like this is real life, real people. I was thinking "oh no, is the whole movie going to be like this?" after the first sequence, but you settle in to the story and the contemplative, lyrical mood. The crowd I saw this with was mainly older, and they seemed to love it - many sniffles could be heard, and everyone stayed rooted in their seats at the end, obviously moved. So do consider taking your parents to this - its a family movie in all senses.The screenplay is very fine, and its so nice to see average Americans portrayed with respect and dignity - it kind of makes you think how often Hollywood is guilty of distorting reality for cheap effects.David Lynch regains his form here, reminding us of what a beautifully sensitive director he can be (i.e. "The Elephant Man"). But I think his true masterstroke was hiring Richard Farnsworth. What a presence this gentleman has, and how he inhabits this role! If there is any justice, his will be one of several oscar nominations this film gets, and hopefully more people will go to see it when awards season gets here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story is so rich and thoughtful that it resonates for days afterward. It is so refreshing to see a movie that is character-driven. I have seen many comments which regard it as "slow-paced," but these must be folks who are accustomed to movies in which the action drives the characters. "Slow" is the last word I'd use to describe this film, which is so emotionally generous and exciting. Lynch blends in the vastness of midwestern American landscapes with the purity that they deserve. Richard Farnsworth speaks volumes with every wrinkle in his face, and emotions come across clearly with or without dialogue. His performance is one which breathed over me and reminded me how delicate and entrancing the art of acting can be. His every gesture and expression was a treasure to witness. The Academy should be fined for not rewarding him best actor this year...the same goes for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old Geezer on a Lawnmower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Straight Story" could be dismissed as a far fetched odyssey about a stubborn old hick trying to drive his riding lawnmower and an attached trailer across middle America. But that would be too easy and understanding Alvin Straight isn't going to be easy. We wonder and we wonder throughout the film why anyone would travel over five weeks under such an unorthodox mode to see his stricken brother. Not that Alvin is a spry old man either for he has poor eyesight and two bad hips. It is only at the end that the true beauty of "The Straight Story" unfolds and then we are left with a warm and heartfelt feeling about an old man and about the goodness of a people who have always existed. You see, the basic character of America doesn't exist in money-grabbing, violent, in-your-face aberrations that comes across daily in our entertainment venues. It still resides in everyday strangers who want to treat others as they would want to be treated. "The Straight Story" could be labeled as homespun and out of touch. Yet there is something inherently right about showing a runaway teenager that the strength of a family is like a bundle of twigs, about two war veterans who could commensurate over their shared war traumas, about young athletes who could never understanding aging until an old man brings it down to earth for them, and about quarreling brothers who are made to see that love is stronger than anything that would break them apart. This film is beautifully acted from the indomitable Richard Farnsworth, the cameo by Harry Dean Stanton, and the superlative rendition of the disabled daughter by Sissy Spacek. If I had a quarrel, it would be the gratuitous smoking (why does everyone have to light up?) that takes place and the crass commercials for John Deere tractors, Ace Hardware, and finally the word for word endorsement for Miller Lite. "The Straight Story" refers not only to Alvin's tale but it tells us about who we are as American people and for that the filmmakers deserve no less than a standing ovation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie only comes around once in a while and it has finally happened again. Richard Farnsworth, in one of his greatest roles portrays Alvin Straight, who is a 73 year old man who drives his riding lawn mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to make peace with his ailing brother who he has not spoken to in ten years. The movie is directed perfectly by David Lynch and the cinematography makes you feel like you are in a Norman Rockwell painting. This movie should get the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. It is heads above the competition. This film manages to touch your soul and edify your mind like no other. In todays world of celluloid violence, noise, hatred, and obnoxious behavior, it is so redeeming to see a movie that touches upon the beauty of human life and learning the simple lesson that the most important, heroic, and noble quality we can achieve as a human being on this planet is to be a kind and gentle person. You cheat yourself if you don't watch this one. A GREAT MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

However, as I've always felt, he was a good storytellingdirector and I respect his vision in terms of digging into humanbeing itself in a deeper way of his own. As story goes, we become familiar with this main character, whois very old and disable to drive. Why, why, and why... It wasthe only given question and answer on the surface of the mainplot along with the character driven story, which is that hehears about his disconnected brother for years has had a strokeand hits the road to see him alone on his lawn mower with atrailer. It is a very simple and boring concept. People wouldthink that way if I tell this concept word by word. However,the main point wasn't there as you who saw this film already.I loved the cinematography as well, which added the the maincharacter's journey to the subtle point behind the scenes thatactually showed what he was going through. Personally, I have abrother far away and have to admit that it made me think aboutthe relationship between me and my brother, too. I would saythat the value of family is limitless and more than the meaningof being precious... I really loved the moment where the two brothers are sitting atthe porch without talking further than few words. No need tohear anything between them, but it's just there... That'sf</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bundles of sticks have had a good year in film. They made their debut as a scary harbinger of doom-to-come in the highly over-rated low-budget hit of all time, "The Blair Witch Project" earlier this summer.They play a just-as-ominous but much more subtle role in "The Straight Story," David Lynch's wonderful G- rated film based on a true-life story of 73 year old Alvin Straight who drove his riding mower across two states to visit his ailing brother.The Bundle of Sticks revives its role from the over-hyped "Blair Witch Project" in much the same way it appeared in that film, showing up one morning outside the protagonists' tent. Here though it is a symbol of strength and one that returns a wayward girl to her family instead of taking her further away."The Straight Story" is just that - quite the departure from the American master of the surreal.Shot with all the care and attention to detail we expect from Lynch, it is not without his trademark quirks. One sequence involving Alvin buying supplies for his journey features a Lynch favorite - the un-scripted buzzing fly that wanders into shot. Lynch - unlike most directors - instead of cutting the shot - leaves the fly in and even generously amps up the buzz just cause he can.But while his quirkiness defines his other films the "Straight Story" needs none of that heavy handedness. With the help of a few odd ball characters - watch for the double-pricing Olsen twins and the method acting of the Bundle of Sticks - Lynch has created a film that deserves at least four Oscar nominations come February. (Unless of course they develop a new category for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object which The Bundle would easily snap up.)As Alvin, played authentically by stuntman-turned-actor Richard Farnsworth, sets out on his near 6-week journey his story and the story of those he encounters unfolds with all the ease and pace of a road movie slowed to 5 miles per hour. The "bread basket of America" lends itself easily to picturesque setting suns, old timers milling about and combine harvesters gathering grain to create our daily bread.Lynch utilizes this natural canvas to moving effect. Alvin has his story to tell and Lynch tells it not in a spoonfed expositional way, but through little parables he delivers to those he encounters along his journey up and down the hills of Iowa. In a credit to Lynch and his team of editors and writers not one word is misplaced, not one sequence too long. (Lynch and John Roach get the writing credits.)There are moments of pure Lynch scattered throughout this heart-string-tugger that wouldn't be out of place in other Lynch visions; The long open highway and its screen dividing yellow line ("Lost Highway"). The sprinkler system that can't get itself to shoot higher than 6 inches while in the background a child chases his ball (the "Twin Peaks" TV series). And the plucky score by Angelo Badelamenti (everything good Lynch has ever directed.)But the "Straight Story" does something that all the other "men at a crossroads" films of late eschew; men can change - even old men - not by virtue of violence but by going against everyone's advice and simply taking that inertia and making a move. Even if it is at 5 miles per hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living in slow motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, the enfant terrible under America' s most popular Independent directors had the urge to slow down after closing the doors to the "Twin Peaks"- era with "Lost Highway". Although, none of his fans really should have been surprised of the fact that David Lynch' s newest movie is anything else than a tour de farce through the dark sides of life. After spending nearly a decade to explain to the public his philosophy on how evil spirits interfere with our lives and corrupt our emotions, Lynch proves that he still has the ability to tell a straight story. We can find all the elements for which he is admired by both - his critics and his supporters even in "The Straight Story", but this time they all serve a greater purpose - to tell a story about life we all can relate to on multiple levels. "The Straight Story" tells the simplistic true tale of a 73-year-old World War II veteran who despite his own physical disabilities drives almost 600 miles to reunite with his long hated brother who had a minor stroke.Alvin Straight isn't the most talkative guy. Throughout the whole movie we learn little about his motives, but we can guess - he fears that after all this years they haven' t even spoke a word on the phone with each other the time of forgiveness may just slip by. As he states himself, for him it is not only a matter of visiting an ill relative, it is a journey against his own pride. A way to use his natural stubbornness for a good cause. On his way he meets all the usual Lynchian characters like the "Deer Lady" who almost every day roadkills a deer in an almost deserted area. "Where did they come from?", she yells at Alvin who can not answer her question, but is certainly happy that he finally got some variety for dinner. Days later he will be confronted with to mechanic twins who - as almost everybody in this movie - speak in slow motion and act with such a gratitude as if they were messengers from a distant, mystical land. One of the men is wearing a big band-aid on his chin as if it would be part of his personal identity, and of course, the twins do everything else than look alike. That is Lynchs trademark - to present seemingly normal peoiple with disturbing, abnormal behavioral patterns. Lynch even manages it to employ his "Twin Peaks"- personnel (like Everett McGill as lawnmower seller Tom) in thoughtful cameo appearances. But none of the actors, not even the hilarious Sissy Spacek as mental disabled daughter Rose, can take anything away from the grace of Richard Farnsworth most impressing performance. It is his certainty which makes this movie so remarkable. And it his stoic reaction to these absurd people he meets which makes the movie both - so wise and funny. Lynch uses Straights real-life story as a metaphor for a life he and his previous movie characters are longing for. A life without violence. A life in peace. A quiet life. Still, even Alvin has to fight his demons - the ghosts of his World War II experiences, and their haunting images once had been the reason for his separation from his bother. Alvin' s journey is therefore also a kind of hope for salvation. This peaceful man wants simply make peace with his own past, and succeeds. Aiming for a simple, but nonetheless very meaningful goal Alvin doesn't compromise. Not even when his own vehicle dies shortly after leaving his hometown, much to the disapproval of his own friends. He never accept any favors, but instead offers his wisdom to everybody he meets. Like when he meets a confused pregnant teenager and brings her to her senses by telling a story about a simple game he used to play. Family, so his experience, is nothing else than a bundle of twigs.Lynch places heartwarming observations like this in context whenever he uses panoramic shots of endless wheat and corn fields. It is this land which produces men like Alvin Straight who do not need the hectic and sensual overkill of our modern age. Like his daughter Rose their life center around small things like lightning storms or the color of bird houses or riding a lawnmower. That' s why the camera takes it time to focuse on persons and action. That's why the dialogue fades sometimes into the distance. The picture itself, the actions and reactions are what count. Lynch' s movie might be painful to watch for those audiences who are used to fast-cut action flicks or sitcom humor. Still, in its own silent way, it is a precious masterpiece of Independent filmmaking, and a sure sign that the director hides a true human soul behind all of his preference for absurdity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film finally got to my area, after being in only 3 or 4 theaters in all of Southern California, since its opening.I loved it and think Richard Farnsworth is wonderful. I heard that they got him to unretire to be in this movie, and thank God they did. I can't imagine anyone else playing this part.About the only drawback is in the dialog taking place in the long shots. Some of it was very hard to hear and understand. A film like this should be expected to attract an older audience and if any of them have a hearing problem, this could be a major distraction.There was a large crowd in the theater with me today, (all ages) and they all seemed to enjoy it and applauded at the end. I wish we had more family pictures like this one. It shows that you really can enjoy a movie without the bad language or graphic sex. Good for you, David Lynch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story touched as no other film seen recently. Farnsworth's portrayal of the thoughtful and loving father, kind stranger on the road, and his stubborn streak all made me feel kinship with Alvin.Having traveled up to 400 miles on bike trips on highways and byways, I can vouch for the special flavor of the slow mode. The photography pleased me, especially when it lifted us up for the big picture of the beautiful countryside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story is a slow and deliberate like the journey taken by Alvin Straight to see his brother Lyle 600 miles away, who has had a stroke. They haven't spoken for 10 years but Alvin feels that he must get to his brother and reconcile their differences. His journey takes him 6 weeks, going through some of the most beautiful farm country in America's heartland. The cinamatography is simply stunning and the musical score is beautiful. On his trip, Alvin encounters some special folks who want to help him in his quest. He also touches lives himself, planting some of life's lessons learned for others to benefit from. Even though this film is rated G, it is NOT for youngsters or teens under 14. It is slow moving which fits with the long, slow journey, but it takes a certain degree of patience that few kids have. Richard Farnsworth is simply perfect as Alvin Straight. His daughter is played by Sissy Spacek who deserves a best supporting nomination come Oscar time. David Lynch can be very proud of this film. It is filled with characters we can love and take our time enjoying. If I had one thing I would have changed, it would be the casting of Harry Dean Stanton as Lyle, Alvin's brother. He looks far younger and completely different than Farnsworth. Also a scene with two lawn mower repair men brothers who seemed to over act a bit. But overall, The Straight Story is a heart warming experience that you will not soon forget. If it doesn't receive Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor, I will be very surprised. It is that good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, gentle film that, nevertheless, is indelibly a David Lynch movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Farnsworth, in an outstanding performance, plays Alvin Straight who is so determined to patch things up with his estranged brother (Harry Dean Stanton) he leaves his Iowa home and travels to Wisconsin on a riding lawn mower. This absurd situation must have appealed to Lynch's penchant for the bizarre, but Lynch plays it, well, straight. Basically a picaresque tale of Alvin's journey and the people he meets along the way and how he affects their lives. Most moving is a late night campfire chat with a pregnant runaway, a harrowing exchange of WWII horror stories, and the brief but poignant brotherly reunion. Lynch manages to make the material his own: odd industrial-noise sounds appear, twin brothers feud and even Everett McGill makes an appearance. Really a lovely film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A unique story, quirky characters, fine acting, isn't this what moviemaking is all about? Toss in a few vintage David Lynch moments and you have a surprisingly moving and effective film about one man's enDeereing journey to make peace with his ailing, elderly brother. Richard Farnsworth's face conveys more emotion in any one scene than most actors can generate in a whole movie. And Lynch does an excellent job of reflecting life and American values in the "great in-between." This is an understated small gem of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lynch has created a wonderfully elegaic and lyrical world out of the cornfields of Iowa. It is a part of America that is forgotten, struggling to keep its identity in a modern world, much like the main character. Certainly a welcome change from the blood and guts movies we're used to in the nineties. This is good evidence that you don't necessarily need violence or sex in a movie to make it poignant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Dean Stanton was a casting mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other reviewers have said most of what I would say about this movie, though I must dispute the Hallmark comparison -- this is 1,000 times more genuine than anything Hallmark ever did.What hasn't been mentioned is this movie's biggest flaw IMHO, the casting of Harry Dean Stanton as Alvin Straight's brother. The entire film has been journeying towards the meeting with Lyle Straight, so it really takes you aback when the person to shamble out of the shack is not "Lyle Straight", but actor Harry Dean Stanton. Stanton looks NOTHING like Richard Farnsworth -- he's dark and swarthy to Farnsworth's ruddy and snow-haired. Lyle also doesn't look anywhere near Alvin's age (though surprisingly Stanton was born only 6 years after Farnsworth, in 1926).Lynch loves to re-use a stable of actors, and since no other major roles use his favorite actors, perhaps he felt he needed to make up for it by casting Stanton. I think it was a major mistake, however, since it wrenches the viewer out of the world of the movie at the worst time. Just a theory, but I bet if Jack Nance (may he rest in peace) had still been alive, Lynch would have cast him as Lyle Straight. Nance appeared in all of Lynch's films until his death, and would have been able to pull off the role even better than Stanton, and had the advantage of looking MUCH more like Farnsworth. It's truly a shame he wasn't given that opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love David Lynch, and I was very excited about the prospect of this film. The idea of Lynch directing a film like this did not surprise me at all. Lynch has always had a streak of sentimentality to some degree or other in all of his films, he has always appreciated natural beauty, and certain of his sequences have always been painfully slow. So I thought he would be the perfect guy to make the story of Alvin Straight a moving and mystical experience. I was very disappointed.The first half hour of this film is relatively good, with typical Lynch dialogue, shots and characters. But once Alvin goes out on the road, the movie loses its focus. The characters the he meets and interacts with on the road simply don't add up to much. Their stories are not compellingly drawn and are often more then a little too sentimental. The very act of Alvin's journey is also not really very well realized either: it its worst moments you feel like Lynch and the editor were sitting around saying "well, I don't know what to do here, so let's throw in another cornfield, a cloudy sky, and a shot of the road." I'm left with the impression that Lynch worked well in setting up the journey--where he had a story and plot to work with--but lost his focus once the the journey began and the events and details that drive the film became much more subtle.One big mistake is these extensive helicopter shots flying over cornfields. I think this loses the perspective that Alvin experiences, that of being stuck going very slowly on the side of the road. They just lose the tone of the film. I also expected MORE coverage of the weather as it develops through the day, the small things Alvin sees as he makes his journey. You do get him looking at a storm once, but it mostly looks like a garden hose and a strobe light, and you don't get the sense of power and beauty that a real midwestern storm can display. The whole idea of this film is to slow down and take a careful look at natural things, and that just doesn't come across here. When Alvin tells some people that he's been on the road five weeks it's shocking, because you don't have a sense of the length of that journey at all. Alvin also refuses help on the way, saying he has to make this journey "his way." I like the idea of the very arduousness of the journey being part of his act of homage to his brother, but that idea is not reinforced enough, and ultimately the viewer is really left at quite a distance from Alvin and his psyche.Mostly I felt this film was filled with signifiers of things that SHOULD have been moving, but ultimately the connections, when there, had to be stretched and filled in by the viewer. This is obviously a very ambitious film, and a great idea for a film, but I'm afraid the thematic connections just were not made. I'd say the script needed to be revised twice more before filming even began. It's too bad, but I'll still look forward to what Lynch does next.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Raymond Chandler, the open road, old country music and John Cage: Uniquely American poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of film where I don't wanna say too much... Well, to quote the great American composer, artist and thinker John Cage, 'I am interested in forms that we can't discuss, but only experience.' The Straight Story has to be experienced and then felt, then talked about. One one level, it's about a man seeking a kind of spiritual and emotional redemption; to put things right. Which oddly enough, is a main theme of Paris, Texas, which Harry Dean Stanton starred in. Lynch surrounds Alvin Straight with lots of people going a lot faster than he is, while he himself prefers a slow and very deliberate pace. It's a very potent message: slow down and see how much more you can see, experience and perceive. A great change of pace for Lynch. When it premiered at Cannes I'd heard that if you missed the credits, there's no way you'd be able to tell that Lynch directed the film. Not true. The whole film is filled with great Lynchian moments and images. I knew I'd probably like The Straight Story, but halfway through I found myself deeply in love with the film's beautiful poetry. Sissy Spacek and Richard Farnsworth both give remarkable and moving performances. Farnsworth is the kind of great actor where he doesn't even need to speak because you only need to look at his face and you can read every thought. Like I said above, uniquely American poetry of the best kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Beautiful...really, it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made of the fact that the film was directed by David Lynch, the creator of such dark, subterranean fare as `Blue Velvet' and `Lost Highway'. I've heard it said that it's hard to believe that he made this film. Hogwash, says I. From its opening images of patterns of fields being mowed to the isolated shots of a small Americana town and a factory building puffing up smoke in the background, we know we are in Lynchian territory, which captures something special the way a photograph or a painting can (and, not surprisingly, Lynch is prolific at both).A large woman on a small chair sits out on her lawn sunning herself. She goes inside, gets her cupcakes and potato chips, and sits back down in the chair, murmuring happy noises to herself. It's Lynchian, and somewhat grotesque, but it achieves what `Gummo' aspired to do at times: to capture the fact that life is beautiful and strange, filled with illusions ? but it *is* beautiful if you take the time to really look at it. (The hero appropriately moves at five miles an hour.)For my money, David Lynch makes some of the most *realistic* films ever made about the American experience. I often find that the films which tap into genuine and universal realism are often the most surreal, because it taps into something which can only be skimmed on the surface through naturalism.Lynch has always been a master at this, and here he achieves it through a poetic lyricism that has always been there in his work, only now it's the center.* * * * for The Straight Story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Classic! A Deceptively Simple, Unexpectedly Moving Triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly, one of the loveliest, most serene, most moving and honest films I've ever seen. Moving quietly, knowingly and sensitively forward for close to two hours to an ultimate payoff where little is spoken, but so much of everything is deeply, eloquently, silently said, the entire movie is a miracle of taste, intelligence and feeling. The quietness of David Lynch's directorial touches are breathtaking in their simplicity, so refreshing in an era of being hit over the head with "directorial pyrotechnics." The performance of Richard Farnsworth is sublime. With a combination of age, grace and talent, he inhabits the role with breathtaking perfection. Sissy Spacek, as his daughter, delivers an uncanny, true performance of a person who happens to have a speech impediment. She invests the character with a delicacy and truth both rare and refreshing.This is a movie like no other. Give all concerned highest honors for not condescending to the audience. And pile honor on honors, awards on awards for making a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't a stretch to compare it to TOKYO STORY and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE. Like them, and like the recent works of his colleague Martin Scorsese, THE STRAIGHT STORY is an elegy for a lost world. It's been attacked as the unveiling of the covert Reaganite side of David Lynch--but if John Ford rose from the dead and pulled out one more, would we be calling him a right-winger as well? Seventy-three-year-old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) makes a visit to his estranged and ailing brother--and his only means of transport is a four-mile-an-hour lawn mower. That's the extent of Lynchian oddity on display here; what takes its place is a cradling, legato rhythm, a brilliant score by Angelo Badalamenti, and collisions between Alvin and other Americans hiding a secret sadness. No epiphanies, no lessons and hugs--just genial, shyly understated brushes with grace.The fashion victim who made LOST HIGHWAY and WILD AT HEART is dead. His reincarnation seems to be a terribly sad (and prematurely aged) man. But the humanism behind Lynch's surreal visions is made clearer than it has been in twenty years: a supermarket conversation between two women using the word "braunschweiger" recalls Lynch's affection for a world no longer represented in television or movies. There isn't a single television set in THE STRAIGHT STORY; no one's on the Internet or playing CDs; nobody's T shirt advertises a product. The only hip joint in the movie is Alvin's broken one. A few coal-hearted souls may find it Hallmarkish; but the core of this tender and beautifully wrought movie is a nod of respect toward a vanishing form of human honor--not least the form practiced by its maker, who always tends to remind us (just when we forget) that he is one of our greatest movie artists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Zen road-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When David Lynch thinks he has to prove he's a great director, he makes a film like "A Straight Story": an old man traveling 500 miles on a lawn mower! This is indeed a Lynch film, even if a lot of those who thought EWS was slow won't take it. It is also a sort of Zen meditation on old age, death and the beauty of the universe. By the way, why should'nt we take pleasure in slowness? Where is it written that pleasure only comes from fastness? If you find TSS slow (and EWS as well) I guess you are the kind of people who anxiously look at their watch when they make love and think "My God, more than 30 seconds. it's so SLOW!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Speed 3" NOT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earlier this week I saw Eyes Wide Shut, and thought that film was quite slow, a thing I really liked about it. But then I saw this film; one of the slowest movies I ever saw! But what can you expect from a movie about a man taking a trip across a few US states on a lawnmower ( it's hard to imagine Jan de Bont making an exiting "Speed 3" about this subject). I really enjoyed the film, though at times it's a bit sentimental and a bit moralistic about "Great American Values". It starts off by giving you the impression this is another David Lynch film about small town America, and the dark secrets that are hidden under it's surface ( Blue Velvet, Twin Peeks), with the typical bright Lynch shots and broody Angelo Badelamenti music, but then takes a completely different turn to the story about one man and his lawnmower on a quest to pay his brother one last visit. The result is another Lynch roadmovie ( Wild at Heart), and probably the slowest roadmovie that was, and will ever be made. Lynch plays around a bit with the conventions of his own style. For example: do you remember the shots of the white lines on the asfalt that go by at a very high speed during the nocturnal ride in Dennis Hoppers car in Blue Velvet? The same shot returns in this film, by daylight, and at the speed of a lawnmower!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch is a director known for the weirdness of many of his films. After all, he's helmed "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet", "Dune" and "Twin Peaks"--all very weird films by anyone's standards. However, here he's made a film that is very different in tone from his other famous work--and I wouldn't have suspected he could make such a 'normal' film. Perhaps this is because unlike most of his work, he didn't write "The Straight Story"--just directed it. Regardless, it's an exceptional film--one that is really unlike anything else I've seen--and I have seen and reviewed A LOT of films.The film is based on a true story that occurred a few years before the film was made. Alvin Straight was a 73 year-old man whose brother suffered a stroke. Alvin did not have a driver's license, as he had poor vision and was in pretty poor health. So, in order to make it to his brother's home hundreds of miles away, Alvin rigged up a trailer onto his riding mower and set out on a journey that would take him well over a month!While the subject matter is pretty mundane and the story rather slow-going (mostly because Alvin Straight's journey was a very slow one), the film managed to be quite entertaining. The script was excellent, Lynch's direction lovely and Richard Farnsworth was terrific in the film as Alvin Straight. Overall, despite being such a simple story, it is a very special sort of film--one that folks who don't demand action and excitement will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He rides his John Deere slowly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old man sets off to visit his estranged brother and travels 500 miles with an old John Deere lawnmower. What a premise. But who's better in celebrating all things offbeat than the master of weird David Lynch? In the first part of the movie Lynch, like in Blue Velvet, celebrates his mysterious vision of American suburban life with the title character Alvin Straight and his daughter spending the days before his departure together. There is something otherworldly about the way the camera lingers on them and the amazing cinematography draws you into that romantic, yet slightly "off" world. In that sense it's a typical Lynch film, his trademarks are visible and it would be wrong to say, just because of the lack of violence and because there isn't that in-your-face weirdness were used to from his other films, that this film could have been directed by anyone.So Alvin Straight starts his journey, driving through the countryside meeting other people, some who are lost and some who give him shelter. With his good-hearted nature he eventually makes it to his brother and we finally understand why he refused to be taken there: He made that difficult journey to show his brother that he was important enough for him to make that difficult task. There's no final emotional conversation that resolves their troubled relationship. Just a nod to that old John Deere lawnmower is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch is amazing, even with Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an absolutely beautiful film. The helicopter pilot deserves his credit, as the aerial shots of the cornfields were as much a character of the film as any(one)(thing). The music by Angelo Badalementino was perfect -- not overstated, did not insult us by trying to make us feel any particular emotion. After I saw "Disney Studios" I was astounded to then read "David Lynch." But there was none of the usual Disney-kid-stuff in this film. It was signature Lynch all the way. The bizarre conversations, the (may be spoiler) scene on the road with the woman and the dead deer (reminiscent of a scene from "Wild at Heart"), the little nuggets of truth and beauty in snippets of dialogue. The opening shot with the lines of corn going first one direction, then another, followed by a honest-to-god Lynch small town.... And the interesting thing was the overwhelming number of old men. Lynch is, as of this date, only 65, so his observations about growing old are perhaps premature (though he has an extraordinary mind, certainly capable of leaps of intuitive comprehension). I must have ordered this film because it was David Lynch, but I honestly don't remember since it was on my list for so long. A terrific screenplay and superb directing. I was deeply moved when I wasn't chuckling inside; this brought tears more than once, and I am a pretty tough nut. This film is too slow for many viewers; but to me it was perfectly paced. Slow and mostly steady -- just like Alvin's trip with the 1966 John Deere mower. Without giving it too much thought, I'd say it was meant to be taking place in the 80's. Anyway, I hadn't read a thing about it, and still haven't -- this review comes straight from the heart of a life-time David Lynch fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So normal it's weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, confession time: I'm the guy who always drifts off during the middle of a movie. I love film, but I have the stunted attention span of my generation. (As proof, in the middle of writing that sentence I went off to check a website before returning.) And yet somehow, for The Straight Story -- two hours of a guy riding a lawn mower and encountering mild small town events along the way -- captivated me completely. Weird, huh? It gets weirder when you consider the guy at the helm is David Lynch, known for producing very strange surrealist films. Sure, there are some Lynchian themes and moments here -- the loving aerial shots of agricultural industry, the fascination with small town American, the woman who keeps hitting deer who seems to have wandered out of Twin Peaks -- but at root this is a naturalist film with a conventional, almost sentimental story arc.But I think this is what gives the movie its charm -- it settles for smallness and modesty, and maybe even presents that as glorious. After all, Alvin Straight's story is not so fantastic -- a journey only from state to state, suitable for the "Weird News" section but not a biopic. And yet there's a beauty to a lifetime of small moments, minor triumphs and tragedies, and The Straight Story really conveys them. More than anything this is a movie of age and survival, and of managing to bear strife with a smile.Which makes it sound a bit like a Hallmark movie but really, it's good. Don't be fooled by the boring description and box art -- this is a film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem of generation gap and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem of generation gap is as old as the hills and has its impact almost in every family. It has been brought to existence by the rapid industrial and cultural changes in the world after WWII. Many scientists started researching this phenomenon, and many terms such as Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials, describing people born in the years 1946-1964, 1965-1979, 1980-1995 respectively, appeared. Each and every generation shared its own values, goals, and ways of life, which produced the source of inability to understand each other across generations. Apart from the publications of many scientific papers touching upon generation gap and related to it the issue of aging, this phenomenon gave its theme also to many Hollywood productions. One of such productions is David Lynch's brilliant film The Straight Story. The Straight Story is based on true episode in the life of Alvin Straight, an elderly Iowa retiree who traveled three hundred miles on a lawn mower to reconcile with his brother, who had suffered a stroke. The film is filled with many small adventures and encounters that illustrate the issue of generation gap, as well as, the challenges and dilemmas of aging. Alvin's journey consists of series of encounters with a great variety of people that present different slices of those issues. He also manages to touch most of them with his wisdom, dignity and sense of determination in spite of his poor health. One of the persons he comes across is a runaway teenager. She stops at Alvin's fireplace, and he shares his supper with her. When she reveals the reasons of her escape, the old man's smart approach strikes the viewer. Instead of criticism, the runner away is told a story about a game that Alvin used to play with his children. In this game Alvin had given each of his children a stick and asked them to break it, which they easily did. However, when he asked them to join all sticks together and try it again, none of the children was able to complete this task. Then Alvin concluded to his children that those sticks are family. After the story they go sleep. In the morning Alvin realizes that the teenage left his camping and on the fireplace he notices a bunch of fastened sticks that viewers may interpret as the teenager coming back to her family. Throughout his journey we discover additional information about Alvin's life. Most of observations that we can draw from these facts concern aging. At one point, when he is invited by a group of cyclists to their camp, Alvin is asked a question: What is the worst thing about being old? Alvin replies that the worst thing about being old is remembering when you were young. When his lawn mower breaks in Clermont, Alvin befriends a local elder. They share tragic experience from WWII, and Alvin confesses that he accidentally killed the Polish scout who served in his military unit, and also how this event shaped his life. The viewer is presented with the character of Alvin's brother and their long lasting argument, which is the main reason for setting up his "pilgrimage" to his place in Mount Zion. He is determined to do it on his own terms, as it is the only way to obtain his peace of mind. Alvin is well aware that the time is passing and it might be the last chance to reconcile with his brother, Lyle. When after series of mishaps and adventures he eventually reaches his brother's house, the viewer is kept in suspension as Lyle does not reply simultaneously after his brother cry. Fortunately, after few seconds we can hear Lyle's voice, the two brothers reconcile, and we can finally feel relieved. Few films have examined the issues of aging and generation gap in such a simple, honest, but at the same time arresting way. The Straight Story moves slowly, which perfectly suits the theme of the movie. The cinematography, by Freddie Francis, is evocative, and features numerous shots of corn fields ready to be razed. Both story line and cinematography depict true images of the Autumn of a man's life. The images that will stay in the viewer's memory for a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big David lynch fan so didn't need much persuasion to watch this but while its not like most of his work if you're considering subject material, some of his favorite players like Everett Macgill (his last movie before he retired?), harry dean stanton showed up and the wonderful music by angelo badalamenti. And this is set in smalltown US and along the way of his journey in true Lynchesque style, Alvin Straight meets a number of interesting and diverse characters all with their own stories. What made this movie great though is this is a story about life and the experiences that ALvin can share with others. It was a remarkable acting performance from Richard Farnsworth and he deserved to be nominated for a best actor award, considering he was suffering from terminal cancer during filming, his performance is especially noteworthy. No silly schmaltzy endings here, this is a movie about life and hardship and it'll leave you thinking a long time after you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple and meditative, but genuinely moving with a lot of heart and a wonderful lead performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like David Lynch and his movies, my favourites being The Elephant Man, Mulholland Dr, Blue Velvet and this. I don't think I can add very much to the previous reviews that sum it up so nicely, but I'll do my best. The Straight Story is not a complex movie, the script is quite simple but it didn't need to be. Despite its simplicity, the script is also very moving and literate and you can tell a lot of heart went into shaping it. The film is also quite meditative in its pace, but again that didn't bother me at all, because as a quite reflective piece of work the meditative pace was deliberate. Besides, even if they were flaws, which I don't think they are if anything they are strengths in regards to The Straight Story, the film has a number of things to love about it. For one thing, the Straight Story is beautifully filmed with the cinematography fluid and the scenery spellbinding. The score adds to the film's poignant tones, in terms of direction The Straight Story is one of Lynch's best directed movies and the story while simple is beautifully told and surprisingly warm too. Also Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful lead performance, he genuinely moved me and I felt for his character too. In conclusion, a beautiful film and one of Lynch's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alvin Straight hasn't seen his brother in a long time. They had a falling out years ago. One day, after learning of his brother's stroke--and also the issue of his own mortality weighing on his mind--he decides to pay his sibling one last visit with the hope of healing old wounds. His brother lives six hours away (by car), across the Mississippi river, in Wisconsin. He doesn't have a driver's license due to poor vision, so he chooses as his mode of transportation a souped-up John Deere lawn mower attached to a 10-foot trailer to carry supplies. (It's never explained why he didn't just hop on a bus or ask one of his friends to drive him there, but I suppose the filmmakers wanted to avoid a literalistic approach for the sake of evoking a fairy-tale atmosphere.) The film is primarily about Alvin's odyssey over the highways of Iowa and Wisconsin and the people he meets along the way. Richard Farnsworth has a great face, and his every little gesture seems to come from a deep well of experience. This was his last performance, and it's a great one. Even though the subject matter veers away from Lynch's usual fare, their are still Lynchian touches throughout (e.g., the scene of Alvin trying to get the shopkeeper to sell him his "grabber," the woman sunbathing shot as if she's a museum piece). Beautiful score by Badalamenti.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple But Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quiet, lovely film based on the true story of an old man who wants to make peace with an estranged brother and sets off on a small odyssey to do so. His mode of transportation is his tractor, and the lesson the film delivers -- about taking the time to appreciate the individual moments that make up a life before the march of time has turned them into a blur -- may be the stuff of hokey sentiment, but as told here it's beautifully effective.David Lynch, of all people, directed this, a reminder that he's just as good at crafting linear, narrative storytelling as he is mind-bending surrealism. And Richard Farnsworth delivers a marvelous performance as the man who suspects that the errand he's embarked on may prove to be one of the last significant things he does with his life.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love. This film felt like a "blind date" gone bad. The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous. Everything in this film seemed wrong. Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about. This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated. The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose. Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame. Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale. She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes. I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors. Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth. Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally. Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time on screen. I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character. His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending. His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive ? I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor). The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant. I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film? There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' "Looking at America" class. I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film. Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn. There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about. I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film. He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for. I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way. Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well. Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature. Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story. I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met. I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture. I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just "played it safe". The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin. Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character? I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters. The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table. I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further. Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film. The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old. I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be! Grade: ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that will move you to tears!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was perhaps memorable because it was an odd story. An old man played by Richard Farnsworth travels to visit his sick estranged brother played by Harry Dean Stanton in rural America. Sissy Spacek has a small supporting role as Farnsworth's daughter who worries about him. The film is not action but character driven. You won't find vulgarity or sexual activity here. it's a family movie with a story about Alvin Straight based on his life. He is old, stubborn, but quite a remarkable determined man. Richard Farnsworth earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance as Best Actor. I wish he won because he deserved that award perhaps more than any other actor. His film credits alone are too numerous to mention. The story moves along at a slow pace enough to catch up with the character of Alvin Straight. I was kind of heartbroken by the ending and a bit confused. I'm like is that it for his story. Only time could have told for two brothers who grew apart. We don't know why they were estranged. But you have to think it's remarkable for a man to drive his lawnmower across the country just to reunite with his brother.</fullReview>

Why is so much notoriety given to Sissy Spacek when the only star of this wonderful story is Richard Farnsworth?????? It looks to me like they also cut the final scene. Why???? This is a wonderful rendition of a movie the like of which used to be offered when movies were the primary method of story telling.

		<fullReview>This was not expected from David Lynch. A rather straight, uneventful movie with no hallucinations (Twin Peaks), character-juggling (Mullholland Drive) or anything like that. The surprise in this movie is that it ties you right into the wonderful character of Alvin Straight and the people around him. Although perhaps an un-Lynchian movie, the themes and symbolism are definitely David Lynch. Those who are familiar with his work will enjoy digging up all the double and hidden meanings while people new to Lynch have a very good introduction to his way of thinking and directing. People are afraid that they may be bored to death when they read the plot. It is indeed not a movie for fans of action or even conventional drama. But anyone willing to see more behind The Straight Story will have a wonderful trip. This movie goes deep. Way deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch makes a family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is, simply put, the greatest film director ever to put body and soul together.He started off with the weird and disturbing, yet very artistic, "Eraserhead," which I won't even try to describe, went on to direct the incredibly stupendous, "Blue Velvet," which, in my jumble opinion, is the greatest feature film ever made, anytime, anywhere. It's a crime film, but to even say that, lowers it to the realm of stuff like "Pulp Fiction" (which was great in its own right, but it was no Blue Velvet). Don't watch any of these with your kids, though.It's true though, that David Lynch directed a horribly bad adaptation of "Dune." You could show this one to your kids, (if you don't mind boring them to death.) The problem with "Dune" wasn't really Lynch, though. It was the script and the fact that Lynch was way too faithful to it.He also directed the critically acclaimed (but nonetheless box-office failure) "The Elephant Man." A damnyankee good film. But don't see it with your kids.And OF COURSE, he directed (AT THE SAME TIME!) the greatest TV series ever made, "TWIN PEAKS!" AND the Wizard of Oz spoof movie, "Wild at Heart" with Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. But don't watch either one with your kids.Which (finally) leads me to my point. One David Lynch movie which you MUST see with your kids is THE STRAIGHT STORY. (A Walt Disney film, by the way.) David Lynch goes straight. Which is the first of the several thousand explanations of the title of the movie."The Straight Story" is, first and foremost, the story of a man -- Alvin Straight. A good man. An old man. A man, who some ten or twelve years prior, had some harsh words with his brother of about the same (advanced) age, a man (Alvin I'm still talking about) who scoffs at his doctor's advice to stop smoking and to eat right. Both brothers are now in ill health. In fact, brother Lyle has just suffered a stroke.Alvin receives the bad news about Lyle's stroke, and despite Alvin's and Lyle's harsh falling-out of several years ago, and at least partially because of both their frailty and mortality, now must see him. (I mean, hey, wouldn't you?) He kisses his daughter (played by the ever-incomparable Sissy Spacek) goodbye and since he is a diabetic and his eyesight is failing and he can't drive a car anymore, gets on his LAWNMOWER and commences to drive three hundred miles at just about five miles an hour to see his poor, old, sick, estranged brother.The rest (and the most) of the movie is his incredible and so, so moving journey to see brother Lyle.I won't tell you everything that happens, but watch out for the (dear) deer lady, she's IT! And I won't tell you about the ending, except to say it's just what it needs to be. It's not overdone or underdone. It is just what it needs to be.But Lynch, he is such a devil. He can't help but include, in his first and only Disney movie, subtle references to his other (way more grown-up) movies, particularly "Blue Velvet," (like the water hose flailing around, unmanned.) But see both and you'll know what I mean.I saw the first week it came to my city. The theater was PACKED. Mainly, I think, because of Richard Farnsworth, who played Alvin Straight. He got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for this movie.He was a big star back in the forties and fifties. A lot of old people came out to see him in what was his swan song. I never saw so many wheelchairs in a movie theater. But the front three rows in the theater were all kids, there to see the next Disney movie. A mix like that I never saw before. (And of course, Lynch fans like myself.)Finally.... David Lynch makes a movie that is not only an artistic success, but is actually popular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Powerful film, wonderfully acted by Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek ( all other parts are quite minor). Beautiful cinematography, although the camera exhibits a slight obsession to dwell on the physical ugliness and quirkiness of rural people (this is David Lynch directing! what else would one expect?) And the script is marvelous, with lines that I will remember and treasure all my life.Negatives? The pace of the plot. The story moves at the pace of a...well... of a lawnmower. While undoubtedly intentional, the glacial pace of the film will chase away a lot of viewership. And the plot is unambitious - a long film telling a short story very well. It is hard to rank this film as high as other films that tackled more ambitious stories (e.g., Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, even Minority Report). I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

The fertile fields, the down-to-earth, straightforward people, the lovely music all weave a tapestry. The trip takes on meaning for us as well as for Alvin. Each person he meets adds a dimension to the tale and become part of it.As the journey draws to a close, we are praying for Alvin and Lyle's reunion. We know what the meeting will mean to both of them because it has come to mean as much to us. Great movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great change of pace for director David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie expecting to see just some sappy, boring G-movie for kids, even though David Lynch directed it and was very surprised he kept the touches he used in his other films with the slow-moving camera shots, unusual sounds, quirky characterizations, and another lush music score by Angelo Badalameti (did I spell it right?). Despite its G rating, it's not a movie made for kids, with the material being adult. Richard Farnsworth should be nominated for best actor as a crusty, but thoroughly decent 75 year old man who drives a dilapidated John Deere riding mower to see his brother and to make up with their estranged relationship. Harry Dean Stanton has all to brief a role as his brother at the end. With the exception of Fargo, no movie has ever captured the beauty of the upper midwest of Iowa and Wisconsin, nor explored the typically decent common folk who inhabit it. Along with American Beauty, this is the best 1999 film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised and happy to find this movie at the top 250, along with Lynch's 'Elephant Man', I was half expecting Blue Velvet to be up there, but it wasn't. I guess it surprises me how many people reacted positively to such a slow and gentle Lynch, one whom I've never seen again after this, and one I hope is still out there somewhere. In between his surreal, dark, and often sadistic fantasies there is this side of him, somewhere, I now know it's there, and I hope he hasn't retired it yet. This movie never fails to move me, and each time I watch it it yields new surprises with it's colorful cast, haunting score and cinematography that is so stunning it jumps from the screen and manages somehow to evoke from the audience a feeling of actually being in these rural locations it captures. Richard Farnsworth performance here is.. well, it's beyond words. I hope that this film is what he will be remembered for because it is a testament to some of the best and most natural acting Lynch has ever extracted from a performer. Perfect in every way!</fullReview>

But after being subjected to Farnsworth (to be fair, he wasn't too objectionable), Spacek (she has always made me want to puke), and cast (forgettable) in this piece of claptrap, I have sworn off Lynch for life. The problem wasn't so much that the movie was boring--which it was--as that it was a bunch of Hollywood types patronizing the residents of middle America--ah, the salt of the earth! Small frame houses! Screen doors! John Deere caps! The geezers hanging out at the small-town café! Was there a friendly old waitress? Can't remember. But there almost certainly was.And to top it off there's the stuttering Spacek whose children got taken away from her by the big bad government and we're supposed to feel sorry for her and maybe even cry--boo hoo hoo!--because it's all so sad!Portraying small-town, middle-America life must be hard for the urban sophisticates who make movies. Even the best recent efforts--John Sayles's __Lone Star__, for example--struggle to get things just right. But __The Straight Story__ doesn't even seem to try. So there's no excuse for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute delight. From director David Lynch, The Straight Story finds the famous purveyor of the oblique on wonderfully mellow form. Story finds a superb Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight, an old boy long in the tooth who sets off across America on his lawn mower to visit his estranged brother. You see, he doesn't have a driving licence, so lawn mower is the viable form of transport.Lynch and writers John Roach &amp; Mary Sweeney have offered up a wry and astute observation of Americana. The journey Alvin takes involves him meeting a number of eccentrics and confused souls, which pitches Alvin as our conduit to a rich view of the life we have - or will - live. Culminating in a finale that rewards anyone with an intelligent soul. The message is clear.A beautiful film for the beautiful of heart. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simplicity is the utmost profound sometimes, and that is what you get in The Straight Story. A very simple story, straight to the point, no pun intended. A very deep story of humanity that we all can relate to. Very well acted all around, but extremely well acted by Richard Farnsworth as he received a well deserved Oscar Nomination for the lead in this film. I love the fact that David Lynch directed this film. Out of thousands of directors who love to make movies out of the bizarre and crazy, David Lynch is probably the only one who has had a successful and lucrative A- List Career at doing so. Lynch always has a specific style and story that he does which is usually a very odd and bizarre one which makes for a very odd and bizarre film. But The Straight Story is something completely different then anything Lynch has ever done. For one thing it's rated G, and it's a Disney Film. I don't think any of us Film Buffs would ever fathom we would be using Rated G, Disney Film and David Lynch in the same sentence in our lifetime. But The Straight Story truly shows what a gifted and talented director David Lynch is. It's just a shame Lynch doesn't go outside of his box more often. What I love about Steven Spielberg is about half the time you can tell it's a Spielberg film by the style of how it is made, but the other half of the time you can't tell Spielberg made the film. And I think sometimes a great director needs to switch it up from time to time and step outside their box and try new styles and stories, just try something different. So David Lynch tried a new style and something different with The Straight Story and it is absolutely a beautiful film. The cinematography is amazing, the pace is perfect for the story at hand, and that's all in thanks to the great directing job of Lynch. Very well edited as well, in thanks to Lynch as well as the other film editor/editors. A movie that one can watch over and over again. Also a film that can make one feel good about life and living again. Farnsworth delivers his lines with such simplicity, such humanity that they go deep in the viewers soul and the viewer will not soon forget certain lines that Farnsworth says in the film(as his character Alvin). A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been fascinated by David Lynch and his intriguing work in movies. He is way different from others but this movie is a real gem. The main character Alvin assures us that we can overcome our mistakes and take the correct decision. Another good thing about this movie is the nice way in which he is able to meet and get along with strangers. This may be considered a taboo but this is a nice way to meet new people and appreciate them. The performance of other characters is also nice and the way this movie has been shot is really captivating. It is a fact that even an unusual story in the hands of a capable Director can bring joy to anyone. It is an appropriate movie to catch on a weekend and feel great about life and its gifts.</fullReview>

Nothing is weird this time, no midgets or strange dream sequences, just a straight forward story of a man who decides to ride a lawn tractor from Iowa to Wisconsin to visit his terminally ill brother.Richard Farnsworth is magnificent as the old man who has lost his drivers license due to poor eyesight. He rides his John Deere in what is one of the most interesting road movies I've ever seen. Sissy Spacek is the old man's daughter and Lynch just lets her act, and she is great, as always.The trip is heartwarming and a very different entry from David Lynch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story is a beautiful film. Shot in the North-eastern part of the United States, it never missed any flavors available. I just didn't want the movie to be over. And beyond the beauty of the movie, the real beauty lies in the characters. It seems there are only good people in this world. Right from the loving father and daughter, the doctor, Alvin's friends and neighbors,the lawn mover seller, the bus driver, the women on the bus, the woman who hit the deer, the cycle riders, the family who recovers his lawn mover, the old man who buys him the beer, the mechanic brothers, the padre...everyone of them. I just wish if the world was like that.I'd like to mention a few incidents too. Alvin's friends though they ask him not to go never laughs at him when he returns with the broke carriage. They rather express their empathy. The woman hitting the deer gives the impression that she is upset for her car or time but it ain't. She says she loves deer. The family who receive Alvin want to drive him to his brother's and the scene where the husband tries to convince his wife about this is exceptional. Even that run away girl proved to be loving. And of course the great message that war is not fought between countries, not even between soldiers but between innocent men who just want to earn for their lively hood.And of course the cinematography was excellent and the scoring was sublime. Altogether a must watch especially if you don't get disheartened by the slow pace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The straight movie (dvd)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beware! The credits open with "Walt Disney Pictures present a David Lynch Film» and it's just surreal: having Lynch &amp; Disney together for a movie, it's like having night and day at the same time.But those credits help setting the movie: forget Lynch's previous unintelligible works, filled with sex, violence, twisted dreams and fantasy. Here's you get a straight story, a biopic without any effects or make-up. Stripped of all his trademark, is a naked Lynch still among the best filmmakers ever? Yes, totally because if all the dark side of Lynch is purged, there is only left his bright side.With a story that seems impossible to direct (a road movie with a lawnmower), that break all Hollywood clichés (about old age, no violence, no guns, no sex...), Lynch delivers a naturalistic tale, a movie that is an hymn to the nature and the wisdom of old age. The lateFarnsworth has a face that says it all: Death is coming, it's time to confess the heart and to save the essential, the family. At 79 years old, he will have master his craft until the end and it's really a SHAME that the best actor award went to Spacey (being selfish and keeping the Oscar for himself, i wish he will have a shorter career than Farnsworth!). Hence, is-it a sign that he dies shortly after the ceremony? The other great loser of the movie is Badalamenti who scored his best soundtrack here: simple, moving, haunting. Just imagine the movie without his music and you'll tear its heart (for the fun, the best music ward went to the "Violon Rouge" by John Corigliano, great composer, 4 soundtracks in his career, none since the Oscar, ever heard about him?).Lynch was very sincere to shoot the movie in the actual locations because you really understand what happened to this old brother and you can seen the landscape changing along the road.In conclusion, if I have the same fun watching the speedy highway strips of "Lost Highway" as watching the slow national strips of "the straight story", then you can be sure that the director is indeed a master!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight up, great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simple tale of old salt (Farnsworth) riding his John Deere mower across the USA to reconcile with his long-estranged and now dying brother (Stanton). No smoke and mirrors from director Lynch, a surprising departure from his eccentric and often confronting style, with a vivid, resonating performance from Farnsworth in his swansong.The score, scenery and especially the acting is first rate; Farnsworth's sad blue eyes speak volumes more than the need for dialogue and his interactions with the cast (that includes Sissy Spacek and chronically under-rated Everett MacGill in minor supporting roles) are only ever sporadic and brief. The sentimental favourite at the millennium Oscars, Farnsworth didn't win the prize, but instead left this wonderful tome as his film epitaph - a bittersweet footnote and legacy to this humble story.If, as a Lynch fan, you were expecting shock and awe, or just prefer watching films where things blow up, then you've come to the wrong place. If you're content to recline for a while and simply absorb the experience, then you should be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) lives in Lauren, IA, with one if his daughters, a Rosie () who'd lost the custody of 3 of her 4 sons, due to her mental illness. 73-year-old Alvin, with very difficulties in standing or walking, he receives news of a tricky stroke that attacked his brother, Lyle, who he hadn't spoke to in a decade, after a fight. Alvin didn't want to leave his brother in those terms, so he felt the need to meet him, the problem was he lived in Mount Zion, WI, and Alvin didn't have a driver license. So Alvin prepares his lawn-mower and starts his 390km trip in a 8km/h vehicle. He went anyway. The whole movie shows the many events that occurred in his long trip. Alvin Straight did in fact exist and also did this trip. Unfortunately died two years later and so did Richard Farnsworth. For them both I'll give a word of respect and applause. Alvin Straight, who's did we only understand from a 112 minute video but it's what it takes just to understand he had the most right notion of value. Richard Farnsworth, one of the late 20th century best actors whose roles shall not be forgotten. Although great deeds and great men provide great productions, the Straight Story is very simple but it doesn't lose any of its epic aspects. From this movie you will keep in mind his words. Deep, wise and meaningful. Obviously it ain't David Lynch's common job but it turns out quite an interesting movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes you need to slow down to notice what's important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the bizarre surreal films that David Lynch directed beforehand, The Straight Story was indeed his straight story. A movie whose narrative structure was straightforward and simple. Although, there's more to The Straight Story than there at first appears. On the one hand it's a tale of the true story of Alvin Straight who travelled hundreds of miles on a lawnmower to visit his ill brother; while on the other hand, it's a reflection on growing old. This latter part is emphasised in the encounters that Alvin has as he progresses along the way. The life-cycle is represented as he first meets a pregnant girl, then some cyclists in the flush of youth, next a middle-aged family, he then has an emotional encounter with a man the same age as him who also has similar tragic experiences and finally there is a night-time scene with a vicar in cemetery where the spectre of death and the possible afterlife is spoken of. So this deceptively simple tale is structured in such a way that it explores a lot more than immediately meets the eye.It's been said many times before but should really be said again that Richard Farnsworth is outstanding in the central role of Alvin. His performance is a master-class in subtle brilliance and must be one of the very rare occasions where an actor delivers the peak example of their skills at so an advanced an age. Cinematographer Freddie Francis photographs the wide expanses of the Midwest quite beautifully, while Angelo Badalamenti accompanies these visuals with a lovely warm soundtrack. Lynch himself, reigns in his usual directorial impulses to remain true to the material. There are still some Lynchian moments such as the encounter with the Deer Woman and some of the quirkier humour such as the grabber scene. But these parts fit in seamlessly to the whole, and in any case, Lynch has often shown a sweet side in even his darkest films, such as Blue Velvet; it's just that here with the sinister element entirely removed it seems so unusual.The Straight Story is really a magnificent film to be perfectly honest. It shows that it is entirely possible to make U certificate films for adults. It pulls off the very rare thing of having a film with no villainous characters at all, while remaining completely compelling throughout. It shows that sometimes by stripping a story down to its basic components and focusing entirely on good people it's possible to produce something that's outstanding and unpredictable. It shows that by slowing down to the speed of a lawnmower you can see details you might otherwise have missed. What David Lynch pulled off here is something quite incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best John Deere Commercial Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old man (Richard Farnsworth) makes a long journey by tractor to mend his relationship with an ill brother.Let me just say it up front. The worst part of this film is the character played by Sissy Spacek. Maybe we are supposed to feel pity for her stammering, but it was so obnoxious that it brought my enjoyment of the film down a few notches.I had never heard of this story before, and I am quite certain it is embellished, but it is interesting just the same. Would it really take five weeks to get from Iowa to Wisconsin? I would think it would be more like five days. I appreciate that (allegedly) they filmed in the actual locations, too. Not that the area is very interesting, but authenticity is nice. I have driven highway 18 many times and know the territory.There is a running joke in the movie about Wisconsin being a party state. Having lived here thirty years, I will neither confirm nor deny that. I also appreciate the inclusion of a pair called the Olsen Twins.Those used to David Lynch's weirder films (pretty much everything else he has done) may be surprised by how normal this one is. The premise is sort of strange, but the characters are rather mundane. There is no surrealism here, or even a strange lighting, angle or sound. If there is any hint that this is a Lynch film, I missed it. But that does not mean it is not good... just not what fans might expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of David Lynch. I am a fan of his surreal style, his 'moody' plot lines, his unexplainable mysteries. So being a fan of all that I knew I would see The Straight Story eventually (although it wasn't one of his that i was looking forward too much), but look at that. For all it's simplicity it is as powerful of a film that Lynch has ever done.I am so happy that Lynch is able to make a film like this. Before this, his most straight-forward film in terms of narrative was no doubt The Elephant Man. But even that film still has some really bleak and surreal imagery going on. Lynch has a really devoted fanbase, but I am sure many critics wouldn't have thought he would be able to direct a film like this. Lynch proves them wrong. He has a humanity and passion that runs throughout his films, and as much of a visceral and visual director that he is, he is also very much an actor's director. He has directed actors to incredible performances, like Watts in Mulholland Dr, Dern in Inland Empire, and Lee in Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me. Richard Farnsworth is completely captivating in his portrayal of Alvin. He invokes such deep emotions and gives perhaps one of the most nuanced and subtle performances I have ever seen. This doesn't feel theatrical in one bit. For the film's emotional pull I always wonder how much a film can get away with before becoming corny and overly-sentimental, but to my surprise The Straight Story never crossed that path. It's because Lynch isn't trying to make us feel with editing tricks, loud sad music, or corny sentimental dialogue. It is all in his direction and in the actor's faces. The entire cast is pretty great. They all have limited screen time but they all hit a deep spot in me. This is an incredible film, as great as a film of this nature could be. Heck, I didn't even think I was going to love it, but I did. It is one of Lynch's best films and stands out in his filmography, making it all that more special.</fullReview>

This movie is a journey we all will walk through in our lives but at our own term and at our own pace. For sure this movie will lay a guiding mile stone at every turn that we can look up to. A beautiful movie, a must watch saga.. It is nice to see Lynch take upon a subject so delicate yet so real and come up with an excellent story telling that holds the viewer from the very first scene.

		<fullReview>It has no complex script, it has no car crashes or explosions, no non-stop action, no CGI effects, not even a "name" cast, but what it does have is 'heart' and emotion. This is David Lynch's masterpiece! It has stunning cinematography of America's Midwest by Freddie Francis, a moving film score by Angelo Badalamenti and a cast at the top of their game. Richard Farnsworth is magnificent in a very understated performance and is fascinating to watch. Sissy Spacek is terrific as Rose the handicapped daughter, as is everyone else in the cast. The very simple story involves Alvin Straight (Farnsworth), a senior, who decides it is time to visit and make peace with his estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) who lives in Wisconsin, all the way across Iowa from Alvin's home town. He has no driver's license so he decides to make the journey on his riding lawn mower. The journey is tedious but Alvin is determined to see his brother. Lynch keeps the story rolling along at perfect pace and Farnsworth is a joy to watch. The most fascinating aspect of this story is that it's true. It occurred a few years before the film was made. Farnsworth was robbed of the Oscar, which went to Kevin Spacey for "American Beauty." Does anyone remember that film? If you've seen "Straight Story" you will never forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a David Lynch movie, this is the only one that has a beginning, middle and an end. It also makes sense even though it is a strange movie. It doesn't start off as being normal and then in the middle get all messed up and then not make any sense. This is actually a regular movie and it's about an old guy with a bad hip who misses his sick brother after years of separation and bitterness. So the old guy, Alvin, gets on his riding lawn mower and rides it clear across Iowa just to see his brother in Wisconsin. It is slow at times and makes me sleepy but it is a great movie. The whole time that Alvin is going along, he really thinks about his family. He meets a lot of people along the way too. I was glad that this movie was filmed in Iowa because it is exactly what Iowa looks like. From the small towns to the country side that is how I describe Iowa after living here all my life. It's a close knit feel good movie with cool music too. It's slow and relaxing for a slow Iowa Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A linear Lynch and a little great Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen much movies "on the road", but this is the most dramatic and the most simple, too. It represents something of extraordinary for the spectators (and I talk for audience and moviegoers), but even for the genial Lynch, the director of this movie, who doesn't usually make linear movies: he prefers to play with flashbacks and anticipations, and his filmography is an imposing demonstration of it. I think about Twin Peaks and my brain explodes if I remember the mental confusion which it has provoked in me XD. But this movie is different. Firstly, it's a true story. Alvin Straight, the protagonist whose surname becomes a brilliant pun with the plot so linear, had really traveled in 1994 for 240 miles on a 1966 John Deere Iawn mover like the movie told us. In fact, "The Straight Story" is dedicated to his memory, because he's died in 1996. After this, we have an excellent protagonist: Richard Farnsworth, in his last interpretation. He makes life to a Character whit the "big C", because he can show us all the longing which an old man who does a similar trip certainly had. Alvin Straight becomes in my opinion an American Dersu Uzala, or a Don Chisciotte who manifests us how nothing is impossible, and we can defeat our own windmill or slope (physical and moral). Any other character in this movie is treated with the greatest care for detail which only Lynch can use for them. In brief, a great movie whit great characters (in particular Farnsworth-Straight), a great director and a great, linear story, for think and for remember our own past (or future: it depends on age! ^^) and for put all old grudges against everybody aside. SEE HIM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playing It Straight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are considering buying/renting/watching "The Straight Story", you should know that people are not lying when they tell you that it is nothing but an old guy (played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to make a 300+ mile trip on his small riding lawnmower. He meets a lot of nice ordinary people, he dispenses a little sage advice, he reflects a little on his life, and nothing much happens to him. It is closely based on a real event that was newsworthy not because of what happened to Alvin Straight on his journey, but because of the human-interest angle of a guy making a journey in such a unique way.David Lynch does a nice job of directing this Disney production, but do not expect a lot of wild expressionistic developments.A lot of people really like this film and a lot of other people are asking, "why do people like this movie so much"? And they are the polite ones. Less polite ones are branding the film "manipulative" which seems like a strange criticism for a film. Aren't they supposed to be manipulative? Don't people watch films to be manipulated? If you insist on viewing "The Straight Story" and if you generally know what you are getting into, you should enjoy it. If you are looking for its deeper meanings I suggest that you watch it along with Monte Hellman's "Two Lane Blacktop". Both are road pictures and Alvin Straight's orientation as a young man was probably not much different than the driver (James Taylor) in that film. The difference is the stage of life in which the journey is being taken. Both have an intended destination. But for the driver in "Two Lane Blacktop" it is just a excuse to keep on the move, the highway stretches out endlessly before him and life is a journey not a destination. For Straight it is a single-minded trip that he views as his last chance to mend fences with his brother who has just had a serious stroke. It is very likely the last trip he will ever make but he does not savor the journey, he does not take satisfaction in overcoming obstacles, or even find much pleasure in his positive encounters with strangers. For him the destination is all important.This was Farnsworth's last picture, his health declining he committed suicide by gunshot a few months after the film's release. One can't help but speculate on whether he was aware during filming that "The Straight Story" would be the final act of his long career, and how much of that realization was incorporated into his performance.Straight's journey is a lot like that of Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) in "The Swimmer". Merrill got it into his head that he could restore things to how they were in his idyllic past if he could just swim home one afternoon through the backyards of his wealthy Connecticut suburb, using his neighbors' pools. Straight is not that delusional but he has come to believe that his brother will remain alive and be waiting for him as long as he stubbornly sticks to his original idea of traveling by mower.His other motivation for insisting on this means of travel (he won't take a bus and he turns down a ride for the last 60 miles) is to demonstrate how sincerely he wants to reconcile. If you give someone a horse it will be a lot more impressive if it is your only horse and it means that now you will have to walk. To walk is part of the gift.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if anyone would ever expect a film of Lynch to be "straight" and "story".The amazing thing in this attempt is that he is using the lawn in a simple way and not as a passage (Blue Velvet etc.} to paranoia.The lawn is the base of the dramatical logic.And he achieves his aim!Including the help of a fabulous actor (Farnsworth) he is proving that the essence of his past (and future) directing shapes is a straight line and especially a line mowed by the third age!I don't know if the director will make again such a straight story.I'm not even sure if he will make again a "story".However,I know that this personal propitiation has been proved beneficial for the American cinema and for us!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a Lynch film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was praised by Lynch-hating critics because it was a "straight" story; a far cry from the weird and wonderful films Lynch fans loved. For Lynch fans this is an odd u-turn before Mulholland Drive, Lynch's only true masterwork. Working on a simplistic script written by his partner, Lynch has directed a curiously quaint and old-fashioned tale that wouldn't be amiss on a 24 hour Disney channel. The fact he did not write the piece is why this isn't a proper Lynch film per se; rather it's his supposed detachment from the screenplay that defines the neutrality of his direction. However, there are some typically Lynchian moments but they are too brief and inconsequential to the story. As an exercise in linear narrative film Lynch did a very good job, pleasing those critics who hated his weirder works. Thankfully, he abandoned such styles in his later film Mulholland Drive and returned to what he did best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discovering slowness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think, nearly everything has been said in the previous comments. So I only want to give some personal annotation about this beautiful movie.I started watching "The straight story" when I came home from a party. I was drunk and tired, but also curious about this one, because other Lynch-movies I saw gave me much to ponder.It started with this long and slow sliding of the camera through the garden of Alvin Straight, passing the fat woman dressed in pink, arriving at the rear window... And then...I fell asleep. I awoke several times while the movie went on. But every time I awoke the movie looked the same. Alvin Straight was slowly moving through America. Endless fields of wheat and corn surrounding him. To only get these snapshots accompanied by the fantastic soundtrack, while dozing, was quite surreal. The next day was a Sunday. And in the afternoon I watched this wonderful movie again. It was one of the best Sunday afternoons I had this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible work by Lynch and Farnsworth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch's "The Straight Story" is certainly one of the finest films that I have had the honor to experience. Alvin Straight's journey from Iowa to Wisconsin, and the encounters with people along the way truly capture the human spirit. This is one of the most moving and peaceful films every created, and the score by Angelo Badalamenti definitely adds to the feeling. Farnsworth and Lynch should have won Oscars for this one. I recommend this movie to anyone who has the ability to truly enjoy films, regardless of genre or rating. David Lynch has shown that he can create gold from anything he touches, even if it is not your normal surreal, dark, Lynch film. "The Straight Story" is exactly the opposite. It is an absolutely touching film, that will leave you thinking about your relationship with family and friends. I recommend this movie to anyone who can truly enjoy films, regardless of genre or rating. Seek this one out and enjoy.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Farnsworth is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cant understand anyone giving this movie a negative review. Richard Farnsworth was amazing as Alvin Straight a man who drives a tractor mover 300 miles to see his brother who is sick. Alvin cant see well so he cant get a drivers license nor does he have a car ,a funny scene in which he shoots his old mower and gets another one is priceless. The movie has beautiful scenery and lonely landscapes of midwest america. Whats even more amazing is Richard Farnsworth(Alvin Straight), the man was 79 ,riddled with crippling cancer leaving him in constant pain yet he completed this movie,I was disappointed that he didnt win the academy award for best actor in 2000.His scene in a bar with another old timer is incredible, talking about his days as a sniper in ww2. His eyes still had that incredible spark and to me blue and beautiful. Its hard to believe this man had been a stuntman since the 30's yet he never had a speaking part until years later.Such a shame we didnt get to see more of his talent as an actor. He will be sorely missed ,his poor body so wracked with pain he mercifully ended his life with a gunshot. Rest in Peace Richard.Last of the old time western stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit that when I first heard I was studying a movie about a man on a lawnmower I was a tad sceptical. However, after watching the movie all my scepticism had disappeared. Who'd have thought that such a slow paced movie could be so heart warming and enjoyable? Had I not been in a room full of fellow students (most of whom would have taken me to the cleaners) I would have shed many a tear. The ending was incredibly touching and although left a mystery, any other ending would have destroyed the film. I have never seen a film like it, nor do I believe I will see one again. I recommend it to anyone of any age. A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subversive and subtly hostile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers.It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Lynch has been the target for a lot of undeserved abuse. His films are misunderstood, his art goes unappreciated, people try to make him a pariah etc.So, with the contempt of a large segment of the viewing public directed at him after 'Lost Highway', this is Lynch's response. Most of the ignoramuses responsible for that contempt are flabbergasted by this film, unable to reconcile Straight Story's superficially sunny message and execution with the majority of Lynch's work.That's because this film is a Trojan horse. It only appears benign. While the meatheads were busy savoring Straight's simple metaphor about the single stick that breaks under pressure and the bundle of sticks that don't, they missed the historical context that Lynch was referencing. In fascist Italian history, a bundle of sticks are the 'fasces', a symbol of strength, carried at the forefront of blackshirt rallies. Is that a metaphor to live your life by?Another fascist reference: The Straight Story. The SS.As for the montages, I wondered how many syrupy sweet panning shots of cornfields people had to watch, with the same string instrument playing, before they figured out that Lynch was making fun of them. They just kept coming one after another.The last shot is just classic. The camera pans up from the country setting in full daylight, in real-time, and then rests on a starry sky for its final shot. How many people were inspired by that bit of ridiculousness?Don't feel sorry for Farnsworth, though. He was in on it, and blew his brains out in real life just as he shot the hell out of the broken lawnmower from the film. Heartwarming, to be sure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed Richard Farnsworth's great work here, you should check out another performance of his that didn't get much notice but also deserved an Oscar: 1982's "The Grey Fox," in which he plays an aging train robber facing with a changing frontier. A much underrated actor. And "The Straight Story" is an unfairly overlooked film that was much, much better than 1999's Best Picture winner, "American Beauty" (which is a fine film itself nonetheless).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie that is sincere and very touching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this move for the first time, when it was aired on TV, and from the first moment, I got that, "emotional" feeling for the movie. It had that feeling of...honesty, simplicity and I could tell right away, that this was a great movie, and it was (and is) too.There are a certain drama movies that succeeds in establishing that..... slow and very touching emotion throughout the movie. This one has it. Dont misunderstand me; it is not a sentimental movie as we are used to in Hollywood, but a really sincere and serious one.The performance from Richard Farnsworth is absolutely great! Restrained, as it should be, but he does so much with so little. He doesnt need to put so many words in it, it comes out great anyway. It's really skillful acting.Despite of what some may think about the "shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much", I think that those images only strengthens the atmosphere in the movie. It gives a the movie a slow pace (which is good and also the point) and it is accompanied by great music, which alltogether creates that sad and touching feeling. And old man, whos health is failing, taking a last trip (that's the feeling i get), to redeem his mistakes in the past.I feel that the movie is about regret and aging. I can't really put to splendor of this movie into words. Even though I like David Lynch's movie, like mulholland Dr and Lost Highway, I think I consider "The Straight Story" to be his best work. It's nothing but great.My advice is, that if you haven't seen this movie, to do that ASAP. Hopefully you will also see the greatness of this splendid movie! Enjoy.</fullReview>

I was really Sad to learn, on this Site, that the 76 year old actor that starred in this Great Movie, committed suicide by gun, soon after the completion of this Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exquisite masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That this film was distributed by Disney and directed by David Lynch is quite unbelievable! However, if one reads the credits carefully, one will notice that it was underwritten by Canal+, a French company, and that there were French co-producers. Its essence is European, although the settings, tone and mood are essentially Mid-Western America. Its concern is the human condition, that we get old, and infirm and we die. And that we must take care to make amends for the brutality of life, because the universe is so much greater and more beautiful than we are. There is only one gun visible in this picture, when Alvin shoots his first and unworthy lawn mower. It is slow, much slower than American movie goers have been trained to tolerate; elegiac, utterly alien to the the shoot-em-up, blow-em-up thesis of most internationally marketed American movies. The scene with Alvin and his chance encounter with another WW II veteran is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in current cinema and is a poignant warning of what we are about to do in the current geopolitical climate. It is also a reminder of the finest aspects of the American soul - caring, compassion, kindliness, neighborliness. Farnsworth and Spacek are superb. It made me mourn Farnsworth's death, and gave me even greater respect for Spacek, whom I adore as one of the finest actors and human beings in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully simplistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Straight Story can really only be summed up in one word: simple. The title is all the movie is; it delivers what it promises. It is the story of Alvin Straight, a likeable old man who 'has seen just about all that life can offer', who has to travel on his lawnmower for six weeks to see his dying and estranged brother Lyle.Essentially it is just another example of the classic travel saga, an eventual throwback to such literary classics as Gulliver's Travels as it contains nothing more than a lot of long shots of seemingly endless country roads along with trials and tales that befall Straight and the people he meets along the way, including a very saccharine encounter with a pregnant teenager who has run away from home.The film-making itself is again simplistic; David Lynch has done some very good work with what is not at all a complex tale. A large number of long-held pauses between characters are beautifully timed as they inevitably mix to yet another long shot of a country road or a close-up of the tyres of the lawnmower as it continues to plow on across roads and boundaries. The repeated motif of the night stars is nicely used to illustrate the continual unity of people and family despite the distance, either physical, or emotional, between them.Finally, the lead performances are all excellent; Richard Farnsworth is perfectly cast as Straight and Sissy Spacek also does a fine job as his daughter Rose. However, some of the minor characters, particularly at the start, give somewhat one-dimensional performances that struggle to get the film moving; we really don't get a good insight into Straight's character until fifty miles into his journey, but from then on it's excellent acting all the way.Overall, the film is a warm, sentimental tale that provides uplifting drama and should bring a smile to all who watch it. 4 and a 1/2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw 'The Straight Story' I was certainly most surprised; for the past many years I've more or less considered American films to be either rather sentimental or rather violent, to say the least - some times both at the same time. However, after the fine experience of having seen the film in question I had to adjust my own prejudices quite a bit. It's a nice story, beautifully told and shot, perfectly cast, and with a plot that only real life stories can provide. I left the cinema as a very impressed person, hand in hand with my equally content wife. 'The Straight Story' is in many ways quite untraditional - worth being seen again one day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a suprise and a delight. At times hilarious, at others poignant and moving, it is a valentine to ordinary people--the elderly and other of society's castoffs. Sissy Spacek and Dick Farnsworth shine as the elderly hero and his daughter with a speech defect. It is refreshing to see a movie with no sex or violence. The slow pace of the film is totally suitable to its subject--the trip of an old man on his tractor to visit his very ill brother. The flat landscapes and drab colors of midwestern farm country are reproduced with a stark beauty. Dick Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight, a kind of travelling saint. He touches the hearts of everyone he meets with his courage, determination, and kindness. The secondary characters are beautifully drawn also--from the old man who owns the town hardware store to people who let Alvin camp in their yard when his rig breaks down to a small town priest. An especially touching scene occurs when Alvin has a beer with another World War Two vet. Nothing much happens in this movie--there isn't much action but the interaction among the Midwesterners. But it affects the viewer like a painting by a Dutch Master--the somberness and light and shadow of everyday life is captured unforgettably, and every gesture and tone is carefully selected. Highly recommended but not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I join with the viewers who highly praise this film. This is very much a David Lynch film and a myth making performance by Richard Farnsworth. The movie gains in mythic size each time I re-see it. *****Spoilers**** Let's consider a couple things touched on in other comments. This is a simple story but not a straight story. Alvin's story is one of a guilt ridden murderer, mean drunk, absent father, maybe even negligent caretaker of his own grandchildren. Not one comment says anything about recognizing older people in Alvin. His character is so vivid I can smell him. Believe me when I tell you the essence of Alvin's existence is spread throughout an entire generation of men leaving this mortal coil at this time. I put this film in the company of Lonesome Dove, Ikiru, McCabe &amp; Mrs Miller, and The Unforgiven.</fullReview>

When his brother is reported to have a stroke, he's determined to go visit him - driving throughout an entire state on a lawn-mower.Those are the facts. It doesn't prepare you for the sheer emotion of the film, the way the random encounters and conversations grasp your attention and, at least in my case, brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.And finally: Richard, wherever you are now, thanks man!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Powerful film, wonderfully acted by Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek ( all other parts are quite minor). Beautiful cinematography, although the camera exhibits a slight obsession to dwell on the physical ugliness and quirkiness of rural people (this is David Lynch directing! what else would one expect?) And the script is marvelous, with lines that I will remember and treasure all my life.Negatives? The pace of the plot. The story moves at the pace of a...well... of a lawnmower. While undoubtedly intentional, the glacial pace of the film will chase away a lot of viewership. And the plot is unambitious - a long film telling a short story very well. It is hard to rank this film as high as other films that tackled more ambitious stories (e.g., Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, even Minority Report). I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If David Lynch were to turn into a small island just off the coast of Cannes and do the can-can to the strains of "I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts" it would fail to surprise me. Two things did surprise me about this film. The first was the "Walt Disney presents" in the opening credits. I would never have thought that Disney and Lynch... Lynch and Disney... but there you have it. The second surprise was in the ending credits when it became apparent that this was a film based on a true story.In many respects this film is like The Elephant Man in that it tugs on the heart-strings in a restrained way. The Straight Story had me weeping at one or two points, and chuckling in others. The slow pace, masterful use of silence, and the cinematography and soundscape all added up to an unassuming and beautiful masterpiece.Having spent so much time in the small-town America of Illinois I was immediately at home with the scenery and the pragmatic characters depicted in the movie. The film has a lot to say about being old and having regrets, but delivers a positive message to us all.All in all, David Lynch, who is one of my favorite directors, has created another movie that will take pride of place in my movie collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1999 was definetely one of the best years in american film history. We had everything in that year. Opinions were divided, but 99 was a year filled with provoking movies: Eyes Wide Shut, The Insider, Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, Three Kings, Sleepy Hollow, American Beauty, Fight Club, The BlairWitch Project, The Sixth Sense...wow...It's hard to pick a favorite among a list like that. But David Lynch's The Straight Story did it for me. This first time I saw this movie on a small theatre in Köln, Germany, I was expecting something good, but this just blew me away. What an honest movie. So f***ing honest, so straight as the title says, that it becomes moving instantly.Richard Farnworth's performance is one you just can't imagine with someone else. He is Straight as much as he is himself. There's soul in this acting.Angelo Badalamenti's scorse hits the spot right there where it's necesary, and the beautiful cinematographym akes you wonder if it was actually David Lynch behind the camera. How can this guy, who specializes in nightmares come up with this truly disney-like moving film?? After watching and falling in love with Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, twin Peaks and Lost Highway...how this did happen? But let's not be fooled by the surface. The Lynchian elements are all over. The quirky characters are turned cute, the highway, the way time passes by for this characters, and of course, the stars, stars the have been on lynch's filmography as far back as The Elephant Man and eraserhead.This is just fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure how anybody with a working soul could rate this movie any less than excellent. Perhaps it doesn't have enough violence or wise-cracking idiotic cops involved in implausible chase scenes. Maybe I was just influenced by the main character being a WWII vet, like my dad. Their generation seemed to somehow grasp the importance of right and wrong, working for a living, family, values, and a strong sense of American brotherhood. I enjoyed every second of this movie, the slow pace was necessary for the wisdom, goodness and honesty of the character to sink in to my baby boomer mind. A man with determination, resolve and regrets making his way ever-so-slowly on the path to correction. His last chance to make things right. An interesting guy with lots of baggage but never complaining about it, on the contrary, only lets it out when he deems it could be helpful to someone who can't and maybe never will understand the complexities of life. I saw the movie as a man that has been on the road all his life, knows he is coming close to the end, and needs to review and assess everything over the hum of a lawnmower. A very good movie for people who should slow down, grasp life as it comes, and appreciate learning from those who have already travelled the path to wisdom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie lingers on the insignificant and glazes over the interesting. One could compare it to Forrest Gump (mainly the jogging scenes), Wild Strawberries or Vagabond, but it's more educational to contrast it since doing so illustrates how the above mentioned movies succeed at telling a similar story, while The Straight Story fails.Rather than risk spoiling those stronger films by discussing them in depth, I'll simply mention that few of the characters Alvin encounters are very interesting, mainly because the film doesn't explore them enough. Yet the characters Wild Strawberries' protagonist encounters are infinitely more interesting even though less screen time is given to them.The technical aspects (acting, cinematography) make The Straight Story worth watching, but ultimately it remains a poor imitation of better 'travel' stories. I reiterate - see Wild Strawberries for a richer movie experience. It essentially deals with the same themes as The Straight Story in a less patronizing tone.</fullReview>

This time he just wants to sing a simple song......Or just tell the unusual true story of a 78-year-old man named Alvin Straight (the wonderful final performance of Richard Farnsworth) who drove his tractor through three states to see his dying brother (played by Harry Dean Stanton, the one wierd element in this film, besides the plot). Oh, Toto, I think we ARE in Kansas again...or Iowa, to be extact. The first time I saw this, I was flabergasted at the almost void of idiosynchcrasies. There are a couple of "party" references sprinkled throughout, if not just to remind the audience that we are actually seeing a film by THE David Lynch. This is David Lynch's first attempt at true story telling since "The Elephant Man," and maybe his best overall film since. While I still prefer the likes of "Mulholland Drive," I still think this is one of Lynch's best and sypathetic films to date. This also marks the first time the equally wonderful Sissy Spacek (who has worked with Lynch behind the scenes since "Eraserhead," and whose husband does Lynch's production designs) and her performance gives more from a "supporting" role than most films give from the leading ones. The Badalamenti music (see, this isn't such a departure for Lynch, afterall) is just gorgeous, even if it doesn't always complement the film at times. The photography is divine and the direction, as usual, couldn't be topped. The only concern is how many Lynch devotees will be bored while friviously waiting for the film to get "wierd." However, if you enjoy G-rated, Disney-released, Midwestern-set films, then you're in for a real treat! This is no space cruise (despite what the credits will have you believe), but it's worth the fare. A true family classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a gentle, heartwarming story. I was pleased to find that David Lynch can actually direct a nice, quiet movie. Wonderful cinematography and score, by Angelo Badalamenti. I've always liked Richard Farnsworth and was pleased to see he could still evoke such emotion. Sissy Spacek also did an excellent job playing his daughter, and all the secondary characters were equally well-cast. Just a nice, leisurely story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, The Straight Story is the most simple movie ever done by the director who makes the most complex movies I can think. So you were confused by Lost Highway or another Lynch movie. Well, The Straight Story is the opposite. You would really have to be a complete idiot to ask to the man sitting next to you "What happened right there, I don't get it". The story is simple: a man who sees his death coming decides that he wants to see his brother who just had a stroke. He hasn't seen him in ten years and has lost his driver's licence. He also wants to do this by himself, so he goes on the road with his lawnmower. This is when the movie turns into one of the most beautiful road movies ever. The beautiful photography and Richard Farnsworth's performance make this simple story a beautiful one, and the rest of the cast, mostly people he meets, are also great. My only problem with the acting might be Sissy Spacek, who overdoes it a bit in her role as Alvin's daughter but nothing really bad. It is simply that alongside Farnsworth's oscar-worthy performance, she doesn't stand a chance. The Straight Story is a movie you will either love or hate. I loved it but I can understand why some would hate it: the slow pace, the lack of action... But this movie is a beautiful reflection on growing old and a movie which touches the viewer deeply. You end up really caring about this old man's quest. Now, wether you love it or hate is up to you, but please, see it!90%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching The Straight Story finally after trying to catch it for some months. There are only a few movies that touch something deep inside, a raw emotion that changes the way you think about all that is dear to you. Forgiveness, redemption, compassion, the simple things in life such as family and friends, the place where you grew up, a clear night sky. But the Straight Story is so much more. It is a simple tale of a man who, in his own words "has seen just about all there is to see" and yet realises that before he dies, he has one wrong left to undo. So Alvin Straight drives his lawnmower 300 miles to see a brother that he hasn't spoken to in over ten years. He refuses help along the way, telling those on the road that he has to do this in his own way; this is his rite of passage. Amends perhaps for estranging his own brother... Along the way, he meets many people and he tells them a little of his story which helps to show us a little more of Alvin's motives. One of the most poignant is his conversation with a fellow old timer about their deeds during the War. Another favourite scene is when he's talking to a runaway about the strength to be found in family. Visually, I have always liked David Lynch's work and the Straight Story, despite being a massive departure from his usual surrealist approach is trademark Lynch. The cinematography is simply stunning. The wide camera angles and slow movement conveys and enhances the American midwest and seems to compliment somehow the peaceful yet dilligent frame of mind of the central character. Richard Farnsworth is brilliant as Alvin Straight. Deep rheumy eyes and a heavily wrinkled face show a man who has lived and yet burdened with with his own regrets. The supporting characters that Alvin meets along the way are good and honest people. Such a nice change from all the badness in the world. And his final meeting with Lyle, his brother, is pure magic. Hats off to Harry Dean Stanton who, when he asks Alvin if he drove all the way on a lawnmower just to see him and Alvin says yes, the look in his eyes he gives back closes the film beautifully. Put simply, The Straight Story is an honest and gentle tale of human goodness and only those without a soul could find this film less than enjoyable. Definitely one for the DVD collection and a movie that deserves to become a classic. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson well learned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having watched this movie in my English class, I'd have to say I'm very pleased. To see an old man on a lawnmower trying to see his dying brother is heart breaking. Once getting farther in the movie I began to realize how much I've related Alvin to my own grandpa. You see, I have been grown up my whole life by my grandma and grandpa. My grandpa just passed away last February (2001). Alvin reminds me so much of my grandpa; it brought tears to my eyes to watch the movie. My grandpa was also very stubborn, but yet he was very wise. He fought in the Korean war and had told me stories of what it was like. He was a type of man that if had something in his mind, he'd let you know what it was. And if he had a plan to do something, you better believe he'd do it. That pretty much sums up Alvin here. He is the grandpa that every kid show grow up to have. To teach life lessons, and lead a path for others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing change from the usual Hollywood action flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have the great David Lynch in a much mellower mood following the excesses of ?Lost Highway' and ?Wild At Heart'.Based on a true story, the film follows Septuagenarian Alvin Straight as he travels 350 miles across America on his lawnmower to visit his sick brother in Wisconsin, and the various eccentric characters he meets along the wayA delight to watch, and refreshing change from the usual Hollywood action flicks. No one gets shot, stabbed, blown up, uses bad language, or is even not very nice. In fact its hard to think of a gentler film.A great central performance from Richard Farnsworth, gorgeous cinematography and a splendid music score makes this a film you should definitely check out. You'll be glad you did! 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far from the "Matrix" and the "Mummy," on the other side of the world from a Jackie Chan kick fight, and worlds away from "Star Wars," there lives a world of just 'regular' folks. And as they get older, their lives take turns that make them reassess where they have been and what they have said. Who they may have hurt along the way.Alvin Straight, (Richard Farnsworth) can't get a driver's license because of medical problems, won't get surgery for heart problems, and won't get a walker just because his hips are giving out. But he can still do one thing. He can get on his old, rusty lawn mower and head out to visit his estranged brother, Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton), even though that is over 300 hilly miles away.If you find yourself choking back tears as this poignant journey progresses at 5 mph, through bad weather, odd lost people on the side of the road, and warm and wonderful people who help Alvin make this one last trip of his life, you won't be alone. And even with all that, you will be happy for Alvin. And wish you had come to know him better...maybe even be his next-door neighbor, or buy him a beer--chat a while to know a real person with malice toward none. Don't miss this one, even though the DVD had no extras whatsoever. Did Farnsworth get the "Oscar" for this? If not, he was robbed. (DVD movie reviewed here.) 10/10 stars :-)</fullReview>

This film had all the qualities I love in movies: great writing, great casting and some breakout performances. Spacek was phenomenal. Although her character was not central to the story, she was so on character I had trouble believing this is same person that was the "Coal Miner's Daughter". The movie had just enough fantasy value (never got pulled over by the Highway Patrol??, never ran out of gas??, never got run over??) to keep it from being a docudrama and yet a story not so far from probable to make it real.I gave it 9 of 10 and a hearty recommendation to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch plays it straight, with remarkable result</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find The Straight Story to be, contrary to what many have said, a very Lynchian film. But I haven't been witness to a more melancholic Lynch since The Elephant Man. One central thread in Straight Story is, just like in the black-and-white Anthony Hopkins drama, repressed emotions and people who are misunderstood because of their appearance or behavior. It seems Lynch has picked up the thread from then, and placed it within the context of the mythological rural American framework he has spent the last ten years developing. Considering his devotion to strong visual ingredients, at first it would seem inappropriate for Disney to put its hallmark on the result, but it's not. For the most part, Lynch plays it cool; only a few times giving in to the temptation to develop the bizarre aspect of the situation ("the owls are not what they seem").The main character, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), bears a striking resemblance to those furrowed old men often turning up in the work of Donald Duck cartoonist Carl Barks. The film starts off with Straight receiving word from his brother, who lives a few states further east. Having had no contact the last then years, the two have resorted to denial of each other's existence. Straight is haunted by thoughts about the past and an unfinished feud with his brother, and decides to drive and visit him. Neither in possession of a driver's license nor a car, he chooses his only means of transport: A lawn mower.Multiple technical problems break up the journey, which for us results in a lot of beautiful scenes from rural America each time Alvin stops to receive help from friendly locals (unlikely, at times). Judging only by the landscape scenes the film is quickly placed within the road movie genre, but taking into account the story, it lacks the eruptive quality of most such films, in stead harboring a concentrated quiet, like in Paris, Texas. Straight's trip echoes his past, which was spent partly traveling around.Richard Farnsworth is charmingly clumsy in his portrayal of Straight. Coming across as a self-consciously old man with all the right answers that indicates that he has surrendered to the inevitable biological decay. Essential enough, though, Farnsworth reveals a youthful aspect in some of his expressions that clearly marks him off from the other elderly people he meets. It is as if Lynch wants to tell us that Straight is not fixed, has not surrendered, but is still in motion with an intention to continue shaping his life. That way it feels like a double warning to "seize the day": Both in Straight's personal mission, and in the contrast to the other elderly, who shake their heads in disbelief over the weird ideas from a person they regard as "nuts". Farnsworth grins and chews with wandering, intense eyes, working his way through elaborate reflections over life in general, sitting around countless camp fires and at bars and other situations that simply invite to getting philosophical. Lynch is remarkably economical with the moral statements such situations easily could be fitted with, making Farnsworth's part in it subtle, and the metaphors about family and aging seem like slips of the tongue.Recommended (7/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch Makes a Good Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First a confession, I've never been a fan of Mr. Lynch's work. Eraserhead was probably the most tedious movie I've ever seen. Dune was a jumbled mess. And the all the posturing and self conscious weirdness of Twin Peaks always seemed a bit too put on for my taste. But with The Straight Story, I've begun to think that maybe the man was worthy of all the praise heaped on him a decade ago. True the movie does contain some of his trademark drawn-out shots that bored me to tears in his other work, but here they fit the mood of the film. One user has questioned the believability of Mr. Straight making the trip in two months on a lawn mower when he could have done it in a couple hours on a plane. I don't know what the real Mr. Straight's motivation was for making the trip in the way he did (maybe he was afraid of flying, who knows) but in the movie, it is a journey of atonement. Hopping on a plane or in a car wouldn't have absolved him of his sins in his brother's eyes, only the most difficult and demeaning journey could mend their relationship.All and all this is an excellent movie. Both Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek are one hundred percent believable in their roles, the story left a lump in my throat and the feel of the whole thing left me in awe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a personal story for me, in that it's a mid-western tale, and it reminded me of home. I grew up on a farm just like any of the hundreds that Alvin drives by, and the kindness and generosity of the farmers was right on. The people he met along the way could have been my dad, my grandfathers, or my neighbors. Although it's rated G, it's not intended for children. Pre-teens, as well as most teens, would be bored out of their minds. This is a gentle movie intended for adults who can appreciate the fear and sadness associated with old age, the regrets of past actions that can't be undone, and the kindness of strangers. This is clearly one of the best films of 1999 and should have been nominated for Oscars for both Best Picture and Cinematography. At least Richard Farnsworth was nominated for Best Actor. As good as Kevin Spacey was in "American Beauty," Farnsworth deserved the Oscar more for his subtle, moving performance.</fullReview>

Never for a moment do you think of him as acting, his quiet conviction, his dedication, the love he has for his daughter (Sissy Spacek) all come across so beautifully. Very fitting it should be his last film performance. I really thought they would never translate this one theme true story into a one theme movie of any interest or substance but I was very wrong. It is inspiring, provocative and you find yourself just cheering at the end for the understated love between 2 estranged brothers. No big wallop of a message, just life and how one old man deals with setting things "straight". An 8 out of 10 and the cinematography is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was impossible to watch this film without thinking of Richard Farnsworth's suicide in Oct 2000 (due to the pain of bone cancer). Farnsworth plays an aged &amp; determined man who travels on his own terms to visit his brother who fell ill. A brother he hadn't spoken with since 10 years because of an alcohol induced argument.This is a film about the lifetime of human experiences. Its running themes include: the haunting &amp; unforgiving nature of memory; simple reflections on living, loss &amp; regret, and especially the strength of will &amp; reconciliation.Sissy Spacek is remarkable as Rose, Alvin's mentally challenged (?) daughter &amp; impossible to ignore, especially in the scenes when she longingly looks out the window.David Lynch admirers might miss his usual focus on the unusual, however it's evident that he is, in fact, behind the camera. For eg, the way some of the scenes close completely &amp; the next opens; the scenes with the ball rolling &amp; how those were filmed; and especially Alvin's encounter with the distressed driver.A truly one of a kind film from beginning to beautiful end (`Yes I did'). Silence can say so many words.It will pull the heart strings of anyone who is able to feel the pulse of what it means to live &amp; breathe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took this movie out this weekend, and it's now one of my favourite films of all time. I avoided taking it out for a while, because I was worried it would be boring. But I was SO wrong.I may not be an expert on movies, but I thought the photography was beautiful - you never think of America looking as it did in this film: lush and green, but with autumnal shades of brown. Some parts were actually quite similar to England. The music was excellent, too - perfect for the film. Amazing that such a simple violin tune actually made me and my girlfriend swing our legs in rhythm, simply because it was so emotive, and we were so "into" the film.The main character in this film is played excellently by Richard Farnsworth. NEVER have i watched a film and been so involved with ANY character as I was with Alvin - I really cared about whether he would finish his journey successfully. If this film had been made differently, it (and the characters in it) could so easily have come off as tacky, stereotyped and preachy. But, as it was, they were always interesting, and by degrees funny and quirky (note: the deer woman).I would recommend this film whole-heartedly to anybody. It shows that films don't have to be cynical (as many films somehow manage to be, despite seeming heart-warming on the surfaces) and full of special effects - note: "The Perfect Storm". A superb break from the norm, that deserves all of the attention it has received, and a whole lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Disney Pictures is about to release a G-rated moralistic family picture by director David Lynch'.This press report caused an almost immediate hassle between the positive side of my personality and the side that likes to be referred to as `Realistic'. Since fortune favors the bold, Mr. Realistic took hold of the mike first and stated: `Think about it. 1990 was THE year for Mr. Lynch. The first season of the mini-series 'Twin Peaks' was popular to the extreme; his motion picture 'Wild at Heart' won the palm d'Or in cannes; his video for Chris Isaak's song 'Wicked Game' a chart topper; and calvin Klein got Lynch to make a series of commercials for his new Obsession perfume. Then came the clouds as the second season of Twin Peaks lost a lot of viewers, who simply had enough (a result of modern culture where we are like children, who stubbornly MUST eat a box of candy in one sitting and wonder afterwards they we got sick of it); the motion picture sequel Fire Walk With Me was booed at in Cannes and a world wide box office failure; his new TV-series On the Air and Hotel Room couldn't raise interest. After a silence of more than five years, Lynch returned to the silver screen with the motion picture Lost Highway. An intriguing film to be sure, but there were few positive reviews and a lot of people were disappointed. Mr. Realistic, whose speaking can always be somewhat exhausting and who often get caught in the moment, sighed and paused, thinking about how to put it. `In the beginning of 1999, Lynch tried it once more on the small screen with Mulholland Drive, but this time it didn't even get the chance to reach audiences as producing network ABC passed on the pilot. Lynch isn't a stupid man, so he starts thinking: 'It's been almost ten years since I had my last hits. The millenium is almost over and if I want to end it successfully, I've got to act fast.' So, less than two years after his latest film, Lynch returns to the silver screen with a based-on-fact family picture about an old farmer road-tripping through the country. How can you possibly make an interesting picture with such a premise? This film's gonna be a sweet as sugar piece of corny and moralistic rubbish. Hence, positive reviews and oscar-nominations are almost secured. Hence, it becomes interesting (and save) again to invest in a guy like Lynch.' At this point, Mr. Positive (who doesn't even want to be called `Mister') claimed the mike. `A director is more than the story he tells', he stated. `A director is the pace, the directing of the camera, the directing of the actors, the whole atmosphere. Besides, Lynch isn't a cold, emotionless creature. Blue velvet as well as Wild At Heart and Fire Walk With me contained dramatic, sensitive moments filled with love. Lynch isn't a David Cronenberg - He cares about his characters. And The Straight Story isn't Lynch's first 'normal' film, he gained interest with the acclaimed The Elephant Man.' Mr. Realistic, bold as ever, grabbed the mike for a moment and yelled; `Yeah, that other 'normal' film he made at a point in his career when he didn't have one.'. Mr. Positive shook his head (because of both Mr. Realistic's bold character and what he said), but since he didn't have an other argument ready, he decided to end this first discussion by suggesting to take a look at the film first before judging it.The beginning of The Straight Story takes place in Lynch-county, alright. We hear the music of Angelo Badalamenti, rather peaceful this time around; we see quiet, dreamy images of a small town. These images remind us of Blue velvet, but, as the music already suggested, we stay on the surface this time. If there is vermin in the grass, Lynch isn't interested this time around. Mr. Positive scored (if you can regard a discussion as a competition, that is) leading with 1-0. Indeed, the images (photographed by Freddie Francis) are obviously created by Lynch. The dreamy atmosphere, the slow pace and the humor are clearly his, too. And this film isn't all that peaceful, either. There are a lot of ominous shadows and the scene where Spacek watches out of the window one night and sees a young boy picking up a ball is scarier than those rope-jumping girls from Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elmstreet. But, after having played a poor first round, Mr. Realistic made a comeback. His opportunity knocked when the film ironically appeared to collapse when Alvin actually started his journey. `Well well well, Mr. Realistic cried out. `And For the first time since his first film Eraserhead, Lynch manages to keep the running time under the 120 minutes. How could that have happened?'Screenwriters John Roach and Mary Sweeney had to come up with stuff to 1. prevent the movie from becoming a one-man show. 2. Keep the story going. 3. keep balance to the story. To put it in another way: if nothing happens on the way, no film. Problem is that Roach and Sweeney didn't come up with enough anecdotes, resulting in a screenplay that shows the same ups and downs as the road Alvin is travelling down. Some of Alvin's happenings are strong and interesting (his story about W.O. II; the speeding down the hill; the small talk with the bartender), some comical (the encounter with the lady who accidentally keeps hitting deers with her car), some simple and serene (the passing bicycle-rally), others simple don't work, lead to nowhere, are corny or obvious (the scene on the camping ground; the talk with the girl who ran away from home). And every scene where really something happens is followed by long shots of the scenery and Farnsworth on his lawnmower, riding off to his next 'anecdote'. To summarize: there's a lack of evenness. Not only in pace and storytelling but also in quality. Fortunately, the last scene, in which Alvin reaches his brother Lyle, is not only the strongest one in the film but also one of the strongest in Lynch's whole oeuvre. There's barely any dialogue here, but Lynch proves once again that facial expressions and silence can say more than a thousand words ever could. So, Mr. Positive won after all, although it was a close call. As Marge Simpson once pointed out, bad winners exist, so Mr. Positive decided not to go on about the other winning expects of this film, like the brilliant acting by all concerned; the breathtaking cinematography by 80 year old Freddie Francis; and the courage of Lynch to, in this day and age, make a film about a elderly farmer on a 5 miles an hour vehicle (remember that wonderful emphasizing scene, messing with an audience's expectation, in which the camera follows the lawnmower, then tilts up to the sky to hold a few moments before tilting down again to show that the lawnmower has only progressed a couple of yards?). The Straight story is not a perfect film, but it IS wonderful and clearly a sincere piece of work, a labor of love.O yes, since fame favors the bold, Mr. Realistic was likely to have last word, anyway. Sneaking back to the mike for one last time, grinning sadistically, to point out a situation that has probably occurred a number of times. `Imagine, if you will, Pa and Ma Average, just having seen The Straight Story with cute little daughter Shirley and intending to see more films of 'that nice Mr. Lynch'. So, they go to the local Blockbuster and rent Blue Velvet. 'Gee, how come we never heard of this title before?'. Pa and Ma, settle down in front of the Zenith with their little daughter Shirley snug as a bug between them, hit the play button and are, once again, confronted with happy imagery of small town America. 'Look mommy', little Shirley chuckles, 'That fireman is waving at us.' Pa and Ma Average smile at each other. Ain't life the best? Then, the camera lingers into the grass and little Shirley's face becomes pale as a sheet. 'Don't you $@#&amp;&amp;* look at me!!' Ha ha ha!'7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pope is going to be the next Dalai Lama. :-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first second i saw the phrase " a Walt Disney production " at the very begining of this movie i though, " WHAT ?!!" and i got totaly convinced this was going to be a very painfull experience. In fact if i hadn´t bought the DVD, i probably wouldn´t have watched it, and i would ended up missing one of the most beautiful movies i ever made. David Lynch, working for Disney ?! The most politicaly correct movie company ever ?! The only comparison for this must be, if the Pope sudenly got chosen to be the next Dalai Lama !!! :-)Come on, someone must be kidding ! For a second i though i had bought the wrong DVD and i had bought a new Leslie Nielsen comedy instead. Well i couldn´t be more wrong, because this movie is all that i was never expecting it to be. THE STRAIGHT STORY, is one of those very rare movies that can´t be explained, it has to be felt. And so if you will like it or not, will depend mostly upon your view of life and how you feel about your own personal values.By now i´ve already seen this movie about 4 or 5 times since i bought it about a month ago and i can´t get enough of it. Each time i get sad, or tired i just put this one and get carried away by it one more time. Because let me tell you, if you like this movie, every time you start watching it, you just can´t stop untill you´ve finished. Mainly because of Richard Farnsworth. Even today i still have trouble in convincing myself that the Alvin Straight in this movie is "nothing" but an actor playing a character. Richard´s performance is probably the best i ever seen in my life, because we totaly forget that everything in the screen is not real. Simply brilliant. Words can not describe it, once again it´s something that has to be felt.And as if this wasn´t enough, there´s Sissy Spacek, playing one of the most touching and simple characters i ever saw. This woman also deserved a bunch of awards, in fact everyone on this film deserved to go home with plenty of prizes and recognitions. The final minutes with Harry Dean Stanton playing Alvin´s brother are simply breathtaking. Never so many things were said in so few lines of dialogue.If there´s a movie that proves how fake the Oscars are, this is it.Oh,and let´s not forgget about the magnificent soundtrack. Angelo Badalamenti, does a superior work here. Probably his best. This has to be one best soundtracks ever, not because it stays in your mind afterwards, but because it works like magic in the movie. Never intrusive, and totaly beautiful !Go see this movie. And if you think this is another soapy drama, forget it. Emotion here is not flashed right into your eyes all the time. It doesn´t show to yourself, it makes you also feel instead. And this is what makes this movie great. Not what it shows, but what we know is there. Go feel this movie. It´s that good. AMERICAN BEAUTY will be forgotten in time. This movie WON´T.It made me want to buy a lanmower ! When i get old, i want to be like Alvin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 1999.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being a full grown man and devoted David Lynch hater, I ventured into the cinema to see this film. And boy was I surprised! It made my eyes well up more than any film I can remember, and that's hard to do. Richards Farnsworth's performance as the old geezer Alvin Straight is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. So nice to see that someone in this world still dares to tell a story where cheap dramatic thrills are not present. Any other scriptwriter or director would have thrown in the robbing of Alvin, or how young would have trashes his trailer or beat him up to create "drama, conflict" (like they learned in filmschool). None of that here, and I'm so happy that was the case. Truly a straight story. Alvin encounters friendly people, just like in reality. It also reminded me about my trips to America: this film truly shows the greatness of America and its people, not everyone is a gun carrying NRA maniac. And the slow pacing is also completely deliberate and justified in this film, since Alvin is an old man and life to him move at a slower pace. His 7 week lawnmover ride to see his ailing brother, is just not only a trip on a machine out of nescessity, the time it takes is also a wayfor Alvin to "swallow his pride" as he says, to be able to make peace with his brother before he dies. Great, great stuff. Without a shadow of a doubt, the best film of '99.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People my age are not supposed to enjoy films like this. When they were designing this movie, it's doubtful that they had college-aged people in mind. After members of my family had rented it, I had planned on catching the first 20 minutes of the movie to kill a little time and then watching the rest "later". (Later almost never comes) However, after watching the first 10 minutes of the movie, I was hooked.Definitely not a typical David Lynch film, here he shows that he can pull off a touching, sweet, G-rated film. This is a great character-driven story with all around good acting . The people are real and three-dimensional, and while the plot may seem simplistic, it genuinely works. This is one of the best family related films to come out in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Straight Story is a quiet, subtle, G-rated tale of a stubborn old man (Richard Farnsworth) who undertakes a six-week, 200-plus-mile journey from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin in 1994. Alvin Straight, 73 years old, is a physical wreck of man. He needs two canes to get around. He can't drive due to poor eyesight. But his estranged brother has just suffered a debilitating stroke, and Alvin is determined to go see him. Since he can't drive, and since he'll be damned if he'll let someone in a bus drive him there, Alvin chooses the mode of transportation he knows best - a 1966 John Deere riding mower. This is such an odd movie for a filmmaker like David Lynch to make. The creator of such cultish films as Eraserhead, Dune, and Blue Velvet generally makes weird, offbeat movies. His films are usually rated R (or worse), and are brimming with stylish violence and a real sense of atmosphere, creepy as it may be. With The Straight Story, none of these characteristics are apparent. I half-expected to see Alvin turn into a homicidal maniac who likes to lop off ears and drink the blood out of them in a crazed, stylish, symbolistic dance. But no, this was as gentle, as moving a movie as you'll see nowadays (aside from certain made-for-cable movies). There isn't an ounce of meanness, not a whit of wickedness, not one dollop of demonic possession. It's as placid as a quilting bee, and what's more, it's absolutely beautiful. If you've seen any of Lynch's movies, you know the director has his own trademark camera angels and movements, and these are unmistakable in this film, as well. From each loving look at the amber waves of grain (okay, maybe they're golden) to the stark farmhouses poised in repose, each camera angle seems to have been painstakingly tended to. There's love in the details, friends, and this is one of those rare, rare movies that'll stay in your mind for years. And to top if all off, you have an Oscar-nominated performance from Richard Farnsworth, a former stuntman-turned-thespian. There's hardly an emotion from cranky old Alvin Straight for most of the film, the repressed WWII vet on a mission. The casting couldn't have been better in this movie. Farnsworth is an absolute delight as Alvin, and his eyes are more revealing than the faces of many well-paid actors. Tired, wrinkly, and a little despondent, Alvin's eyes express everything from sadness to resignation to resilience. The moment when Alvin finally reaches his brother's house is very memorable, the kind film scholars should be talking about for decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw American Beauty the other day and thought this was the best movie of the year. The performances of Spacey and Wesley were outstanding; perhaps Wesley like Carrey was robbed for not being norminated. Benning performance can either be seen as over-acting or someone who is trying to make a false face for herself and a makeshift image of success. Nevertheless, after seeing Richard Farnsworth performance in 'The Straight Story' I realised that Richard deserved the oscar if it was just a race between him, Spacey and Crowe. Whereas, Spacey relied upon good camera direction and words to convey emotions, Richard went a step better just by seeing his slow movement across the screen - he didn't even have to talk to convey ideas and emotions and when he did Richard as Alvin summed up World War Two far better than three hours of 'Saving Private Ryan' could ever do. For me this is the best movie I have seen since La Vita e Bella and that was over a year ago!!! This is one of the greatest movies of all time for the following reasons: 1) The acting by all the characters were outstanding, something you cannot claim for American Beauty. 2) The storyline was more thought-provoking as it's the type you will appreciate more when you are adult enough to understand. 3) There are moral lessons here that are far superior to American Beauty. What do you THINK!!! </fullReview>

I should note that I saw this movie with an audience composed mostly of elderly people, most of whom walked out (on two canes, slowly) during the show. I started this movie as a young pup, but rode away on my John Deere lawn mower and didn't feel a day over 94 years old. Why did they even have Harry Dean's name on this thing? It's not like Ms. Montenegra in "Central Station" -- I mean : Get a grip. That wasn't a role. It was money for his electric bill for the month of December and possibly a favor to Lynch, who, by the way, made that the most irritating sound track since Erasorhead. If you're itching to see the world (well .. Iowa(y)..) through the eyes of an old man and can't wait to be one (or woman), then get your walkers fired up and get over there.

Not so apparently; up here in the bay area the movie has all but disappeared. What's the deal here? Does nobody bother to see a G rated movie? Doesn't ANYONE pay enough attention to quality in movies to know that Lynch is one of the country's best directors? I wish this movie better luck in other countries, where maybe they take better notice of movie excellence and have the patience for a wonderful film like "the Straight Story."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie unfolds at a slow pace: music, colors, and dialogues are monotonous during the entire movie. Despite a relatively interesting opening, the level of genuine tension that motivates the spectator to continue watching the movie is extremely low. The idea of the director is to unveil a story of two brothers as far as the journey of the main character (one of the two brothers) develops but the degree of introspection is low and the gradual unfolding looses its meaning because it is very easy to detect the motives of the journey. Overall, the movie is characterized by redundancy: the spectator understands from the very beginning that the main character's life is sad but every few minutes, a melancholic music fades in, accompanying the narration of a depressing situation of the past. After the third narration, those among the most cynical spectators may start smiling instead of feeling empathy. I would not recommend this movie to those who appreciated Amores Perros, in the Name of the Father, and Diarios de una Motocicleta because they may be disappointed by the lack of rhythm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alvin Straight lives with his "slow" daughter Rose. He is a stubborn man who when the doctor tells him that he needs to get hip surgery refuses on the basis that he simply doesn't feel like it. One day he gets a call telling him that his brother, Lyle, has had a stroke. Alvin decides he needs to visit his brother and make peace for the last 10 years (in which neither of them have spoken to each other), but since he can't see well enough have a driver's license, he decides to take his lawnmower on the 300+ mile trip, dispensing fortune cookie wisdom to anyone who he happens to come into contact with... and that's it. Yes, you read that right, "that's it". For two hours we watch a tired old man on a lawnmower.The entire movie is an exercise in blandness and mediocrity. Whether it's the one-note acting, the countless repeated shots of cornfields and the open road, or the repetitive score (which recycles the same two musical cues over and over again for the entire movie). The movie is so bland that when we finally have a tender moment in the bar between Alvin and a fellow WW2 veteran we, the audience, no longer care because we stopped caring about Alvin over an hour ago. Then when he finally gets to his brother, they say two lines to each other and it ends. That's it. We don't even find out exactly why they fought in the first place, other than a fleeting reference about saying nasty words to each other.Indeed we, the audience, find ourselves saying "that's it?" for the entirety of the movie. Early on in the movie, Alvin's mower breaks down so he gets a back ride into town, buys a new mower and starts all over again. That's it. There's a scene where Alvin stops to talk to some young bicyclists to tell them that he hates being old, and then the scene ends. That's it. There's a scene where a lady runs into a deer and goes off for minutes on end about how she hates continually driving into deer, and then she drives away. That's it. There is no conflict, there is no message. The only person who really learns anything is a runaway teenager who learns the importance of family, and she isn't even important to the narrative.It has always been a tradition for conventional movie goers to wonder how critics have come to love certain movies. This is no exception. This movie, however, makes one wonder how it even got past scripting, let alone garnering the praise of every respected critic out there. There is not a single good thing that can be said about this movie, other than perhaps it is one of the first real attempts to show that G rated movies don't only have to be for the kiddies (though this movie probably should have been rated PG for some mild language and alcohol use, but it's a minor quibble really), but that effort is not enough for me to even consider this piece of celluloid to be anywhere near watchable or recommendable. All I can say is thank heaven that I didn't have to pay to see it.one half star out of five *I'd give it zero out of five, but even I recognize that it takes a lot of effort to make even a bad movie so the half star is for the hard work that went into it. Aren't I generous?*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The straight story is the sad yet realistic view of a man's struggle to see his brother on his death bed and rekindle a childhood friendship which had once been so important to him. The story is a brief glimpse of the events that occur on his journey to his brother and the reflection of the past. The worst thing about being old is when you remember when you where young. The simple yet descriptive story is a realistic picture of what life is when you are old and the picture portrayed is not pretty. Thus the Straight story may leave you reflecting about your own life and questioning your past and give you a new perspective to look at life.</fullReview>

This is achieved by making the strangeness and unpredictability subtle enough that it could go unnoticed. I laughed hysterically during one scene - the main character, who has been travelling long distances on a lawnmower and generally acting weird throughout the film, is asked something along the lines of whether he was concerned travelling and potentially interacting with "crazy people". It was also very entertaining that few characters in the film remarked on his mode of transportation. The conclusion of this film was left open-ended, rather than tying up with a snap cheese conclusion... another aspect which is highly unusual for a Disney or G-rated film.</fullReview>

I've always thought that only a true genius can really make a G rated vehicle insightful and appealing to an adult audience, and Lynch proves to me that he is not. This movie is terribly boring, ordinary, and his camera shots become so predictable. This one certainly and thankfully does not have the charm of continuously sickening the audience with Lynch's gratuitous and nonsensical trash, which is really the only thing courtesy of the G rating. So, when the trash isn't there to masquerade as weirdness, what are you left with? Well, of course you're still left with the boredom, weak plot, characters with whom you can't identity, and an empty feeling at its lack of resolution.

		<shortDescription>Lynch is getting old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quasi-Spoilers: Regarding my evenings with David Lynch, the first, second and third times were all charms; the fourth, a bomb. Respectively, these times were: The Elephant Man, Twin Peaks: FWWM, Lost Highway, and The Straight Story.Going into 'The Straight Story,' I was not worried that my opinion of Lynch would be threatened; after all, he had shown me with 'The Elephant Man' that Lynch can do sentimentality, but in this latest film the sentiment lacked the Lynchness. The beginning was great. Use of horizontal panning and life-like conversation (not afraid to put in akward pauses and such, like when the grabber is being bargained for) makes the movie more real and watchable. The characters were interesting as usual, the music is as good as can get with using the same tune throughout, and a variety of unique camera angles are used. Having him travel by mower is such a good idea, and I was surprised that the taking to the road coincided with a downturn in the movie. All the subtle and enjoyable indiosyncratic Lynchities I've been speaking of were replaced by sentimental rubbish. Many of the morals learned throughout the travels were stated metaphorically and indirectly, which eases the dislike I have for such movies, but it was not enough. Sentiment alone has been tried ad nauseum, there has to be something more. Lynches typical nuanced style could have surely solved this lack, I'm not sure why he abandoned it. The only answer I can reach is that Lynch is becoming elderly, perhaps senile, and the average hollywood clap trap is accepted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But I didn't. I LOVE David Lynch; indeed some of my favorite films are his ("The Elephant Man", "Blue Velvet") and I love his style. I think I knew there was something wrong when I saw the titles-- "Walt Disney presents... a film by David Lynch". Despite the wonderful heartfelt performance by Richard Farnsworth, and some great cinematography, this film is just too slow for me. I guess I could have anticipated that based on the fact that a lawn mower IS slow. But a film doesn't have to move at break-neck pace to have something really important to say, and to say it well. This movie didn't do either, I'm afraid.I did also appreciate the score by the Twin Peaks composer, and some scenes were very good-- the bundle of sticks, the low voices in the background (someone said it was a sound problem but I credit David Lynch for his realism-- were we far away from these people and that's how they would sound-- not up close like they were speaking into a microphone the way a "normal" movie would have you believe), the way the daughter's story is exposed, and so on.Overall I gave it a 6 out of 10-- I was disappointed and cannot recommend it to others.</fullReview>

It was the way he chose to travel with his riding mower by getting him closer each day to his ill brother that touched my heart and made me cry. Finally at the end of his journey reaching his brothers home and his ill brother seen how he arrived , made me cry all the more and his ill brother cried also for he knew his brother really did love him after all and to make amend of past arguments between the two. This was the most wonderful movie of all time !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essentially the opposite of 'Lost Highway'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie, even though it's not typical from David Lynch , save for some moments here and there (take the grocery scene with Alvin Straight's daughter and the clerk for an example), and even though perhaps I would never have watched it, had the director been someone else. Along with Lynch, composer Angelo Badalamenti also makes the transition to produce a film score that's rather unusual based on the career record. And it's not only the irregularity by way of which their - Lynch's and Badalamenti's - performances match. They both weave brilliance out of the most linear/straight simplicity.The film does sometimes go very directly for the tear-drop effect, but does so so openly as an old man finding unexpected audience, in you or any other stranger, would, in telling his story. You can't help but accept that as fair and be understanding to the whole venture. Richard Farnsworth shows us an especially likable character. He's witty, he does surprise you sometimes how much. At one point or another you'd think now he's surely in a dead end, but then he already seems to know the way on. No spoiler in telling you he uses a lawn mover to start with... A film full of respect after which you'll look at the star-filled sky and think, instead of the loneliness of standing on a planet speeding through empty space, making no sense, of how just a little care for each other can make this a great place.This film is essentially the opposite of 'Lost Highway'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While mostly true to the facts, depictions of life in Iowa are not realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up and currently living in Laurens, Iowa (the home of Alvin Straight) where it all began, and where a large portion of the movie was filmed, we rolled out the red carpet for the film crew and everyone they brought into our small town of 1,500. Though small, we are not living in the past as this movie highly portrays the "folks" of Laurens. If you think that we all were in the same mindset and living quarters of Alvin and his family, think again. The Straight house, better known as the stray cat house is by far the worst looking house in the town, in fact, if it wasn't for this movie, it would have been torn down just as any dilapidated house in Laurens is. We have several large manufacturing businesses in our town that do nation wide and international wide business. As for dogs running across main street, you won't find any as portrayed in the opening shot of the movie. We don't drive old beaters for car, yes, we too in small town Laurens own Cadillacs, SUVs, and other nice vehicles just as the rest of the world. We do have running water, cable TV, and the internet. We do not dress in overalls, wear straw hats, and chew on pieces of straw as was also seen in the movie. For treating the film crew as good as we did, I feel that they did not do us any favors in return, in fact, the portrayal of our town was very misleading and erroneous. Not to mention they were very adamant in keeping the stereotype of rural Iowa alive. It was a good hearted story, but keep in mind it wasn't done just for good-hearted-ness, a buck was to be made. And if a buck was to be made, it isn't hard for them to stretch the truth to make things more "interesting".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film with a decent lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Straight Story is quite a departure for David Lynch; a man who has made a name for himself for his strange and surreal movies. It is, however, an unwelcome departure as although this movie isn't bad, it's hardly up to the high standard that we're used to from a man that has brought us such classics as 'The Elephant Man' and 'Blue Velvet'. The movie follows the story of Archie Straight; a man that doesn't have a drivers licence, doesn't like other people driving and has a sick brother that lives a long way away. So, he decides that he'll make the journey, on his lawn mower. Sounds boring? You bet, but it's not actually as boring as it could have been. Richard Farnsworth stars in the lead role, and is believable as the old man that wants to see his brother, but it's hard to say that his performance is good - simply because it doesn't require any talent to play. Archie is a typical old man, and since Farnsworth is also an old man; it's simply an old man playing an old man. The rest of the cast isn't really in it enough to make a fair judgment on, and the only other real star is Sissy Spacek. Spacek has proved that she can act with films like Carrie and In The Bedroom, but if you had only seen her here, you'd be forgiven for thinking that she couldn't. She spends the film talking. very. slowly. like. this. and although, obviously, the character needed to be played like that since it's based on a true story, it's hard to call her performance 'good'.The Straight Story is very similar in nature to classic Bergman film; Wild Strawberries, in that it's about an old man taking a road trip, and coming to terms with his age and giving advice to younger people. This idea of getting old was also explored to an extremely high standard in 2002's underground hit - Bubba Ho-Tep. Here, however, the message is lost under masses and masses of fake sentimentality, of which the movie is soaked in. It simply doesn't always work, and Lynch would have been much better served by laying off the sentiment and packing in the more important things - like story. That being said, the movie does have its moments where the sentiment does work and these moments are definitely good; but they're few and far between. There is also some important life lessons in the movie, but like the sentiment; it's few and far between. The movie also uses a fade to black editing technique, which gets irritating very quickly.Overall, The Straight Story is a decent film with a decent lead performance; but that's all. Despite the fact that it's not bad, I would have a hard time recommending the movie to anyone. Although it has it's moments, there simply isn't enough of them and that makes it hard to recommend, and therefore hard to recommend not watching either Wild Strawberries or Bubba Ho-Tep instead. So yes, if I was you; I'd see one of those two movies and leave this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is an old man. He walks with two canes. He is nearly blind. He can't drive a car. His brother just had a stroke. He and his brother haven't talked for over 10 years. Alvin decides that he has to see his brother. So, Alvin sets off across Iowa headed to Wisconsin on a lawn mower. The movie is almost 2 hours of alternating boredom. First we see shot after shot of Iowa cornfields being harvested and close-ups of asphalt whizzing by under the lawn mower. Interspersed, we are subjected to the homespun philosophy of this old man talking to people he meets along the way. Most of these discussions are melodramatic, trite, or disgusting. Melodramatic - Alvin discusses his W.W.II service with another man in a bar. Alvin believes he killed an American solider while serving as sniper in France. He's never told anyone before!!! Trite - Alvin tells a group of young bike riders that the "worst part of being old is remembering what it's like to be young". Disgusting - Alvin tells a young pregnant runaway that she needs to go back to her family. Family is more important than the individual. Not only does this Kantian, proto-Nazi philosophy disgust me, Alvin had to use the old bundle of sticks analogy to illustrate it. Then there's the scene with the "woman driver" who can't make it to and from work without hitting a deer. (I guess that's funny, but woman driver jokes are hardly original.) The worst part of the movie is the acting of Sissy Spacek. She plays Alvin's mentally challenged daughter. She painfully draws out her stuttered lines. You think or hope that she'll choke on a word and no longer be in the movie. Not much to recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I know to separate the wheat from the chaff, and let the small stuff fall away."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a modern-day Homer work, a twilight American reflection and the most artistically honorable Disney film in decades, isn't merely about old Alvin Straight's journey through the drowsy hamlets and bucolic boroughs of the Midwest, but about the people he discover to notice and watch over him. You'd think it was a flight of the imagination, this Blanche DuBois pipe dream, if the movie weren't rooted in a reality, supposedly anyway. Straight is a 73-year-old man from in Laurens, Iowa, who finds out that his brother is failing and resolves to see him one last time. His sight is too poor for him to drive. He lives with his slow daughter Rose, who is hopeless at the wheel. Nor do they have a car. But they have a tractor, and the second Alvin's eyes happen upon it, he knows how he can drive the 300 miles to Mt. Zion, Wis. The first mower goes kaput, but he gets another one, a John Deere, hooks a small trailer to it, and intractably sets off.En route, we discover a lot about Alvin, including an anguished secret he has kept ever since the war. He's not an erudite guy, but when he talks, the words emerge like the bones of something very durable. The screenplay by John Roach and Mary Sweeney unearths rhapsodic balladry and profundity in the precise selection of the right everyday language. Richard Farnsworth says the lines with ideal tranquillity and sincerity. Since the film is directed by David Lynch, who deals in esoteric, terrifying films, we keep expecting the suspense to diffuse with what we feel will be obvious, for Alvin's journey to cross Frank Booth, Laura Palmer and Eraserhead's threshold. But even when he comes across a possible eccentric, like the hysterical woman whose car has killed over two dozen deer in one week on the same expanse of highway, she's not a sideshow act, and we identify with her. You can hit a good deal of deer on those country roads.Alvin's voyage to his brother is one into his past. He recalls when they were young and overflowing with awe. And his courtship and marriage. His Army service as a sniper. And about years squandered by drinking and spite. He has surfaced from the furnace of his failings as a better man, cleansed, down-to-earth, and people along the way seem to get that impression.In one town where Alvin happens after losing control of his mower, the John Deere guy he comes upon is Danny, who lets Alvin camp in his backyard. Alvin won't enter the house, for any reason. Danny's an uncommon guy, innately gentle and discreet. He personifies all of our own thoughts about this endearing old oddball. He tenderly makes suggestions, but Alvin is inflexible: "You're a kind man talking to a stubborn man." If Riordan, the deer lady, the two bickering twins on the way into town and a despondent young girl are the backdrop, so are the surroundings themselves. Cinematographer Freddie Francis understands how to stir up a countryside without making it too reassuring. There are pastures of swaying corn and grain here, rivers, woods and little bed barns, but the wind we hear sighing through the trees is a gloomy and lonesome noise, and we're reminded not of the landscape we drive past on road trips, but en route to a memorial service, or on autumn days when the roads are bare but the look of the sky and the smell of the air fill you with a meditative somberness. The faces in this film are among its riches. Farnsworth himself has a mug like an old crumpled wallet you just can't bring yourself to replace. It's been attached to you for too long.There's another old man who sits beside him on a barstool late in the movie, whose expression is like the onlooker to all time. And the actor who plays the bartender in that same late scene, the one who serves Alvin the Miller Lite, taps the perfect timbre: He knows how all good bartenders can appear like a chum bringing flowers to a deathbed. The film is such a rambling voyage that it's easy to forget Sissy Spacek's mesmeric performance as Rose, completely riveting in her behavior, mannerisms and utter altruism.The final shades are also spot on. Who will this fading brother be, and what will he say? Will the screenplay say too much or fumble for obligatory over-romanticizing? Not by any means. Simply because you have to see someone doesn't mean you have a lot to talk about. Regardless of how far you've come to see them. It's a gesture more powerful than any words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Straight Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was quite a different direction for director David Lynch (The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet) to go, and making it with Disney as well, but I had to try it. Based on a true story, set in 1994, 73-year-old Alvin Straight (Misery's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Richard Farnsworth) lives a quiet life in Laurens, Iowa, walks with sticks, and lives with his slow-witted daughter Rose 'Rosie' Straight (Sissy Spacek). One day he gets a phone call from a hospital informing him that his 75-year-old brother Lyle (Alien's Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke. He decides to go to him in Wisconsin to settle their differences, but because he does not have a driver's licence, the only transport he has to get him there is his lawn mower. So he begins his journey that will take hundreds of miles, even if it is the last thing he will ever do. Along the way he obviously greeted by some friendly and helpful people who are fascinated by what he is doing, and does make it in the end to sit with Lyle on the porch and look at the stars. Farnsworth is a good lead actor, Spacek gets a few scenes that make her stand out, and the aerial shots of the places the mower travels are good viewing. For a road movie, even though I can't see to giving it five stars myself like the critics do, it is quite alright. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Angelo Badalamenti. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true tale of a traveler, a tractor and a time to make things right again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One might think that Alvin Straight's riding mower drove him to madness, but actually, it only got him as far as Mount Zion. Indeed, fact is more strange than fiction, as is portrayed in Walt Disney Pictures' The Straight Story. A true tale of a 73 year old man named Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth ) who, in 1994, rode his lawn tractor on a journey from Iowa to Wisconsin to make amends with his ailing brother.Of necessity, this film rolls along at a crawl, but this isn't because we're watching some geriatric putt along US-18 on a John Deere at 3 mph. Well, maybe that's part of the reason, but more importantly, this slow passage of time gives Al Straight time to think; time to think about where he's been and where he's going. It gives us time to think, too. We ponder because we want to understand this person's feat and the immeasurable motives that must be moving him. Along the way, we get to see what Alvin sees, vast corn fields and repeated shots of an open sky and a very, very lonely open road.Richard Farnsworth is right on point with his blended performance of stubborn, wise and weary. Sissy Spacek plays Rose Straight, Al's daughter who has some special physical challenges which hinder others' judgment of her capabilities in a tragic way. Spacek's attempts of the disability begin well enough, but become over-done and increasingly unconvincing as the movie progresses. Because this film was shot in sequence, perhaps her gradual comfort with the character costs her the grasp on the uncomfortable inhibition.Throughout the trek we cringe, fearing that some inevitable doom will befall our traveler. Instead, we learn that his worst pain comes from his wrestle with his demons; haunting reminders of his accident untold and his words unremembered. We find out that during the war, our lawn mower man was quite the grass kicker when it came to sniping, much to his chagrin.The people in his path are surprisingly kind. Alvin even sojourns with some, at least for a small season. A run-away who seems initially unimpressed with Mr. Straight, later learns from the wisdom of years. Amid his teachings, the "who" of an old, wise owl can be heard off camera, a subtle Snow Whitish reminder that this is, after all, still a Disney production. A symbolic bundle of twigs intended to warm our fuzzy only made me worry for Alvin's tongue and dentures as it hearkened back to the little presents left for the campers in The Blair Witch Project. Dueling twin brothers, who obviously got their clothes from Uncle Jesse Duke, are taught by Al's particularly poignant and present experience. All of Straight's encounters are potentially thought-provoking and seem to have a little lesson for him, or us, or someone along the way.I appreciated Angelo Badalamenti's score, which is used sparingly and laced with overcoming pensiveness. Musically silent scenes use the sudden implementation of the soundtrack themes to make the mood piercingly lonely and sad.Richard Farnsworth was a Hollywood stunt man for 40 years before he ever began acting. The Straight Story was his final role. A year after this film, he was diagnosed with terminal Cancer and shot himself. It is supposed that he did not want to lose his dignity through death by disease. In an interview that I once read, Farnsworth stated how he could relate in a lot of ways with Alvin Straight. Richard was notorious for not using four-letter words in his movies. Seemingly a man of stubborn principle, like Alvin Straight, he did things his own way. Playing pieces of himself, an actor is often most convincing when he doesn't have to act. In this instance, Mr. Straight wasn't the only one who needed a hip replacement and found it disagreeable to ride on tractors.Alvin Straight does make it to his brother's house, eventually. What could have been a six hour drive by car became a six week odyssey by lawn mower. A saga that seems to say that no matter how the end of all of our traveling unfolds, it is how we spent our time along the way that matters most, next to the fact that we made the trip at all. It seems to me, if you were to ask about the roads of their lives, honest men like Alvin Straight and Richard Farnsworth would not exaggerate or fabricate, they would only have one thing to tell you, and that's the straight story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some hopes of The Straight Story being a good film. Maybe not full of action, but at least a touching, emotional story at the heart of it. I was very much disappointed when I actually watched it.The only impact this film had on me is that it was long, and hard to stay awake during. I thought it was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, and was shocked when I saw it was voted on the list of top 250 movies of all time. If I had to rank this out of all the movies I've ever seen it would be dead Last.To spare you the pain of sitting through this sad excuse of a movie, here's a quick summary: An old man with some issues and a hard life wants to go visit someone, so he gets a lawn mower, and visits him. That's it. He drives the lawn mower.Please, instead of wasting your time watching this, go do something more worthwhile, like plucking your excess nose hairs.</fullReview>

This movie won all kinds of Euro awards, not surprisingly the movie was backed by Euro based financing.The product placement for the tractor was particularly pathetic. Almost as bad as the FedEx commercial called "Cast Away (2000)". I can just see a product manager haggling over the tractor's "exit shot" and forcing the producer to force the director to make sure there was that last company logo close-up, and maybe even a re-write to magically fix the failed tractor. What a joke this movie is. Why should we pay to see movies that are infomercials? We shouldn't. Skip this one.</fullReview>

Hey, he looked pretty darn happy when he hitches a ride on a bus full of old ladies. So, here's a man that leaves his somewhat retarded daughter to wonder where he is for about a month, he uses corn fields for a bathroom and I'm supposed to get all teary eyed watching him ride a lawn mower down a state highway. There's a scene in a bar when Alvin exchanges war stories with another old guy and I was expecting him to reveal some battlefield trauma he'd received that would explain his bazaar lawn mower trip.

		<shortDescription>A Finely Made Film With One Fatal Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of David Lynch's, and my appreciation for his work seems to grow with each passing year. I anxiously awaited the release of his newest film, "The Straight Story", after the long drought following his extraordinary but poorly received "Lost Highway". My reward for this wait was a genuine film, with superb performances (though I admit to being moved more by Harry Dean Stanton's five minutes on screen than the admittedly wonderful Richard Farnsworth's previous two hours worth), lush photography (though after the fourth beauty pass over a wheat harvester, my beliefs about the Midwest were confirmed--God, what a dull place in which to live!), and another impeccable musical offering from Angelo Badalamenti.However, there is one fatal flaw in "The Straight Story" that prevents it from taking its place beside "Twin Peaks", "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me", "Lost Highway", "Blue Velvet", "The Elephant Man", etc., as one of Lynch's finest moments--there is absolutely no dramatic conflict anywhere to be found in the film! Any student of drama knows that in order for a drama to be compelling, there must be a dramatic conflict for the main character to go through, an obstacle to be overcome. It could be argued that the dramatic conflict in the film stems from Alvin Straight's quandary of whether or not to reestablish contact with his estranged brother, but that question and resolution both occur within five minutes of each other. After that point, Alvin Straight never wavers from his decision. Others might argue that the dramatic conflict lies in the precarious means by which Alvin chooses to reach his brother (the riding lawnmower he rides across two states). Though this argument carries more water than the previous one, the two scenes wherein the lawnmower breaks down are played very low key (one of the times the lawnmower is replaced within three minutes of screen time--oh, the suspense!), with Alvin simply utilizing standard means (money and waiting) to get the machine repaired, then he's off for another ten minutes of beauty passes of wheat fields and paved roads.To make matters worse, we are never treated to the inner workings of Alvin's mind. The traumatic history of the brothers is never delved into, nor are the actual personal battles of conscience Alvin must wrestle with on the way to meeting his brother. Richard Farnsworth does an outstanding job of passing seventeen different emotions across Alvin's face in any given moment, but this does not entreat the viewer to the impetus behind those varied feelings. This deprives the movie of both outer and inner conflict, rendering the movie well-crafted and performed, but almost completely lifeless and flat. Having said all of this, I still think it's true that Lynch's worst outings are often more compelling and intricate than many directors' best, so please give THE STRAIGHT STORY two hours of your time. There are many gems to be found here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me by a colleague whose preferences are generally similar to mine. Not this time. I knew it would be a "gentle" story, but this was downright sleep-inducing. I heard it was scenic; yes, 50% of the running time was taken up with footage of cornfields, wheatfields, harvesters, and clouds. Then another 10% was just spent on photographing the road itself, double and single yellow lines and white lines, and various wheels turning on the road. There is no story except what we are told: 73-year-old man rides his mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to visit his ailing brother. Some of the people he meets on the way are fairly amusing, but we don't have a chance to get to know them. In any case, they don't seem to be that interesting.I know that this film has been well-received by many people, but I just don't see it. There were a couple of touching moments at the beginning, but for the remaining time I kept thinking that I "should" be liking it more than I was. Sissy Spacek's talents were completely wasted in the role as Rose, George Straight's speech-impeded daughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMHO Too much cliché ! This movie could be stopped after 20 min (just after the deer scene). The photography is basic. The characters are propotypics and the dialogs look like a sermon. Why the heck did Lynch showed us the exactly the same sunset 4 times ? In other hand, the actors are really good but it's not enough to save this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the greatest thing about David Lynch's "The Straight Story" is the Disney logo which pops up before the film begins. The film pretends to be a "straight story", the cosy adventure of a heroic old man who travels across America to visit his brother, but is many ways a tale every bit as terrifying as Lynch's other features."Story" begins with shots of a Midwestern night sky. Lynch tells us its a cosmic graveyard, each star representative of "passed on" human spirits (Lynch believes in this New Age nonsense, so we'll allow the hokiness). We then get several melancholic shots of a small Iowan town. It's all quite peaceful, until Lynch begins to dwell on the grotesque. And so we see an ugly women, obsessed with beauty products, munching on food out in her garden. She's so self-absorbed she doesn't notice her neighbour, the elderly Mr Alvin Straight, collapsing in his home.Alvin is then taken to a doctor. His legs no longer work and so he is given two walking canes. The doctor says he'll be dead soon but Alvin doesn't share this news with his daughter. "He says I'll live to a hundred," Alvin lies. As the film progresses, it's clear that Alvin Straight isn't ever straight with anyone. Alvin's daughter is called Rose, but there's nothing rosy about her life. She has a mental disability and makes bird houses. Why houses? Because she lost her four children to the state when a fire destroyed her home. It wasn't Rose's fault, though. She had left her kids in the care of "someone else". But who was this "someone else"? Alvin, after learning that his brother suffered a stroke, sets off to visit his sibling in Mount Zion, a place, we assume, of symbolic redemption. But Alvin can't legally drive (he has no license), and so he hops on board his "reds" lawnmower and sets off on a slow journey. Unfortunately Alvin's mower promptly stops working. He responds by taking out a gun and "putting it down" like a wounded animal. This is the first sign that there is some violence buried deep within Alvin.From here on the film tells its tale via several symbolic episodes. Alvin upgrades to a green 66 John Dere lawnmower and passes an old woman whose dead husband rode a "reds". He then meets a young girl who says she's running away from her parents. This mirrors Rose wishing she hadn't lost her kids. Later, Alvin's pathetic lawnmower is overtaken by a crowd of young bicyclists and huge, virile trucks. "Worse part of being old is remembering when you was young," he says later. Death is approaching the old man, but what he really means is that he hates remembering what he did when he was young. He wants to atone for some hidden past.Alvin then meets a woman who has bizarrely run over 14 deer on the highway. We recall that Alvin had fourteen kids. That's a big family, but where have they all gone? Dead on a highway? Driven apart by something? Alvin, who throughout the film is associated with meat and carnality, later guiltily eats the dead road kill whilst four deer sculptures loom over his shoulder. Didn't Rose have four children? The next day Alvin mounts the deer's antlers on his John Deer lawnmower.Alvin approaches a hill, his brakes failing when he notices a burning house in the distance. The audience recalls that Rose's children were lost in a fire. Alvin, now without mower, spends the night camping out in a family's garden whilst he waits for his mower to be fixed. He makes it clear that he doesn't feel worthy enough to step foot in their home. The "nice family's" modern cordless phone is contrasted with Alvin's old wired phone. They are free, Alvin is weighed down by something.Later, Alvin shares a beer with an old man. He talks about how he used to be an alcoholic, using booze to get rid of the trauma of war, and how a priest cured him of his "disease" when he got back to America. But is this true? If Alvin gave up drinking shortly after WW2, why did drink cause the fight with his brother Lyle? Meanwhile, a man plays with a knife in the bar.Alvin meets two brothers who constantly argue. One has a bandage on his chin. He's been cut. In the next scene, Alvin makes a stop at another bar. He's on the verge of seeing his brother for the first time in years and now here he is, seeking solace in the beverage that drove them apart?The film ends with Alvin driving his mower up to Lyle's house. His engine mysteriously shuts down. He's unable to go through with it, unable to face his brother, unable to look his sibling in the face. A "bigger tractor" then approaches, shaming Alvin into completing his journey. Alvin then ambles up to Lyle's house and sits with his brother out on the front porch. They are Cain and Abel (Alvlin with two walking canes, Lyle with his able walker), looking mournfully up at the night sky; imminent death will end their torment.And so we have the tale of a man who returned from war a violent brute. He impregnated his wife, beat his children and was disowned by his family. Alvin then became an abusive drunk who cut his brother and lost his daughter's kids in a fire. A man who lost control of his car, lost his license, lost his wife and lost his own kids in an accident. And so Alvin Straight is riding his mower, not as an act of forgiveness, but as an ordeal of atonement. Actor Richard Farnsworth, who plays Alvin, would commit suicide soon after. Creepily fitting.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd be the first to say that David Lynch was a great director, but this latest offering from him just fails to push the point it tries to. Technically, it's incredible; the sweeping vistas of Iowa, slow turning windmills, and sunsets to die for.It's not even as if the concept of the movie is lacking, and Lynch includes many small gems during the story. Yet, his film is fundamentally lacking. The parables included are nothing new, and nothing close to as deep as they could be. It over-dramatises to attribute such deep effects (the runaway's return, and the cyclists' attention) to what are essentially very superficial observations upon life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When his estranged brother suffers a stroke, Alvin Straight resolves to travel the 300 miles to see him and mend the broken bridges that exist between them. Unable to walk very well, unable to drive a car due to his failing eyesight and too stubborn to accept the help of someone driving him there, Alvin sets out on the only mode of transportation available to him ? a John Deere ride-on lawnmower. With supplies in-tow, Alvin leaves his daughter at home and heads out on the road ? a road that holds breakdowns, adventures, friendships and humility.When I saw that David Lynch had made an U rated Disney film I almost did a double-take worthy of the late, great James Finlayson. But, yes, it appears that the man who has continually confused, bewildered and unnerved me over the years. However the fact that this is such a gentle film does not take away from it being very definitely Lynch's film ? the use of music, the focus on the oddities of smalltown folk and the 'quirky' nature of the story all mark it out as his, even if it is hard to reconcile the man who made Fire Walk With Me with the man who made this. The plot is simple and is no more than a series of low key interactions between Alvin and the people he meets along the way. None of them are individually moving, and the film has none of the 'swelling music, tears in eyes' moments that films often do to force emotion from their audiences; instead I felt I was given an unassuming story that has a gentle warmth that never blazes in any one scene but leaves a heat after the film ends. This is not to say it is perfect because it isn't and I can totally understand why some people are mystified about why it is so popular (even I was surprised to find it high in the IMDb 250) because it is very slow and very little actually happens.However what it does do well is to touch on the usual Lynch theme of small town America ? but here there is nothing sinister behind the white pickets, there are not ears to be found here! Instead he swings to the other extreme; everyone is good, life is slow and everyone knows everyone else. I have never been to America and don't know if it is true or not but the film makes you glad to believe it. The minor stories are warm and witty but also touching with more than enough realism to convince and, more importantly, to care. Lynch's direction is solid and the cinematography uses the landscapes to great effect with slow camera movements that match the overall feel of the movie. The music avoids easy cloying sentiment and settles for a nice little score that helps the film to tells us that it is not 'dull', it is being deliberately slow and there is a difference.The cast are pretty good although they are mostly 'good' support characters with little to them save old-worldly charm and values. Farnsworth steal the film of course with a pained performance that he easily falls into ? you believe that this man has lived a whole life and you can see the regrets he has not only in the scenes where he spells them out but also in his total performance. His Oscar nomination may have had a touch of sentiment about it but he did deserve it for such a good performance. Spacek may have a comparatively minor role but she is also excellent in a role that she could have overdone but, I think, got spot on. Support is mostly OK from people like Pearson, McGill and various small town folk, but like I said they generally have thin roles to deliver. Stanton is a nice cameo but he brings nothing to the picture except his face and name.Overall I really enjoyed this film but will be the first to admit that it requires patience and may leave some unsatisfied. I liked its slow burn of emotion and the gentle, affectionate look at small town characters but there is not a great deal to it and I am a bit surprised to find it as high as it is in the top 250 list. As a Lynch film it is both an oddity but also typical ? his usual themes but a surprisingly warm and human touch to much of it. Worth seeing for the gentle warm feeling you will be left with as well as great work from Lynch and Farnsworth but you should not approach this with high expectations ? the film is unassuming and slight, accept that from the start and you'll enjoy it a lot more than someone tuning in for one of the 150 best films ever made (according to IMDb)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I require very little of the movies that I watch. But some movies just don't cut it. This proves that once again, David Lynch disappoints. Like any other David Lynch film, this movie is about as slow as they come. This does not necessarily bother me... I made it through a six hour "The Stand" (1994), and many other unnecessarily long films. But the problem with this movie is that it is laced with intermittent doses of bad acting, and a lacking story. Watching this film is like driving a tractor to the moon... forget state lines. A few beautiful and intellectual moments shine in this film. But if David Lynch thinks that he can cast just anyone because he plans to have them sit there and stare at the wall, he is dead wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many reviews for this movie, touting it as a great movie. I have my reservations. It appeals to a very limited audience to begin with. The movie is about an old timer from Iowa, Alvin Straight, who wants to visit his ailing brother in Wisconsin, so he decides to drive the 300 miles in a lawnmower. The apparent greatness of the movie is in the courage it takes an old man to actually undertake something like this, and the people he meets on the way and what he adds to their life. The unapparent foolishness (which most people seem to ignore) is that it takes him six weeks to make the journey! Alvin cant drive, and he doesn't like travelling by bus, so he would rather spend six weeks on a lawnmower at considerable risk to himself, rather than make a day long journey by bus! He also seems to forget the fact that his brother whom he so urgently wants to see to resolve some old dispute could very well die in those six weeks, rendering his 'courage' useless. A lot of people are touched by the conversations he has on the way with people, giving them parable like insights into life - so where was his wisdom when he needed to get himself on a bus and visit his brother - wasn't that more sensible courage? The movie is excruciatingly slow at times, and besides the fact that Alvin's story is not really worth telling, it could very well be told equally well with a lot of editing. I would not recommend this movie to most people - unless they're suffering from deep loneliness, psychological problems, unresolved issues, etc like the characters themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet John Deere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picaresque, to put it mildly, this quiet David Lynch-directed character study tells its slight story mainly in images, with loads of beautiful but eventually monotonous vistas of the Midwest. It's a thoughtful meditation on what really matters in life, the unbreakable bonds of family, the small kindnesses that can change lives, etc. But Lynch, being Lynch, can't resist emphasizing the baroque aspects of the characters, and I smell a misanthrope with a condescending streak. Everybody's just a little too fat, a little too slow, a little too defined by their physical beings or minor tics. Farnsworth, as the quietly stubborn guy-on-a-tractor, is incapable of an undignified line reading or a false gesture. And there are some affecting episodes throughout; loved the utterly normal couple who put Straight up while his tractor gets fixed, and the priest who offers him meat and potatoes. Those finding profundity in this tiny, tiny tale, though, probably are looking to pronouncements like, "your brother's your brother, no matter what," or, "the worst thing about growing old is remembering your youth." These aren't earth-shaking ideas. And while it's a leisurely, un-pushy movie, all I see ultimately is a resolute old coot on a John Deere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walt Disney Pictures presents: a film by David Lynch; far from it being a crazy concept, it's a sweet little slice of great film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a truly and unabashedly serene road movie this is. Lynch, through his co-writer/wife's script, seems to understand how simple but not so simple life and the people living in rural areas can be. Veering on part Iowa-neorealist fable and in part a truly experimental feat for the filmmaker (eg how to match together the absurd yet sort of logically illogical comedy of everyday life with true whimsical overtones in visual style and choice in leading role), The Straight Story provides some measurable food for thought, however in little doses, and if there was ever a film that I might want to have playing right before I die- or even at my funeral, as some people have songs- it would be this.Rarely do actors get enough leverage out of playing kindly old people, but Farnsworth really digs down deep for something that is, actually, not too far from his real life (the aches and pains in just getting up from his lawnmower seat and walking around were truer than just in portraying Straight, as Farnsworth had early-stage bone cancer during filming) . Though aside from physical presence, Farnsworth makes an easy role not so easy. Beneath Straight's stubborn, well-mannered but no BS-in exterior, there's some demons he carries, mostly from WW2, and a life lived via good times and very bad times in the history of his family shows always on his face and his fragile eyes. It's an extraordinary turn, and it's one of those career-capping performances that many actors only wish they could achieve let alone a veteran stuntman turned character actor like Farnsworth.And as for Lynch, he takes a few playfully wicked stabs at the rural life he's portraying, though playful the key word; spouts of dramatic conflict and comedy come in the forms of a whole fleet of bicyclists riding on the other side of the road, or a woman who's hit one too many deer, or when he just has to get out of the rain- albeit there's one shot, one of the very best I've seen in a Lynch film, as Straight stars his journey and we see it from a perspective of the road as an uproarious in-joke to Lost Highway. Many crane shots and sweeping views of fields and tracking shots of the man on his mower are splendid, but it's this contrasted with how intimately portrayed the human interactions are, on levels of the goodness and occasional slow-ness of small-town folk, that scores Lynch his richest points.Although the film does end on a note that's satisfactory only in the sense that it leaves it on a "well, we made it, that's what counts" kind of level, and that it's far from being Badalamenti's best musical score overall (some of it feels like it should accompany a Quaker Oats commercial, which maybe is the point), it remains a small but succinct triumph of the aging human spirit, where the light side of Americana still has its quirks via the Lynch universe, and abstraction blends into naturalism with the greatest of ease.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not in much of a rush, was he? He must really like his brother. A lot.This is such a yawn of a film! The first half is even watchable enough and can be survived without permanent brain damage if one has the necessary mental discipline, but the second half - and particularly the last half-hour - are so S L O W that I can't see how anyone can consider this to be anything else but a forgettable mediocrity. But because Lynch made it the film predictably gets overpraised, as is the case with most of his post-"Elephant Man" movies. (It's so very easy for critics to rate this yawner highly when they don't have to sit through it; they simply know who directed it and immediately have an opinion.) Lynch basically directs the camera at the main character but nothing happens. If he'd even picked his nose once it'd have been an event! This lack of activity is in the vast majority of the scenes, while soppy, cliché Hollywood music doodles in the background - and this pathetic and highly unoriginal combination of sad-old-man and soppy-little-ditties is supposed to make the viewer fall into uncontrollable weeping frenzies. The ending is particularly pathetic. This movie is a sleeping pill the size of Arizona.This isn't even a chick flick: it's a pensioners flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A curious combination: twisted filmmaker David Lynch with the Disney people, resulting in too-slow story of an elderly man attempting to reach his estranged, ailing brother by driving a John Deere lawnmower 260 miles. The film's opening moments are quirky and funny, with Richard Farnsworth completely at ease in the lead, quickly connecting with the audience on a grounded, friendly level. Once Farnsworth sets out on his journey, the movie becomes a rather murky variation on "Harry &amp; Tonto", with the screenplay giving Alvin Straight no real dimension or interesting obstacles. Lynch seems to believe that dark, muddled bits of business will tell this story (the most enchanting moment comes early on, with Straight and his daughter watching a lightning storm from their window). Farnsworth got an Oscar nomination for his sterling work, and almost carries this film off single-handedly; Sissy Spacek has very little to work with as the daughter, but Harry Dean Stanton is moving in his moments at the finale. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Straight Story" is based on Alvin Straight who, at the age of 73 and in ill-health, made the 265-mile trip from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisc. on a John Deere riding mower, albiet with the need for repairs along the way. It took him 5 weeks to make the first 200 miles! Along the way he encountered some interesting people that produced some heartwarming dialog. The meeting of the two brothers after 10 years' of not speaking is a fine finale. Farnsworth as Straight does such a remarkable job that he really "becomes" Straight. But, how do you place a film like this among other films based on "a real story?" Films that come to mind are "Nixon", "Longitude", "Music of the Heart", "Apollo 13", "Man on the Moon", just to name a few. To me, all of these films are wonderful, and also are much more significant, are better-filmed, and are overall more enjoyable to watch.Currently "Straight Story" is rated #78 on the IMdb all-time list, ahead of such favorites as "The Graduate(67)", "October Sky(99)", "Forrest Gump(94)", Dead Man Walking(95), "Back to the Future(85)", "Bonny and Clyde(67)", and "E.T.(82)", to name a few. I don't believe it belongs there.I rate "The Straight Story" as a very high 7, or a low 8, on a 1 to 10 scale. It is a good film, but has been over-hyped to a considerable extent.</fullReview>

Not once did anything inspirational or uplifting happen, let alone anything to help move the dragging storyline along. The musical score is just horrible.

Richard Farnsworth did a good job acting, but he didn't have much to work with. There isn't anyone else worth mentioning about acting, they were all very mediocre and amateur. I gave this movie a try, I really did, but it didn't live up to the hype.

		<fullReview>This is one of those over-rated films that has you scratching yourhead with regard to the accolades heaped on it. I guess if you goto Hollywood movies, it may seem like a nice respite to seeMid-America on the big screen. However, if you're a film buff, you'llfind the story thin and the acting weak. The opening scene is very strong &amp; interesting. Sissy Spacek isthe only thing that redeems this film, however Lynch ditches hercharacter once the central character undertakes his journey(another short coming of the film). As the main characterundertakes his journey we see numerous shots of amber wavesof grain while Badalameti's score is playing (yawn). All thecharacters we meet along the way are over-acted, particularly thesmarmy couple he stays with. Harry Dean Stanton does a ratherpoor job as the brother &amp; the dialogue between the 2 is completelyphoney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like Straight Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other people might like "Straight Story", but I felt the plot didn't make any sense and the movie was boring and slow. The story is about a degenerate old man traveling cross country on a lawn mower to see his estranged ill brother. I felt the story didn't make sense because the old man had a choice to take a plane, train, or automobile, but stubbornly chooses to ride on an old, slow lawn mower. Many scenes put me to sleep and I was anticipating a better ending.Two thumbs down!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is what trash is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILERS* This ranks right up there with A.I., The Cutting Edge, and The One as the stupidest films ever created. It should have been called, A Moron and his mower. The deer scene, come on! What kind of idiot would hide the fact he is eating deer because a fake, supposed to be real, deer is looking at him? And the whole lawn mower thing was just gay. Sure, it was based on a true story, thats fine, but is shows what kind of idoits americans are when they think the story of some moron who is dumb enough to drive a riding lawn mower across 3 states to see his brother is actually good. Why cant the fool actually try flying in a plane, or getting one of the towns people drive him. Money? Sell of his stuff, or maybe he can find someone nice enough to pay his way. He's old, well if he can take driving a tractor down that steep hill, with bad brakes, and roller-coaster type speeds, I think he could take a plane ride, or a bus ride, anything that could stop him from being a moron. And the stick scene, come on? Oh, and what about the great acting, the old man walks off from a store, a few seconds later a old timer comes out and says "we'll be waitin' for ya!" It might not sound dumb in words, but its another idiotic part from the movie that has to be scene to be appreciated, or at least laughed at. In fact, that is the one good part about this movie, I laughed my head off at its stupidness. I give it a whopping Zero * out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible how boring a movie can be.The friend who selected this movie a year ago is still regretting it, we have not allowed him to pick a movie again... when he selects a movie, any other in the group will say "remember 'The straight Story'?" and he will humbly shut up.1 out of 1, today I was in good mood. And the landscapes were actually beautiful, that is true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh.. this movie is a WASTE of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe there are people raving about this film. I found it to be absolutely pointless and boring. An old man drives a tractor to another state to visit his brother... This is movie material? Why are they trying to make sense out of the actions of a real life brainless old mid-westerner?Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar - there's nothing in this movie. No underlying message.. It is what it is. An old guy drives his tractor to another state to visit his brother. Total garbage. Don't buy into the "people don't like it because it's not speed 3" trash - it's just NOT a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read just about all of the recent comments and I'm shocked at how many people actually enjoyed this movie. This movie was soooo boring I didn't even finish it, I just stopped caring. Don't get me wrong, I love David Lynch movies and Twin Peaks rocked, the guy knows his stuff and the directing is definitely the only good aspect to the film, but the rest of the movie fails miserably to entertain, I think the story in general is quite interesting but I would rather of had someone just give me a two minute recap of the movie just so I know what happens in the end because basically myself and all of you people out there have probably had better adventures in our lives and better stories to tell than "please cheer for me" alvin straight, to comment on other people's comments, If I wanted a good look at nature for two hours I can just walk out my front door and go for a walk or watch the travel/naturel channel, if I wanted life lessons from an inspirational dying old man I could have read the excellentTuesday's With Morrie again in the same amount of time it took me to waste my time watching this film, if I wanted to watch a quality flick I could have rented anything else in the store and have been satisfied, and to the person who thought this movie would be better understood by an adult and had more moral lessons than American Beauty, what are you thinking, you obviously must have had no idea what American Beauty was trying to get at, it's strange because most of my friends who are adults hated American Beauty basically because they didn't get it either or they just didn't want to, if you catch my drift,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man rides mower cross country in real time (oops told the story)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a joke played by a friend who told me to watch it.I kept waiting for something to happen.It is the worst piece of video (home movie) I have ever seen. I think it is done in Realtime.No editing.I was Very Surprised to see Sissy Spacek.It is actually very hard to write ten lines for this.that would tell you how the movie moves along. I had to mow my lawn twice while watching it.Very bad lighting, on the bright side it shows a couple nice sunrises. OK I am stretching it out nowIt is great if you need something to fall asleep to.wow..awful</fullReview>
