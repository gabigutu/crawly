		<fullReview>Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player, unhappily married to Margot (Grace Kelly), correctly guesses that she has been cheating, with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. Unbeknown to Margot and Mark, Tony knows about the affair, and wants to teach Margot a little lesson, by taking away the thing that is her life. But, being too guileful to do it himself, Wendice blackmails one of his old school friends into murdering her, and the essential thing to doing it is his latchkey.Dial M for Murder succeeds on many levels, and it is largely thanks to some superb dialogue, written from a tricksy-yet-capable script that never gets too deep. The cast are a treat. Ray Milland is an absolute gem, extremely sly and dispassionate, yet a character so full of self-assurance that one almost sides with him. Grace Kelly completes her great year (she gave an Oscar-winning performance in The Country Girl and also starred in Rear Window) by emanating the poised, beautiful being, that is vulnerable, yet oddly unassailable. And it's weird in that even though she's cheating on her husband, you care for her a lot more than him (although that could do with the fact that he's trying to kill her...) And John Williams, as the police detective, is quite wonderful.Alfred Hitchcock manipulates and enthrals his audience here like the master that he is. Each scene has a sense of direction, great pacing, and is staged realistically. Stunning full colour photography and a haunting, atmospheric score from Dimitri Tiomkin complete this great package. The ending, when it comes, feels a little too nice to be truly realistic, but that is my only major quibble with an otherwise highly entertaining, thrilling movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film for the perfect murder...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford's 1953 tale of romance and adventure, "Mogambo", the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However, what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction, Kelly made an integral part of the Master's films, becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock's idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western "High Noon", one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. "Dial M for Murder" was the first of Hitchcock's films with Kelly, and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme: the perfect murder.The movie is the story of Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), a former tennis player married to the beautiful and wealthy Margot (Grace Kelly) and living in an nice apartment in London. Life is good for Tony, until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with an old flame of her, famous crime novel writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). After that discovery, Tony spends a whole years plotting the perfect way to murder his wife in order to inherit her money, carefully planning every detail of the crime. When Mark visits London again, Tony finds the perfect chance to set his plan in motion, and as planned, he recruits Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) to kill his wife. However, bad luck and a sudden change of events will test Tony's plan's infallibility as, just as Mark points out, human action can originate flaws even in the most perfectly devised plan.Like most Hitchcock's films, "Dial M for Murder" was an adaptation of another art-form, this time a popular play by Frederick Knott. As Knott was also the writer of the screenplay, the movie remains extremely faithful to the play, although of course, not without its differences. Knott's script is wonderfully constructed, as like in the play, the dialog is witty and simply captivating, with many twists and turns that spiced up the complex plot and keep it from being boring or tiresome. An interesting feature of the movie is that oddly, there are no black and white morality in the characters, and it's easy not only to sympathize with Margot (despite she being cheating on her husband) but also to sympathize with Tony (despite he wanting to kill his wife), as the characters are wonderfully developed with very detailed personalities.It seems that Hitchcock's knows that the dialog is the highlight of the play, as he deliberately focuses on his actors and uses an elegant camera-work to frame the whole movie inside the apartment. The movie literally is shot entirely in one single room (only two other sets are used, and only briefly), but Hitchcock's classy way of using the camera allow a highly dynamic flow that never lets the movie be tiresome. This is also very helpful as Hitchcock just lets his characters keep speaking, carefully describing actions and events (when other directors would use flashbacks) in a similar way to a what the real play would be. While this approach could easily get boring, Hitchcock's use of colors and overall visual imagery simply creates the perfect medium to allow Knott's dialog to shine.Without disrespecting John Ford or Fred Zinnemann, I think that it was Hitchcock who finally could allow Kelly's talent to shine beyond her physical beauty. Grace Kelly makes her character shine with her subtle and restrained performance, specially showing her skill in the second half of the film. While often Kelly receives top honors in this movie, it is actually Ray Milland who makes the whole movie work with his suave and charming "villian". Milland's performance is simply terrific, making his character nice enough to win the sympathies of the audience, yet still frighteningly intelligent as the mastermind of the plot. John Williams appears as the Inspector in charge to solve the complex puzzle, and delivers a classic performance as the Enlgish gentleman decided to find the final answer. Only Robert Cummings seems miscast as Mark Halliday, although a lot of his weak performance could be blamed to Milland, Kelly and Williams overshadowing him with their excellent work.In many ways, "Dial M for Murder" shares many things with "Rope", as not only the two films are based on successful plays, they are also about committing the perfect murder and oddly, they are both "experiments": while "Rope" was conceived as a "movie in one take", "Dial M for Murder" was done as 3-D movie. Sadly, the interest in 3-D was dying when the film was released, so few theaters carried the movie complete with the gimmick; a real shame, as Hitchcock's use of the technology, unlike most 3-D films of its time, was conceived as a way to enhance the claustrophobia of the Wendices' apartment instead of using it to merely shock the audience with "stuff coming out of the screen" (as seen in for example, "House of Wax"). While not too fond of the gimmick, Hitchcock truly gave it a good and intelligent (albeit subtle) use to it."Dial M for Murder" is probably less celebrated than the Master's most famous movies, the fact that it came out the same years as "Rear Window" (again with Grace Kelly) may have had something to do with it too. While a subtler and more restrained tale of suspense, this is still the Master at his best, as the movie proves that when he was at the top of his game, no other director was comparable to him. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best thrillers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1954 was a big year for Grace Kelly. She played in Hitchcock's classic "Rear window" and she won an Oscar for best actress in "The country girl" and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic, "Dial M for murder". Starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings, it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of all-time. In fact, I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever, my first being "Psycho" (although I haven't seen "Rear window" yet). Margot (Grace Kelly) is married to Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player. However, she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. The two of them think that Tony doesn't know about their relationship but they're wrong; Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it. So when Mark, who lives in New-York, comes to London to see Margot, Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife. But the night of the event, Tony is unable to go. So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time. The only problem is that Tony doesn't really have something that's keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark. He has another plan, the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife. What follows this is pure entertainment at its best. As usual, Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job. Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough, Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday, the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer. But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard, the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery. He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be. Another of his great performances is in "Witness for the prosecution" where he played Brogan Moore, Charles Laughton's very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case. As for "Dial M for murder", well it's one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Hitchcock with an exquisite Grace Kelly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore. Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its gentile and bloodless ability to glue us to the screen. This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which the movie was adapted. (He also wrote Wait Until Dark (1967) starring Audrey Hepburn.) Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering unnecessarily with the material. He also has the exquisitely beautiful Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice. Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married mostly for security. John Williams is the prim and proper Chief Inspector Hubbard. He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian flair. One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache after the case is solved. Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse. For those of you who might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days. The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey. It is the clue that (literally) unlocks the mystery. There is a modernized redoing of this movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed. I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood what happened. Follow the latchkey! Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such intricacies. I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone, even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury might find her guilty of anything! She remains in my psyche America's fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco. Something was lost there, and something was gained. She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy Onassis. I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well. At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display here. Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and snug (but certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and her exquisite arms and hint oh so coyly at her subtle sexuality. She was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her ability as an actress. She had just finished starring opposite James Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress. So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I adore) look downright gawky, and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations. By the way, the "original theatrical trailer" preceding these Warner Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the "Coming Attractions"--that is, clips directly from the movie and a promo. You might want to fast forward to the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly overrated....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mostly enjoyable movie, but hardly a 'great' movie. I am most disappointed by the lack of depth in the Grace Kelly and Cummings characters, which are both one-note uninteresting roles. Grace Kelly is wasted in a passive, weak, and vapid role which relegates her to the status of window dressing (not that there is anything wrong with that!), she might as well be a nice looking piece of furniture in this movie. The Cummings role is wasted as the passion between him and Kelly is not developed, and amazingly, the tension that would exist between Milland and Cummings is never apparent!. This guy was sleeping with Milland's wife, but you would think they were best friends. What a waste. Would have been a lot more interesting if Kelly and Cummings were not such bland, cardboard harmless people and were a little more human, with real emotions (jealousy, hatred, passion, even a little evil).Milland makes the move interesting to watch as he sets his plan in motion with great charm and flair. Unfortunately, as he is the only interesting character, you kind of feel bad when he is caught in the end and the two sappy characters prevail. Oh well, it could have been a lot more 'noir' if they had not glossed over the fact that Kelly and Cummings are far from the sweet innocents they are portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All it is, is plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly, "Dial M for Murder" has a clever plot: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plans "the perfect murder" to do away with his wife Margot (Grace Kelly), who cheated on him with novelist Mark (Robert Cummings). He blackmails an old schoolmate into committing the crime and plants clues to mislead the police. But when things don't go according to plan, Tony has to plant new clues and think of another explanation to give the detectives, so that suspicion doesn't fall on him.The trouble is, the plot is the only interesting thing about this movie, and the characters are defined solely by how they can affect the plot. For instance, Mark writes mystery novels only because this explains his ability to "read" the crime scene. Most of the movie's dialogue is expository: long scenes where the characters debate the minutiae of evidence found at the scene, without an interesting subtext. The movie is known for taking place almost entirely in the Wendices' living room, and Hitchcock does a good job of varying the camera angles to make you forget there's just one set. But he did this even better in "Rear Window," his other 1954 film.Admittedly, Milland gives an enjoyable performance as the villain?truly a guy you love to hate, a clever and smiling sociopath. But Kelly and Cummings are surprisingly boring for a pair of adulterous lovers. Kelly also proves herself the ancestor of all those female horror- movie characters who go investigating strange noises in their best lingerie."Dial M for Murder" is lightweight without actually being funny?a fatal combination. Though serious concerns (adultery, murder, the death penalty) underlie the story, we're never made to feel that they are really consequential. It's a cold and mechanical movie, which subordinates everything else to the demands of an intricate plot. Contrast this with something like "Rear Window," whose plot is simple and lacking in twists, but whose characters are vividly drawn and act as though their stories really meant something. Having a clever solution to a mystery does not a great movie make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Hitchcock thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly this is a lesser-known Hitchcock film but still stands up today as an exciting thriller full of twists and turns.Ray Milland is excellent as ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice who decides to commit the perfect murder of his wife (Grace Kelly) when he learns of her affair with Robert Cummings (who isn't given much to do). In fact, Milland's subtle performance has you wanting the murder plot to work! Though it has to be said, Kelly's helpless female turn does not help in this regard either.Hitchcock's skill here is to totally involve the viewer in the labyrinthine plot involving keys, telephone calls and stockings so that at the end of the film you haven't even noticed that virtually all the scenes are in one room.If you like clever, wordy films with a touch of humour then I recommend `Dial M For Murder'. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What gets me about this film every time I see it is just how simple it is. The witty urbanity of the dialogue goes without saying (hem), the acting is stagily impeccable, and the direction by Hitchcock is limited by the small sets but masterful for all that.Cold Ray Milland plans and sets up the murder of his demure but faithless wife Grace Kelly by a virtual stranger who is urged on by the stick of exposure of his misdeeds and the carrot of GBP1,000 in used notes. Of course all of his convoluted plans go horribly or thankfully wrong, depending on your point of view, leading to an even more convoluted revised plan. When first seen when young I wasted my time because I wasn't paying attention at the critical moment so missed the point and didn't get it: the key is how did the baddie get into the apartment? It's incredibly verbose, being from a stage play after all and at times it seems nothing more than a radio show with pictures. The long scene setting and verbal sparring by Milland and Anthony Dawson is superb to hear - it's fascinating for its relentless poetry, and of displaying a now-dead world. I could never understand the attraction of 3D movies, least of all with this particular attempt, or why Kelly was continually uglified by the Hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than in here when she was playing stressed out throughout.I wonder if Hitch remembered the jokey murder scene he did in 1930 in Elstree Calling when Jameson Thomas realised he was murdering in the wrong apartment? Turn that key you have and go in, it's a remarkably literate film and as intricate inside as any lock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stage-originated dialogue sings with intelligence, wit, and an easy transition to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder," and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for "Dial M for Murder" on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948's "Rope," though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.But the dialogue, put on film here, is exceptional. I write this review having seen "Dial M for Murder" two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers, myself included, have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it's so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning, with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production, as it explains the plot background in great detail, and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out, giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though "Dial M for Murder" pretty much stays on just one small set (an apartment in London, in which we see mostly the foyer, a little of the bedroom, and just a glimpse of the kitchen), what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.And that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle, dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches, such as when Mr. Milland, as the jealous husband, kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered, and tells her: "Goodbye, my dear." The audience, having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold, cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland's plot. Mr. Hitchcock, as the director, is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience, not the victim, how the murder will go through, but Mr. Hitchcock's camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And, before we realize it, if something starts to go wrong, we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It's Mr. Hitchcock's gift at work.Dimitri Tiomkin, a very good film composer, hits all the write notes; that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks' cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though "Dial M for Murder" was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D, it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film, in much superior 2D, I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground, such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene, not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today. "Dial M for Murder" is a near-perfect movie of its kind, pumped full of smart dialogue and dazzling energy. This is one of the few play-to-movie transition that I have seen where I have suddenly become eager to see the original stage production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What does Hitchcock know about women?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock brings the successful play, Dial M for Murder by Frederick Knott, to life in a shocking new way. Adapted by use of the amazing 3D technology.This movie is unique for Hitchcock in many ways. It is shot entirely in one room, yet there is never a moment of claustrophobia. As for many movies in the early 50's, it was shot in 3D. And you will at times notice scenes that play into that, but are done with the greatest of expertise. Also he chose not to change the play at all, but rather ride it out.As the aging tennis pro or the jealous husband, Ray Milland is solid all the way through. And what can I say about Grace Kelly. Behind only Ingrid Bergman and Donna Reed, as the most beautiful and talented actresses of all time. She never fails to impress. She can be quite a darling and at the same time a spectacular bitch.Probably my favorite Hitchcock film, since it is the first one I saw. I was introduced to him very early in life at the age of 7, by my wicked older sister. For years Psycho haunted me and Vertigo confused. But I do thank her for Notorious and Rear Window. Dial M for and North by Northwest.Seems to me that Hitch was not the most attractive guy, yet like all of us he favored beautiful women. Especially blonde's. This leads me to the question of, what does a guy like Hitchcock know about women? Maybe simply, how to kill them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Do you really believe in the perfect murder? "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott "Dial M for Murder" has been adapted to the screen several times, including the films made in West Germany and Sweden, as well as a TV movie in 1981 (TV) by Boris Seagal and the film "A Perfect Murder" (1998) directed by Andrew Davis with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. "Dial M for Murder" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow. Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) is a surprisingly sympathetic villain (which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent, charm, and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart) who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money (she is a wealthy one in the family). His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold-blooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.As always with Hitchcock, his directing is impeccable, the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call "Dial M for Murder" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six years after Rope, Hitchcock released another adaptation from a play, still behind closed doors, but a lot more conventional than its experimental predecessor. Unfortunately, although Dial M for Murder is a real improvement, it is not free from flaws, of which some are recurrent with the English director.It's a shame because it started pretty well. One easily gets carried away by the flowing dialogues, and wonders where this story is going to lead to. Granted though it is a bit far-fetched but nonetheless it arouses curiosity. Unfortunately, as soon as we pass the murder (and the intermission), the script struggles a little too much until the final outcome. The second part lacks tension, suspense, but most importantly rhythm which is strongly crippling, let alone for a confined movie.Once again, and as it happens too often with Hitchcock, this is a lukewarm feature, not a total flop but not fully accomplished either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thrilling and suspense movie based on Frederick Knott's play , author of other successful and equally adapted books as ¨Wait until dark¨ and ¨The honey pot¨ . A London ex-tennis pro (Ray Milland) carries out a plot to murder his wife and then he hires a killer (Anthony Dawson who recreates his stage role) . When things go wrong , he improvises a brilliant plan B . In the city , wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice was on a tennis tour . But his plan for pulling off the perfect crime is temporarily foiled and quickly switches to another plan . Meanwhile a Police Inspector (John Williams who won the 1953 Tony Award to recreate his stage role of Chief Inspector Hubbard) investigates the deeds .Top-notch suspense film of a man plotting spouse's killing , full of sustained intrigue , thrills , a few interesting twists and entertainment . The picture , stagy at times , is formed by two parts , a Plan A and a Plan B with even more fun . Casting is frankly magnificent , the stars are excellently cast . Splendid performances from Ray Milland as a rather likable nasty who desires to inherit his wife's fortune and John Williams as an obstinate Inspector who carries out the subsequent investigation . Furthermore , a gorgeous and wonderful Grace Kelly ; Hitch arranged to have Grace dressed in bright colors at the start of the film and made them progressively darker as time goes on. Colorful and shimmer cinematography by Robert Burks who uses intelligent camera vantages , being photographed in Technicolor and 3D , which explains the prevalence of low-angle shots with lamps and other objects between us and the cast members. Thriller and suspenseful musical score by the classic Dimitri Tiomkin . The movie was skillfully shot in 36 days: August 5-September 25 1953 , by the maestro Hithcock , including his well-known touches and as usual the same appears a cameo on the left side of the reunion photograph . Rating : Above average , and ranked #9 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre "Mystery" .Remade for television (1981) by Boris Sagal with Angie Dickinson and Christopher Plummer and for cinema as ¨A perfect murder¨(1998) by Andrew Davis with Viggo Mortensen , Gwyneth Paltrow and Michael Douglas as the husband , but this time , the man he contracts to kill his wife results to be her lover .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A treat for the eyes and exercise for the brain, "Dial M For Murder" is Hitchcock's second "drawing-room perfect murder" movie, after "Rope", the latter a darker and more sinister affair altogether. Hitchcock himself in interviews played down the quality of this movie, amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as a warm-up for the more ambitious "Rear Window" which immediately followed it in his career.However. it actually has a lot going for it, being beautifully shot in luminous colour, extremely well acted in almost every role and peppered throughout with those eye-catching and brain-satisfying flourishes which so distinguished the director from the rest.Yes, it is very set-bound, betraying its stage origins and likewise very talky, especially on exposition, but it keeps the viewer alert throughout and delivers a neatly satisfying conclusion. I do wish Hitchcock could have done better with his back-projection unit (an old-fashioned, jarring trait he still hadn't grown out of by "Marnie" some 10 years later) and I occasionally found the constant too frivolous background music an intrusion, but it's well paced throughout, helped considerably by an on-form cast.Ray Milland is excellent in a kind of darker Cary Grant type persona, Grace Kelly (who'd want to murder her?) goes convincingly from loveliness to wretchedness while it's pleasing to see Robert Cumming to the fore, recalled by Hitch for the first time in over a decade ("since "Saboteur" in 1942). The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.About those flourishes..., perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly's doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself, even if one can't imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann's jacket far less kill him stone dead, but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland's unexpected approach.Yes, it's old fashioned Hollywood movie-making, but it's old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic stage murder thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Milland schemes to knock off his lovely wife (Grace Kelly) in order to support his flagging bank balance...His cause is "justified" by the fact that his wife is guilty of cheating on him...Milland develops a carefully constructed murder plan, contacting Captain Lesgate (John Williams), an old college classmate operating illegal ventures, to whom he outlines his murder scheme and then blackmails into carrying it out... The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between three different characters... Tony, done by Ray Milland in outstanding performance, is icily intense and incredibly wild. He is easily the best of the three... Grace Kelly &amp; Robert Cummings both pale in comparison, although Grace is slightly better, for the merely reason that her character is left for to do the least amount of truly suspenseful acting...The murder is set up and is deliciously evil: The defining moment is when Ray Milland wipes clean every object he touches as he explains to Anthony Dawson how to carry out the murder of his adulterous wife, thus not incriminating himself... They discuss the closing of the screen door to the porch, the placement of the golden key, and the time it will take his woman to answer the distracting phone call...Grace Kelly is the smart but vulnerable Margot... She begins her role dressed in bright crimson reds but as the film progresses and finds herself accused, her outfits become darker... Kelly is ingénue enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to be respected... Her most memorable image was on the phone, oblivious to the assassin behind her... Robert Cummings does not fare at all because of his comical face... He is the weakest cast member bringing so little to the table... John Williams is excellent as the dangerous murder weapon tricked by a clever scoundrel... but he somewhere along makes one fatal mistake...Anthony Dawson is absolutely brilliant, delightful as the eccentric Chief Inspector watching how the easy-talking husband is trying to cover his tracks... As soon as he arrives on scene to investigate the murder, there's an instant feeling of electricity... Here's a guy who can read human nature from a mile away... He takes compassion on Kelly, but unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies...The film, however, belongs to the sinister Ray Milland, the cold logic husband who designs the murder to look like a routine burglary gone wrong, and leads Scotland Yard into believing his wife is guilty of deliberate murder...Milland, a genteel charmer with an icy murderous side, is perfect as Tony Wendice... If ever there was a demonstration of venality, Milland's Tony Wendice was it: courteous on the outside, devious on the inside... We see his cheery domestic manner with his wife... He blithely sends her out for the evening with her lover, then without breaking his stride sits down at the telephone and calls Swan, the man he intends to enlist for the murder... There is something chilling about the way in which Milland operates in these scenes: Once Swan arrives, the polite smile never leaves Milland's face as he switches gears from exchanging pleasantries to blackmail and murder.. The entire scene was shot from the ceiling...'Dial M for Murder' holds its grip pretty well... Hitchcock provides the tension in many directorial tricks: Margot's unexpected change in plans for the evening; a hiding place for a key blocked by Mark at a critical moment; a stopped watch; an occupied telephone box; Margot's wavering hand holding the telephone that almost blocks Swan's access to her neck; Tony taking the key out of Swan's pocket and even briefing his wife what to tell the police...'Dial M for Murder' is a classic stage murder thriller... It never reaches the heights that 'Rear Window' did, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage thrillers ever written... The score, composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, is both eerie &amp; precarious..."Dial M for Murder" is a film that makes you pay attention. It is a definite must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's perfect film of a non-perfect crime ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Dial M For Murder", the Master signs another classic of mystery, starring for the first time, the actress who'd become the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, Grace Kelly. And as much as I appreciated the much more acclaimed "Rear Window", I sincerely believe this is one of Hitchcock's finest achievements, which is saying a lot considering his glorious oeuvre, but "Dial M for Murder" takes a special place in my heart, because it represents for many reasons, the typical Hitchcockian film, by many standards.I. Dial M for ? MurderThe Murder takes place right in the middle of the story and like in "Psycho", it's defined by what precedes and what follows, it's the emotional reward of a patient but powerful build-up while the resolution is an intelligent case of manipulation. The build-up is the construction of a perfect crime, Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, presents to the killer, a remarkable Anthony Edwards, the killing's plan as if it was a simple technical operation, following an incredibly methodical scheme, admirably meticulous if it wasn't for the purpose of killing. Hitchcock's masterful direction creates a plot within the plot, at a point you wonder if you're watching the adapted play within a film, or a film that transcended the confined setting of the play. And the second and crucial element of the build-up subtly hints the fact that there's always a human factor that undermines any attempt of perfectionism. So, when comes the time of the murder, we have these two parameters, we know how it should happen, but we keep in mind that whatever must go wrong will go wrong. How? When? Where? This is what the whole first part of the suspense is about.II. Dial M for ? MistakeWhat could have been a lazy exercise of adaptation becomes in the hands of the Master, an extraordinary thriller confined in an elegant room sometimes welcoming, sometimes claustrophobic. The handling of the space and the various objects that occupy it, a telephone, sockets, scissors, keys, the way the camera shows them or hides them till the right moment is crucial in the way they organize what would lead to the fatal mistake. We only see what the characters can see and Hitchcock's manipulative effects consists on the way he lets the human factor affect the story only during the villainous parts. As much as we don't really care for the love story, because Christopher Hummings who plays the lover, Halliday, is probably the least charismatic of all, we sort of root for the villains, because of that 'humanity' displayed by the mistake. The point is that the murder is so well crafted, that there's a little evil voice inside us that wishes it could work, but again, this is Grace Kelly, and the sight of that creature in danger immediately reverses the rooting process, and then while her hands desperately seek a providential help, one pair of scissors theatrically conclude the heart of the film and the ruthless killer, becomes a worthless killer, before falling as a victim, or a collateral damage at best. The mistake is not just a plot device, it's Hitchcock's cynical insertion of humanity in a rather cold and emotionless mindset.III. Dial M for ? ManipulationThere's an interesting trivia about the title's translation in French: "The Crime Was Almost Perfect", which conveys the inevitability of human factor like fate in Greek tragedies. It is, no pun intended, the key element of the evolution and resolution of the plot, when Wendice will exploit the mistake to his advantage. Tony Wendice is impressive, because he's simply predicted everything, and he puts the level so high, that even Halliday couldn't accuse him, although, in the way he deconstructed the murder when trying to convince Wendice to find an alibi to save his wife Margot from execution, he concluded on what could have been the true motive of the murder but he was not in the same caliber than his opponent, hence the entrance of Detective Hubbard, played by an elegant, suave and scene-stealing John Williams. And it's only justice, that he could outfight Wendice by using his very weapon, manipulation. It's all about manipulating objects, space and people and on that level, Wendice found his archenemy.IV. Dial M for ? MillandRay Milland is perfect as the quintessential upper class villain, elegant, sophisticated and absolutely and totally unflappable, and I use the word 'perfect' as the reference to the French title. A perfect murder needs a perfect villain whose perfect scheme wouldn't be undermined by any external factor, except something under his own control. The casting of Milland also works because he's the one who outshines the other characters, his wife is the victim, the man he hires also appear as the victim, when he tries to kill Grace, you can look on his eyes, that he was a 'casting' error, Milland also underestimated his wife's strength as she managed to overcome her fear and become the killer. But Milland is the only one who doesn't change, totally unflappable, he's the pillar of the film, and the film is so confident that even when he's caught, he doesn't flinch an eye.V. Dial M for ? MelodramaThe film also allows to insert some melodramatic elements to engage our sympathy toward the couple, but it's clear that this just works as the foil to justify the murder, and inspire some sympathy toward Milland, when you see him with Margot, all in white, in the opening scene, then she's wearing a bright and dazzling red dress with Halliday. In one minute, Hitchcock masterfully highlighted the treachery that would inspire Tony's crime. The love will be Halliday's motive to fight for innocence but again, it's only with the same weapons that Wendice could've been defeated.? so whether it's for murder, manipulation, Milland or melodrama, you know you'll dial a definite M for ? Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those who love to watch thriller, Dial M for Murder is a perfect one from the best director of all time. The story is so interesting and it will bind you to your seat.Recently I heard about this movie and from that time I was looking for it. I went to video library so many times for looking this title and I got it after 3 long weeks. But when I saw this movie I was quite amazed and quite pleased.The plot is superb and Ray Milland did an excellent work. John Williams even has an equally powerful role and performance.The main thing about this film, which I enjoyed most is how the story progresses and how the suspense come out layer by layer. Everything is just perfect in this film, the story, the characters, the plot. I enjoyed this movie so much.For all the fans of thriller, murder and crime, it is an excellent film. Hats off to the Alfred Hitchcock. From me its 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If the name Hitchcock wasn't attached....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading these comments you'd think that this was the perfect film. An incredible plan of the perfect murder. The problem is that none of the characters are likable, the plot contains more holes than Swiss Cheese and police that act far out of character so as not to be believable whatsoever.This movie has aged badly. The contrivances of old films are all present here. I was wondering whether this was a play of some sort and lo and behold it was. Like Hitchcock's other loser film, Rope, this one has annoying characters doing things that people just don't do. The film takes place primarily in one room, the apartment.Rear Window is a far superior film to this one. Like most films, the fawning fans gladly overlook the horrendous flaws so that they can proudly proclaim "Ooooh, it's a Hitchcock!" This is just a conceit where Hitchcock thinks he can lazily work his genius and all the fools in the audience won't notice. You will. You'll be asking yourself one question from the start, being... "why the heck not make a third copy of the key?" That's just for starters. The last third of the film you'll be groaning... don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There Is no Perfect Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London, the wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) one year ago while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is traveling in a tennis tour. Tony quits playing to dedicate to his wife and finds a regular job and she decides to give a second chance for their marriage. When Mark arrives from America to visit the couple, Margot tells him that she had destroyed all his letter but one that was stolen in a depot; then she was blackmailed through letters but she had never retrieved the stolen letter. Tony arrives home and claims that he needs to work, and asks Margot to go with Mark to the theater. Meanwhile Tony calls the scum Captain Lesgate - aka Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson) that studied with him in the college and blackmails him to murder his wife, so that he would inherit her fortune. But there is no perfect crime, and things do not work as planned by Tony."Dial M for Murder" is one of the best thrillers of cinema history, with a theatrical story supported by an excellent screenplay and top-notch performances. Ray Milland is superb in the role of the Machiavellian and cynical Tony Wendice; Grace Kelly is extremely gorgeous and sweet in the role of a wife in the 50's; and John Williams is great in the role of the efficient and fussy Chief Inspector Hubbard. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the picture of Tony's reunion. In 1998, Andrew Davis remade this movie with "A Perfect Crime", with Michael Douglas, Gwineth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Disque M para Matar" ("Dial M for Murder")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is entertaining, but isn't one of Hitchcock's greats. There isn't much suspense. Most of it is just about the police investigation and about the "perfect crime". I was searching for something to keep me on my toes. A movie where I can't stop watching. "Dial M for Murder" produces none of these things.On the other hand, it was originally shot in 3D. The 3D effects of the movie are very subtle. It's more like watching a theater play than a movie. I liked this quite a lot. It makes the film quite pleasant. I don't like those movies where 3D is all about projecting things out of the screen just for scares. I would like more 3D movies using this kind of effect.In overall, I enjoyed watching it. And the 3D is a plus. That's why I gave it 5 stars. It isn't great, but if you want to chill watching an easy film, this could be it. The 3D is definitely a plus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder-***- Must-see- Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock. Written by: Frederick Knott (from his play), Starring: Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, John Williams, Anthony Dawson.Perhaps Hitchcock's talkiest thriller deals with a former tennis star (Milland) who hatches a pitch-perfect plan to kill his wife (Kelly). Yet when she kills her hit-man attacker, Milland must go to great lengths to cover his tracks from his wife's lover and an investigator.Frederick Knott adapted his play for the screen, which is perfect fodder for Hitchcock's suspenseful interest in murder and wrong accusations. The marvelous thing about the film is the fact that Hitchcock is able to conceal the fact that the whole movie takes place in virtually one room. The quick and engaging dialogue by Knott and a stellar performance by Milland are the key attributes that hold the film together when it threatens to expose the theatrical approach other than cinema-tics.Hitchcock already reveals the clues to the picture yet we are still fascinated over the course of the investigation because of how effective he is as a storyteller. The talky aspects and the limited cinema-tics of the picture may not appeal to everyone, but Hitchcock still crafts a noteworthy thriller worth discussing and re-watching like most of his pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dial M For Murder Of The Most Mindlessly Mundane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, "The Master of Suspense" (yes, that's director, Alfred Hitchcock, everyone) has done it again. "Dial M For Murder" is yet another one of "The Master's" misfired, mediocre tales of "murder-most-foul" that honestly doesn't even come close to living up to all of its hype.Over the past few months I have watched a number of Hitchcock's most-applauded films of the 1950s (such as Vertigo and Spellbound) - And, yes, even when I take into account that they are now all 60+ years old, I still find that these films are really being grossly over-rated by (what appears to be) oddly sentimental reviewers who seem to be viewing Hitchcock's films through the hazy gauze of rose-colored glasses.And, "Dial M for Murder" was a perfect example of what I'm talking about here. This very stagy, Technicolor production took the whole idea of a meticulously thought-out murder plot to preposterously implausible extremes. And this, in turn, left this viewer rolling his eyes to the ceiling (in pure exasperation) more than you can ever imagine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, folks, I'm really trying to be fair and tolerant here about my rating and comments regarding this 1954 Alfred Hitchcock production - But, from my perspective, all that Dial M's story amounted to was just a stagy, little tale about a handy pair of scissors, latchkey lunacy and "Plan B" let-down.Well - OK - There was actually a bit more to Dial M's story than just that - But, with that said, I couldn't believe how utterly pedestrian and annoyingly anti-climatic most of this film turned out to be.With all of the talk-talk-talk (ho-hum!) that prevailed throughout Dial M's story, I was tempted (a number of times) to use the "silence" button on my remote in order to shut these gabby characters up once in a while. (I'm not kidding) Anyway - If you happen to be Hitchcock fan and love Dial M to pieces, well, I certainly don't hold that against you. But, as for me, I would never, ever recommend this truly disappointing film to anyone. Never.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to understand why this movie appealed to Hitchcock. It's a static stage play focused on expository dialogue, and final scene is long and involved yet not interesting. But apparently it was a successful play and Hitchcock decided he could make a movie out of it.Alas, the result is pretty tepid, outside of an excellent Ray Milland as a smiling psychopath. It's easy to blame the weaknesses of the film on the screenplay, but Hitchcock himself doesn't really bring much to the project. The scene outlining the crime could have been far more compelling, and I can't help but feel that Hitchcock at a different stage in his career would have made it more so. And there's one place where he attempts to open up the play a little by showing you what's going on outside the window when it's obvious that the moment would have been more effective as done presumably in the play, with the suspense generated precisely because you couldn't see anything and had to be told what was happening.Grace Kelly's simpering performance did nothing for me, but it's not her fault she was asked to play a cowering idiot. Robert Cummings didn't have much to do, but John Williams is solid as the inspector.Decidedly minor Hitchcock film that would have been justly forgotten if directed by anyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retooling the perfect murder when it turns out to be imperfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is an aging tennis pro who learns that his wealthy wife (Grace Kelly as Margot) has a lover (Bob Cummings as Mark). Tony figures out what might have led his wife astray and fixes it - he gets a real job with a real boss. But what if his wife divorces him? He'd get nothing! Realizing that getting a job may have enlarged his wife's respect for him but not diminished her affection for the lover, he spends a large amount of time figuring out a perfect way to kill his wife so that he can inherit her money. Tony has nothing personal against Margot and her infidelity, he just can't take the chance of winding up penniless. He can't do the job himself - the husband is always the prime suspect in such matters. So, he must find someone who will be willing to do the job for him. He's not the type who hangs with organized crime types, so he has to find someone already guilty of murder but yet untouched by the law and get that person to agree to do the job for him.It sounds perfect. Tony even has the lover with him as an alibi the night the murder is to occur. But everything does go wrong, and now Tony has to retool his perfect murder. Who will kill Margot for Tony? The law of course! Watch this great little thriller and see what I'm talking about.Most directors lose a step after they are in their 50's. There is just something about their creativity that just fizzles, and I say that as someone who is 55 myself. But here Hitchcock is at age 55 doing some of his best and most clever work. This one is so ironic it could be considered a film noir if not for the elegance of the players, the setting, and that great score.Just one thing that nobody ever seems to talk about much - did anybody else want Tony to get away with it just a little? He does play it icy cold and smiling throughout, but when he makes the phone call that sets everything in motion, you can see the regret in his face - the fact that he hates that this is the way that it must be. Meanwhile my sympathy was not with the cheating wife and especially the false friend Mark Halliday. The guy was sleeping with a man's wife while pretending to be his friend, even carrying on a kissing session with her while the husband went down the street for an errand. If you're going to steal someone's wife, let it be a stranger's. Don't shake the guy's hand, eat the guy's food, and accept his hospitality and take his wife behind his back too. Maybe Hitch wanted the audience to be conflicted though, maybe he was trying to add to the complexity of the situation with this added dimension. At any rate, watch this if you get a chance. In fact, watch it more than once. You'll always see something you didn't see before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Champion tennis player--retired and married to a wealthy, unfaithful blonde dish--arranges to have his spouse murdered, never dreaming of course she would fight back against her attacker, leaving the unruffled rotter to match wits with the savvy police inspector on the case. Frederick Knott adapted his own successful play, though neither he nor director Alfred Hitchcock made much of an attempt to open up the material for the screen. Instead of exploiting all the possibilities for a decadent danse macabre, the material is kept in-check; it finally seems stunted, or rather stultifying. Cinematographer Robert Burks gives the proceedings a nice coat of gloss, and Grace Kelly is attractive (though one-note) as the wife of scheming Ray Milland. John Williams, recreating his Tony-winning stage role as the Chief Inspector, out-acts them both. It passes the time painlessly, but is never more than a compact drawing-room mystery. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even the perfect crime can have one minor, overlooked detail that leads to the complete unraveling of the entire plan. The random quirks of chance can be the downfall of the cleverest man. That's the plot of Dial M for Murder, in a nutshell.I decided to make this my next Hitchcock film, because that's the kind of story that always seems to interest me. Well, the primary reason was that I'm in love with Grace Kelly, but the plot description was also appealing. Dial M reminded me of Rear Window, in a few ways. Most noticeably, the sparse (yet effective) action, and the use of a single apartment as the major setting for the film. In the hands of a lesser director, those two elements may have been a detriment to the overall quality. But Hitchcock once again works around them marvelously.&nbsp;It's not hard to guess the stage origins of this movie. It actually feels more like a play than a movie. &nbsp;And while that is in no way a negative, it does mean a lot of exposition. The story is explained to the viewers instead of shown, and because of that I cannot rate Dial M as highly as Psycho, Vertigo, or Rear Window. It's an interesting movie, and it's not hard to find yourself tense during nearly the entire last half. But the execution as a whole could have been better and less expository.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Revenge of Civilized Palaver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looks to me as though Hitch was marking time with this pre-digested package until better material came along, which it did with Rear Window (1954). Halfway through this static exercise, however, I started taking notes so I could keep up with all the plot complications. I had to write fast.The trouble is the movie's so full of contrivances and polished British gentility, it had me yearning for Sam Spade and a straightforward slug to the gut. At least that would have interrupted the endless talk and civilized palaver. In fact nothing riles the oh-so, civilized Wendi (Milland), ? for example, seduce his wife and he says, "Okay, have a glass of port"; arrest him for murder, he says, "Okay, have another glass of port". I may simplify to make a point, but it's like Hitch is trying to prove something about the British. However, in my book, whatever it is, it's not good.This is one of the few Hollywood movies that films a stage play like a stage play, requiring only a one room set. Couple that inbred space with endless palaver, a tortuous narrative, and 100- minutes of run-time, and you've got one of Hitch's weakest, most oppressive entries. And pity poor Grace Kelly who gets mostly to stand around and look befuddled?probably trying to figure out the latest wrinkle.Now I may not be the brightest bulb on the block, but I'm betting that only the rotund master's name keeps this entry afloat on anyone's list of goodies. Too bad someone didn't save the idea for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, where the stage play would seem more workable. And to echo the obvious? Please, please, tell me why the cerebral Wendice can't count to three when it comes to latch keys, except, of course, that a locksmith would undo the entire premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this again, but I will make this comment on a viewing I had many years ago.I was sponsoring some research on human interfaces, and the center of expertise at the time was coordinated by an Air Force Lab out of Dayton Ohio. Some of the more clever guys at the lab had connections with hobbyists in the area, and also with local film enthusiasts connected with the city artfilm theater. They'd arranged for a reconstruction of the three-D version of this. I made a special trip for what was billed as the only week ever this would be shown.It was originally filmed in 3D, using an unusual process. Two cameras made two color prints. These were delivered together to the theater and shown with two synchronized projectors on the same screen through polarizing lenses. Polarized glasses allowed the viewer to see color 3D.Almost immediately after release, the process was abandoned because the projectors required amazing skill and were extraordinarily complicated, expensive and unreliable. To reconstruct the original effect, several years went into the location of most of the original projectors so that parts could be cannibalized to create the complete kit of Siamese twin projectors. Some missing precision parts may have been fabricated in a spooky government research lab; I cannot say. That was only the first impossibility.What had happened shortly after the film was released over 50 years ago, within a few months, was that the left and right prints were separated and distributed as "ordinary" versions. To reconstruct a pair, you need to have every single frame match. But no prints had all frames complete. Some had been edited by exhibitors for various reasons like time. Others had been broken and respliced and some of those repairs even reversed. Some had frames snipped to create publicity stills. Still others had both some left and some right elements.It apparently was a tremendous effort to scan all prints a frame at a time and reconstruct a matched pair. A previous 3D version had been released, but it was no help, in fact unwatchable. It reduced the process to the older black and white and didn't do the matching this team did. Its horrible, and not even 3D in some places.So I made a special trip to see this in Dayton as it was intended. Hitchcock made this in his spare time while preparing for his masterful "Rear Window." It was already a hit play, and his contribution was to design the blocking for 3D. Its important because Hitchcock was a master in advancing the notion of a spatial camera, a space-savvy eye. Some of what he did here is not only extraordinary on its own, but it can be seen as a sort of sketchpad for some of the indirectly referenced effects on "Rear Window." So if you are interested in the world, then you are interested in film in space, and then "Rear Window," and as a result this in 3D.I not only saw this, but arranged to have the optimum seat in the house. And the place was packed with some of the most enlightened viewers I knew and the swelling of sighs at points was palpable. It was an extraordinary experience. The vision research lab was destroyed shortly thereafter because of Republican actions in Congress. I believe the reconstructed projection machinery was effectively lost forever, so the window may have closed to see this properly.You'll have to extrapolate the 3D effects from a two-d print. Its not impossible I suppose. I'll give you some clues. He places the camera in one of three modes, alternating among them depending on whether we are colluding, witnessing or dissecting. (The trial scene is excluded from this.) Obviously, these viewer modes are interleaved appropriately with which character we conspire with: the husband (a performer), the boyfriend "mystery writer," or the detective. Its easy to work out and quite thrilling to see how he has "dialed" the vision.This is a replacement comment, the original having been deleted (along with scores of others) by a reader unhappy with comments elsewhere I made about an unrelated actor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Laid Plans of Mice and Men often go awry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a testament to the above mentioned proverb. After finding out that his wife Margot is having an affair with an American writer named Mark, ex tennis star Tony Wendice is enraged to a point where he wants to murder her. But before doing so, he wants to take possession of her money and property as she is the richer of the two. Thus, he concocts what he believes to be "The Perfect Murder Plan". He blackmails a former college friend Charles Swan, who has a rather murky past, into doing the dirty work while he himself goes to a party, thus giving the perfect alibi. He meticulously plans out every detail right down to making it look like a burglary gone wrong. But the above mentioned proverb takes effect and Swan is killed in self defense by Margot. Having no other choice, he improvises a new plan to cover his tracks and make Margot look like the killer. What happens next is the rest of the story.Hitchcock lives true to his nickname "The Master of Suspense" by directing a movie that to this day, keeps those who watch it on the edge of their seats. Just like with his masterpiece "Psycho", he has the ability to build up anticipation in every scene and spill it all in an exciting climax. Very few modern-day crime movies are as good as this one and that says a lot. The acting is good as well. Ray Milland portrays Tony pretty well while Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings are almost as good in their respective roles of Margot and Mark as are John Williams and Anthony Dawson in their roles as Hubbard and Swan(though their screen time is relatively less). Along with good acting, you do have good characters that you could feel for as well.But of course, what I'm bothered about is how correctly Mark guessed at Tony's motives. Even if he was a mystery writer, it seems too much of a stretch for him to be that accurate. Besides that, this movie does tend to a drag a little. This is probably because, good as it was, this movie was also a product of its time.Overall, this was a pretty good movie and a must watch for movie buffs. My score-8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dial M for Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is a genius. There is no getting around that fact. I'm not saying this to placate the film school dropout we all know and hate to watch movies with; I'm not saying this to please your fifty-year-old mother who is a fan of his movies but still views Along Came a Spider (2001) as a guilty pleasure. I'm saying this because it's a fact. Vertigo (1958) is his enduring critical gift to the art of cinema while Psycho (1960) is his pulpy gift to the masses and in-between the two greats, sits 52 other spellbinding films in addition to the much beloved Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955-1961). Everyone's got a favorite and while some may get their kicks from North by Northwest (1959) or Rope (1948), my personal favorite has to be 1954's Dial M for Murder.Dial M centers on a single question that many people find themselves asking out of morbid curiosity; how do you plan the perfect murder? If it were someone close like say your wife, how would you do it? Maybe you can hire someone to do it for you. Perhaps someone you can blackmail and functions outside of your social circles. Someone compliant enough to be exploited and use laundered money to pay them for their services.Indeed the supposed murder planned by Tony (Ray Milland) is set up like a beautifully played game of chess. As Tony coldly explains his plan to murder his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) to Swann (Anthony Dawson) his hired assassin, every angle is thought through. Every movement is calculated and timed, every detail addressed. Unfortunately for Tony, Swann and the rest of the principle characters, "the best-laid plans of mice and men oft go astray."Dial M for Murder is my personal favorite Hitchcock film primarily for three reasons. Firstly, the film is shot almost entirely on one set, in one room of one domicile. There is a short scene in a jailhouse, one in a theatre and one in the bedroom of the flat but every important plot point and reveal takes place in the den of Tony and Margot's apartment. Limiting the space like that can be an advantage in that it heightens tension though very few directors can truly do such a thing well. To my recollection the only modern example to come close to chamber-proximity sustained suspense like Dial M was Joel Schumacher's Phone Booth (2002).The second reason I enjoy Dial M for Murder is its unabashed British-ness. I mean this in two ways; The characters are Torrie upper-crust types who always have a snobbish one-liner to spare. Additionally British movies of the era expect audience investment and even participation in the intrigue. Modern sensibilities tend to favor simple action centered plots we can all easily follow. Modern studios do this largely to cater to international audiences who don't want to be bogged down with subtitles and Americans who want to fiddle with their phones, fold their laundry and check their Facebook all while watching Bad Boys II (2003). I find myself doing this from time to time while watching movies but never with Dial M.The third and most important reason why I love this movie is because you know exactly how it's going to end. Not in the "know how it ends" kind of way of say every stupid, pointless, unoriginal, mediocre horror movie ever made, but rather in the way of we know Tony (spoiler alert) gets his comeuppance, we just don't know how. The characters Margot, her "friend" Mark (Robert Cummings) and Detective Pearson (Patrick Allen) are left in the dark for most of the movie. Only the audience is privy to all the dirty details of Tony's deceit and yet the question is left; will he get away with it? On that level the movie gives you a artfully done suspense thriller without a sub-par mystery cheapening the story.Alfred Hitchcock is said to be the master of suspense; a title certainly worthy of such a giant figure. His films have a complexity that leaves many to fervidly comb his filmography for interpretation. Whether you're a fan of a psychoanalytical approach to Hitchcock, a post- modernist or auteur theory habitue, you have to admit Dial M for Murder needs more credit than its been given which, up until today has been seen as a "lesser work". Don't be taken in by those in the supposed "know". Check out Dial M, and while you're at it, check out some of Hitchcock's other "lesser works" like Lifeboat (1944) and I Confess (1953).http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension combined with great acting results in a Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the first time in 2013, and I can honestly tell you that is better than many big budget thrillers made these days. It had everything, drama, tension and some action. All these combined with some great performances of Ray Milland and Grace Kely. This was the first movie I ever watched starring Ray Milland, and I can tell you that after watching this movie I declared myself a Ray Milland fan. He is so natural and such a believable actor. The script is very well written. It's so intriguing and catching, that you won't even notice the whole movie is happening in one room. Dial M for Murder is one of Hitchcock's best movies in my opinion. Movies like this, never get old. They might get better though, so if you haven't seen this movie yet, I envy you, and you should see it right away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller but in my opinion not the classic many seem to think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is set in London where ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) &amp; his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) live together, an American author Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) visits &amp; rekindles an affair with Margot. With Margot being the rich one Tony fears that if she leaves him he will be broke even though the relationship is a front, since Margot has left her fortune to Tony in her will he decides to commit the perfect murder. Tony blackmails small time crook Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson) into killing Margot, Tony says he has devised the perfect murder &amp; that no-one will suspect anything but even the best laid plans can encounter problems &amp; on the night of the murder it's not Margot who ends up dead...Produced &amp; directed by Alfred Hitchcock this thriller was based on the 1952 Broadway stage play by Frederick Knott &amp; he also wrote the screenplay here, very talky &amp; exposition heavy with only one main indoor location you can certainly see the stage influence here &amp; while Dial M for Murder is a solid film I personally don't think it's a classic. Although very talky barely a line of dialogue is wasted as a complex plot of murder, blackmail, adultery &amp; detection is painted over it's rather excessive one hour &amp; forty five minute duration. One big problem I have with Dial M for Murder is that there are no mystery elements here, nothing is ambiguous &amp; it's all far too obvious whats going on as it's spelled out very clearly during it's numerous exposition scenes. While Dial M for Murder is a decent thriller the fact that nothing is ever a mystery &amp; who did it &amp; how it was done &amp; exactly what happens is made perfectly clear I did sit there watching but not really getting involved. Also the climax in which Tony is very confusing as it's all about a key, where it has been, where it is, where it should be &amp; the film just left me behind a bit here as you can't keep track of who has what key or or the movement of the key as again it's all talk rather than say a flashback which would have made things clearer. The character's are good &amp; Inspector Hubbard reminded me of Columbo, in fact the film itself reminded me of a Columbo episode with someone committing an apparently perfect murder before a nosey &amp; clever cop figures it all out as he pesters the suspect &amp; has endless questions.Dial M for Murder was a stage play &amp; it's easy to see here, there's only one main location &amp; that's indoors &amp; it has lots of people sitting or standing around talking with little action. Originally shot &amp; briefly released in 3-D some of the compositions are obvious with strange placement of foreground objects although I doubt the 3-D changed the film much. Being from a more innocent time there's no swearing but someone is stabbed in the back with scissors. You know Dial M for Murder is rated number nine on the American Film Institutes ten greatest mystery films but again I will say that there is no mystery here, it's all made perfectly clear from the word go what going on &amp; people's motives are also very black and white.With a supposed budget of about $1,400,000 this is unspectacular stuff, it's very static &amp; stagy but I am sure that was intentional. Although set entirely in London this was filmed in California. The acting is alright, it's not terrible but again there's a lot of standing around.Dial M for Murder is a good solid thriller, I enjoyed it for what I was &amp; can certainly see the Columbo influences here but there's no real mystery going on &amp; there's no great twist either. I don't know, it's good but I certainly wouldn't cal it a classic or even one of Hitchcock's best. Remade numerous times for telly &amp; as A Perfect Murder (1998) with Michael Douglas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 3D, it's murder it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Middle tier Hitchcock but still one of the finest mystery thrillers around. Ray Milland plays Tony Wendice, a former tennis player married to Grace Kelly's Margot, the source of his wealth. Fearing his lifestyle is about to come to an end due to her dalliances with American mystery writer, Mark Halliday {Robert Cummins}, Tony hatches a plan to have her murdered by an old acquaintance whom he has over a barrel with blackmail. However the plan backfires and a whole new strategy is needed to save Tony from suspicion.Based on the popular and successful play by Frederick Knott {who adapts for the screenplay here}, Dial M For Murder was a film Hitchcock had little time for. In fact having already started work on Rear Window, Hitch treated Dial M For Murder as a jobbing assignment. His mood was further darkened by Jack Warner's insistence that the film be shot in 3D, with all the camera restraints that such a production brings. Perhaps unsurprisingly tho, the restraints and general mood of the director brought about very interesting results. Choosing to go for a claustrophobic single set shoot, Hitchcock resisted the urge to launch things around for 3D effects, instead he used the process to highlight props and angles of the Wendice home. While his use of colours here is first rate, particularly around his new found favourite actress, Grace Kelly.Having never seen the 3D version {who has I wonder?} I can't say what impact, if any, the gimmick had. But regardless of Hitch's grumblings and general disdain towards the film, he rose to the challenge by challenging himself and actually produced a fine and technically sound picture. Ray Milland is icy cold yet debonair, while John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard strides in and walks off with the film. Kelly is adequate enough {it's her least effective turn for Hitch} but Cummings is awfully bland and threatens to lose the film its momentum as things spice up in the last quarter. Hugely entertaining story tho, and of much interest to Hitchcock purists, Dial M For Murder holds up well today as a disquieting mystery thriller. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sympathy For The Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Wendice has everything you might want in life: A mantel full of sports trophies, a cushy lifestyle, lots of booze, a rich and attractive wife, and a foolproof plan for killing her so he can inherit all her money.We shouldn't like this guy, yet we do, because of a script by playwright Frederick Knott that presents Tony as the victim of his wife's adultery, a performance by Ray Milland that presents Tony as a charming and able foil for many cruel twists of fate, and subtle direction by Alfred Hitchcock that invites us the audience to feel closer to Tony than we do to his victims.The three elements work together at key moments. Wendice has taken great pains to kill his wife at an appointed time, only to find himself with a busted watch. Then he goes to the phone booth to make a call that will deliver his wife into a killer's hands. But the booth is occupied.Milland's eyes go buggy. We worry about whether he will be able to pull off his great scheme, perhaps forgetting the magnitude of his planned crime, perhaps just judging it less serious than the wife's adultery as Knott and Hitchcock have been encouraging us to since the beginning of the picture without our noticing. Then Hitch lets Milland make his call. As the crime is carried out, we finally have a jolt of fear for the wife, played by Grace Kelly at the peak of her beauty. Then tables are turned, scissors beat stockings, and Milland's face falls in an exquisite close-up. Our morbid sympathies are back in his court.Hitchcock fans are down on "Dial M For Murder" because it is played pretty straightforwardly on the surface, with little visual trickery. What we do get, like a phony finger poking through a hole in a telephone rotary and an abstractly staged and lit courtroom scene with Grace Kelly giving her deer in a headlights impression, is weak. Grace Kelly gives an inert, unconvincing performance throughout.But Hitchcock's strengths as a scenarist outweigh much else, and he finds a lot of help not only from Knott's script but a score by Dimitri Tiomkin, cinematography by Robert Burks, and set design by George James Hopkins. If we are to be stuck in one place again, like in "Rope" and "Lifeboat," it might as well be a posh London flat crammed with period charm and detail.I even think Robert Cummings is a plus here. You quickly dislike him for his smoothness and nerviness as Mark Halliday, the other man in this love triangle, but of course you are supposed to. In a great documentary that comes with the "Dial M" DVD, Peter Bogdanovich suggests Cummings represents "subversive casting" on the part of Hitchcock, designed to get us to like Milland more. I'll go further and say that Cummings was a knowing co-conspirator, communicating Mark Halliday's smug contempt for Milland's character in subtle ways throughout the film. When he approaches Wendice with his brilliant idea for having Wendice claim that he set his wife up and thus help her avoid execution, we actually resent this ploy despite its inherent validity. Of course Mark wants Wendice to cop a plea: Mark can then get the girl and profit from Wendice's misguided devotion. Lucky for Wendice he's beyond such tricks...And there's the rub. We root for the murderer because he's getting his own back. Never mind that killing people is far worse a crime than cheating on them. This film sticks a magnet on our moral compass and leaves us to work it out long after the last scene, where Tony's sociopathic depravity is laid bare in Milland's best on-screen moment. Chips down, he manages a final wink and a cheery smile as his wife watches with tear-filled eyes. Give the devil his due and he'll steal your soul, but you may be too charmed to catch yourself being swindled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know this is nitpicking but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in many filmed plays, the camera goes in too close. The scriptis full of effects that need the audience to see the whole picture -one character sneaking a key and hiding it, the other oblivious. Ifeel sorry for the main couple living in such a dreary flat: one smallliving room and bedroom. As in Rear Window, I wonder where theykeep their clothes and books, and where the bathroom is. Andpoor Margot leads such a dull life! When her husband goes out,she is torn between mending stockings, sticking in newspapercuttings or going to bed with the radio.I can't understand others' comments on the brilliance of JohnWilliams as the inspector. The character is obviously meant to be droll, forcing the murderer to reveal himself by pretending to be amere bumbling cop, but Williams to me doesn't bring this out atall. He loses opportunities to be funny, eg wrestling with Margot'slover to get at Tony's bank book, sending his constable off with herhandbag - Not like that, you'll get arrested!Still worth watching, though. Even lesser Hitchcock is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable if stagy thriller ? more a stage play than an example of classic Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to get his hands on his wife's fortune, washed up tennis star Tony Wendice plans to have her killed. In a carefully planned plot, he approaches a small time conman and blackmails him into helping. However the carefully planned set up goes wrong and Margot kills Swan in a struggle. When the ensuing police investigation assumes that Margot set the whole thing up, everything appears perfect for Tony. However, there is no such thing as the perfect murder.Although it is very much a stage play rather than a film, this still works well as a thriller due to solid (if unspectacular) performances and good direction. The film s split into three main acts ? the planning, the deed and the conclusion. The planning is easily the most enjoyable part as it moves quickly and seems to have everything tied up. The deed is good as we begin to see little things go wrong and the conclusion is enjoyable as the pieces are put together. The plot is quite straightforward, but it's strength is in it's logic ? both in set up and conclusion. It is a little dull at times due to it's static location (almost 100% of the film is in the flat) but Hitchcock does manage to deliver real tension at key moments.The gimmick of 3D (as the film was originally shot to be) means that the film is cluttered with shots of action in the background and furniture in the foreground. It all feels slightly weird to have such a good director frame his shots in this way but it is not too obtrusive. He does better with the dramatic stuff and manages to give a cold, logical air to the planning stages and also makes the actual murder scene very dramatic.The cast deliver quite polished performances without every stretching themselves outside of the character they have been placed in. So Kelly plays the bewildered wife well, Cummings is a typical tough jawed American and Dawson is a bit of a sub-Terry Thomas. However it is Milland as the coldly English plotter who makes the film quite watchable in it's first act and is very enjoyably `English'. The final act of the film is made to feel different enough to enjoy due to the input of Wiliams as the Inspector ? he is witty but also a good match for Tony.Overall this film is a little too stagy for it's own good but it is still a solid little thriller. The setting make it feel a little too confined and staged than was necessary, but Hitchcock is able to use the location well rather than be hampered by it (3D aside). An old fashioned detective film in the style of a B movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock plays playfully with plays.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIAL M FOR MURDER is no masterpiece - its source material, though amusing is too mechanical and obvious, with an unravelling that is disappointingly implausible. Grace Kelly is a terrible actress, but she doesn't even have the crutch of her legendary beauty here, as her humiliation goes hand in hand with increasing dowdiness. And yet the film is a must-see: not only because every Hitchcock film is rich in style and meaning, but for two cherishable performances from Ray Milland and John Williams; for an extraordinary, abstract courtroom scene; and for a remarkable play with theatrical metaphors.Robin Wood sees many Hitchcock films as analyses of marriage, and DIAL M FOR MURDER is no exception. Even from the beginning we know there's something wrong with the Wendice union - the opening clench is theatrical, cold, unreal. The family home is not comforting, but made strange: objects don't blend in, but are threateningly present (lamps, drinks bottles etc.), always getting in the way of human communication (the telephone is an apt metaphor for the crisis in the film). In a traditional detective story, it is through the displacement of ordinary items, taken for granted, that marks a rupture - the everyday becomes frightening.Wendice is unable to satisfy his wife - he is only interested in her money. when he talks to Swan about his marital difficulties, he walks with a cane, ostensibly a fake prop, but a clear hint of the impotence rejected when he drops it and talks of the murder that will reassert his patriarchal role. He is like a servant in his own home, dependent on his wife, serving her and her lover drinks. He is probably gay - the handbag which has been transferred in association from his wife to him, is made the butt of a homophobic jibe by Inspector Hubbard.Most importantly, the conjugal home resembles a stage set. This is the governing motif of the film. Hitchcock subverts the hokey sentiments and values of Knott's play, by drawing attention to its staginess. Props are foregrounded; Wendice is clearly a stage director/author who is putting on a play (planning the murder of his wife). He talks to Swan like he's a director instructing an actor, giving him his lines, showing him round the stage, telling him what to do, where to move; crucially, giving him his cue, timing, the 'call'.However, although Wendice seems in control, the gaze of the film does not belong to him - his authority is already undermined long before his plot unravels. Frequently filmed in distanceng wide angle, this scene with Swan is shot from above, spied on from a seemingly unmotivated, godlike position, which only emhasises the unreality (theatricality) of the sequence. There is another author beyond Wendice, who is really running the play. Is it God? Fate? Hubris? This position of authority is jostled for by the four male characters, in a frequently homoerotic manner.The only time this kind of shot becomes motivated, it belongs to the Inspector, suggesting that the law is the godlike arbiter, from whom nothing can be hidden. And this is true, but not reassuring: the Inspector is cold and detached; but, more unforgiveably, like the other male characters, two of whom tried to murder her, he sadistically inflicts pain on Mrs. Wendice, pushing her out of the story, in effect succeeding where Wendice and Swan failed; she is absent for most of the film's second half. The law is shown to be both frightening and whimsical, rather like an Old Testament God. This is not comforting.This link between the author and authority, both trying to shape meaning, and 'create' truth, while in reality concealing it (Hubbard's assertion of patriarchal truth denies Mrs. Wendice's emotional reality) is linked to a story which is invoked in the film's opening MacGuffin, the stolen letter. Poe, a favourite of Hitchcock's, wrote 'The Purloined Letter' about a missive stolen by a respectable government minister, form a Queen possibly enjoying an adulterous relationship. What's written in this letter, and who controls it, becomes a site of power between the two male characters, who squeeze out the female character, who owns it, altogether. Knowledge, authority, power, and the artist are linked, all are abused, all are stolen from women. Mrs. Wendice's absence in the middle of the film is the anguish seething behind the film's (or play's) smooth mechanics. Anyone who thinks Hitchcock is just a technician is an idiot. he had a profound grasp on the workings of society, and how people are sacrificed for it.He also shows the seductive appeal of power - Wendice is suave, hilarious, imperious, mandarin, the motor of the film, a joy to watch, and yet an automaton. Hubbard's victory over him relies on Wendice's working like clockwork. The author was really only an actor, parroting perfectly his fed lines. It's significant that it should be a real author who exposes him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Key Swapping Balderdash (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I scanned through all the comments on this film hoping that someone somewhere might agree with my assessment of the plot as being absurdly overcomplicated. Surely it was relatively straightforward to get an extra key cut even in the 1950s, which would have stopped all the ridiculous key swapping activities. At times, it seemed more like a magician's (con man's?) act - now you see it, now you don't - rather than a mystery/thriller. I thought it was quaint that the local police were called instead of the emergency services when there is a dead body in the apartment. Perhaps we had the ethos of your local, friendly neighbourhood cop on the beat in those days who would clear it all up quite amicably and we could all get on with our lives, and perhaps be more careful in future. Not only are keys swapped with gay abandon but also raincoats (unnoticed, of course). Not at all sure why the crime-writer boyfriend of the wife agreed to go to a stag night with the husband, just after he had admitted that he would find it very difficult talking to the bloke, who he hardly knew anyway. The whole thing just fails to be anywhere near believable. Why on earth are all the comments favourable?</fullReview>

"Dial M for murder" is not a brilliant movie or something, but it's a mandatory film for those who like a detective novel or for those who like Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those classic old school crime mysteries, here made even more a caricature with Hitchcock's name and status as the director, where one's main criticism is quite easily distinct. This recounts the story of yet another instance of 'the perfect murder', that classic theme where an evil plotter constructs a plan of near flawlessness in theory which, of course, doesn't get carried out as imagined; as often reality forces an unknown, an unlikely event which in turns creates the intrigue for the film.The said criticism is that for such a film to even happen at all, everything in it needs to follow a plan in the plot very closely, so closely it's extremely improbable such a story could ever happen, where every scene is so dependent on a very specific outcome in the next, and if one thing happens otherwise the whole collapses; and whether fiction or not, a film really should give more breathing room and space to its plot, a margin of comfort supplying just that so very important credibility for the viewer.It's a good Hitchcock crime besides that fundamental flaw, often necessary to this sort of cinema, acting/casting/dialog good, well written, pretty fun to watch... 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Storyline From Outer Space !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is #12 in a Hitchcock marathon that I'm presently on. I just can't wrap my head around how inconsistent the quality of Hitch's films are. I've found the early ones in the 1930's particularly weak. But during a time when he made some pretty good films, "Dial M For Murder" is not very good. All the Hitch "stinkers" have the same thing in common for me. The story lines are from Outer Space. Admittedly, I'm a film fan that feels that a coherent &amp; believable storyline in a film is MOST Important, but that's just me. I view a film myself to see &amp; hear a "good yarn" &amp; everything else is just icing on the cake.There are Just S-O-O-o Many UNREAL aspects to the storyline in "Dial M For Murder", that I don't know where to begin. That the husband would spend SO Much time following his former classmate to get enough "dirt" on him suggests that THIS was his full time occupation at least for months, if not years. That the husband was tailing the henchman-to-be so closely &amp; for so long, but yet the henchman was Clueless about it is very improbable. The business about the key is Just STUPID since it has ALWAYS been a simple matter to get a duplicate key made. That the BF/mystery writer put it all precisely together in the end by sheer speculation is just unbelievable. That they would let a condemned prisoner "temporarily" free to go on some unlikely adventure the day before she was to be hanged ..... Well, you get the idea.Even though the storyline was unreal, Hitch did make this a very suspenseful film through great cinematography &amp; editing. His usual technique of weird camera positions PLUS a rapid shifting of the camera focus between different details of the story was quite effective. The acting was very good by the whole cast. Overall, it was an interesting experience in my Hitch Odyssey. It's an OK film, but just OK.At this point in my Hitch marathon, I must conclude that all the "fan hype" about Hitch is just that, "fan hype". Hitch was very good, but he certainly doesn't deserve a seat on the Mount Olympus of Cinema. Sadly, at this point, I feel that although he was a great director, he lacked total control over his films, most notably the selection of screenplays. If he had more control over the selection of screenplays, he might today be worthy of the seemingly universal accolades he still gets. As far as his "cult following" among film fans, I can only quote PT Barnum's words --- "There's a sucker born every minute."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Hitchcock murder mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another excellent Hitchcock film, just one of the many that the director made which exceeded all my expectations. This murder mystery has a twist ? we know the identity of the culprit from the start, it's just a question of waiting to see whether the cast work it out or not. The film takes place in a single location, a low key apartment, much like the Audrey Hepburn thriller WAIT UNTIL DARK. It's a slow paced and talky affair with an absolutely intricate plot that's likely to tie you up in circles if you don't watch it closely enough, but of course that's part of the fun.Personally, I thought the script was superb ? one of the best, ever. Every little detail has been worked out and even if there are a couple of weak explanations along the way, you can easily forgive them thanks to how enjoyable watching the twists and turns play out is. The clever title refers to the pivotal scene, a sterling set-piece of suspense and murder, in which the lovely Grace Kelly is menaced by a sinister thug. Ray Milland is the deliciously slimy anti-hero and I love his stiff upper lip and confident air of self-assurance that propels him along throughout the movie. John Williams, a carry-over from the stage play on which this is based, supplies the much-needed comic relief and, with Milland being so darn likable, it's left to American adulterer Robert Cummings to play the guy you don't really like.The fun from this film comes from watching Hitchcock ratchet up the suspense in numerous unexpected ways ? such as the simple turning of a key in a lock. There isn't a cliché in sight, just strong plotting and decent scriptwriting. I even enjoyed this over the Hitchcock film I watched previously, NORTH BY NORTHWEST; it's one of those films where I wouldn't change a thing. I know I'm gushing, but this is a real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From time to time I try my hand at directing and hope to one day direct an actual movie, and I consider Alfred Hitchcock to be one of my major influences, which Is why Dial M for Murder surprised me so. This movie is so simplistic and so low in standard compared to what Hithcock is known for. It's pretty much his most overrated movie. The plot is like something straight out of a British soap, the acting especially from Grace Kelly is an insult to the actors and that ending ... dear god. Coming from the man who gave us the terrifying 'She wouldn't even harm a fly' scene as an ending in Psycho, a phone call and a drink is pretty much the most anticlimactic ending to a movie I've ever seen. Probably the only redeeming factor is the actual attempted murder scene. That's it. Dial M for Murder is a hugely underwhelming movie from one of the masters of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man hires a shady character from his past with a criminal record to murder his wealthy wife who he suspects of having an affair with another associate. The plan is worked out in fine detail but it goes wrong on the night when the would-be murderer is killed by his intended victim.Dial M for Murder is another film which perfectly showcases the variety of styles Alfred Hitchcock was able to turn his hand to in order to tell a suspenseful tale. In this case, he adopts a smaller scale approach, with the film being pretty stage-bound. It's a dialogue-driven piece where the action happens almost exclusively within the confines of one house. Interestingly though, I never really noticed this when watching it, which I think has to be a testament to Hitchcock's mastery of the medium, in which he can make a stagey set-up feel pretty dynamic and involving. Despite its intimate nature the studio insisted it was shot 3D to ride the wave of popularity the format experienced briefly in the early 50's. Hitchcock obliged although he refused to pander to the gimmicks of the format and used it in a more subtle manner, although it is admittedly used quite strikingly in the attempted murder scene where a hand reaches out to the audience somewhat memorably.This seems to be a Hitchcock which generates quite mixed responses. But for me, it's definitely an upper level entry. Its plot about the execution of the perfect murder is one where we sort of know where it's ultimately going to go, what we don't know is how we're going to get there and I thought the story was masterfully paced and plotted. Its character-driven nature means it's a film set-up perfectly for actors to stand out. And the one who rises to the top is Ray Milland, who stars in the central role of as the villainous husband. It's a very dastardly character and Milland plays him with some relish. Grace Kelly, as his wife, once again has effortless screen presence, while Robert Cummings as her lover has a pretty cardboard role but he does okay with it. All-in-all, very entertaining stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another solid Hitchcock thriller that really doesn't waste a second on anything that doesn't move the plot forward and build tension. It doesn't have the memorable moments and visual flourishes that other Hitchcock pictures have, perhaps constrained by the story's theatrical roots. Also if you've ever watched an episode of Columbo it feels like your watching one at times due to its structure. Ray Milland makes a fantastic baddie who you can't help but will to succeed with his convoluted murder plot. Hitchcock is so skilled in getting us to side with his characters and become complicit in their deeds. The fear of being found out is a basic human fear we all feel at some point in our lives and he exploits this. Not the best Hitchcock film by any means but certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** One of the Master's-Alfred Hitchcock- most confusing efforts in having the attempted murder victim Margot Wendice, Grace Kelly, indited tried and convicted in murdering the person who tried to murder her C.A "Come and Get it" Swann, Anthony Dawson, who was hired or better yet blackmailed by her husband Tony, Ray Milland, to do her in for her cheating on him. That 1st class jerk Tony if he any brains in his empty head had a good case for divorce but instead opted to have Margot murdered and the person he choose C.A bumbled the whole plan and ended up, by getting himself killed, putting his life &amp; freedom into jeopardy.The other man in this three way affair was Tony's best friend mystery writer Mark Halliday, Robert Commings,who seemed to come and go whenever he pleased into Margot's life without, or so Mark thought, Tony knowing anything about it. The plan to have Margot murdered fell apart when C.A slipped up and was overpowered by her who ended up killing him as she was answering the phone, on cue, with Tony on the other end of the line. This was supposed to prove that C.A got the job done but instead ended up with him being done in by his supposed victim! Now Tony puts plan 2 into motion to frame his wife in proving that she murdered C.A because he was blackmailing her! Not that Tony blackmailed C.A to murder her!****SPOILERS**** With what seemed like the British version of the Keystone Kops as well as courts who completely overlooking the facts in the case and ended up charging a confused and bewildered Margot with murder it's up to her lover Mark to get to the truth of the matter before she's executed for a murder-not an open and shut case of self defense-that she didn't commit! Where Tony who didn't as much come to visit Margot in prison on the day of her upcoming execution messed up is in that the key that C.A let himself in to the apartment to try to murder Margot ended up incriminating him. That's by Tony mistaking or switching it with the dead C.A's house key that didn't fit Margot's apartment lock when he later tried to unlock it that he swiped it off him! In thinking it was really Margot's that he hid under the floor-mat to try to let himself it. That ended up not only proving him guilty in this entire mess-planning a murder where the attempted murderer ended up himself getting killed by his targeted victim-as well showing us what an incompetent jerk he is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Positive, but not surprising.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of Tony and Margot Wendice. She's married, but ends up having an affair with Mark Halliday, an American writer of detective novels. Therefore, and to avoid giving up her fortune, Tom decides to murder her but his plan goes wrong and Margo kills, in self-defense, the man who would kill her. Tom, to avoid the risk of being discovered, quickly creates a plan to take his wife to be sentenced to death.Directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock (one of the most brilliant directors of all time), this film, like others he directed ("Rear Window," "Psycho", "The Rope" etc.), is based on a police investigation, and the dramatic tension of the plot resides in its development, putting the audience in expectation, waiting to see when the killer will be unmasked in their eagerness to try to save himself. That's a formula that Hitchcock used so often in his movies that it's difficult today to see this movie and don't feel that disappointment of those who expected something more, or something different. Nevertheless, this movie is good, is very well done and has a great cast (headed by Grace Kelly, Ray Milland and Robert Cummings, respectively in the role of Margot, Tony and Mark Halliday) toasting the audience with great interpretations. The technical aspects (photography, soundtrack etc.) also seems faultless."Dial M for Murder" is a film that already has a few years, and probably we've already seen it on the small screen. Despite this, and despite not being one of the best films of this director and being totally unable to cause us astonishment or surprise, it's a nice movie to see, or review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M For Murder (1954): Dir: Alfred Hitchcock / Cast: Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, Anthony Dawson, John Williams: Suspense thriller about that blatant decision that tips one over the edge to commit a crime. Ray Milland plays Tony, an ex-tennis player who learns that his wealthy wife Margot is having an affair with a crime author named Mark. He hatches a plan that involves blackmailing an old college acquaintance turned criminal into murdering Margot. He goes over the plan with great detail but these things never go as planned. Margot survives a strangulation and kills her attacker in self defense. From there the chief inspector investigates, which places Tony is position to conjure up ideas that place his wife on murder charges. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock with a keen eye for plot detail despite a structure that is quite stagy. This is not quite the masterpiece murder suspense that Strangers on a Train is. Milland plays off the cunning yet desperate demeanor of Tony. Grace Kelly as Margot is torn between her husband and an affair that is not dealt with as the consequence it should. Robert Cumming plays Mark who is concerned for her future. Anthony Dawson plays the trapped and desperate criminal blackmailed into his own death. John Williams plays the clever chief inspector. Theme regards perfect plans going perfectly wrong until all one can do is drink to the absurdity. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dial M for Murder" is a thriller movie in which we have an ex - tennis pro carries out a perfect plan in order to murder his wife. When things change he improves his plan with adding some new details and everything again change.I really liked this movie because of the plot which I found just brilliant, and of course because of the cast. About the direction we do not have to tell many things except that Alfred Hitchcock for one more time create another masterpiece and his direction was obvious in every scene of the movie. Ray Milland's interpretation was simply outstanding as he played very good his part, also Robert Cummings made a good interpretation and of course the beautiful Grace Kelly was for one more time the perfect choice for her role. The truth is that before this movie I have seen the remake of it "A Perfect Murder" with Michael Douglas, but when I saw the original I was speechless. The original is far better than the remake.Finally I believe that "Dial M for Murder" is a really good movie in which in every minute of it you are in tense and never calm down until the end of it. And this is something that a true thriller movie should do, unfortunately nowadays we do not have that kind of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(74%) A fine example of stage to screen transition handled with all the flare and know how of a true legend. Grace Kelly is the target of murder from her own husband, and just like "Rear window", in which James Stewart is practically harassed to agree to marry her, it is a difficult concept to fully relate with. I mean how many men lucky enough to be married to Grace Kelly would arrange to have her killed? You'd have to be insane, even if she is fooling around. The almost single location works better than expected. It never gets dull to watch. And once everything has been established this becomes more and more interesting as the minutes go quite quickly past. This isn't Hitchcock's best ever, but it does fit in just below the better examples.</fullReview>

Now Ray changes gears and tries to make it look like Grace staged the whole thing and really murdered the man in cold blood. Police Inspector John Williams sees through Ray's lies but the problem is how does he prove it?Often imitated but never duplicated, it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's best color thrillers. Filmed in 3D, no less. Grace Kelly is at her most stunning and sexiest in this movie. Robert Cummings is fine in a bland uninteresting role. John Williams is great as the clever Inspector. Creepy-looking Anthony Dawson is memorable as the hired killer. The star of the whole thing is Ray Milland, who gives one of his best performances. His character is conniving and quick on his feet. The way Hitch sets the whole thing up I actually found myself rooting for Ray to get away with it. I didn't care for the lovebirds very much. Hitch's direction is brilliant (of course). Frederick Knott adapted his own play for the screen and the result is well above average for such an adaptation. It's exceptional Hitchcock, taking a relatively simple plot and crafting something remarkable out of it. A definite must-see.</fullReview>

Audiences who Like Hitch's Rope (1948), Lifeboat (1944), and Rear Window (1954) will No Doubt Fall in Line Among the Worshipers of this "Flat" Film that All Takes Place in a Flat, Ironically, Artificially Enhanced to Provide Depth (just put on those clunky red and blue eye-strainers).Although Coming at the End of the 3-D Experiment the Movie was Released in a Limited Run in the Format but Quickly Became Only Available in a 2-D Experience Until 1980. The Dialog Flows Smoothly from Ray Milland and Grace Kelly but Robert Cummings is Unconvincing, Stiff, and Almost Stutters at Times and it is an Uncharacteristic Nervous Performance.The Rest of the Limited Cast does OK with Anthony Dawson as the Slimy Snake Contract Killer Remarkable. The Movie is Very Well Done, but of Course its Hitchcock and Compared to Others in His Filmography it Doesn't Rise to the Top, Although it is Immensely Popular. The Third Act is the Weakest when Things are Pieced Together in a Rush.Overall, Certainly Worth a Watch for it is Hitchcock, and the Movie Stars Ray Milland and Grace Kelly. But Truth be Told, it isn't Much More than a Good Play Filmed by a Great Director and it's Best Left as That, for to Try and Stretch and Say this is Great Hitchcock is a Futile Endeavor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might scoff at my notion that this film is underrated since it was listed on AFI's greatest mystery films of all time list, so clearly it gets some respect. Where I would consider the movie to be underrated is that it just never seems to come up in discussions of people's favorite Hitch films and, personally, I would consider it to be one of his best.I brief aside for the complete Hitch noob. There was a time a decade ago when I really only knew him for his two horror films (PSYCHO and THE BIRDS) before I really started delving into his catalog of genius movies. One thing that might strike you is that there is often a familiar feel to Hitch movies, like you've seen this before. That is generally because his movies have been ripped off and "homaged" so much that you probably have seen the plot redone in different ways on TV shows and other movies, that shouldn't detract from how good the original product is, though.This movie is taken from a play and feels very stagey throughout. Aside from a few shots, the movie takes place almost entirely in one apartment and, mostly, in one room. Few directors could have pulled this off successfully, but Hitchcock is not your average director, is he? It never feels claustrophobic or repetitive. He creates so much creative divergence in his shots that you almost don't notice that you've never left the room during the movie until you reflect back afterwards. Speaking of those shots, there are a lot of very interesting angles here, most of which were employed to make use of the 3D technology, but it forces Hitch to shoot things you don't typically see in movies, with a whole lot of low angles.Naturally, placing your movie in one room puts a lot of weight on the plot and acting and both come through admirably. The plot is typically twisty as is any of Hitch's work. The idea of a man planning the "perfect murder" and the way that plan slowly unravels on him is done so well. There is a lot of complication of detail in both the setup of the murder and in the final "ah-hah" moment from the police detective as the truth comes out. All of this could have been very confusing, but is executing very well so as the viewer is never left feeling like a detail is missing.The acting is superb. Ray Milland, as the husband plotting to murder his cheating wife, is excellent. Sort of a poor man's Cary Grant, he is so suave and assured in this movie. Even in the final moments as things are crashing in on him, he never loses his cool. He plays the part so well that we are confused in our feelings towards him. We should be rooting against him for trying to murder the beautiful Grace Kelly, but he's such a likable character that you find yourself hoping he gets away with this, in the end. The police chief is another great character who reminds me a lot of Columbo in that way of playing the role of a bumbler who's clearly much more clever than he's letting on. Grace Kelly isn't given too much to do here, but is certainly nice to look at and plays her limited role well. She's another complicated character as, again, we should detest her for cheating on her husband, but we never want to see real harm come to her.When you've seen the requisite Hitch movies that everyone is supposed to see like VERTIGO and N BY NW and you're looking for another excellent movie, look no further than this murder mystery.</fullReview>

As the crime is set up, I had a lot of fun seeing how (or if) the plan by the villain could/would go wrong and it's gripping to see all the events play through. I enjoyed it quite a bit, particularly the ending, but I do have one gripe with it. The film is shot like a play so there is a distinct lack of visual style, which is disappointing. I have heard that this movie is also sometimes shown in 3-D, maybe that somehow hindered the look of the film, or maybe it's the fact that I saw it in 2-D that made it seem like there was something missing. I don't know for sure, but that's my theory. Otherwise, the movie plays out just fine and it's a lot of fun to watch, particularly towards that conclusion where all of the clues and everything start falling into place.

Her husband Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) was a professional tennis player who quit for his wife. Unbeknownst to her, Tony stole her letter and has been blackmailing her. Also he blackmails an old acquaintance from Cambridge and petty criminal C. A. Swann (Anthony Dawson) into murdering his wife to get her fortune. Tony plans out the perfect murder but it doesn't works out. Swann tries to strangle Margot but she turns the table on him. Chief inspector Hubbard (John Williams) closes in with every clue.It's a pretty dense start and lots to take in. Once the expositions are done, it is quite tense and compelling. Ray Milland is fascinating as the scheming suave villain. It's a Hitchcock classic and well made game of clue. The tension of the investigation builds and builds. It's fascinating because it lays out everything for the audience. The tension comes from the fact that the characters don't know everything and as they scramble to make up a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently watching Dial M for Murder after Hitchcock's other greats like Psycho and Vertigo, I was surprised at how well he carries out plot twists and intricate folds in every story so well. This film is not about the classic blackmailing of others to get them to do you're dirty work; rather, it's a tale of a man who will go to whatever depths necessary to seek retribution. Every single scene, angle and line in this movie contributes to the ultimate plan, and it's every piece that makes Hitchcock's movies such a puzzle. Always sitting on the edge of your seats, constantly wondering what will happen next and having butterflies form in your stomach -- these are just some of the side effects you will have from watching this film. Playing detective is a role that is never easy, especially when you're against a criminal who leaves traces that lead to the wrong people. Hitchcock did a terrific job with Dial M for Murder because not only does he manage to entice the viewer for the entire 105 minutes, but he starts making us imagine what the perfect murder really would be.I think it's safe to say: vengeance and wits are never a good combination.</fullReview>

The idea of the perfect crime, the failure of it and the idea that crime never pays run throughout many of Alfred Hitchcock's films. It's also the one theme of his that I'm the least interested in as knowing where the film is going takes away some of the excitement. For instance, when the supposedly perfect murder of Grace Kelly goes wrong, but she is still arrested and sentenced to death, it is a brilliantly cruel and sadistic twist, but the stakes would be even higher if you thought there was any chance she wouldn't make it.Complaints about predictability notwithstanding, Hitchcock still shines in his execution. There's a real elegance and assurance about the way the characters act and interact and the way the plot, with some ingenious details revolving for instance around the keys to the apartment, unfolds. Hitchcock can still squeeze a lot of tension into certain scenes. When Anthony Dawson is standing behind the curtain during the attempted murder waiting for that call, Hitchcock makes the audience sweat too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder is an adaptation of the successful Broadway play of the same name by Frederick Knott. The movie was shot in 3-D, since in 1953 the movies Bwana Devil and House of Wax started a 3-D craze. But that lasted just after the release of Dial M, and therefore this movie was mostly played in 2-D. Because it's mainly set in an apartment's living room, the movie was shot in only 36 days.Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is an ex professional tennis player who retired because his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) complained about his busy schedule and started an affair with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Out of jealousy, Tony decides to meet with an old acquaintance to blackmail him into murdering his wife by following a plan Tony alone devised.Being an adaptation of a play, the movie is primarily based on smart dialogue that carries the plot and manages to keep us interested while the characters try to solve the mystery, even though we know from the beginning what has happened. This is one of the things I liked the most about the movie. Then, there is the great acting: Ray Milland is constantly indifferent, cold, extremely rational and doesn't let emotions interfere with his horrid plan. Grace Kelly is a typical damsel in distress but doesn't know who her saviour is supposed to be, and Robert Cummings would do anything for her. All of them, along with the supporting cast, are very convincing in their roles. That's probably why it's easy to empathise with everyone, no matter their actions.Since, like I said, Dial M was mostly shot in a living room, many people have talked about the movie as "claustrophobic". I would rather say the lack of open spaces gives this movie a feeling of inevitability and hopelessness ? nobody can escape their fate and we're all responsible for our actions. This also proves how much Dial M relies on good acting. Another thing I loved about this movie (and old movies in general) is the thoughtful use of soundtrack. Nowadays, the majority of mainstream movies try to evoke feelings in the audience by being too loud all the time, and that's when a soundtrack loses its purpose. In conclusion, Dial M might not appeal to all Hitchcock fans because of the lack of action and long dialogues, but it's an excellent movie nobody should miss.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy Hitchcock Murder Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is a classy 1950s Hitchcock 'murder mystery', suspense movie adapted from the stage play by Frederick Knott.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the film follows a well-trodden story line in which you know whodunit and you know who's&nbsp; going to get his come-uppance in the end, you still want to see how it will all unfold.&nbsp; The main characters - Tony (Ray Milland), his glamorous but subservient wife Margot (Grace Kelly), her lover Mark (Robert Cummings), and Swann (Anthony Dawson), the man hired by Tony to kill his wife&nbsp; - do an impressive job playing their parts and the acting is skilled, subtle and believable (mostly).&nbsp; The unassuming detective, Hubbard (who's not quite so believable and whose acting is a little dodgy), figures out more than he's letting on,&nbsp; and lover-boy&nbsp; Mark just so happens to be a crime writer so that's a handy combo when it comes to dealing with murder, intrigue,&nbsp; and solving the 'perfect crime'.&nbsp; The whole film takes place in Margot and Tony's apartment&nbsp; (apart from a bizarre and slightly jarring court 'pastiche' where Margot's head appears in front of a swirly, colourful background that looked as if it was hastily crayoned on bristol board by an underemployed&nbsp; boom-holder), followed by a disturbing flash of a red cloaked, improbably archaic judge.&nbsp; But that's all by the by, as Kelly executes her role&nbsp; perfectly, playing the obedient, compliant, and elegant, (but none too bright) wife and, in this day and age, it's quite amusing (or perhaps shocking?) to witness her deferral to hubby on just about everything. She 'does as she's told' even when circumstances scream out for her to take some initiative (well I screamed out anyway;&nbsp; I mean, really...).&nbsp; Her passivity was so well portrayed it made you want to shake her and yell 'get a backbone!' but that was the idea and it just leaves you so utterly thankful not to have been a wife in the '50s.&nbsp; The sharp and elegant apparel sported by the main characters provides a satisfying feast for the eyes and invokes nostalgia for the days when people actually 'dressed up' (even if they were staying in for the evening).&nbsp; Schlepping about in tatty jeans and t-shirts wasn't an option - that's what makes films of this era so visually rich and decadent (not to mention the non-stop smoking and unabated supping of cocktails or hard liquor, morning, noon or night).&nbsp; The jaunty orchestral music is vintage cinematic&nbsp; entertainment as are the dramatic crescendos of stringed instruments . We all know how Dial M for Murder will end but it's a clever and enjoyable ride and so absorbing I didn't even complain about it being&nbsp; two hours long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dial M for Murder is another classic Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is a classic mystery thriller that I will advise all Alfred Hitchcock fans to go watch. If you love mystery movies, this is one you will have to take the time to see.The saying that all things work together for good kind of came into play in this movie, the acting was in top shape, the script and dialogue were intriguing. This will not go down as the best of Hitchcock but it still stands out, the cinematography isn't classic since majority of the movie was done in a confined apartment, the screenplay was not as grand as there is little room pull out all the stops but the plot is as grand as they come. The plot takes you on a journey where you get to see things in the view of the three leads; each one is giving a scene time to win you over to their side.Done in 1954, this movie is directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on a stage play done in 1952. The screenplay and the stage play on which it was based were both written by English playwright Frederick Knott, and the movie did well in the box office and was well received by critics.The stories plot is all about Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) obsession to take revenge on his wife for cheating on him.He decided to kill her and the best way to do it was to allow a stranger take the fall, so he plotted and thought through how to commit the perfect murder, one thing he forgot to think about is his wife Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) will to live, as the man he sent to murder her, was murdered.But that didn't stop Tony as he still found a way, how? You have to watch Dial M for Murder to find out.A remake of the movie was done in 1998 and it was titled A Perfect Murder directed by Andrew Davis, the remake had Michael Douglas play the husband and Gwyneth Paltrow was the wife. In the 1998 remake the characters of Halliday and Swann are combined which was played by Viggo Mortensen.Alfred Hitchcock is the king of mysteries and this movie does plagues of it from the get go to the last scene where Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) served everyone a drink. Dial M for Murder is in position 48 in the AFI's 100 years?100 thrills. Dial M for Murder was released in the same year as Rear Window.So take the time to watch this classic.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder, anyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen several of Hitchcock's movies, this seems to me to be typical of his psychological thrillers. Three strengths of this movie are its plot, characters, acting. The plot is a tightly constructed murder mystery. And while the viewer knows "who done it," only the villain, Tony Wendice (played by Ray Milland) knows what's going on. Whether or not he is able to commit the perfect crime hinges on every tiny detail of his plan going perfectly. When things don't go exactly as he expected them to, he has to change his story. And then the question is, will he be able to escape getting caught and pin the crime on his wife, Margot (played by Grace Kelly). As the plot unfolds, the suspense builds, as one expects in a Hitchcock movie, to a dramatic climax.The characters were believable and well developed, thanks to the good acting of the main characters. Ray Milland does a convincing job as the conniving and ruthless former tennis pro who has married his wife for her money. Grace Kelly is excellent as the unfaithful, neglected wife. And Robert Cummings does a good job portraying her secret lover, mystery writer, Mark Halliday. John Williams, in a supporting role, makes a perfect detective, Police Inspector Hubbard, whose cluelessness early on, adds to the suspense.The weaknesses that I saw in the movie were in its setting and certain parts of the plot. Most of the movie took place in one small room of the Wendice's apartment. Other than that, the action occurred only briefly in front of the apartment building, in the hallway of the building, or at a hotel. I found this a little boring. I would have preferred a greater variety of locations. On the other hand, while that would have been my preference, I realize that Hitchcock may have done this on purpose to add to the sense of claustrophobia experienced by the main characters as the situation seems to close in on them. In terms of weakness in the plot, I thought some of the circumstances were pretty unbelievable. It's hard for me to imagine that the police inspector would be able to bring a convicted and condemned criminal home as easily as he did and have that person hang out in their own home while he was able to continue investigating. I also found it hard to believe that the movie ended with everyone involved acting as calmly as they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classic thriller from Alfred Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dial M for Murder" is Hitchcock's adaptation of the hit stage play of the same name. In it, a retired tennis pro blackmails a man into murdering his wife for him. He has an apparently foolproof plan but when it (naturally) goes awry he must improvise a new plan in order to save his neck.Being adapted from a single set stage play, much of the action occurs in just one location. However, Hitchcock varied his approaches enough that this fact didn't even occur to me until after the movie. There may not be a lot in the way of truly exceptional visuals but it should be remembered that this was designed for 3D presentation while all existing home video versions are flat. It would be interesting to see the 3D version since it was supposedly more about immersion than visual trickery.The script is clever and gave the actors quality material to work with. I'd say that Ray Milland outdid his Oscar-winning performance in "The Lost Weekend" with his villainous turn here. I was less impressed with Grace Kelly (though she's still good) but Anthony Dawson &amp; John Williams both contribute fine performances in support. The film also benefits from an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin.Overall, "Dial M for Murder" is a well executed thriller that falls just a bit short of Hitchcock's best films. Nevertheless, it's well worth watching, especially for Milland's performance and, as always, Hitchcock's masterful direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 202Dial M for Murder, a Hitchcock thriller, is about three people: Tony, an ex tennis player who suspects his wife of cheating and plans to kill her. Margot, the wife in question, and Mark, who Margot is with on the side. While none of these people are good, they're far more likable than the two characters in The Postman Always Rings Twice, the film I watched yesterday. These characters are morally grey. A big part of that is the directing. We see what kind of people they are, not just their actions. No one does a better job of that than Ray Milland, who plays the smart and calculating Tony. Depending on who you are, you may want or not want him to get away with the crime.An interesting point to note is how cheery the music is in the first half hour. It caught me off guard in a murder mystery like this. It helped me sympathize with the main characters, because no ominous music played to influence my thoughts.The plot moves quickly, and there's a lot of plot. Tony's scheme is very complicated and detailed, and little time is taken to explain it. It's not a complaint, but you have to pay close attention.It's very apparent this was a play: much of the film takes place in one room, and there's even an intermission.In conclusion, Dial M is an interesting murder mystery for the time you see it. There's not too much special about it, but you'll want to see how Tony's grand plot turns out. 8.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A retired tennis player plots to have his cheating wife murdered so he can get his hands on her fortune. Given the origin as a play, it is not surprising that the film is stagy, but Hitchcock manages to make it absorbing, even overcoming the limitations of the 3D camera he was forced to use. Kelly's short career peaked in 1954, with "Rear Window", "The Bridges at Toko-Ri," "The Country Girl," and this fine entry. Milland is perfectly cast as the cold, slimy husband, but how did he ever land a beauty like Kelly and how could he want her dead? Cummings brings energy to the role of the lover while Williams is delightful as the Scotland Yard inspector.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with a few other reviews. This film is different, from my impression, when I compare it to say, my favorite film "Strangers on a Train" ( a must see).Wendice is NOT a likable character, nor is his wife as portrayed by a shrill Grace Kelly. Perhaps this was the intent. Interesting. Hitchcock often said he liked to put his characters through their own special torment, and we see a great deal of that here.I also find it interesting that Wendice, a retired tennis pro (and rather useless figure) is like The Farley Granger character in "Strangers". Also a life of leisure, the guilty character is an American tennis pro. Is Hitchcock poking fun at these people?.All in all, highly staged, but suspenseful. Not as good as most of his other films. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is one of those deliciously suspenseful films (Hitchcock's forte), where the script is mind-bogglingly good and the results are absolutely thrilling. The plot is deceptively simple; Tony is a retired Tennis Pro, being more-or-less supported by his wife Margot, played by a luminous Grace Kelly in an early film role. Tony's career meant that he was away for extended periods of time, playing in various tournaments, and during one of his absences Margot fell head-over-heals in love with an American writer visiting London. That was a year ago, and since then Tony has cold-bloodedly plotted to kill his wife, all the while playing the part of the devoted husband. But after a chance encounter he decides to blackmail an old acquaintance, a vaguely seedy con-man and womanizer, into committing the crime for him by following Tony's plan to the letter, a plan he claims is the "Perfect Murder."A combination of superb direction from Hitchcock, one of the most magnificent scripts, bang on acting and the technique of suspense all play an active role in making this movie one of the most famous of Hitchock's and of this era."Dial M for Murder" would probably be seen by a lot of modern audiences as too slow, too talky with not enough action. However... I think it's a superb thriller unique in the respect that for once the written word rather than the action creates the suspense. Grace Kelly's attempted murder scene still however packs a real. "Dial M for Murder", has so much to recommend it to lovers of suspense from a veteran director in top form. Thrillers and investigation stories don't come much better than they do here and every lover of Alfred Hitchcock and his directing genius should have this superb film in their collections. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DIAL M FOR MURDER Aspect ratio: 1.37:1 (WarnerVision 3-D)Sound format: MonoA cuckolded husband (Ray Milland) hatches a plot to murder his beautiful wife (Grace Kelly), but his plan unravels when Kelly kills the man hired to strangle her.Successful adaptation of Frederick Knott's clever stageplay, and an exercise in technical bravura by director Alfred Hitchcock. The script may not loan itself to the 3-D process, but Hitch and cinematographer Robert Burks (who had previously photographed the 1953 WarnerVision feature HONDO) employ the illusion of depth with remarkable clarity, framing characters between foreground objects (lamps, tables, etc.) and the physical space of the screenplay's primary location (Milland and Kelly's apartment); aside from the opening and closing credits, there are only two examples of 'off-the-screen' effects, both crucial for dramatic purposes. Otherwise, Hitch makes few attempts to widen the play's narrow canvas, but plot and dialogue are so compelling, and played with such relish by a top-notch cast, the film's 'staginess' goes largely unnoticed. Milland and Kelly are terrific in their respective roles, and Robert Cummings is equally fine as the young man whose dalliance with Kelly sparks Milland's murderous plot, but they're all upstaged by John Williams, reprising his stage performance as the dogged police detective whose investigation reveals the fatal flaw in Milland's near-perfect crime. The 'murder' scene represents one of the great moments in American cinema, and Milland's climactic comeuppance is a show-stopper.NB. Though framed for 1.37:1 aspect ratio, the film was projected theatrically at 1.85:1 in some venues. Remade as a TV movie in 1981, featuring Christopher Plummer and Angie Dickinson, and reworked as A PERFECT MURDER in 1998, with Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dial M for Milland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dial M for Murder"'s main assets are its intricate but faultless plot, and fluid camera work in the limited area of a small and crowded flat... which does not leave much credit for Hitchcock !. So you can easily believe he told François Truffaut it was not an interesting film. Still you have to recognize that the murder attempt is very impressive and that having reduced Grace Kelly 's trial to one sequence of some ten seconds expedites matters very conveniently ( the old master's hand ! ). But the casting is uneven and reflects Hitchcock's probable lack of interest for the film: he appears to have temporarily lost his fascination for his goddess Grace Kelly ( perhaps because of the affair she is said having then with Milland ); so she is lovely but ill at ease( except in the murder scene )as the unfaithful wife; Robert Cummings is completely wooden, and his adulterous couple with Kelly shows no passion, not even warmth, whatsoever and attracts no sympathy. Ray Milland is better, but has sometimes a tendency to overplay. The best performances are to be credited to Anthony Dawson, aptly sinister as the would-be murderer, and John Williams, a delight as the Inspector.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this was Hitchcock's best film with his favorite actress Grace Kelly. Ray Milland was a smooth, debonair villian and the film really required you to think and follow along its a lot of fun from beginning to end. I wish I could have seen this on the stage. The greatest challenge for any director is bringing a stage play to the screen because its like he has to work in such a small area. Hitchcock also did this in Rope. By the way, the scene where Grace Kelly is being stangled is the best scene Hitchcock directed. Grace is a good little struggler and it is a joy to watch. I love how he just has her dressed in a flimsy nightgown. It should have lasted at least a couple minutes. Theres a great closeup of her bare legs and feet. Gwenyth Paltrow's strangle scene in A Perfect Murder was even better! Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, the whole point of the movie was Ray Milland (as Tony Wendice)planning in detail the murder of his wife, Margot(Grace Kelly). The chilling way Milland explains to Swann the why and how of the details for murder. No one has ever captured the pathology of murder the way Alfred Hitchcock did in this movie with Ray Milland. (I can't see Cary Grant--apparently considered as an alternative for Tony Wendice--performing at the same level as Milland.) And Milland brought to the role a unique set of vocal talents that was perfect casting for a pathological killer. Almost a monotone with his demonic concern for the crime. Good looks and charm that prohibits him from looking like a pathological killer. Even at the end of the film where all is revealed--what does he do, he makes himself a drink and offers a drink to Margot, Mark, Chief Inspector Hubbard...So the movie really isn't about Margot, after an attempted strangulation, having strength to thrust scissors through a trench coat, a woolen sport coat--to reach a vital organ for a near fatal thrust. It is not even about solving the 'crime'. It not about the Hitchcokian macguffin of the key.The movie is really a character study of a pathological killer; and Ray Milland fulfilled the role with excellence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is your quintessential Alfred Hitchcock thriller. Now it may not be his best work, but it's pretty darn close. The story is engaging, and often quite thrilling. Despite the location of the film being mostly in the single apartment room, the audience never gets the sense of claustrophobia. It takes a tight screenplay and fantastic performances to make a one-room setting movie and it mostly works here. There is one tense murder scene, but I love how the rest of the movie is mostly talk, but somehow does not take away the aura of tension and suspension. The build-up for the justifiable ending is really, really fun to watch, especially since we have to deal with the charm of Ray Milland's character.Hitchcock's film is about a pro-tennis player named Tony who decides to settle down and be there for his wife. Meanwhile, his wife Margot, had an affair with an American named Mark. One day, Mark comes to visit. As they were going out for the evening, Tony decides to stay at home so he can plot a murder. The murder of his wife. But not all plots go according to the plan?.The acting cannot get much better than this. Ray Milland injects his character with such charm, and one can see why people never suspected him of murder or blackmail. His charm even won me over despite me knowing exactly what is going on. Also, Grace Kelly delivers a magnificent performance. Her performance during the murder scene should have alone nominated her for an Oscar. Robert Cummings does a fine job as the man at the other end of the love triangle, Mark. Finally, I have to mention John William's fine performance as the police inspector who little-by-little pieces together the hidden clues.Overall, this is a film that shows why Hitchcock is the master of thrillers. He takes such simple stories and turns them into twisting tales that pierces the heart with thrills and dread. Despite a one-location, talkative movie, my heart kept on churning wondering what was going to happen next. I love how Alfred Hitchcock pays close attention to stuff like the keen details, the small camera movements to further enhance the audience sense of terror. This is a really captivating thriller thanks to amazing performances, a tight screenplay, and wonderful directing.My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's strong crime thriller is best watched in all three dimensions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think the contemporary 3D craze is a new phenomenon, think again. Though the current output of 3D movies far surpasses those of bygone eras, there have been two previous waves in cinema featuring the addition of a third dimension to draw audiences away from their television sets ? first from the sets themselves, the second time from the choices offered by VCR technology: these days it's a combination of high quality television production, the relatively large size of the home cinema screen and the ease in digital technology for users to watch whatever they fancy that threatens audience attendance ? the previous one during the Eighties, the very first one in the Fifties. Then, like today, some high profile directors, fascinated by the narrative and visual possibilities offered by the three-dimensional aspect, tinkered with the technology to see what it could accomplish and add to the overall viewing experience. During the short lived fad of the Fifties, the most notable director to explore the new dimension was Alfred Hitchcock, who used it only once, for his 1954 crime thriller Dial M for Murder. Though its 3D release was almost as brief as the interest in 3D technology itself in that decade, it cannot be denied the 3D version of this classic film still makes for a fascinating watch, both with regards to the use of the third dimension and the story itself. Thanks to the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, I got the opportunity to experience this film as Hitchcock shot it, in a beautifully restored print that utilizes the modern 3D techniques, which also benefits the vividly rich Fifties' colour palette that would have been absent in the original 3D print with its notorious red &amp; green glasses.It's clear upon watching the film Hitchcock made ample use of the added layers of depth 3D offered, as we get a clear sense of persons and objects in the foreground, the middle and the background of the frame, the depth perception shifting as another person or object moves into frame prominently on a closer layer. Considering most of this Kammerspiel type film takes place in a single room, 3D actually comes in quite handy to make the environment feel more alive and diverse than it otherwise would have felt. Especially notable is the scene where two characters are in mid-conversation and a vase enters the shot, basically right in our faces as we see the two men continue to talk behind it, though separated (both visually and in terms of their narrative interests) by the vase which is positioned in the middle of the shot composition. Of course, a few more typical in-your-face shots are also present, and these work far better than the ones we have grown used to, outstretched arms feeling almost tangible as they seem to hover right in front of us. Also charming to behold is the blue matte lines that appear around characters as they are in motion: the modern 'high frame rate' technology might have been of benefit to avoid such visual oddities, but in this case it makes the movie feel even more historically intriguing from a technological viewpoint. Nevertheless, after the first hour it seems Hitchcock was running out of ideas as no particularly noteworthy new use of 3D is witnessed and the novelty of its sensations wears off. Until that point, this film makes some of the finest use of 3D to this day. The incomparable Grace Kelly never looked more beautiful than she does in all three dimensions in this remastered 3D print.In terms of story Dial M for Murder is simply a little outdated, through no fault of its own. The problem is it has been emulated, copied and parodied for almost sixty years. Though Hitchcock's famous mastery of suspense and the delivery and timing of his actors' dialogue is still of the highest order, it cannot help but make the movie feel like its dragging its feet just a little too long. The moment police inspector Hubbard (John Williams; not that one) enters the crime scene and displays just how brilliantly deductive the mind of a British inspector works as he spends the next 30 minutes explaining the details of the murder attempt for longer than we care to hear it (we got the point!), while occasionally touching his moustache in every conceivable clichéd manner, the movie drones on a little too much. Until that time though, the exciting plot offered by a man (Ray Milland) who means to murder his wife (Kelly) by blackmailing a former schoolmate who has fallen on hard times (Anthony Dawson), only to have the assassination gone horribly awry, makes for s striking crime drama of the highest order, good for many a scene of emotional tension like only Hitchcock managed to deliver. 1954 proved a good year for Hitchcock, as the celebrated director released the even more highly acclaimed (and superior) suspense thriller Rear Window ? also starring Grace Kelly ? only a few months later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific performances, especially enjoyed Bob Cummings and John Williams. A real gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only problem that some people may have with this film is that it's very talky, and filmed almost entirely in an apartment. However, that in a way was the brilliance of Hitchcock here. Talky, because it was a psychological drama about a man planning to have his wife murdered, and most of the talking is how he suckers a man into doing it for him, and then how he gets out of that after his wife kills that man during the attack. It virtually all takes place in the apartment, because this was a film translation of a play, although it doesn't really have the feeling of a play like a few films have.The cast here is excellent. Top billing went to Ray Milland as the murderous husband, and here is another case of an actor who today is very underrated. Milland, who has more dialog in the film than anyone else, handles it brilliantly. Grace Kelly is the wife. I'm not a particular fan of Kelly, but she was very good here...I can't think of a thing about her acting here to criticize. Robert Cummings, who devoted much of his career to comedy, had a few very fine dramatic turns, and this is one of them (another is in Hitchcock's "Saboteur"). As good as Cummings was in comedy, perhaps he missed his mark...he could have easily been a straight dramatic actor! He plays it just right here. A real treat is character actor John Williams, who steals many of the scenes he is in...as Chief Police Inspector. As good as the 3 leads are, Williams makes the film special.So sit back and relax with a great Hitchcock film, though it is not one of his bigger hits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy Thriller that Mixes Things Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder: I've always liked the remake of Dial M for Murder, A Perfect Murder. Consequently, seeing the remake before the original, I knew every twist that was coming my way. Though I think A Perfect Murder has a better female lead, setting, and tone, Dial M for Murder is a classy thriller that mixes things up; it's a great project for Hitchcock to pour his energy into. Dial M for Murder originates from a stage play, it's evident here. This is a movie who's driving force is the dialogue exchanges between its characters. It's very talky. The cinematography has some odd shots, but that's forgiven for the gruesome action. "The scene" is the most violent scene Hitchcock has ever directed. Dial M For Murder dissects the gravity of a murder, every possible thing that could lead the detectives to the guilty one. The film is terrific until the final two minutes which is out of tone with the mood the film held for 100 minutes. Dial M for Murder's ultimately says that everyone is manipulative and to watch out backs (literally Grace Kelly, watch your back). Rating: 9/10Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When A Crime Goes Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, the movie seems straightforward. In Britain, a former international tennis star has quit the game to find regular employment. His wife had had an affair with an American associate of his, who comes back to them. The wife tells him that she had destroyed all the letters relating to the affair, but one had been stolen, and a note was sent to her demanding money. She sent the money to the blackmailer, only for that person to vanish without even taking it. Unknown to them, it was the husband who had stolen the letter and written the note, and is plotting to have his wife murdered-not for revenge so much as to inherit her money.His next act is to blackmail an old college classmate into committing the murder, while he arranges for his wife to stay home while he takes the former lover to a dinner party. Near midnight, the husband calls his apartment to lure his wife into answering it while the classmate tries to strangle her. But everything goes wrong when the wife ends up killing her would-be assassin instead. And then the story really begins! The husband then plants evidence to make his wife appear to have killed the man because he presumably tried to blackmail her. She is found guilty...but can she still be saved? The movie is less a thriller than a police procedural, as a police inspector, along with the former boyfriend, suspects what really happened and tries to puzzle it out.The movie is a detective story, not a thriller like "Psycho", so don't expect bloodshed and mayhem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dial M for Murder" is worth giving a call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was not only a legendary director and a master at using suspense, he was also an expert at making films for the mystery genre. While his earlier mystery "Rope" (1948) tried its best to feel like one continuous uninterrupted take, its story wasn't exciting enough to suit the style Hitchcock attempted to create. If there was a film that would've been better suited for that style with minimal editing and settings, then that film would be Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 mystery, "Dial M for Murder". In "Dial M for Murder", we follow a former tennis player (Ray Milland) who has secretly discovered that his wife (Grace Kelly) has been dating another man (Robert Cummings). One day, he meets up with an acquaintance (Anthony Dawson) of his and makes a deal. If he commits the murder of his wife, he will be paid a generous amount of money. But the murder plan goes terribly wrong and his wife ends up killing the hired intruder. The tennis player must come up with another back-up plan to get rid of his wife or else she'll discover that he was behind the attempted murder the whole time. The story of "Dial M for Murder" is relatively simple and basically a typical murder story that Hitchcock would bring to the screen just like "Rope" before it. The difference is that this picture is much better in terms of its execution and has much more going for it. It has improved storytelling, less predictability (even though it's not too hard to figure out where the plot will go), and more memorable scenes. The most famous scene is the murder attempt in which Grace Kelly defends herself with a pair of scissors. Like most of his pictures before it, "Dial M for Murder" shows us how there's no such thing as getting away with the perfect crime, especially when you secretly have so much pride with committing it. While "Rope" was probably better at proving how this theory can be correct, this picture does have a smarter antagonist. He tries harder in terms of keeping the murder a secret as best he can, as opposed to the villains in "Rope" who are obviously showing weaknesses in hiding their murder. I always enjoy Grace Kelly in all the movies I've seen her in and this film is no exception. Despite not knowing for certain how the intruder got into her apartment, she still seems pretty smart and is a pleasure to watch. She's so attractive that we wonder why her relationship with her husband is suffering to the point where she had to see another man. Speaking of which, "Dial M for Murder" never did tackle why the relationship went downhill in the first place, did it? I didn't think so. Furthermore, I can't remember the other characters, Kelly's other love interest included. They're not terrible, they just don't add a whole lot or leave an impact in any way. The film also gets off to a slow start and you only start to get interested once the murder plan starts to take effect which is around 20-25 minutes in. Once "Dial M for Murder" gets going though, it's a fairly solid film for its genre. It keeps you interested in how things will pan out for the main antagonist and his wife. If you're a fan of Alfred Hitchcock like me or a fan of mysteries, I think you'll like what "Dial M for Murder" has to offer well enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget thriller at its witty best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wouldn't the world be so simple if everyone processes information as logically as the characters do here. An extremely low budget single set piece movie with 4 central characters doing a hot and cold job. One moment the action and dialogues feel irritating and the next moment they are intriguing. Works more as a 'what if' game you might enjoy on a lazy afternoon and talking about lazy somebody else is playing it and you just have to sit back and watch it.Tony (Ray Milland) has retired from professional tennis and living off his rich wife Margot (Grace Kelly) who is having an affair with Mark (Robert Cummings) a crime fiction writer. When Tony learns of this affair, he comes up with an elaborate plan for a perfect murder involving his ex-college mate Swann (Anthony Dawson). When the implementation goes horribly wrong, Tony quickly turns it again to his advantage. But he has to convince shrewd Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) along with Mark.Though it is highly inconsistent in terms of performances and dialogues, the screenplay is watertight with gripping suspense and a witty plot. What actually is a simple perfect plan, Hitchcock's brilliance shines here with his masterful placing of pieces and strategically joining them. Ray Milland's dialogue delivery is horrible in the beginning but gets better later and Mark's cautious and caring character could have been a little more interesting. Grace Kelly is beautifully shown but John Williams steals the show as the tactful inspector. Background score is loud as in all Hitchcock's movies including a thread that does not leave your head for sometime.Low budget thriller at its witty best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Meticulous Melodramatic Murder Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In usual fashion, Hitchcock takes a simple one room setting and injects a complex plot to a simple murder act. The scheme and collusion between two former college acquaintances is just too coincidental but brilliant.I think that in terms of performance the credit goes to John Williams as the police inspector who led people on to think that that he knew less than what the truth was. As always Grace Kelly just mesmerizes you with simple beauty, charm and of course grace. And the murder plotter played by Ray Milland was simply fantastic with his bold yet reserved concern for how this murder would actually play out. Mark played by Robert "Bob" Cummings adds quiet humor to saving his lovers life by actually suggesting the premeditated plot that the husband really wanted to carry out.The suspense is concluded with collaborated work by both the inspector, Mark, Grace and surprisingly the husband who actually convicts himself unknowingly. Great viewing for Hitchcock fans and viewers of murder mystery thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glossy fifties film in living color</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little bit dragged out at times...everyone seemed to love the sound of their voices in this one, lots of talking, not much real action. Ray Milland gives the best performance of the film for me. Grace Kelly is fine, but bland and stiff. She isn't required to do a whole lot but change her expression from time to time and barely does that. To me, she is always aware that she is on screen and instinctively models for the camera. Of course she is beautiful, but she is so staid it is difficult to believe she ever had an affair passionate enough to cause all of this drama. And what the heck was in that darned letter at the center of the film? Still, you have to stay with it and watch all the way through to learn the great mystery of the latch keys. I have to admit, I hadn't figured it out. Some parts are a little unbelievable, such as seeing Grace's character coming back at the end, allegedly still facing execution the next day, and yet she is carrying her little purse, the center of so much controversy, as is a death row inmate would still have possession of her things, and she is shown standing alone on the sidewalk in front of her building, rather than in handcuffs, etc...since the audience does not yet know that the police have figured the whole thing out, it is a little beyond belief.Also, if she has so much money, why do they live in that cramped apartment? I've never seen such a small apartment in a film not set in the lower income brackets. I guess they wanted it small for atmosphere, but goodness, they were tripping over each other in there. I guess Grace spent her money on clothes...that nightgown alone was probably several hundred and just what one would really wear to bed, lol, tight bodice, zipper and all. I can picture Hitchcock salivating behind his lens as she struts about in that, and her infamous red dress, which signals danger ahead. Her wardrobe was pretty restrained overall, lacking any turbans or astonishing hats, the better to show that shining blond hair, which in the early scenes is as stiff as a helmet, but a little softer later on.With all of my griping, an entertaining way to spend your time, especially for the performance of Milland and the wily old chief inspector.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What sane man would want to murder Grace Kelly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A lot of movies are about life, mine are like a slice of cake." - Alfred Hitchcock Hitchcock made a number of "smaller pictures" which took place in confined or claustrophobic locations ("Lifeboat", "Rope", "Rear Window" etc). Of these, "Dial M For Murder" is one of the director's best.The film stars Ray Milland as a retired tennis pro who concocts an elaborate plan to murder his wife (played by the always enchanting Grace Kelly). The plan fails, however, resulting in a subsequent battle of wits in which Milland, Kelly and a police detective (actor John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard) attempt to outsmart one another.Based on a stage play by Frederick Knott, "Dial M For Murder" is, unsurprisingly, all sparse indoor locations and back-and-forth banter. Still, Hitchcock's clinical direction elevates things tremendously. Every line of dialogue oozes macabre delight, characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys, and the Master's plot unfolds like a well oiled piece of machinery, Hitchcock's camera, dialogue and cadence cold, immaculate and precise.Best of all, though, is the way Hitchcock juxtaposes up-market sophistication and respectability with devilish secrets and dastardly deeds. Despite their social standing, everything in this film is devious to the core.Of course there have been many films about "the perfect murder", and countless TV shows/films which rely on "Dial M For Murder's" Agatha Cristie inspired "drawing room mystery plot" (Hitchcock's own "The Lady Vanishes", "Strangers On a Train", "Rope" etc all rehash this formula somewhat). What separates "Dial M For Murder" from such films is how stripped down it all is. Hitchcock liked such no-nonsense efficiency. If you're going to indulge in a little bit of cinematic sadism - what Hitch unashamedly called "celluloid cake" - then you want it as lean and devoid of fat as possible. You know, like a skeleton.Incidentally, "Dial M" utilises a now-famous narrative structure known as the "inverted detective story" (every episode of "Columbo" utilises this structure). In the "inverted detective story", or "howcatchem" (as opposed to the "whodunit"), the audience/reader is shown the crime being planned and committed in lengthy detail, is aware from the start who the criminal is, and then watches as detectives and/or criminals slowly jostle for superiority. Author R. Austin Freeman is believed to have invented this format, but Hitchcock was the first major director to repeatedly utilise it, the format fitting the Big Man's darkly comic sensibilities.9/10 - "Dial M For Murder" was released the same year as Hitchcock's "Rear Window"(1954)). Both films take place in confined or fixed locations, Hitchcock concluding the spatial experiments he started in "Rope" (1948) and "Lifeboat" (1944). Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-Key But Brilliantly Written And Directed Drawing Room Murder Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Wendice discovers that his wife Margot is having an affair with Mark, an American writer. Wendice blackmails an old college friend with a murky past into killing Margot while he and Mark are at a party, thereby giving him a perfect alibi. But of course there's no such thing as the perfect murder ?Hitchcock was a little disparaging of this movie, famously quipping that he "could have phoned it in". And yes, perhaps it is a bit stagy and talky, but that's doing it an injustice - it's a brilliant little thriller, with a terrific twist in the middle and a fantastic denouement involving a misplaced latchkey. It has a great villainous leading performance by Milland and a deliriously overenthusiastic score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Most importantly, Hitch fills it from start to finish with delicious visual flourishes; Tony spilling salt (foreshadowing his doom), the lovers' shadows parting on the door, Swan's shoes squeaking as he paces out the apartment, Tony's chilling goodnight kiss as he leaves Margot for what he thinks will be the last time, Swan's gleefully horrible demise, many others. The mechanics of the plot keep us gripped, but the director adds so much flavour with tightly composed shots, dramatic lighting and maximum suspense. I must confess I think this film has a liability however, and it's Kelly, in the first of her three roles for Hitchcock. She's a fair player but she has almost no range - check out the aftermath of the attack scene, where she simply is unable to play hysteria or look less than perfect to camera; all we see is her back and hear her voice over a phone. A great actress can play anything, and isn't concerned with how she looks, so Kelly doesn't qualify. This minor quibble aside however, this is a perfectly crafted little murder thriller that hasn't aged a day since it was shot. Based on a first-rate stage play by Frederic Knott - for another great film written by him, check out Wait Until Dark. Remade several times for TV and perhaps most interestingly as a feature in 1988 called A Perfect Murder, but as with so many movies the original is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very watchable Hitchcock movie and although pretty much a one stage set-up this still has much suspense and excitement, mostly achieved by use of the excellent dialogue. Despite being lumbered with various compositional nightmares, rows of bottles, oddly placed standard lamp etc all in the cause of the 3D process forced upon the director, he still manages some great and tense moments. The ending is a bit stagey but Hitch milks it wonderfully and the whole business with the key is great. Milland is surprisingly effective particularly in the brilliantly written main scene with Anthony Dawson, which sets the whole thing in motion. Grace Kelly is fine and certainly seems much more worth all the effort than the slight Gwyneth in the recent remake. John Williams may slightly overdo it as the seeming joke police detective but it is the director who wants us to see the police as a mere joke until?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock does Experimental Theatre ? That's pretty much to most befitting description you could give to "Dial M for Murder"; one of the Master of Suspense's most acclaimed but also ? do I daresay it ? most overrated achievements. The entire film takes place in one single location, as if you're watching a stage play, and there's also the experimental use of unusual camera angles and bizarre compositions, which proved that even the untouchable filmmakers like Hitchcock were attempting to be innovative in order to face the competition with the skyrocketing success of television during the early 50's. Personally, I have to admit I thought of "Dial M for Murder" as a very intelligent and competent but nevertheless severely underwhelming thriller experience. Every tiniest detail in this production is flawlessly taken care of, but the wholesome is just so damn lifeless! Every single character stands there talking as if they have a dozen of knives stuck in their backs and daren't move a muscle. Frederick Knott's screenplay is tight and highbrow, but since he adapted it from a stage play (his own), the movie is exaggeratedly talkative and the limited possibilities to switch sets rapidly makes it tedious as well, regardless of all the photography gimmicks.Former tennis star Tony Wendice developed the ideal plot to murder his unfaithful wife and rake in her family fortune. He truly thought up a seemingly waterproof and meticulously all-inclusive scheme that involves blackmailing an old college buddy turned petty crook into committing the vile act whilst Tony is out partying with his wife's lover. But, like one of the characters correctly states, the perfect murder doesn't exist and the more definite a plan looks, the more likely it is for important details to go wrong. Tony's plan does indeed go horribly wrong, but the cagey villain nevertheless comes up with an ingenious alternative plan on the spot. A couple of aspects about "Dial M for Murder" are undeniably pure genius. The whole build up towards the actual murder sequence, for instance, is nail-bitingly suspenseful and made unforgettable thanks to the creepy music. Then there are two performances that easily qualify as brilliant, namely John Williams' portrayal of the witty and typically British police detective and ? foremost ? the terrific Ray Milland as the dangerously sagacious psycho Tony Wendice. In fact, Milland's performance is so deeply impressive that you actually cheer for him and secretly hope that his diabolical plan of will succeed, if only just because the characters of his wife (played by Grace Kelly) and her lover are so annoyingly wooden and dull! "Dial M for Murder" is a highly compelling and smart film, but by no means a masterpiece and I sincerely doubt it ever would have made it into the top 250 if it hadn't had Hitchcock's name in the title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A clean, well-acted suspense thriller. Even if it was trash, you'd still want to see it as Grace Kelly stars. She is, as is often noted, the ideal blonde leading female for Hitchcock. With floral good looks, and childish glee or lens-friendly cool at the drop of a hat, she can act as well. She must be the main draw in a movie that pragmatically revolves around its conniving British cad Milland. He has all the wretched self-assurance that seems primed for the fall. Robert Cummings' impetuous American lover is less likable, but everyone, even John Williams' reassuring inspector is morally compromised by the end of the film - it's all a question of degrees.The fun of the film is in the suspense. We know who's organised the 'murder' - but will they pull it off? Will they be found out? Hitchcock manages the twists of happenstance as the plot and its aftermath play out with as much elusive cause and effect as that which is going on in the investigation of the crime. And it's (almost) all - like Rope - played out on a single set. Terrific 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Do you really believe in the perfect murder?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1954 was an excellent year for fans of the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Not only did he release 'Rear Window' ? widely considered his best film ? but also 'Dial M for Murder,' his lesser-revered, but certainly not inferior suspenseful murder film. The first of Hitchcock's three collaborations with the beautiful Grace Kelly (along with 'Rear Window' and 'To Catch a Thief'), it was arguably 'Dial M for Murder' that cemented Kelly's reputation as a genuine acting talent, assuring her enduring legacy despite a painfully short-lived film career. The film was adapted very closely by Frederick Knott from his own stage play of the same name, which had previously premiered as a BBC television play two years earlier.'Dial M for Murder' bears certain resemblances to Hitchcock's 1948 film, 'Rope,' in that both are based on stage plays (the latter adapted from a play by Patrick Hamilton), both take place largely in the one setting, and both plots entail characters attempting to get away with "the perfect murder." The setting for 'Dial M for Murder' is an upper-class flat at 61A Charrington Gardens, Maida Vale, London. Most of the film's plot unfolds within these walls, though there is also a single scene set in a restaurant, and a very brief, highly-stylised courtroom montage. Staying true to its stage roots, the film relies heavily on character conversation to advance its plot, a style that could potentially become tedious in less experienced hands. However, the mastery of Hitchcock, coupled with the quality of the acting performances, successfully infuses the film with an ever-present atmosphere of intrigue and suspense.When famous former tennis star Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) discovers that his beautiful and wealthy wife Margot (Grace Kelly) has been cheating on him with American crime writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), he begins to plot the perfect revenge. Enlisting ? via blackmail ? the services of an ex-college acquaintance (Anthony Dawson), Tony plans to orchestrate the perfect murder of his unfaithful wife without implicating himself. However, as Mark points out to him, the "perfect murder" might not be quite as achievable as it seems: "because, in stories, things usually turn out the way the author wants them to; and in real life, they don't... always."Just like in many of his films, Hitchcock heightens the suspense by subversively enlisting our sympathies for the villain. Nobody in their right minds would wish for the lovely Grace Kelly to be murdered, but somehow we are manipulated into almost hoping that Tony's plan is a success, and we revel in his sly brilliance as he recovers from his initial failure to implement an equally-devious Plan B. By doing this, Hitchcock makes the audience feel as though they are, themselves, a part of the crime, and as though their own fates hinge on the outcome of Chief Insp. Hubbard's (John Williams) investigation. Nonetheless, it is inevitable that the villain be brought to justice, and Tony's inability to accurately predict human behaviour becomes the single, gaping flaw in his flawless plans.To counteract the potential tedium of a film set almost entirely in the one room, Hitchcock makes clever use of colours and camera angles. To trace the downward spiral of an innocent woman who became the focus of sinister deeds, Hitchcock arranged for Grace Kelly to be dressed in bright colours at the start of the film and made them progressively darker as time goes on. A viewer would also, no doubt, have noticed the prevalence of low-angle shots with household objects sometimes, such as lamps, standing between the cast members and the camera. This was done to exploit the 3D-format in which the film was originally shot, though, by the time of the film's release, interest in this gimmick had substantially waned, and only a handful of cinemas showed the film in this way. Nonetheless, even without the 3D, this style of cinematography places the viewer in a unique position, as though they are hidden within the room and secretly observing the characters' most intimate moments.Whilst 'Dial M for Murder' managed to keep my attention throughout its running time, the first half of the film was noticeably more suspenseful than the subsequent half. This "drop-off" might well have been because, in the film's final act, the audience's perspective parts from that of the villain and meets up with the shrewd Englishman detective, Hubbard. From this moment forth, the outcome of the investigation was never really in any doubt, and Tony was bound to be arrested and tried for attempted murder. Every moment up to this point, however, was completely unpredictable, and one hundred percent genuine Alfred Hitchcock suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Anthony Dawson carry this movie to almost greatness. Too bad Cummings and that annoying cop brought it down from greatness, but still again a very enjoyable hitchcock movie about a disgruntled husband who wants to kill his wife and take her money. His wife is cheating on him and he knows this and he knows she doens't love him anymore, so he figures, hey why not profit from this. He hooks up with an old college buddy and together they plan to off his hot wife. but of course, as in all movies, things don't go according to plan and he spends the rest of the movie lying his ass off and trying to evade a very very very nosy cop. Ray Milland should have been the leading man Hitchcock should have used in all his movies because he and his college buddy singlehandedly carried the movie as I found myself laughing at thier conversationg when they first met each other, pure classic. He was so calm and cool, likehe ha all the angles figured out, Stewart would have defintiely panicked like a biatch in this movie. Grace kelly was beautiful as always but her lover was very annoying because he was messingup a marriage and really gave poor Ray no choice but to off his wife. When he does get caught, he calmly accepts his faith like a gentleman and all this had been a game and even congratulates the cop in catching him. The plot is well, very confusing but rewinding the scenes should put you on track.Pros: Directing, Acting.Cons: Cop and Robert Cummings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Feelings About this Hitch Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock has never really made a bad movie, although some have not been totally up the the high standard we expect from him. This film, which has a great plot (very intricate business with the latch keys), still comes off as a filmed stage play and is very static. The sets are uninteresting and the cinematography is mediocre because of the limits of only one major set, the apartment. Ray Milland is superb as Tony Wendice.....Milland can play it both ways, charming and sinister, and does it well here. Grace Kelly is a bit subdued as the wife and does not get much of a chance to show her acting talents and the charm and sophistication that is her forte. John Williams is absolutely delightful as the Inspector and brings humor to his part. His schtick with the mustache comb is priceless. The casting of Bob Cummings as Mark is a disaster! Cummings is a weak actor and it is hard to come to grips with the fact that Kelly prefers him over Milland. He does not bring believability to the part and therefore, throws the film a little askew. The suspense is good and Anthony Dawson, one of my favorite British villains, does his usual excellent job. This film, despite some of the apparent weaknesses, is another Hitchcock that is worth seeing. A little bit of trivia.......Milland and Kelly were having an affair when this movie was being filmed.....see if you can spot the underlying sexual tension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite Hitchcock movie, just ahead of Psycho, Rear Window and North by Northwest. Vertigo and The Birds were solid as well.SO slick and the improvisation of the main character Tony (the ex tennis pro), the guy who is plotting to kill his wife once everything goes to hell is my favorite part of the film. His explanations to his wife that he tries to murder, once she escapes the murder and to the detective and to boyfriend of Gracy Kelly to whom shes having an affair with are all done brilliantly.He thinks of things to say on the spot and he does so in such a clever fashion. Pretty amazing and fun to watch. This whole film takes place in just one or two rooms and that is also what helps it flow. The dialogue is top notch, whoever wrote the screenplay deserves just as much credit as Hitchock does for directing this masterpiece.I love this flick so much that even I enjoyed the re-make with Micheal Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow entitled A PERFECT MURDER. (1998) since I liked Tony the man who plots the murder of his wife in this film, I could not help but root for Michael Douglas in A Perfect Murder.I try and watch this movie at least twice a year, one of my favorite, older, classic movies directed by arguably the greatest in film history: Sir Alfred Hitchcock.I would give this a 10-10 because it is one of my favorite films ever.But I will stick with 9 out of 10.A MUST WATCH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you could ever want from a crime suspense thriller... and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1954 was one hell of a year for Alfred Hitchcock. May saw the release of one of his most revered films, Rear Window. Then, only a few short months later he released another classic in August called Dial M for Murder. Rear Window might be the more well known of the two, but I don't think I'm prepared to say that it's the better of the two. Dial M for Murder is a thrilling story about an ex tennis player who plans to murder his cheating wife for the vast fortune she would leave behind. However, things go awry and he must elaborate a new scheme and comes up with an incredible plan B. It's a story full of intrigue, mystery, suspense, blackmail, two-timing, double-crossing, etc, etc. And it is absolutely awesome.This has to be one of the most brilliantly imagined and ingeniously constructed plots of all time. The plot is so elaborate for a story that only centers around three characters and the police chief investigating them. The plans that are devised are so well constructed and so meticulously played out that the suspense grows wonderfully throughout the whole film. There's a lot of dialogue and not a lot of action, but the genius all comes from this dialogue that perpetuates one of the most brilliant tales of deceit and deception I've ever heard. It is true genius via storytelling and it is certainly one of the most eloquently devious crimes I've ever seen in film.Of course, all the while the brilliant auteur that is Alfred Hitchcock directs the story with keen eye for witty detail, and beautifully arranged scenes with all sort of subtle brilliances that you don't quite catch at first. Hitchcock's flare that he always plays up in his films can come down to the simplest things, like how Grace Kelly's character begins the film wearing bright and vivid colors, but as the story grows darker and the situation more harrowing her clothes darken. It's brilliant things like that that make this film and all of Hitchcock's other masterpieces just that, masterpieces.I'm prepared to say that this is one of Mr. Hitchcock's finest directorial efforts and one of his finest films. The story is so elaborate and so masterfully told. The execution of Frederick Knot's script is perfect and the story is so enthralling and so exciting all the way through. The film isn't boring for a second. It is exactly what every crime story should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M For Murder is Hitchcock doing what he does best- building suspense and climax. It is the fourth film I have seen from him, and once again, he does not disappoint. The film is built upon a cleverly staged crime, one that can be called the 'perfect' crime, but like we all should know, no crime is perfect. The screenplay works very well, and is definitely it's strong point. Hitchcock is also the master for this kind of film, and the film is never boring for one second. Ray Milland and Grace Kelly are both superb, probably the best performances I have seen from a Hitchcock film together with Anthony Perkins. I am pleased to say that this is another classic film and I shall continue seeking out Hitchcock!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Hitchcock movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics and even Hitchcock himself think this movie is one of his lesser efforts, but for me it is his best together with "Psycho". There are several reasons for loving it: the acting is generally superb, the plot is very clever, and even though the directing is not as groundbreaking as in many other of Hitchcock movies I don't see how it could have been improved on.Ray Milland plays the betrayed husband planning to kill his wife. His character is so charming and intelligent, that even though he is obviously a psychopath and his wife is stunningly beautiful and lovable, one almost hopes he will get away with it. Grace Kelly plays his wife, and it is one of her best roles. Anthony Dawson is great as the petty criminal who is more or less blackmailed into carrying out the murder. John Williams plays the police inspector with a combination of humor and cunning that is really hard to make believable, but he does it marvelously. Anthony Dawson is also good as the wife's lover, although he pales somewhat in comparison with the others.I won't go into all the twists and turns of the plot other than saying that it is really quite elaborate, and one has to focus to grab all the details on the first viewing.Although 95% of the action takes place inside one apartment it never feels claustrophobic or boring, which can be a problem for filmed plays as this is. This movie was made the same year as "Rear Window" and though the general opinion is not on my side, I would say that this movies is clearly the superior one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's Use of 3-D, and another great Ray Milland performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read Patricia Highsmith's novel STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, it does differ from the film version that Alfred Hitchcock made. Guy, his tennis pro hero, actually does become quite close to Bruno, and at the end confesses to the murder of his wife (after Bruno dies). The hint of homosexual attraction between Farley Granger and Robert Walker in the film (mostly due to Walker's performance) is allowed to go so far, but the conclusion is firmly on heterosexual grounds. Granger goes off with Ruth Roman at the end. It was 1951, and you did not show a favorable eye towards gay lovers.But it has been pointed out that in a strange way, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is like an introduction to DIAL "M" FOR MURDER. Guy is a tennis pro (which is how Bruno recognizes him to begin with). He is romancing (although still married, if estranged) Ruth Roman, the daughter of a wealthy U.S. Senator played by Leo G. Carroll. So his marriage is one of potentially great social importance to Guy. The marriage of aging tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) to his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) is to a wealthy fan. They are living in an expensive flat in one of London's most posh sections. But the marriage is souring on Milland's part - he has found that she has been having an affair with family friend novelist Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). This is too much for Milland's pride (which has suffered from his physically forced retirement from tennis into working in the corporate world - and living off Margot's money). So he decides he has to kill her. One wonders if Guy's marriage would have done better.Frederick Knott's tight little melodrama can still be revived with a set of good actors and good direction. In fact, it was remade into two television versions and another movie (in 1998) with Michael Douglas in the Milland role. But Milland's smiling, plausible villain is one of his best performances - a toss-up between this role and his Devil in ALIAS NICK BEAL as to which villain was a better performance. He is in complete control of the "game" until the last fifteen minutes when he is finally tripped up by John Williams' Inspector Hubbard, who finally pieces together the mystery of the flat key (you will have to watch the film to understand).Some of the best moments are between Milland and subsidiary villain Anthony Dawson (Captain Lesgate / Swann), who is blackmailed into agreeing to be Milland's agent in his plot against the unfaithful Margot. An example of the dialog between the two scoundrels is shown on this thread, with Lesgate finding he can't scare Wendice into dropping the scheme and letting him alone. The whole sequence has to be seen - especially as Wendice keeps wiping off surfaces Lesgate touched during the scene...no fool our Tony! Hitchcock's film is usually shown in regular film stock, but he shot it also in 3-D. Unlike INFERNO there is little that is original in his use of 3-D (he probably did not know what to do with it). But in one of the critical scenes, wherein Grace Kelly is defending herself, he shows how 3-D can...err drive home a point about violence. It's one that is effective too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Voici l'anglais avec son sang froid habituel." This French saying -- roughly translated as, "Here come the English with their usual cold-bloodedness" -- has never been more fitting than in Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder."After he discovers that his wife Margot has been cheating on him with Mark Halliday, an American author of murder mysteries, Tony Wendice spends a year stalking his old schoolmate Charles Swann, then blackmails him into killing Margot. Tony has devised a complicated strategy for the perfect murder, but he plans it out down to the most minute details so much that when a few of those little details go wrong, the entire plan is botched, and Swann ends up dead instead of Margot. But Tony refuses to be discouraged and immediately hatches another scheme to have Margot convicted of Swann's murder and sentenced to death. It works, but as Margot's execution date approaches, her lover Mark Halliday begins putting his skills as an author of detective stories to work to save Margot and uncover the truth.While this movie may prove that there's no such thing as the perfect murder, it also proves that there is such thing as a perfect murder mystery, one that's gripping, scary, and smart, and all completely without any nudity or profanity. To me, the most interesting thing about "Dial M for Murder" was the impeccably polite behavior and iceberg calm that was maintained throughout. Sure, Tony is trying to kill his wife without getting caught, but that's no reason for anyone to get very upset, or even raise their voices. When Margot discovers of Tony's true intentions, for example, she simply says, "I don't seem to be able to feel anything" (!!). When one of the characters does get mad, it's more likely to be because no one offered to take his coat than because of the murders and attempted murders that are flying around. And after his plots are finally revealed by Mark Halliday and some clever policemen, Tony simply offers his wife -- the one he has just made two attempts to have killed! -- a glass of brandy. She accepts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maybe not a 'classic', but certainly a mini-masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial 'M' for Murder has become one of the forgotten Hitchcock films. It hardly ever gets any mention or recognition during those retrospectives on his life and career. That's a real shame. A crackerjack whodunit(actually since we the audience already know 'who', it's more like a 'how'dtheyfindout'), Hitchcock is well served by a marvelous performance from his lead, Ray Milland. This is the rare picture that actually tells the story exclusively from the point of view of the 'villain'. One reviewer wrote that the Bob Cummings and Grace Kelly characters were too shallow and underdeveloped. But that was exactly the point. The less depth the 'good guys' have, the more sympathetic Milland looks. It's not so much that we want him to get away with it, as it is that we get to know the inner workings of his mind. It is fascinating just to watch his eyes while he thinks on the spot how to change to plan 'b' while the original plan goes awry. You can almost see the wheels spinning in his brain. As with any mystery film, it's not just that we want the culprit caught, but it's how it gets resolved that's important. And for once in a Hitchcock movie, it's the officer who figures it out(Shadow of a Doubt is probably his only other movie where the police weren't represented as evil, or inept, or nonentities altogether). John Williams, as the inspector, proves to be the perfect foil for Milland, and seeing the two of them in action is the key to the film. Cummings and Kelly obviously have the thankless roles, purposely underwritten, in my opinion, to heighten the tension. It's tough and unfair to judge those types of roles. They do the best they can with what they have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apart from the plot, this is a film that you can enjoy again and again, for its unique atmosphere ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the previous reviews, what can one add? Simply that I adore this film, see it again and again, always with the same delight, never getting tired of it. Curiously, though, it does not seem to me like a typical Hitchcock film... There is not a "good guy" fighting some "bad guys". The hero is a cold blooded schemer, who wants to murder his wife, but she is not so innocent herself, since she has a secret affair with another man, while her lover comes into their house seemingly as a friend, but is determined to make her leave her husband. There are no action filled scenes, the story is confined within the couple's house, and all is done with the utmost politeness and keeping of appearances. There is no "murderer", because the one that commits the actual killing does so in self defense.And yet, we are watching with undiminished interest, to see what will happen next. All the fascination emanates from the "plan", the setting, the idea, the master mind that orchestrates the crime scene,like a director does his movie, only his "actors" play it differently from what he had arranged. He swiftly opts for an alternative plan, and concludes his "scenario" with success, until a police inspector with unorthodox methods finds the loose end, the small detail that leads to the truth... At least 80% of the film's value is due to the performance of Ray Milland, he is pure perfection in his portrayal of the ex champion, the sportsman who organizes his last game, and almost wins the bet... I am very much surprised that he did not get a second academy award for this one, it really shows how unfair the whole system is. It is impossible to point out any favorable scenes, as he is brilliant from the first to the very last moment he is on screen. I especially love, though, the little scene when he hides Margot's handbag behind his back in order to steal her key , while she clings to him, so as to prevent him , both laughing while they struggle... Grace Kelly was very very beautiful in this film, more girlish and sexy than in any of her other roles, not at all like her usual sophisticated and coolly aristocratic self. With Ray Milland they made such a charming couple, that one is almost disappointed that things did not work well for them in the film. If only Tony had a way of knowing that Margot had decided to abandon her ex lover and stay with her husband, the story would have a totally different end! In such a case we would have a romantic film instead of a thriller, but I would surely love such a happy end! Something else that should be said is that Tony would not get the death penalty for what he did, because he did not actually kill anyone, he just PLANNED a murder that did not take place in the end, so he would probably be out after one year or so... I trust that he would be able to make a new life for himself quite easily after that! A film that has no need of any recommendation, its value is well established over the years, but I give mine just the same, as well as 10 points out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock -- Ray Milland delivers stellar performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Milland pulls off another flawless performance as the jealous husband determined to have his cheating young wife Grace Kelly murdered. The aging former tennis star who lives mainly off his wife's wealth. When he learns of her infidelity with an American acquaintance, Milland's adoration for the beautiful Kelly becomes nothing more than a strained pretence, all-the-while planning how he can get rid of her, then live happily ever after off her money.A man Milland barely remembered from college has a few dark secrets, which Milland uses to blackmail him into the meticulously planned "perfect crime" of murdering Kelly. A clever (although typical) "Hitchcock-Twist" makes for a thrilling change to an unexpected "Plan B". Not as well known as similar Hitchcock films, this one is no less of a gem. Although the story and handling, particularly the dull-British "Scotland Yard" dialog are definitely from another era, the unfolding plot is sheer Hollywood candy. The final scene is priceless. A sure hit for those who love "whodunits" as well as for fans of the Master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Milland and Hitchcock create suspense classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dial M for Murder" is on of the best pictures that Alfred Hitchcock ever made. From beginning to end it is full of suspense and excitement. Hitchcock has taken a rather "talky" play and turned it into a suspense classic. While the screenplay screams to be "opened up", Hitchcock does a nice job of making the small one bedroom apartment interesting.Helping him do this is Ray Milland, who is nothing short of brilliant as the jilted cuckold, Tony Wendice, who plots to kill his wife. A former tennis pro, Tony must now live off of the wealth of his cheating wife, marvelously portrayed by the radiantly, beautiful Grace Kelley. Robert Cummings plays the love interest to Kelly. Cummings is pretty bland as Mark Halladay, mystery writer. But then, Halladay is the least interesting character in the play/screenplay. John Williams almost walks off with the picture as Inspector Hubbard.The score by Dimitri Tiomkin is appropriately eerie.But Milland is by far and away the stand-out of this film. Icy, a little creepy, and calculating, this is also, other than "The Lost Weekend", his finest performance.In my opinion the only major flaw is the last 12-14 minutes. Too contrived and unrealistic. Although I did like the final moment, where all they want to do is have a civilized drink together.A wonderful performance, wonderful suspenseful direction and score all add up to a truly great film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this film is made with a sort of flamboyance. The film is really more of a slick sort of entertainment than all around masterpiece like so many of his are. First, I have to say that the film is as clever as a film of this stature will ever be. The storyline is basic..a man wants his adulterous wife dead. He "hitches" a plan by blackmailing a con artist he knew from school to murder his wife. The perfect murder seems to be afoot. But as our author Mark(the one that ole wifie was canoodling with)points out:"THE PERFECT MURDER IS PERFECT ON PAPER". As the film twists and turns, this perfect plan has consistent screw ups due to human nature. In reality, often times real murderers leave small clues because human nature is not immune to mistakes. The way our husband concocts his plan to the unfortunate con artist is shown in a masterful way by Hitch. Hitch has the camera overheading the room showing the two discussing the plan from above. Hitch makes sure we understand how everything is suppose to work so we will understand how this plan will ultimately backfire. Sure, we know that things will not happen as beautifully as our husband plans them. The film takes great strides to tie all loose ends so we will not find plot holes. The film suffers, in my opinion, from some overacting from Grace Kelly and a way too tidy ending where everything ends so the viewer can sleep well knowing that Hollywood wouldn't let them have the perfect crime(which winds up being Ms. Kelly killing our con artist and getting framed for murder by the husband's clever trickery). The film is a lot of fun and the story's unravelling is entertaining. The characters are strong, but the film isn't as great as many of his classics. ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks that Essential Hitchcock Ingredient- Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Alfred Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1940, he continued to make occasional films with a British setting. Some , such as "Stage Fright" or "Frenzy", were actually shot in Britain, whereas others such as "Rebecca" or "Dial M for Murder" were filmed in America despite an ostensible British setting. "Dial M for Murder" started life as a stage play, and remains very stagey even in its cinema version. Apart from one scene in a gentleman's club and a few views of the street , the whole film takes place in one location, the living-room of a London flat. This is one of the few films in which Hitchcock does not appear in person. As in "Lifeboat", his cameo appearance comes in the form of a photograph. Tony Wendice is a retired professional tennis player living in London with his beautiful younger wife Margot. (Guy Haines, the hero of Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train" , was also a successful tennis star, although in his case an amateur). The marriage is not a happy one, and Margot has been having an affair with the American crime novelist Mark Halliday. Tony has devised a plan to have Margot murdered, although his motivation is not sexual jealousy; he displays no malice towards Halliday and the two men even appear to be friends. He is rather motivated by financial greed; Margot is independently wealthy and Tony is the sole beneficiary of her will. Tony gets in touch with Charles Swann, an disreputable acquaintance with a criminal record, and persuades him to agree to kill Margot using a mixture of bribery and blackmail. The film's title derives from the telephone call which Tony will make to his flat and will be the signal for Swann to carry out the murder. The plan, however, goes wrong. Swann enters the flat as arranged, but while he is attempting to strangle Margot, she manages to reach a pair of scissors and stabs him to death. Tony's scheme appears to have misfired, but he is quick-thinking enough to improvise another plan, planting evidence suggesting that Swann was blackmailing Margot over her affair. The police do not believe Margot's story that she killed Swann in self-defence and she is arrested, tried and sentenced to death for murder. Numerous Hitchcock films include a character wrongly accused of a crime, but normally that character is male and plays an active role in establishing his innocence and bringing the real perpetrator to justice. (Examples include Derrick de Marney's character in "Young and Innocent" or Cary Grant's in "North by North-West"). Margot is virtually the only female character in a Hitchcock film to find herself in this plight, and after her conviction disappears from the action until the end of the film. The lead in establishing her innocence and Tony's guilt is taken by a detective, Chief Inspector Hubbard. Although most of Hitchcock's films deal with crime, individual police officers rarely play an important role; "Dial M for Murder", like "Stage Fright", is one of the few exceptions. To judge from its high rating on this board, "Dial M for Murder" still has many admirers, but I have always regarded it as one of Hitchcock's weaker efforts. Although he made other films with claustrophobic settings, notably "Lifeboat", and "Rear Window", few of his films are adapted from stage plays ("Rope" being another example), and I feel that this one would have benefited from being opened up to a greater extent. The acting is far from distinguished. Grace Kelly looks gorgeous, as she normally did, but this is by far the weakest of the three performances she gave for Hitchcock. (The others were "Rear Window", also made in1954, and "To Catch a Thief" from the following year). Ray Milland is bland and wooden as Tony. It might have been more interesting if the role had gone to Cary Grant, a frequent Hitchcock collaborator, who wanted it, but apparently the studio were afraid that audiences would not accept him as a villain. There is, in fact, no really sympathetic character with whom the audience can identify. Tony is an obvious villain. Mark is a selfish playboy, and even though he is a crime writer he seems ignorant when it comes to real-life crime. Margot is weak and passive, and as an adulteress does not attract much audience sympathy. (Fifties audiences probably worried more about such things than modern ones would do). Although Hubbard is instrumental in finding the crucial evidence which clears Margot, we are also aware that it was originally his mistakes which led to her being wrongly arrested and convicted, and his change of heart about her guilt is never really explained. The film's greatest weakness, however, is that it lacks that essential Hitchcock ingredient, tension. It is probably the most "talky" of all his films, with little physical action except for the scene where Margot stabs Swann. There is no heart-stopping set-piece comparable to, say, the cornfield scene in "North by North-West" or the shower scene in "Psycho". The denouement is a prosaic affair, involving lots of talk about the location of various keys. In a bizarre twist, Margot is released from jail and returned to her flat to assist Hubbard with his investigations, even though she is supposed to be under sentence of death. (I really cannot imagine the authorities ever sanctioning such an arrangement). The fifties are often regarded as the decade when Hitchcock was working at the height of his powers, and he certainly produced some of his greatest films during this period. ("Strangers on a Train", "I Confess", "Vertigo", "North by North-West"). With the possible exception of "Stage Fright", however, "Dial M for Murder" must count as his weakest from this decade. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** for me, this movie is hitchcock's best. everything is high above average, the cast, the directing, the plot, the screenplay, the cinemathography, the music and the whole movie. movie is abot a man (ray milland) who wants to kill his wife (grace kelly) because of two reasons, one is the money he will inherit and the other is because he discovered that his wife is in love with a novelist writer (robert cummings). milland deviously convince an ex-classmate (anthony dawson) to kill his wife while he is in a party with cummings. but dawson fails to kill kelly and himself is killed by her with scissors. things begin to get rough for milland and then he elaborate a very complex plan to blame his wife for the murder of dawson. the movie goes along with the police investigation and how the inspector (john williams) and cummings begin to suspect of milland.ray milland gives an excellent performance. this is the best performance by grace kelly (second is her role in "REAR WINDOW"). cumming gives his best role ever (although he is still wooden faced). dawson is outstanding as the forced murderer and john williams is unforgivable as the extremely british chief inspector.hitchcock directed this movie with all his stamina, each shot is a piece of art. an epic scene is when grace kelly is judged. the stuff about the scissors is very creative and the whole picture is like a very real dream. in this movie you will have to think a lot because the plot is sometimes complicated, but i think this is a good point."SPOILERS AHEAD"special mention to the reaction that milland has when the police discovered his trick. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Dial 'H' for Hitchcock !!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch this movie it's impossible not to feel that Alfred Hitchcock was a genius! Whether it's a thriller like "North by North west" where the viewer is taken half-way across America, or an espionage movie that treks across Europe in "Foreign correspondent" or just simply a plain case of mistaken identity in the "The wrong man", Hitchcock was always able to find the right tempo, atmosphere and chemistry for his films. It's hard to imagine a simple stage play being transformed into a Hollywood box office hit, because with the exception of one or two short scenes, the entire movie takes place in a confined environment of a ground floor flat in Maida Vale London. Not surprisingly Hitchcock does not disappoint and is able to pull it off by producing a highly entertaining film!It is a well written story with great dialog between the characters, but it is the tension, the incidental music and the camera angles that make this movie compelling viewing. Needless to say the movie was blessed with some big box office draws of the day in Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and Ray Milland, with fine support from Hollywood based Brits character actors Anthony Dawson and John Williams. I'm not suggesting that Dial M for murder is Hitchcocks best movie, the best of course is a subjective viewpoint, but the lead character here Tony Wendice who plays the villain, a washed up former tennis pro is probably Hitchcocks most diabolical killer. I say that because he is not deranged or violent but cold and calculating, he is able to personify evil in an easy-going and matter of fact way. For example not only does he really enjoy blackmailing Swan but takes great pleasure in detailing the way he plans to kill his wife and get away with it. In addition you can see that he is proud of the meticulous planning and ruthless dedication that has gone into this. What's fascinating about the character is that when he gets home and finds Swan dead rather than panic he does some quick thinking, takes advantage of that and is able to stitch up his wife Margot for Swans killing. With his marital woes now behind him (his wife going to the gallows) and the only person who knows other wise unable to talk you can see that he is pretty pleased with himself. Things couldn't have worked out any better for him and he even starts spend the cash he did not have to pay Swan. Even at the very end, a very nonchalant Wendice just casually pores himself a drink as if he had just come in from work. Watching him is like watching water of a ducks back, you'll simply never see Ray Milland in a better role!Robert Cummings plays crime writer Mark Halladay who is Margots lover, and Grace Kelly plays Margot who comes across as mostly bewildered the whole time, even before the attempt on here life. John Williams plays police inspector Hubbard who at first one just dismisses as an eccentric dunce. Initially you underestimate him and wonder if he is in over his head, but as his role becomes more prominent you realize that he is smarter than he looks and is way ahead of Wendice as things unravel. Lot's of twists and turns as you would expect from a Hitchcock movie and despite some obvious legal problems with the crowns case against Margot, it's well worth a watch! (Note: even if the initial crime had been successful and Swan had been able to extricate himself from the flat the police might have been puzzled why there was no wet footprints, grass or mud on the carpet bearing in mind that the garden was wet and that was the way he had meant to have gained access?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of slow but still pretty good Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suave, debonair Ray Milland wants wife Grace Kelly killed for cheating on him with bland Robert Cummings. He sets it up...and everything goes wrong.The script is pretty obviously from a stage play and most of the movie takes place in one room. Also the ultimate resolution was more than a little silly. Still this is not bad. I saw it in 3-D and 2-D. In 2-D this is slow and dull...3-D actually helps it. The camera is constantly shooting people in the background from behind lamps, couches, chairs etc etc. It adds a great feeling of depth to the surroundings. Hitchcock (wisely) avoided throwing things at the camera--there are only two instances of this: When Kelly is attacked her hand flies up to the camera--it was so real for half a second I almost reached up to help her! Also when someone holds out a key to the camera it comes right out of the screen at you. Hitchcock didn't want the 3-D--he was ordered by studio heads to shoot it that way. Still, he DID manage to use it in an effective way.The acting is almost completely great; Milland is fantastic--very smooth and suave as the villain; Kelly is just visually stunning and also gives out a good performance; John Williams is just terrific as an inspector trying to figure the crime out. Only Robert Cummings is not that good--he's bland and blank-faced the entire time. You really wonder what Kelly ever SAW in him!I like it but I think it drags quite a bit in the second half. I was getting a little bored. Seeing it in 3-D definitely improved the picture. Also it contains one of the most shocking murders in a Hitchcock film--right up there with "Psycho"!So it's worth a look--try seeing the 3-D version. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not as gripping as Hitchcock's greater efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"North by Northwest" is a great example of classic, gripping Hitchcock style -- that movie grabs you by the throat and never lets go! Nowadays I look back at many films from the '50s and '60s and definitely appreciate them, but feel cinematic ally they are much slower and not always as engaging as movies from the '70s, '90s and yes, even the '80s.Hitchcock was a truly great filmmaker, and evidence of this is that nowadays his films are STILL packing a punch and they don't seem outdated in the least! I mean, when was the last time you watched "Psycho" and checked your watch? Unfortunately Hitchcock did make a few errors in his resume (namely his last project) and "Dial M For Murder" is somewhere in between. It's a good "talky" movie in the sense that a bunch of people are in a room acting civilized and sophisticated and upper class (much like "Rope" starring James Stewart, also directed by Hitchcock).But the suspense is lacking and the film is not of the same calibre as "North by Northwest" or "Psycho." It's a good film, and for my money it's better than "The Birds," but don't expect any sort of masterpiece -- otherwise you might feel rather disappointed.(For the record, critics seem to generally consider this Hitchcock's worst movie if only for the reason that it was made during a time when he was very popular and it didn't do very well -- kind of like the 1950s' version of "1941" or another flop, people -- primarily critics -- didn't take a real liking to it and it'll probably always be considered his worst mainstream US movie.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets better with each watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone loves Hitchcock. This one is my favorite. "Rear Window" and objectively speaking probably half a dozen others are better but this film is for me. Ray Milland plays a tennis player in the cruel old days when it was not good enough to be good at something. His wife got the money. Grace Kelly did not need much acting talent to play a boring woman but this is not why Ray wants to get rid of her. She falls in love with another man - Ray Cummings of all people. This casting is of course the reason why this film works. We are supposed to sympathize with the greedy husband and at the same time the wife has to be an angel. Very difficult but Hitchcock succeeds. And mainly because we cannot forgive her for even thinking of giving up her husband for a man like him. Still, at the crucial time when she is about to be strangled our sympathies shift to her. We want her to reach the scissors.And then we admire Ray Milland again and hope he will make it. His eyes are the most wonderful thing in the movies. It is a great pity that he played only in a few good ones even after "Lost Weekend". This is one of the few thrillers that can be watched over and over again. One drawback of course is that after a while you start thinking about the acting and the great directing and the simple pleasure of watching a good movie shifts to the background. This is true for all great films except for the greatest of them all like GWTW or "Thief of Bagdad" that can be watched a hundred times and still be seen like the first time -where you just enjoy the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Hitchcock's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a stage play, the film's plot takes place mostly in one apartment, a cozy abode complete with a fire burning in the fireplace. An aging tennis pro named Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plans his wife's murder with the help of an old acquaintance.Wendice is charming, debonair, and intelligent, a man with great foresight who constructs his crime in meticulous detail. Half the fun of this film is watching, and listening to, this guy as he articulates his scheme with confident coolness. Ray Milland is just terrific in the role.Naturally, complications ensue as the film's plot moves along. Not even the scheming Tony Wendice can foresee every possible contingency. And in the second half we get to watch him squirm, mentally struggle, and improvise, as his airtight plan starts to unravel.The Frederick Knott script is heavy on dialogue, but the film is so engaging that it never seems "talky". Hitchcock's direction is fine. Color cinematography includes some clever camera angles that help break up the monotony of such an enclosed setting. Yet, the film has a claustrophobic feel that actually enhances the anxiety and tension of the situations the characters find themselves in.Dimitri Tiomkin's elegant score fits well with the formal attire of the characters. The impression is thus conveyed that Tony and his wife are sophisticated, well off financially, and connected to society's upper crust. Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings give fine performances in support roles. And John Williams' performance is as outstanding as that of Ray Milland.This film is not a whodunit. The story is simple and straightforward. It's more of a character study, particularly of Tony Wendice.With a terrific story, engaging characters, excellent acting, clever photography, and credible production design, "Dial M For Murder" is thoroughly enjoyable. It is one of my three favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absorbing Cat-and-Mouse Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Alfred Hitchcock's best-known films, "Dial M For Murder" is a carefully crafted and absorbing cat-and-mouse game that keeps the viewer's attention all the way until the end. The very simple settings and small cast focus all of our attention on the battle of wits a between a scheming husband, played with style by Ray Milland, and the rest of the characters.The story begins when retired tennis pro Tony Wendice (Milland) decides to eliminate his rich, unfaithful wife Margot. He has laid out an elaborate scheme that starts with blackmailing an old college classmate to do the job for him. But things do not work out as planned, and Wendice must spend the rest of the film constantly trying to improvise his way out of difficulty.The blackmailing scene at the beginning makes a great prelude to all that follows. The way that Wendice approaches such a sordid business in such a debonair fashion both initiates all of the plot action and also establishes some nice character contrasts. (Also watch this scene carefully for one of Hitchcock's most subtle cameo appearances.)The rest of the plot is complicated and contains some fine surprises. As always, it is handled expertly by Hitchcock, who makes sure that we focus both on the characters and on the clues. Milland gives a fine performance as Wendice, making us admire his poise and resourcefulness despite his amoral coldness. Hitchcock favorite John Williams is excellent as the police inspector.The only thing that keeps this from being one of Hitchcock's very best films is the weaknesses in the other two major characters. As Margot, Grace Kelly is charming as always, but her character makes too many obvious mistakes for us to sympathize with her as deeply as we could. As Margot's boyfriend, Robert Cummings is too over-eager and one-dimensional for us to like him very much. These imperfections keep the viewer's emotional involvement from being even stronger, but even so the story is still filled with suspense and interest."Dial M For Murder" will bring a lot of satisfaction to mystery and thriller fans as they watch it and try to figure out what will happen next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful is the only word for this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say this movie is as fantastic as it is and then it not be considered one of Hitchcock's very best, well it only goes to prove how amazing a director he was. Dial M for Murder is a very dialogue heavy movie, but don't let that fool you into thinking it may be boring or well, too laden with conversations. The film is truly thrilling and working out what will happen next is no easy game, Hitchcock gets the absolute most out of the play it is adapted from and the most from the cast too, with the likes of Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings all shining in their respective roles. It of course centres on a plan for a husband to off his wife called Margot (Kelly) by her husband Tony (Milland), of course Tony thinks he has the perfect murder, and even if he hasn't, he has a few tricks he can pull.The story moves along at a nice pace, never too fast or too slow and constantly fits itself nicely into its running time. Hitchcock just knew here how to truly get the scenes he wanted and uses things like light to truly create a sense of doom or a sense of hope, fine work from the director considered one of the best at suspense. I wasn't all together sure on the score for the film which can at times sound like some kind of cartoon or in any case a much happier film and although it can be used well, it just doesn't feel right sometimes. To be fair other than the score there isn't too much wrong with this at all, acting maybe not always on point but I'll come to that next.I wasn't always so sure on Grace Kelly, many a person who has seen this has mentioned her as doing a good job but I didn't feel she was at her very best. The by far best cast member has to be Ray Milland who kind of has to step up in this movie so we see him as the evil he is, but that also we can follow him through the story without getting bored. John Williams as Inspector Hubbard is a good addition to the cast and can actually at times add a little comedic relief randomly here and there, he over time becomes a character you come to not mind as much as maybe when he first walks in. One thing about this movie that I can't say I have seen much is the way in which it lets you follow the protagonist but he is not good and although inside you do not want him to succeed, you expect that everything that happens will all go to plan (whether it does or not well you will have to see). Yet again Hitchcock brings us this nice little gem of a thing, he really gets the camera put on Milland but in a way where although he is in the shot, he remains behind peoples backs and he moves away from others a lot, it feels like it is meant for him to seem distant and of course more sinister than other characters.Overall Dial M for Murder is as I said not really thought of as within Hitchcock's absolute best works but this is really an excellent little piece, worth a watch whether a fan of Hitchcock or you have never seen one of his films before. He does of course borrow elements from past films and that makes this not any copy of his previous works, but it actually also makes it much better as he can draw from his own inspiration but then make a film like this that feels like a play (of which as mentioned it is based on).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Hitchcock Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a well-crafted thriller to enjoy, look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, Dial M for Murder. On the outside, nothing much seems to happen with the film, but once you see it, well you are in for a surprise. As Hitchcock films goes, this one is more off-beat. However, you can classify the film as one of best films of the legendary director's career.If you look at the film from the outside, you are wondering how on earth is this film even good. For starters, most of the film is located in a single apartment room save for exterior shots and a scene at a theater. You need a well-crafted screenplay for single-location movies to work. Also outside of one rather fantastic murder scene, most of the film is talk, talk, and more talk. But this film does work because everyone plays their cards right. The screenplay is well-crafted and despite all the talk, it creates an aura of tension and mystery which builds up over the course of the film, before we reach the shocking ending. The build-up is excellent and it is very much worth it when the end is revealed. I also like that despite the movie being located in one room 98% of the time, you never get that feel of unintentional claustrophobia. So thanks to the excellent screenplay by Frederick Knott and masterful direction by Alfred Hitchcock, you never really think about that one location.Now it's time to describe the plot of the movie, which takes place in London. The wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with an American author named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Her husband, Tony (Ray Milland), a professional tennis player, was away from home at the time on a tour. However, he quits tennis because he wants to spend more time with Margot, and help a marriage that is crumbling apart. One day, Mark decides to visit the couple from America. During the affair, Mark had written letters to Margot. She insists she destroyed them all, but one letter was stolen. She claimed she was blackmailed, but she never really thought much about that letter. When Tony arrives home, he insists Mark and Margot go to the theater, and he will arrive shortly thereafter. However, he ends up calling an old colleague, Captain Lesgate (Anthony Dawson). Together, they plot the murder of his wife so he can gain her fortune. But complications arise in the form of failed opportunities, the police led by Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), and Tony trying to constantly cover his footsteps so he will not be implicated in any wrongdoing.Here is a film that is a masterpiece when it comes to delivering acting skills. Ray Milland injects his character with an incredible amount of charm, and his character is often likable even if his motives are not. His simple charm was enough to win me and many, many people over, enough to believe how he would do nothing wrong. Grace Kelly is absolutely magnificent in her role as Margot. During the murder scene, her performance was enough for me to wish she was nominated for an Oscar, which sadly enough she wasn't. These were the two main attractions of the movies, but there was another great performance to point out. John Williams (no, not the legendary composer), has been a staple of Hitchcock movies, so it is no surprise for him to show up here. I really loved his finesse role as the police detective who figures out this case, piece-by-piece with a remarkable eye.Hitchcock is one of Hollywood's most famous auteurs. When one think of his works, usually The Birds, Vertigo, Rear Window, or, Psycho comes to mind. But never count out this underrated film. During the first phase of 3-D phase in the 40's and 50's, many films were subjected to 3D treatment. However the faze begin to die out in the mid 1950's, and this is the last film to use 3D during that phase. I did not have the opportunity to watch the movie in 3D, but it could have been cool. For those who watch Hitchcock films, you should be familiar with him appearing in his movies somehow, someway. In Dial M for Murder, you'll really have to search to find him and it's a genius move to see where you'll find him.Overall, Dial M for Murder is just pure, classic Hitchcock. It's one of his underrated films, but there is no denying it is a masterpiece. The premise is a simple one, but Hitchcock turned into a twisting tale that pierces the heart with a load of dread and thrills. It's a very captivating movie, not only from the direction, but also from charming performances from Milland and Kelly, whom characters are likable. The film is good at talking, but you should be good at watching. I highly recommend this fine thriller that has Hitchcock in top form.My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most powerful and wonderful spell caster on earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When your spouse is having an affair, your world becomes a confusing, scary place full of hurt, shame, and anger. You will wonder why this has happened and what action(s) to take. The question of what to do when you learn your spouse is having an affair will have a different answer at different times and under different circumstances. What you should do in your specific situation might be a lot different from what someone else should consider doing, but in most cases, it starts by deciding what you really want to take place, and why you want the answer. If you have decided to divorce quietly, move to another country (or planet) and just forget the whole ordeal, what you should probably do to make that happen smoothly will be a lot different than if you really want to know if you're likely to still be married to the same partner 10, 20 or more years from now. As a guess, you aren't online looking for advice that supports that choice, since that path seems pretty clear for most people, once chosen.Assuming that what you are really looking for is advice to help your marriage survive, let me make a few suggestions about what you can actually do.When i met my husband then it crystal clear to me that he was the man of my dream. When i looked at him, i saw perfection. He was tall, respectful, looked at me like i was the only one on earth i mean words cannot describe that moment that is the day we met. It lives on here in my head. I know i was not blind and i know there was nothing really to make me suspect he also like the company of men as well as women. Yes i mean we were sexually active just like every other normal couple who are in love. It never seem like he was avoiding me when i want to have *** like he always comes up with excuse no he was just like every other man. I only got to know when i was two years into our marriage. The first year was healthy for us i mean we were happy and had our first child. It was my sister who caught him passionately kissing another man his car after spending all night together in the movie theater. He told me he was going out with friends for a drink or two. I was hurt because he was not honest with me and also was cheating on me. Even before i knew, this thing he had going on started before we got married at least he was honest about that. Hadn't been my sister, i would have been locked in the dark. I have nothing against same sex relationship but when you claim to love a woman and also want to be with a man it becomes a problem i mean you are either with one or the other. You can't be married to me and expect me to shear you with another be it a woman or a man. We promise we will stay together just us and not us with some one else. I gave him an ultimatum it was either me or his male love i was hoping his love for me will make him pick me but no he ended our marriage simply before he could not pick. He wanted it all i wished i never made him choose then. I was in a traumatized i could not understand how he could be so selfish i mean we have a son together you don't just walk out like that. I remember i even asked him to go ahead with relationship with his lover as long as he was here with me but then i realized i would be at the losing end in all ways. I was so much in love with him letting him go was not an option for me i mean i knew that if it wasn't him it was going to me no other. After months of trying and searching with no success to find a way to make him see i am more important than his lover i came across a lot of comments on the internet of how a spell caster Akpe Osilama and how he has help a lot of individual with relationship and life problems. I was skeptical about it but i thought giving it a try would not kill me. What can i say, my experience with Akpe Osilama was real, honest i mean everything that was said about him was nothing but all true. I shared my problem with him that is how my husband ended our marriage because i was not OK with him have a male lover even when we were married and what i needed him to do for me. I got the materials to get the spell that was going to get me my husband. I could only find one of the spell materials but he help me get the rest with the total estimated cost i sent to him for help. I don't know how to explain what happen just after the spell process was concluded and made effective with the parcel he sent to me. I was like a fairy tale i mean i got my love back my family was whole again. My husband picked me he choose to be with me. It been more than six months now all i can see is a man loves and dedicate his self to me he goes every where with me aside work though yeah. Contact him here at chiefpriestakpeosilamaspellcast"at""yahoo""dot""com" convert email address to the standard email format. Hope you all with similar problem and any kind of mess you find yourself in life get all help from Akpe Osilama also. I also hope this comment will help a lot of you trying to keep your marriage bond strong.//</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, a story where former tennis player Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) decides to murder his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) for her money and her affair with writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). He blackmails an old college associate to commit the crime for him, but when things don't go according to plans, Wendice quickly hatches up a Plan B.The plot almost immediately gets to the point at the beginning, from Mark and Margot's dramatic talks about their relationship to Tony hatching up his plan for the perfect murder. Director Hitchcock brilliantly combines drama and thrills in the movie that will make you go along with all the detectives' investigation of the crime and them putting pieces of the puzzle together. Hitchcock keeps the suspense going throughout the film, filling you with intrigue from start to finish.The cast did an outstanding job in their acting roles, giving us classy and dignified yet dramatic performances in their characters. I especially enjoyed Ray Milland's crafty yet calm portrayal of Tony Wendice and Grace Kelly's beautiful and determined yet vulnerable portrayal of Margot Wendice. In addition, Robert Burks did a great job on the cinematography, especially in achieving the brilliance in color of the Wendices' upscale apartment flat.For the first time watching this 1954 movie in 2015, the story still looks fresh and captivating to me and it is highly recommend to any fans of mystery movies.Grade A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alas, the 3-D version seems to have disappeared, although one does hear rumors of its screening at special events from time to time. Hitch took great care to ensure that the 3-D effects enhanced the story rather prove a distraction. To this end, he asked Fred Knott to write three or four minutes of inconsequential, introductory dialogue so that movie audiences would get used to the effects produced by the 3-D cameras and could then focus their attention on the plot and the dialogue. He also reasoned that the major effects, particularly the sequence with the scissors would come across far more dramatically if they had a visual element of surprise. When viewing the movie in its flat version, one wonders why the devil Knott is marking time when the curtains part and doesn't get on with the plot. My original theory was that he wanted to accommodate latecomers, but that isn't the case at all. Hitch simply wanted audiences to settle down, so that he could spring a few 3-D surprises later on, such as the all-important scissors scene. On the acting side of the movie, Milland, Kelly and Dawson walk away with the honors. To my mind, Williams' performance is somewhat odd. I know police detectives are supposed to impassive ? especially British police detectives ? but to my mind, Williams overdoes the impassivity. In fact, he simply repeats his stage performance and makes no effort whatever to cater for a movie audience ? except, of course, to lower his voice. Because Williams is so impassive, it's possible to notice several gaping holes in the plot, which a more colorful performance could have disguised. All in all, though, despite the shortcomings of the flat version, Dial M for Murder is still a must-see movie. Available on a superb Warner Brothers DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Cummings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought much of Robert Cummings as an actor. But recently I found a disc called 'Robert Cummings Directed by Alfred Hitchcock' I had recorded a few years ago. It contains SABOTEUR and DIAL M FOR MURDER. He plays this goofy-grinned innocent (wrongly accused of sabotage) in the first film, with Priscilla Lane-- and I thought Hitchcock made the right decision casting Cummings. It really did have to be a guy who comes across wholesome and likable, whose life is turned upside down because he had the great misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. And the romance that occurs between Cummings and Lane fires on all cylinders. I love the scene where he manhandles her in the car, when she is screaming for the police. Hysterical, yet sexy.In DIAL M, he is third-billed and he does not have as much screen time, but again he fits into a Hitchcock film about murder and deception perfectly. He has to be the innocent potential love interest to balance out the nefarious cold-blooded husband played by Ray Milland. We know that Grace Kelly will be happy with Cummings, after the sordid mess with Milland has been put behind her.So watching these two titles last night helped me develop a deep appreciation for Cummings who just has such a likable screen persona, you can't help but love the dude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's most wordy film is also a top notch mystery movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm afraid my murders would be something like my bridge: I'd make some stupid mistake and never realize it until I found everybody was looking at me."Hitchcock loved to innovate and experiment with his films and some might argue that Dial M for Murder is his most straightforward mystery movie. But what we forget is that Hitchcock made this film in 3-D which explains why there are so many low- angle shots. Warner Bros forced him to do so, but in a way we can call this another experimentation from the Master of Suspense. It is by far his most wordy film and just like Rope the screenplay was adapted from a play. The film takes place almost entirely in a small British apartment where Tony (Ray Milland) and Margot (Grace Kelly) live. Over a year ago Margot had an affair with an American crime author named Mark (Robert Cummings) who is now returning to England. Mark meets with Margot and that is where we are introduced to their backstory. They had had a very torrid love affair and he continued to write to her after he returned to America, but she didn't. She explains that after Mark left, her husband had decided to quit tennis to spend more time with her and that she didn't want to leave him anymore. What Margot doesn't know however, is that her husband discovered her secret affair and was simply waiting for the perfect opportunity to have his revenge. Tony blackmails one of his former schoolmates, Swann (Anthony Dawson), and convinces him to murder his wife while he goes to a guys reunion with Mark providing the perfect alibi. Tony has been planning this perfect murder for quite some time so he can inherit her money (she is the one with the wealthy family). But something unexpected happens and the film took some interesting and clever turns that had me at the edge of my seat.I've mentioned before that in my opinion Hitchcock directed his best movies during the 50's and this is yet another great example of a film that was made during the height of his career. There might not be as many innovative filming techniques here, but the heart of the film relies on its clever story full of unexpected twists. This is the very definition of a mystery film and it stands out for the story alone. If you don't like wordy films then this isn't one for you because it feels very theatrical considering it takes place mostly in one room and it relies heavily on explanations. It's no secret that Hitchcock knows perfectly well how to create suspense and he manages to do so in this talkative movie relying on dialogue this time around more than on anything else. Although I do have to say that the confrontation between Kelly's character and Dawson is incredibly tense and filmed perfectly. It's one of the best scenes in the movie and very memorable as well. There is something about the mystery story here that feels like it was taken from an Agatha Christie novel or from Sherlock Holmes, and Hitchcock knew that he had a great story to work with and relied on the power of storytelling this time around.Grace Kelly is perhaps one of my favorite Hitchcock leading ladies and this might be her best role. I loved Rear Window and she was wonderful in it, but James Stewart owned that film. Here Grace Kelly shines in every scene and she is wonderful in the surprise attack scene as well. Ray Milland, who was unknown to me, did a wonderful job in the lead villain role, while Robert Cummings also delivered. I expected his character to be the one to figure everything out, but Hitchcock does include some clever twists and it's someone else who takes on the role of Sherlock Holmes, John Williams, who plays the Chief Inspector in this film. In a talky film like this, it is very important that you have convincing actors to play the roles and I felt that the cast delivered solid performances. This film may fly under the radar in Hitchcock's astonishing filmography, but I had a really good time with the screenplay and enjoyed it more than some other beloved Hitchcock films. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never thought that in 2015 i would write that i wish i was alive during the periods in which films were magical, funny, intelligent, Horrifying, mystical or dramatic-all. Today we see films with no story but explosions, nudity, immature Language and other alternatives used to glue a film together. Dial M for Murder was great, it had very deep story and characters that you appreciated for their own agendas, The pacing is brilliant, the film doesn't let it self explore one scene for to long, for it to become boring. The film throws curve balls at you for you to keep on guessing and for you to feel like the writer of the film, trying to understand where it is leading you. In the end you get caught in the story, and in the performances of the actors and forget that nearly 2 hours have gone by. To bad the same can not be said for modern day films. Where we learn to multi-task with one eye on the screen and the other on our phones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is mainly set in one apartment in London but its obvious this is a film set in California.During the opening minutes we realise dastardly Ray Milland has made elaborate plans to kill his wife, Grace Kelly who has been having an affair with a crime writer. Although the murder is meticulously planned by Milland it goes wrong and Kelly is charged with killing instead but it takes a determined police inspector to unravel the mystery.Milland is cold blooded who is enjoying his cat and mouse game, Grace Kelly is the usual blonde damsel in peril that Hitchcock loves so much. There are some unusual camera angles here but it actually makes the film look more like a stage adaptation than a feature film.I felt that the movie needed opening up and would had been better if it was shot on location in Britain rather than filled with American based British actors in a studio setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock proves again why he is a master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched Psycho when I was only first becoming a film buff. I was unimpressed. For years I wondered why everyone loved Hitchcock so much. Then I grew and matured and found an appreciation for art and style and the effort and creativity that goes into film making and re-visited Hitchcock with Rear Window and Rope and my jaw dropped. I saw it...I saw the brilliance, the eccentricities, the suspense and the camera angles and the way he made his actors portray their characters. His best work (in my opinion) seems to be Stage Plays adapted for the big screen. I've never seen anyone perfectly capture a Stage Play and make it so perfect on film. Dial M For Murder is no exception. This absolutely breathtaking murder mystery reeks of suspense and dark characters and a nearly perfectly paced mystery that never misses a beat for even a moment. You can absolutely tell it was originally meant for stage given the entire film nearly takes on one set but you never once feel confined or like its the same drab backdrop. In fact, that apartment setting will come to feel like home and like you're sitting in the living room watching this story unfold before you.If I had one major complaint about this film...it wouldn't even be a complaint. I liked this cast. They all did very well and I loved this film so to speak ill of them wouldn't be right. However! The Main cast doesn't have quite the legendary charisma and chemistry of say...Cary Grant or James Stewart...if either (or both!) of those men had played the leads in this film...well the sheer mention of it gives me goosebumps. In fact, I understand Hitchcock wanted Grant for the role. Still, Ray Milland is excellent and absolutely menacing and twisted as the ex-tennis pro and husband Tony. At one point in the film I realized that I quietly mumbled something under my breath that implied I was inadvertently rooting for him! He is the ultimate villain and the film revolves around him. The stunning Grace Kelly (this woman defines elegance) plays his wife and the would be victim. Kelly is very good and she can do very little and still seem amazing because of her own level of chemistry on screen. She has a more subtle performance as the victim compared to the men but she is very good. Robert Cummings is good as her lover and the amateur detective of the film. He is sort of a background character but when he is on screen (especially during the climatic ending in his scenes with Milland) he is very good. Anthony Dawson was absolutely perfect as the menacing would be killer and the entire plot scene with him and Milland will be forever burned in my memory as an amazing dialogue scene. John Williams is also very good (reprising his role that he played on stage) and the lead inspector of the investigation. Every player in the film gets at least a moment or two or several lines where they really shine.How does Hitchcock take a story...or a play...and make it this soul searching story about the good and evil in men. Each shot, every take, every scene, every moment of dialogue is brooding and dark and gets under your skin. This film is an exception because it actually wraps everything up in a neat and tidy little bow but everything leading up to that will have you on the edge of your seat. People often get tired of hearing the old phrase "they don't make them like this anymore" but if you watch this film and dissect it or don't even do that...just watch it and pay attention to the characters and story and the tiny little things they do to make sure every part of the plot works and you'll realize they literally are incapable of making a film as effective as this anymore. Dial M For Murder is the perfect thriller!! It demonstrates why Hitchcock is a master of his genre and it is absolutely thoroughly entertaining. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrific film by a terrific director. Setup mostly in a single apartment with lot many details of apartment and characters explored in very little time, this is a very good detailed film about murder. There is a lot of conversation, for the most part of it. Most of it is planning the murder, and the rest of conversation is about covering up by culprit, then the culprit being brought to justice. The best part is in the first 10-15 minutes itself we know of what would come. Who has planned whose murder that is setup very clearly. Now the rest of it is for the police to bring the murderer or the planned murderer to justice. To categorize this as a mere thriller might not be apt for this. This has a lot of drama, it's cold blooded drama and a meticulously planned murder. It's not mystery either coz there are many things that are clear. We know who plans it, what is his motive and how he wants it. What happens perhaps is different but, the person who has planned needs to be brought to justice. The only driving point from then is how is he brought to justice. Ray Milland does a terrific job, less of emotion and so much of cold-bloodiness in him. Damn, that is very tough to pull off and he does it with considerable ease. The master throws up a masterful film in this. Also, there is a significance in the title "Dial M" though shown very briefly, it has it's place. Without much to say about this film any further, I am going with 4/5 for a film by my favorite director. Hitchcock rocks again in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully imaginative and pretty much flawless throughout, Dial M for murder is another 'must see' film from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When former tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) discovers that his wife Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) has been having an affair with American crime writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) he decides to arrange for her to be murdered. He blackmails former college associate Captain Lesgate - (which is merely one of his pseudonyms) into murdering his wife whilst Wendice is at a party with Halliday in order to give him an alibi. However, things don't go to plan meaning Wendice has to come up an ingenious back up plan in order to achieve his original objective.Before I go any further with my review, I feel that I must acknowledge Frederick Knott. Knott is the man responsible for the original play on which this film is based and I must say that it is wonderfully imaginative and an extremely clever idea. Of course, that's not to discredit Hitchcock who I must say has adapted Knott's play wonderfully to film. Hitchcock is helped by a terrific cast with Ray Milland as the vengeful husband Tony Wendice arguably giving the strongest performance. Milland is also well supported by the likes of Dawson, Cummings, and Kelly to name a few.Part of the fun with a lot of Hitchcock films are in their puzzle solving nature and Dial M for Murder is no exception. Right from the initial exchange between Wendice and Lesgate through to the rather clever ending - this film was crammed with suspense, it was exciting and as previous mentioned was both well constructed and clever. The cinematography was also excellent and the numerous scores used throughout the film were also highly effective. As a side note, it's also fun in Hitchcock's film to look for Hitchcock's cameo role - observant viewers will spot him in this film.Dial M for murder is an excellent film and all I kept thinking all the way through was how 'clever' everything was. The amount of time and thought that Wendice put into setting up Lesgate to carry out the crime. The twists and turns in the plot will have you on the edge of your seat and finally the 'clever' twist at the end will probably fool a lot of people. This is another brilliant piece of cinema that is clever, filled with suspense and is engaging throughout. Make sure you add it to your Watchlist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skating on Pretty Thin Ice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The best way to do it is with scissors." (Alfred Hitchock's 'humorous note...)Charles Ramirez Berg notably points out that "Alfred Hitchcock deftly blended sex, suspense and humor." Although there are plenty of other, more outstanding productions that prove the skill unquestionable, DIAL M FOR MURDER is no exception from the rule. This film, however, will leave you speechless because of three aspects: confined feeling, improbable MacGuffin and excellent trio of leading stars. Consequently, the movie appears to be skating on pretty thin ice likewise the leading character who too earnestly plans but too easily slips up...The setting of this movie is no great spectacular location, like it would be the case of NORTH BY NORTHWEST or VERTIGO; it does not reach a loud crescendo like in A MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, it is no psychological drama in the mode of PSYCHO or SPELLBOUND nor does it reveal any Hitch's haunting effects like THE BIRDS or REBECCA. DIAL M FOR MURDER, the first movie made in 3D technology (paradoxically, released in the format after Hitchcock's death) with the screenplay by Frederick Knott, can boast of something on its own: striking use of colors, innovative experiments with visuals as well as almost claustrophobic settings that results in a rather confined feeling. The camera-work beautifully corresponds to the perceptions of viewers who are, in a way, involved in the world of the characters. Sometimes, the camera positions itself in such a way that even our perceptions resist the supreme spell of suspense. Consider the image from the top when the murder is being planned. We see the flat suddenly, in a different way, more from the watcher's point of view. For every little step is measured, every movement planned. Yes, we cannot escape being there, feeling the mood of the growing action and awe inspiring magnetism of single details.The movie's MacGuffin (famous Hitchcock's concept) revolves around the key that requires particular attention absorbing a viewer entirely. Here, as nowhere else, the director's precision and considerable commitment is remarkable. Mainstay thematic concerns, like suspense, wit, obsessive desires, neatly-planned murder are present here along with the director's cameo presence that does not make us wait forever. While tension grows, mistrust appears to place seeds of doubt about the motives. Objects like notes, a latchkey, gloves, watch and telephone create this tension remarkably. Unlike some other films, we know what happens, we seem to know the motives, nothing truly might appear as 'unpredictable' and yet, the viewer's attention is kept throughout in truly impressive tension. You cannot simply allow yourself for skipping even the slightest detail though you know who the villain is and you know that the villain is doomed to be punished (for unlike in real life, movies of the time had to punish the baddies). But this is achieved primarily thanks to wonderful performances.Although there are many supporting cast who do wonderful jobs and also contribute considerably to the magic of the entire movie, the trio of Grace Kelly, Robert Cunnings and Ray Milland is unforgettable. One of the three films that resulted from Grace Kelly/Hitchcock's great rapport sheds light on some new aspects of this beautiful, talented, highly sophisticated woman that embodied Hitchcock's ideal of beauty. She is captivating as Margot, a woman torn apart between two men, whose feelings are constantly changing, a woman whose relationship with her husband appears to be on pretty thin ice, whose illusion turns into disillusion and trust into mistrust. The entire emotional scheme of the movie is placed in her and delivered perfectly. Ray Milland is another milestone performance of a man who is exact, precise, stylish, decisive, extremely controlled and yet, not thoroughly. Something must break him at last...Robert Cunnings is a typical Hitchcock's positive character who is though very lucky to merely witness all that is going on.Among the supporting cast, particular attention should be paid to Anthony Dawson as Captain Lesgate, a reflective, rather sympathetic character subverted to a murderous scheme and punished most. John Wyman also does a fine job as police officer Hubbard. DIAL M FOR MURDER, though not one among Hitchcock's top movies, is a highly entertaining, extremely involving movie that I would recommend to everyone who is bored with fake development of schemes and silly climaxes that we encounter so often nowadays. Yes, authentic make-believe is something that makes this film so convincing, like Tony who makes everything look authentic since this border between reality and disguise might be placed on pretty thin ice. And...you will never forget these scissors... 9/10</fullReview>

The actors have done a splendid job. It is really amazing how hitchcock makes such wonderful movies with very few characters and mostly confined within an apartment.

		<fullReview>To say that I enjoyed this movie over and over again would be an understatement. Ray Milland is superb as the sinister husband, who is tired of his wife's affair with Robert Cummings. It would threaten his existence and his lavish lifestyle if she should leave him. The idea of being just a tennis bum with no money does not appeal to him. Therefore he decides to hire an old college chum to murder her. Really we hope he does, because Kelly is after all an unfaithful wife. Hasn't he done all she wanted? He has given up his career as a tennis pro to settle down to a boring life selling sports equipment. And even after he does all she wants she has an affair. Bad girl. Grace Kelly isperfect as the wife who tired of Tony's lackluster commitment to making a living. After all he is a tennis champ. I read that the movie was shown in 3-D but I don't know how that would make it better. I really like the use of the camera shooting down on the characters in the living room. Really interesting is how Tony, when he hears Kelly struggling with the killer actually looks pained. What a guy! The best scene of course is the last when Tony realizes that he is caught, and charmingly sinister just pours a drink and offers one to everyone else including Margo. How good is Milland? Perfect, considering he was head over heels in love with Grace Kelly during the filming. His character displays no hint of this torrid affair. Cummings is perfect also as the lover who is a detective novel writer who after a time figures out that Milland planned the whole thing. The only criticism of this movie is the constant music thru out. Milland is so, so handsome that you can see why Kelly fell for him.</fullReview>

She is remorseful, but he now wants to inherit her wealth, and so he blackmails a Captain Lesgate (played by Anthony Dawson) to murder her. This plan backfires though, forcing him to improvise a plan B, which may be even better, though the chief inspector on the case(played by John Williams) is suspicious... Stylish mystery with good direction and acting, and effectively plays off its stagy setting.

Unfortunately for Tony, things don't go quite according to plan, with Lesgate coming a cropper on the end of Margot's sewing scissors, and he finds himself having to quickly improvise while Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) attempts to uncover the truth.Is there any such a thing as the perfect crime? Dial M for Murder suggests not, showing how a meticulously planned, seemingly flawless murder plot can quickly unravel due to the unpredictable nature of life. Likewise, there may be no such a thing as the perfect murder-mystery movie, but Dial M for Murder sure comes close?If it ain't broke, don't fix it: that's the motto director Alfred Hitchcock seems to have taken to heart with this movie, wisely remaining very faithful to Frederick Knott's highly successful stage production, even so far as to confining the majority of the action to the play's single apartment setting. When this tried and tested plot is combined with Hitch's masterful direction and a superb cast, the result is a thoroughly riveting murder mystery that grips like a vice until the very end.The complex story takes real concentration, and I suspect that, if studied very carefully, it might be possible to pick holes here and there, but Hitch's superb handling of proceedings, and the terrific central performances, mean that one is never tempted to try. After all, why spoil the experience when you can simply sit back and be swept away in Hitch's wonderful world of intrigue and suspense? 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</fullReview>

But when things go wrong, he's left with no choice but to improvise.Expertly directed from start to finish, Dial M for Murder remains one of Hitchcock's most enjoyable &amp; entertaining flicks that features a very tightly structured plot &amp; is fine tuned by its cut-throat editing to engage the audience in solving an investigation for which the director provides ample clues to its viewers, but not more than what's available to the characters in the film.With a plot full of twist, turns &amp; confessions, superb performances from Ray Milland, Grace Kelly &amp; Robert Cummings, and exhibiting admirable craftsmanship in every filmmaking department, including cinematography &amp; music, Dial M for Murder is another home run from the master storyteller who made a career out of crafting only intensely entertaining quality motion pictures.

		<shortDescription>Pretty darn good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Wendice would quite like his wife's money without the hassle of having her to go with it: how fortunate then that he makes contact with a would-be murderer who he can blackmail/bribe.Despite my advancing years, I had managed not to see Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder until the 3D Bluray arrived with my postman. So this comes from the point of view of someone whose first viewing of this film is of the remastered version in 3D (and filmed in 3D rather than a post-production conversion).From the distance of 2013, this film doesn't have much in the way of surprises - the story, while a good one, is nonetheless fairly familiar. And its stage origin shows - despite a handful of scenes in other locations, this remains essentially a single set drama with a small cast.So, given that we have something which is not necessarily the most exciting property in the world, what has Hitchcock done with it? He has drawn excellent performances from his cast, to start with, and he has made the very most of his single set. The camera prowls around it, constantly seeking new viewpoints to reinforce the dramatic impact of what is happening, lighting changes create a number of different moods - impersonal, comforting, dark and menacing - and the mobility of the camera is all the more remarkable given the bulkiness of the 3D rig.For the visual impact of the film, especially in 3D, is amazing. The remastering is excellent, with pin-sharp image and saturated colours. And the 3D is stunning. Hitchcock joins a scant few directors as an artist who understands how to use 3D as an artistic tool to enhance what appears on screen. Nothing is going to jump out of the screen at you, but the true 3D image has staggering depth, particularly when the camera is on the move, and this adds enormously to the visual appreciation of the film.This film should be compulsory viewing in 3D for any director who is currently in the position of having to make a 3D film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>{Sir}Hitchcock is not a new face to crime, thriller and mystery genre, but dial m for murder is a piece of utter brilliance and mastery.Well, if you love watching movies while lying on bed with laptop at the front prepare to rise and get immersed in this cinema. Movie never takes time to develop characters, it just shoves the plot right into the viewers' face right at the beginning and yet we are so into the premise of the cinema like we are living it and characters build themselves. Actors have done their jobs exceptionally well from Grace Kelly to Robert Cummings, from Roy Milland to John Williams everyone is perfect and simply awesome.With the subtlety Milland plays Wendice is truly unbelievable. You will definitely succumb to his devilish yet charming personality.In short I am now a great fan of Roy Milland..!! Dialogues and the screenplay are very well executed. there are no clichés or not a single detail is cheesy like today's mystery movies with exception of a few. This simply is one of best movies ever made. Sir, I salute you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it was a good first half but everything after the murder it was really boring and felt rushed. When Wendice is explain to Swan how the whole thing will be played out, I was completely drawn in, I thought this was brilliant screen work, it was planned out great too. I kept thinking Hitchcock is a genius for thinking up something as crazy as this! During the execution of the attack, you're not really sure what to expect is going to happen so you're just drawn right in. Your feeling of suspense is at a maximum, and then the fun just stops. The rest of the movie is Wendice clumsily covering up his tracks and his wife being maliciously interrogated by one cop. Then, all of a sudden that cop solves Wendice's whole plan (as if by a miracle or something) and exposes it almost too easily. It's just like they said during the movie, there is no such thing as a perfect crime, only on paper, so the thrill of the movie was a bit disappointing. Other than that the camera-work is really unique if you pay close attention there are some really great shots, such as one when Wendice explains the murder to Swan in the room, the camera is stilted from the ceiling, like a crane shot. The color of the movie is very pretty too, I just feel like there was much more to the movie that Hitchcock could have done to keep his audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is a thriller film adapted from a successful stage play.It was written by Frederick Knott,the writer of the original play, and directed by Alfred Hitchcock.It stars Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, and Robert Cummings.The single setting in the stage play is the living-room of the Wendices' flat in London at 61A Charrington Gardens, Maida Vale.The story has British tennis pro Tom Wendice suspects that his wealthy wife,Margot is fooling around with handsome American Mark Halliday. Tom blackmails a disgraced former army comrade,C.A. Swann into murdering his wife and making it look like the work of a burglar.But Tom's carefully mapped-out scheme does not take into account the notion that Margot might fight back and kill her assailant. When the police investigate,Tom improvises quickly, subtly planting the suggestion that his wife has committed first-degree murder. He almost gets away with it until a "key" evidence was revealed.The movie was more apt for the stage.In it,the characters exchange ideas and talk about the murder as a conversation piece which talks up much more suspense than it actually delivers.In other words,the film wasn't graphic except when Swan tried to commit the crime.But nevertheless,it still manages to put some suspense and tension as the characters talk to carry on with the story.Overall,the movie is outdated but still great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very intriguing movie! I love this film for a few key reasons, the most prominent being that it is almost hard to decipher at times as to who is the "Good guy" and who fills the role of antagonist, and I believe the argument could be made that all 3 main characters (Mr. + Mrs. Wendice, and Mark Halliday) all fill BOTH roles throughout the movie interchangeably. At first we see a couple with a strained marriage (as many are in one form or another) and Mrs. Wendice cheats on her husband while he is away working. SHE is the villain because she did not live up to "For better or for worse" in her wedding vow, she went behind her husband's back and betrayed him. We sympathize with Mr. Wendice because he did nothing to deserve this (to our knowledge) and I believe most can not blame him for hatching a plan to have her killed in order to inherit her fortune- she deserves it. However, as the film progresses we see Mr. Wendice become thorough in hiding the evidence, almost maniacal, as he attempts to cover up his mistake and send his wife to her death. Simultaneously we see Margot Wendice slowly torn emotionally by circumstances she can no longer control- we begin to empathize with her because she was set up and nearly killed.Finally, with Mark Halliday, we see a similar situation to that of Margot Wendice. Mark has accompanied Margot in betraying her husband as he is the one whom Margot commits the act with, unbeknownst to Tony Wendice. He then visits Mr. Wendice's home, almost slapping him in the face figuratively. Mark Halliday is evil on the same level that Mrs. Wendice is seen at. He too, however, redeems himself as the movie progresses by trying desperately to save Margot's life by proving her innocence. He is a force for good and turns the tables on Tony Wendice, who in turn becomes the villain halfway through the film.Although each character is unique and each changes throughout the course of the film, I still found myself rooting for Tony Wendice to get away with his ploy. He was a decent man who was simply put in this situation because of his unfaithful wife- he would not have tried to kill her had she stayed faithful to him. Either way you spin it, the good guys prevail and evil is vanquished throughout the film- which characters are "good" and which are "evil" is entirely up to you. Great movie, very suspenseful, entertaining, and funny! Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder was an unbelievably great movie. Thinking back on the movie I realized that every scene took place in the tight, small, claustrophobic apartment of Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), but that was okay because the dialogue and plot were so great, I didn't even notice until the end. From the first meeting with Swann, we are immediately caught up in trying to figure everything out in our mind. How the murder is planned between the two of them, to how Wendice changes the story several times to make it believable for the detective and his wife, to figuring out all the different keys (literally and figuratively) to the real story behind the murder.The cast of characters was amazing with Milland making us believe Tony Wendice and his attempts to escape the law, Grace Kelly playing the blonde (Need I say more) Margot Wendice, and finally John Williams playing a wonderful detective, with his wit and little drops of humor.The storyline was perfect and made for a captivating and interesting movie as the audience tries to figure out the truth behind the murder, hoping that Tony Wendice doesn't get the ending he hopes for.</fullReview>

Alfred Hitchcock's storytelling excellence is showcased in a profound manner.'Dial M...' is not the classic whodunit. You already know who the killer is, how he plans to carry out the murder and also, without a doubt, you know that he will be caught in the end.But how he is caught forms the crux of this story.'Dial M for Murder' is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece and more so because of the director, Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the Grace-ful era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M is fascinating from start to finish. It is really my cup of tea, and from the sweeping majority of favorable response here alone, it has much appeal for others as well. As one said, the lead in the remake appears gawky compared to Grace Kelly. That's a good way to compare today's films in general. There's been a comprehensive detailing of the production aspects of the film. I appreciated the "McGuffin" as Mr. Hitchcock calls it. Just wanted to add an observation about another aspect.Society people of that, and much earlier times as well, had no problem with the husband or wife going out with a friend, dancing with them a lot at parties, etc. It was fashionable to be rather cool with/about one's spouse and uncool to demonstrate a lot of public affection toward. Yet, everyone was shocked when affairs took place. The insincere formalities would extend to the two men going out together just on a friend of one basis. Social encounters covered a lot of ground. It helps understand that this is a society couple. They observe the formalities of the morning kiss, using endearments and all that. One may or may not be dear to one another. You generally can't tell on the surface, since it is the common practice. However, in this case, the wife is having an affair and the man has found out and is busily planning to ensure the continuance of his meal ticket, albeit in another form. Both continue the shell. That's a bit thick for any era. It is true that the straying couple are each sympathetic figures in this. That certainly speaks of the skill of the expert director. However, it seems that it goes a bit far with Margo's wounded response to her husband's attempting to rearrange the setup his way. Let's step back here a moment, madam: You are cheating on your husband, are you not? And, you are even considering leaving him, is that correct? So, what is all this, "Oh Tony, how could you" stuff. No question, murder is shocking and inexcusable on any account. But adultery is a serious betrayal. Margo, how could YOU! Her hypocrisy is there all along, but noticeable particularly after the attack when she runs to him for comfort, with full expectation and entitlement to it. He's her husband after all. But, she's an adulteress after all. Is she an elitist amoral? No, it's more that she's a spoiled society girl, brought up to expect accommodation to come toward her without accountability going out from her. And, she's a product of her social system. You played the game no matter what. In any event, this film is a very special one and must-have for the DVD library of Hitchcock fans particularly.</fullReview>

(Kids, ask your grandparents what a rotary telephone was.)Alfred Hitchcock's only foray into 3D. He dismissed the technology as a gimmick?are you listening, James Cameron??but achieved impressive results: never have mechanical telephone switches looked so menacing. What Hitchcock can't overcome is the stagey origins of the material: after a pitch perfect first act, the second is a little talky. The addition of police inspector John Williams doesn't quite make up for the loss of dodgy rogue Anthony Dawson. SPOILER ALERT: Ladies, always keep a pair of scissors handy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a successful ex-tennis player, very rich and married with the beautiful and charming Margot (Grace Kelly). But she has an affair with Mark (Robert Cummings) a writer in visit to London where the Wendice couple lives. What Margot and Mark doesn't know is that Tony knows about their affair. They also can't imagine what Tony's planning to do with her: He blackmails an old college associate (Anthony Dawson) convincing him to kill his wife in what is called a perfect murder. The associate believes and we believe in Tony's words, because his imminent presence and his plans seem to be flawless. The day of the murder is on the next day of the proposition made by Tony but something goes wrong and now Tony has to make all sorts of plans to get rid off the wife and her lover, and of course, a way to keep his hands on a large amount of money. But on his way is a veteran obstinate police inspector (John Williams). And what's next?This is one of those films where you always gonna ask what's next and it doesn't bore you in any minute. A very clever plot, with excellent tension moments, with a cat-and-mouse game between all the characters, a brilliant conclusion and very good performances by the cast. Ray Milland is fantastic playing the bad guy we all love to hate. He really knocked his performance out of the park. Complex, quite funny, a very dangerous mind, he makes of Tony Wendice a lonely genius of crime very cold hearted but at the same time you might always believe every word he says because his presence dominates every moment, even when his out of the screen you think of him imagining what happens next, if his plans are going to succeed or not. Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings are very well too, but Milland and John Williams really were the most impressive performers in the movie. Williams in the inspector role created that logical characteristic presented in many detectives movies almost like an old version of Hercule Poirot in Agatha Christie's books. He's always one step ahead of everything and everyone, the guy who gets all the answers leaving the audience in that state of "Tell us what you got, we want to understand how you got to this conclusion". This magnificent movie is directed by the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho, Strangers on a Train) based on a famous play. For those who watched "Rope" it might seem very similar because both are based on plays and on screen it's almost one set (the apartment) and both main characters of both movies want to know if the perfect crime exists. But they also have in common the greatness of great acting, a very complex story and thrilling moments that makes you to be glued on the seat. "Dial M for Murder" is a wonderful masterpiece. Remade in 1998 under the title "A Perfect Murder". 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story about a key related to a murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the Hitchcock films, North by Northwest and Dial M for Murder is similar by more resembling a puzzle. Lots of moments pass examining the details of the murder in this film. Most of us are used to see Hitchcock in a scene of his films but there is an unusual scene in which Hitchcock appears in a photograph that contains graduation ball of the students.According to the story, Tony is married to a famous writer who is Margot but he thinks she cheats him with another writer Mark who come for her from America regularly so Mark is right about his doubts. Because of all these matters he makes a plan upon murdering Margot by a man. This man is previously convicted and followed by Tony.Tony explains the plan to the man who should come into the house about at 11:00 PM and he is wanted to wait Mark's telephone from party to Margot. "Dial M" is the sign of this murder trial in which M letter appears in the phone while Tony calls her. As an important part of plan, Mark say the place of the key which is placed under the carpet of the stairs against flat door. But the plan doesn't work and Margot kills his future murderer with a scissors stroke. The key that isn't found in the pocket of the man make the inspectors get confused because how he open the door is a big mystery due to absence of any stroke of windows or door. At that point two possibilities appear. Tony hires an assassin or Margot lays a trap for the man whom she believes the blackmails is made by him. One of the letters that Mark wrote to her was previously captured by Tony but nor Margot neither Mark knows this one was captured by Tony. Tony uses this from one year before to the appearance of the reality.Hitchcock manages the film very well as usual but there are some important messages that it gave. For example; the conversation between Mark and Tony upon murders that Mark says them as "No murder is perfect practically" and the another is Mark's proposal to Tony is saving her execution saying a scenario that is based upon hiring assassin of Tony and another is contradictions of Marks such that no one could believe anything Mark because of his fame about writings upon crimes.How could a small key change the flow of whole film? I think this question can be answered only in a Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

It's so minimal that I wouldn't be surprised to find out it has been performed on stage?after all, almost the entire movie takes place in one room. The acting and direction are top notch and the script is amazing! With each passing minute comes another twist and another turn of the screw. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It's kind of different from other Hitchcock movies I've seen in that it's so simple and streamlined, but I'm sure any fan of his would love it (and has probably already seen it, I'm sure). But beyond that, I think the movie would appeal to basically anyone who loves a good thriller or tense drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine Hitchcock film, as fine as they get. It is the only time he filmed in 3D but the brilliant sequencing he did shows he was made for that medium too. Alfred understands better than almost any film maker what he should do with the camera.Grace Kelly is her sexiest in this film, even more alluring than she is in Rear Window later. Ray Milland is great in this. Bob Cummings is very good too. The cast is all perfect.You realize when you watch it that is is adapted from the stage, but the film is so good that you don't even care. Many say Milland is actually better in this film than he is in his Oscar Winner, The Lost Week-End. That says something though Milland was excellent in most of his films. Too bad he did not do many films with Alfred as he works with him so well here.</fullReview>

I've stated before that I've made it a goal to see every Hitchcock film ever this year. Tonight was Dial M for Murder. A fun little thriller with a lot of intelligence and well thought out scenes. Though, I don't think anyone would expect less of Mr. Hitchcock.The story is about a man who finds the perfect murder for his wife but finds out that it isn't so perfect at all. It makes for a lot of great plot twists and edge of your seat scenes. Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings make this a star filled movie with absolutely wonderful acting. The editing is also brilliant as usual and I would say that this in one of Hitch's best. However, I say that about most of his movies so what do I know? Dial M for Murder is definitely not a movie that should go unseen. Most film fans will find it to be a great piece of cinema and it won't let them down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film showcases great acting (esp. John Williams) and inspired direction while also delivering entertainment one viewing after another.The characters are well-developed (despite the camera almost never leaving the living room of a single apartment) and the dialogue is sharp - delivered with near-perfect timing. There are no wholes in the motivation for each character - leading to audience sympathy (at times) for even devious Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) and the unfortunate Charles Swan/Captain Lesgate (Anthony Dawson).The blocking is tremendous as well, even if you look past the cutting-edge 3D treatment the film introduced in its theatrical run. One beautiful shot after another, along with the terrifyingly effective 'murder' scene.Grace Kelly showed tremendous acting ability given the almost ballet-like restrictions this stage play-like production placed on her. No grandiose establishment shots, no swanky sets, no beautiful ballroom scene capturing her profile .... It is all about her acting ability as she plays Margot Wendice, generating sympathy for the bored but reformed housewife despite the fact she is not without some culpability for the pain existing in her domestic situation.</fullReview>

Everyone probably thinks of Rear Window when you think of these two working together, but in Dial M For Murder you've got it all, a bit of romance, suspense and characters you can love and hate at the same time. Ray Millard does a brilliant job as a calm and calculated schemer who you cant help but like a little just for being so smug and sure of his plan. Grace Kelly puts in her usual high standard of performance and the rest of the cast are flawless too. I really think this film deserves to be in the top 250, there are a lot of films in there i enjoyed a lot less than this.

		<fullReview>I love Alfred Hitchcock; watching a Hitchcock film is like reading some of the first few chapters on how to do a movie. You can see how the coolest film effects of today owe tribute to the master of suspense in their setup and composition . . . but I didn't really like Dial M for Murder.Granted it does have its share of Hitchcock trademarks we've all come to look for and appreciate, and it has Hitchcock's instinct for making shots interesting . . . I didn't like how this movie is 75% dialogue describing the 25% of action that is in the film. The premise is clever and intriguing and the laid back pacing is always welcoming, but the movie explains itself to death. I hate doing plot synopsis in a review but I'm compelled to here: basically, in the beginning of the film we hear a full blown explanation of Wendice's plan to kill his wife. Then we see the plan in action and something goes wrong (of course). Then later on another character comes up with a `wild' idea of what happened (which is surprisingly accurate), then that idea gets told to the cop to humor him . . . yeah, you get the idea. It is amusing in its own way watching character's reactions to each retelling, especially those who do know what was planned and what really happened and that in turn gives each recitation its own distinct flavor and atmosphere so it's never entirely monotonous . . . but you're still ultimately hearing the same basic thing over and over again. It's still surprisingly fun, but without the likes of Hitchcock behind it I don't think I'd of had enough interest to finish. Definitely not one of my favorite Hitchcock films. Oh well, maybe it'll grow on me like Kane did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Dial M For Murder in the theater when it was re-released in 3D in 1980. It is the best 3D movie ever. Unlike other gimmicky 3D movies such as House of Wax that were released in the 50's by lesser directors, Hitchcock didn't try to throw things at the viewer in every single scene. Since it was a stage play, he just concentrated on the depth of the stage in a lot of long shots to lull you into forgetting about the 3D. He even used rear projection in some scenes that flattened out the movie. He saved the 3D for the one great scene when the killer is strangling Grace Kelly. With the great 3D effect, she seems to reach out into the audience for the pair of scissors to defend herself and you find yourself wanting to hand her the scissors.</fullReview>

Even though the acting is slightly wooden (except the marvelous performance by John Williams as Inspector Hubbard) and the direction bland and dated by today's standards, this film is still thoroughly entertaining and compelling. The only "Hitchcock touch" was the extreme close-up of the finger dialing "M", which though a nice touch, is unintentionally funny since the finger is obviously a prop (it was impossible to film such a close-up in 1954 so a large phone and finger were created for the shot).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not on the lines of a Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, North by Northwest, etc., Dial M for Murder was a fine Hitchcock film. It featured great performances from Ray Milland, John Williams, Bob Cummings, Anthony Dawson, and of course drop-dead gorgeous Grace Kelly. As most people know this was the first of three films that she would do for Hitch. Also, most people know that he sort of developed an unhealthy obsession for her and was devastated when she retired from acting to become Princess Grace of Monaco. This movie keeps you in suspense throughout the picture. Hitch's cameo is a funny one--he appears in a picture. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and rent it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite Hitchcock films. The plot is spellbinding. The cast, superb. And the set just great. Ray Milland and Grace Kelly star in this shocking masterpiece. Milland as the jealous husband determined to kill his wife because of her infidelity and to get her money; Bob Cummings as the lover is quite convincing. Notice how Kelly's dresses get darker colors throughout the movie. Milland's plan of murdering his wife was too perfect to become true. The remake in 1998, A PERFECT MURDER, cannot be compared to this one. And I think that Gwyneth Paltrow will never be Grace Kelly of the 90's. John Williams (the actor not the music composer) as the detective who tries to resolve the case presented a great performance.This was the first Hitchcock film that I watched. A must-see for Hitchcock's fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grace Kelly assumes the role of the lovely Margot Wendice in this tale of greed, jealousy and murder directed by Alfred Hitchcock who also directed Miss Kelly in 'Rear Window' and 'To Catch a Thief.' Margot is married to her husband Tony (Ray Milland)but having an affair with the "charming (being a loose term)" Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). A jealous Tony then plots to have his unfaithful wife murdered for her considerable wealth. However the scheme goes awry when Margot defends herself and kills her assailant with a pair of scissors. Tony then takes the chance to frame his wife for the crime and have her hanged for the murder. This film is a chilling for a moment when Miss Kelly is about to be strangled by the assailant, but it is not the greatest. You know from the minute what it about to happen and who is behind the whole affair. And you probably will ask yourself why Grace would prefer Robert Cummings instead of Ray Milland. But this film is still worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two kinds of murder stories. In those written by Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, the mystery is the identity of the murderer. Hitchcock specialized in the other type where the identity of the killer (or, in this case, the man who tried to arrange the murder) is known from the beginning and the mystery is how he or she will be discovered. Dial M for Murder with Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings is a classic example of Hitchcock's approach, though, of course, the viewer knows for a certainty that Tony Wendice (Milland) will be found out even after his rich, philandering wife, Margot Mary Wendice (Kelly) escapes the hired killer by plunging a pair of scissors into his back. The viewer is likely also to surmise that the third major character, Mark Halladay (Cummings), an American mystery writer and Margot's lover, will play a significant role in establishing her husband's guilt.Despite the obvious sign posts, Hitchcock manages to sustain the suspense thanks not only to his own skills but also to Frederick Knott, who wrote the screenplay and the play on which the movie is based. Without giving away the secret, the crucial question posed by the death of the hired killer is how did he get into the Wendice apartment? Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) answers this question initially by determining that Margot must have let him in and then murdered him because he was blackmailing her. She is convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged. But the chief inspector is not entirely satisfied and, seeking a different answer to the question, ultimately discovers that Tony planned the murder.Milland and Cummings handle their roles in their customarily efficient style. Dial M is perhaps more notable as a reminder, if any is needed, of how beautiful and how classy Hollywood's own Princess Diana, Grace Kelly, was in her twenties when she became a star. She was, of course, one of Hitchcock's muses and it's easy to see why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first Hitchcock film I has seen, and absolutely loved it. The call, seeing the internal connection. I thought it had a great storyline, especially Ray Millands character. Fast, smart, convincing, menacing, methodical, careful. Really love that role. I just can't get over his fast thinking.Directing style with movement if the camera and crane shots really capture the peoples perspective. Along with perspective shots of Milland's quick hands.Ray Milland is smooth and suave--a far cry from his character in The Lost Weekend. Grace Kelly is all elegance and, well, grace. It's play-to-screen and 90% of the movie takes place in one room. It's a murder gone awry and in the 50s British tradition we follow the clues through the efforts of Robert Cummings, Grace's ex-lover and a crime writer and John Williams, the Scotland Yard detective assigned to the case. British crime thrillers are so unlike their French or American counterparts and the lack of emotional affect enhances rather than detracts. Dial M was remade into The Perfect Murder just a few years ago but the remake is not much like the original and not that good. A Perfect Murder is a perfect example of what Hollywood and two big stars can do to muck up something understated and clever and really suspenseful</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A husband found his wife is having an affair with another man and he planned to murder his wife to inherit all her wealth.He made a perfect plan and had all the arrangements done,but just like in real world every thing doesn't go as you planned.The things get upside down when his wife not only escaped from being killed but she also killed the man who came to kill her,now the husband have to hide his involvement in crime.Dial M for Murder is a small and simple crime thriller and one of the best movie from master of thrillers Alfred Hitchcock.It is really amazing to see how a movie that has been almost shot in a single room without any thrilling scene(except one) create such a tension and mystery.This is one of rarest thriller movie that doesn't depend upon it's style and thrilling scenes to shock you and manage to keep you on the edge of your seat,in fact the whole movie consists of long sequences of dialogues and conversations,just like a play but still doesn't bore you.This movie is less psychological and dramatic than other Hitchcock's work and this simplicity of the movie give it real strength.The story of the movie is very clever and witty and it also doesn't seemed to be unrealistic at all and the feeling of realizing that how much the events that occurred in the movie also possible in real world,thrills you most.Direction of Alfred Hithcok was perfect.Every single scene was wonderfully shot with brilliant camera work.He maintained the suspense and tension constantly throughout the movie with his brilliant story telling,there is only one short scene of violence in the movie and the movie maintain the thrill all the time only with it's story-telling and dialogues.The soundtrack of the movie also played a very important part to create the atmosphere in the movie.The script was also very well written,sometimes it seemed to be dragging the scenes very long but it's weakness overcome by perfect direction.The first part of the movie shows how he plot the killing and how the killing went wrong and the second part of the movie shows the investigation of police and how he manage to hide his role in the killing.The most appealing of all the performances was of Ray Milland as the devious husband who planned the murder of his beautiful wife for 90000 pounds, his character was so clever and witty,always remained cool and casual in critical situation.No matter how serious the situation is he come with a brilliant idea to save himself.Grace Kelly was looking so beautiful(especially in the nightdress) and also did the brilliant performance,she is the most beautiful Hitchcock lady ever.Dial M for murder is my third favorite Hitchcock movie after Rear Window and Psycho,I am not a very big fan of Alfred Hitchcock.I usually like those Hitchcock movies that depend lesser on style but more on plot and story-telling,and Dial M for murder is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Wendice learns that his wife, Margo had an affair but even though it's over, he decided to kill her but chose to bide his time. He waited until Mark Halliday, his wife's boyfriend, returned to town. He then placed his plan in order. He summoned a man, whose reputation is a bit shady, and reveals that he knows his secrets but also tells him about his wife and her boyfriend and that they are each the beneficiary of their estates. He gets the man to agree to kill his wife and he has laid out what appears to be perfect plan. Only thing is the man was the one who was killed. Wendice trying to cover everything up, decides then to make it appear that Margo had an ulterior motive for killing the man. And it appears to be working except Halliday doesn't believe she's guilty and the police uncover a few anomalies... Its funny to watch a film made more then 50 years ago, people look, talk and even kiss differently. The manners were different, the way people interact with each other was different; it's a completely different mentality and it's fun to watch how society behave in such a distant decade. However, no matter how many years have gone by, Dial M For Murder is still somewhat effective at creating a feeling of excitement and suspense, mainly due to the first half of the script which was extremely well written. The script does loose a bit of its strength towards the end of the film, because all there is left is to talk about solutions and escapism. The acting, which is also very distinct from today's, was tremendous. Ray Milland was a delight to watch, he played his character perfectly, nice and charming on the surface but truly, deceitful and malicious. Grace Kelly was radiant and every time she's in a scene, she lights up the screen. Having said that, by today's standards, I consider Dial M For Murder a nice little thriller but nothing more then that. After a while the film gets a bit claustrophobic ( the action takes place in one room only) and the third act tends to be a bit tedious. I just don't think, and I know most people would disagree with me but this is my personal opinion, that this film can compete with some contemporary thrillers. A good watch nevertheless.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blithe, articulate play about how to kill your beautiful wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M for MurderAlmost a parlor piece, something like Rope in that sense, and yet more taughtly written and directed, a play of wits, a game for the viewer to follow and anticipate. It is based on a play and, to its benefit, it feels like one. The dialog takes first row, and is crisp and intelligent. The original 3-D intended for the sets (and the sense of claustrophobia, apparently) is lost on most of us, of course, to the point that the color and lighting seem too high-key and pasty instead of rich and dramatic, but you can write it off as a period effect, just before Cinemascope and other wide screen efforts went mainstream.It's surprising how little pyrotechnics you need (and no blood) to make a suspense movie have real suspense. Not the kind where your hair stands up, but your brain snaps on to figure out what's going on, what's likely next, what would you do. By keeping the setting consistent for most of the movie (in Ray Milland's character, the antagonist's, apartment), Hitchcock also avoids any of the false back-projection he seems to be happy with in other, generally better films of his, like Vertigo or North by Northwest, which are both from roughly this period. In all a brilliant piece of writing and elegant, restrained film-making. The acting, too, is worth noting, Milland being utterly convincing, and the inspector, if a bit of a caricature, is also believable. Grace Kelly is always a bit too wooden for her sculptural prettiness for me (I've never understood her iconic appeal at all), but she plays a witless victim well, the kind of dull-headed blonde that Hitchcock favored, to the ill of all smart blondes and women in general. Woe to sensibility!And so we have a brilliant bit of British film-making, made in America (at the Warner studio lots). The original play, and TV teleplay, were both British, the emphasis on words over action is certainly an English cliché in the movie world (and not always a bad thing), and the setting is of course London, with the cliché Scotland Yard types at hand. All of this is quaintly appealing, and keeps an airy feel even as the main character plots the murder of his wife. What ensues is no joke, but it still comes across with Hitchcock's facile touch, knowing all along it's entertainment, not shock, that we are after. And get, first rate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is a wonderful director, directing classics such as Psycho, North by Northwest and Rebecca. While not his best, Dial M For Murder has so much to recommend it. First of all, is the breathtaking cinematography, which is nearly always the best thing in a Hitchcock film. The script is a gem, showing that you are capable of anything, and most of the time, it is very tense and rarely slips. That said, my only complaint, is that one or two scenes such as the ending do fall flat, compared to the rest of the film. However, the film also has a wonderful music score, and fantastic performances from the entire cast. Ray Milland, an actor I really want to get more familiar with, is excellent as Tony Wendice, the husband planning to murder his wife, and make it a perfect murder. As Margot, the beautiful Grace Kelly is the picture of beauty and vulnerability in a wonderful understated performance, perhaps outshining her co-star. Everyone else acquitted themselves well too, even Robert Cummings as Mark Halliday and John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Overall, an excellent film, not Hitchcock's best, but well looking out for. 9/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was and wasn't the right person to direct Dial M For Murder, just as it turns out to be a film that contains some of his best gifts and some liabilities that are more-so apparent here than in most of his movies. It was based on a play, written for the screen by the same author, and close to all of the story and action takes place in the living quarters of the Wendices, Tony (Ray Milland) and Margot Mary (Grace Kelly), and it revolves around a murder plot by Tony to bring in someone no one will suspect (old college friend) to do in his adulterous wife so that Tony can collect the life savings and insurance. Then, of course, everything slowly starts to go wrong, however not until way into the second half of the story, as it usually goes of course.Hitchcock manages to garner some wonderful performances from Kelly and Cummings as mystery writer Mark Halliday, the one Margot is sleeping with, and the inspector played by John Williams (and no, not the more famous John Williams of musical scores). With Milland it's a little trickier to tell; sometimes he's very good as an elegant bourgeois husband, and other times it's obvious as hell as to the look on his face as to what he's thinking or plotting or, frankly, just the plain guilt showing and hiding ever so slightly. I couldn't peg whether or not it was very good or not, but whatever the case they all serve a plot that is burdened (all in vain of Hitchcock's attempts like with the 'legal processing" of Margot with the stark composition and surreal lighting or certain close-ups and zoom-ins for detail or just the murder itself) by the "stagey" quality. That is to say, it becomes slightly predictable a bit of the way through and only gets intermittently tense.This isn't to say the writer Frederick Knott is necessarily bad at all. On the contrary, much of his dialog is extremely good depending on the scene or conversation, like those between Milland and Williams are best at a kind of double-gaming that adds to the dark humor as well as the suspense. But there are more than one moments when Hitchcock succumbs to not knowing what to do much more with the camera; there was a somewhat similar situation to the film Lifeboat, and however much Hitchcock tried to circumvent the limitations it was still a play being filmed. Certainly a must for fans of the Master, yet I wouldn't know if it's one of his better or lesser works. It's a combination of both, really, hence the rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essentials</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here is a suspense film that is almost purely that. There is only one murder scene, obligatory to the genre, and the rest is all dialog from the actors and Hitchcock's ever interesting camera-work. The result is a terrifically tense film that simply doesn't let up. Hook, line and sinker it gets you and keeps you to the very end.This film is especially interesting today when compared with other thrillers to see how vastly the genre changed. How much more about simple shock it has become, in large part. How much more about the superficial as most thrillers today have to have at least some sex or nudity, which often results with hilarious and bizarre results in the odd PG-13 category. Strangely enough this Hitchcock film feels like an inspiration for the Dogme movies as there is nothing but dialog to keep you interested. Of course, Hitchcock used sets and the apartment in which virtually the entire film takes place is surely a set (thus not true Dogme) but that feel of essence is there. It is a thriller that provides the bare essence of a thriller: a game of wits between characters. All the shootouts, car chases, explosions, hostages, etc... can provide great ingredients for tension, but any fan of the thriller genre should thoroughly enjoy this film since all those chases and explosions are merely icing on he cake. That game of wits is the real dough and substance of the genre. It is that one essential element that will ultimately make or break a thriller, because if it is poor then all those chases and explosions will seem pointless.In this film are but 5 principle characters and the camera work while engaging is pretty straightforward by today's standards. Yet the way these two elements - characters and camera - all interact are the main parts of this thriller and those precious essentials of any other thriller. --- 9/10BsCDb classification: G --- good for general audiences</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect murder?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dial M for Murder" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about a man that organizes a "perfect murder" for his wife with an accomplice. An important distinction between this and other Hitchcock films is that mystery and suspense come not from attempting to ascertain what is happening, but rather if any of the characters can discover the details of a crime the audience has witnessed.Ray Milland is Tony Wendice, the man organizing the crime. Milland is well-suited to his role as a man calculating and resourceful. Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and Anthony Dawson are solid in their roles as well. However, my favorite performance comes from John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Williams skillfully presents a subtle characterization that gradually makes a transition from easily dismissed to commanding.Though I generally prefer films with mysteries to be solved to those where the crime is known to the audience but not the characters, this film's story is tense and engaging. There are a number of interesting twists in the story that keep it interesting. "Dial M for Murder" is an excellent mystery and suspense film from Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An intriguing plot line (courtesy of the Frederick Knott play), a clever performance from Ray Milland, and fabulous direction, including stunningly simple but effective camera shots, from the 'master' Alfred Hitchcock, make "Dial M for Murder" very entertaining.Even though we know 'whodunit', Hitchcock still keeps the viewer fascinated with a plot that never quite reveals all. Grace Kelly is always a joy to watch and John Williams is just right as the inspector who will not be thrown.The music is at times a little over done, and somewhat annoying, but the movie really works well over all. Look out for Mr. Hitchcock's cameo in a college photo.Wednesday, July 3, 1991 - VideoThis classic mystery from the ingenious Frederick Knot play is an entertainment that never wears thin. It could be Ray Milland's cool portrayal of the scheming former tennis pro Tony Wendes, or Grace Kelly as the unfortunate Margot. Of course there is also John Williams, terrifically over confident as the police inspector who investigates the case, or Anthony Dawson who convinces as the cornered confidence trickster, Captain Lesgit.We must not forget the subtle, sublime touch of the master, who closes us into this fated two room apartment and involves us in the murderous goings on. After all is said and done however, I cannot help but return to the clever plot which fascinates from beginning to end.

		<fullReview>Brilliantly done! Director Hitchcock pulls a sting on the viewer with a simple latchkey, then uses it to trap the architect of a perfect plan. Except that it wasn't perfect, as mystery writer Mark Halliday himself opines - "Well because in stories things usually turn out the way the author wants them to and in real life they don't, always." It's great the way Hitch telegraphs his intention and then completely blindsides you with it when it eventually plays out.Ray Milland is perfect here as scheming husband Tony Wendice, planning to off his cheating wife (Grace Kelly) while using her lover Halliday (Robert Cummings) as an alibi. Milland's character has it all worked out like a master chess player, all the moves worked out backwards and forwards, with Swann (Anthony Dawson) his less than willing pawn. The way Tony spins his web to ensnare Swann in the deadly scheme is masterful, and repeat viewings confirm just how airtight his argument is to compel Swann's compliance.I know I didn't imagine it, so I rewound the film to check - weren't those some pesky curtains that Tony had to close twice while discussing with Margot whether she should go out or not?Now even though I thought the story was cleverly done, a couple things did nag me a bit. The whole business with only two keys to the apartment seemed a bit forced, why wouldn't Tony have simply made a duplicate key for Swann to use instead of going through all those contortions to get his wife's? Sure it created some additional tension, but it seemed misplaced, and Margot (Kelly) was never put in a position to call Tony on it. The other issue I had was during Inspector Hubbard's (John Williams) questioning, Margot never reacted to the fact that Tony knew the dead man that tried to kill her. You would think that she might have shown some kind of emotion over that revelation.Still, what works in the picture outweighs what doesn't, and for Hitchcock, it's a much more successful examination of the killer for hire motif than "Strangers On A Train" which generally ranks higher among the director's fans. And to top it off, it even has a more creative cameo appearance by Hitch, courtesy of that class reunion picture!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Wendice Ray Milland is a former professional tennis player who has decided to kill his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) to obtain her money. He has planned the murder carefully for a long time having discovered Margo has an affair with writer Mark Holliday (Robert Cummings); he doesn't care at all about his wife's infidelity but he sees the opportunity to use it in his meticulous plan. But something goes wrong and Margo survives the attack of the hired murderer (Anthony Dawson) and he's the one that gets killed.There's precisely when Hitchcock demonstrates his undeniable skill for thrillers and the film gains interest and intrigue as Tony starts to rearrange things on the move in order to create evidence that will put Margo facing the dead penalty for murder. After all, Tony doesn't really matter how his wife disappears as long as he gets her fortune.Ray Milland renders a classy and most precise performance as the ambitious and deadly husband (in fact the guy is almost sympathetic and you come to sort of admire him). Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings are good in their less compromising roles, and Anthony Dawson was always better in mean and menacing roles as the one he plays here.If not Hitchock's top thriller -I think "Psycho" is the one- "Dial M for Murder" is for sure one of his best films of the director and an extraordinary film in the genre; and don't waist your time with the 90's remake with Michael Douglas and Gwynneth Paltrow a definitely inferior product.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1954, Alfred Hitchcock cast Grace Kelly in what may have been her two most eye-opening roles: "Rear Window" and "Dial M for Murder". While the former is the most famous, the latter is also something. Portraying ex-tennis player Ray Milland trying to blackmail someone into murdering the man who has been having an affair with his wife, they make the most of everything: Grace Kelly's beauty, Ray Milland's tense expressions and camera angle. I read that Hitch filmed it in 3D; seeing how suspenseful the regular version is, I would love to see how intense the 3D version is.All in all, this movie grabs like few others do. You just may never trust anyone again after watching this. The 1998 remake "A Perfect Murder" was also quite well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clever murder mystery with a lot of entertaining twists. The plot is set up beautifully in the very first scene of the movie (no wasted moments here or anywhere else -- this is a tightly made story). Grace Kelly is excellent, as is John Williams as the Scotland Yard inspector and Anthony Dawson as "Swan". But this is really Ray Milland's show. He is a charming intelligent scoundrel, whom we love to hate, and his scenes with "Swan" are riveting.Just one complaint: What in the name of Heaven did Alfred Hitchcock see in Robert Cummings, a pedestrian, silly-looking man with no sense of the heroic about him whatsoever? It is not possible to believe that a woman -- especially a woman with the style and beauty of Grace Kelly -- could fall in love with him.An intellectual exercise while you're watching the movie: Follow the latchkeys!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M For Murder is a fine thriller that has all the usual Hitchcock touches. The blonde, the wrong man theme, and always a standout scene that will stick with you for days. The one from this film is the scene where Grace Kelly is about to be strangled. The events leading up to this scene bring about a wonderful sense of dread and suspence. You are glued to the screen to see if the murder will actually take place. Hitchcock shot this in 3-D and it would've been interesting to see this sequence in 3-D. Even more fun than the planning of the crime is the events that follow, the police inspection and how everything seems to fit perfectly in place, implicating Kelly and not Ray Milland. Then, everything starts to unravel again. A good suspence thriller that will keep you guessing until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who, other than Alfred Hitchcock, could have taken Frederick Knott's hoary old murder yarn and turned it into something like a classic? You might wonder why Hitchcock would have wanted to film such a creaky, stage-bound piece, (it hardly ever leaves its one-room setting), but it's full of lovely little bits of business and it's genuinely exciting.Much of the fun derives from the casting which, with the exception of that unattractive tailor's dummy Robert Cummings, is spot on. Ray Milland is a hiss-ably suave villain. It's almost as good a part as the one that won him his Oscar in "The Lost Weekend" and Milland has a lot of fun with it. As the wife who turns the tables on her would-be killer, Grace Kelly is almost as good here as she was in "Rear Window" and "To catch a thief", while Anthony Dawson, (the slime-ball assassin), and John Williams, (the upper-crust, debonair and really rather unreal detective on the case), probably do their best screen work here.Originally made in 3D so you do tend to find a lot of objects in the foreground but even in the 'flat' version finally released these visual compositions add to, rather than detract from, proceedings and Hitchcock's placement of the camera throughout gives the film a considerable kick. In fact, the only complaint I have is that Cummings didn't get his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock Presents...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIAL M FOR MURDER just might be Alfred Hitchcock's least exciting film -- the least Hitchcockian as it were. It is based on a one-set play and Hitch does little to open it up. There is an action scene that bows to the then-new concept of 3-D, but it is only mildly exciting. Indeed, most of the film is just people talking. And on first viewing, it doesn't seem all that interesting or well done. Yet, it is a film you can watch over and over again and enjoy just a little more each time. Eventually, the idea of it being a "Hitchcock" film fades and you begin to see it for what it is, a simple, no-nonsense drawing room mystery. It doesn't need the Hitchcock stamp on it -- no theatrics or gimmickry like that found in Hitchcock's other one-set filmed play, ROPE -- only simple, straightforward direction. The play's the thing, not the director. As such it is less a Hitchcock film than a prototype for what would become "Alfred Hitchcock Presents...": a twisty sinister little tale that is a showcase for a special guest star.The star in this case is Ray Milland. In one of the few times that a mere actor has ever upstaged Hitchcock, Milland takes the film and runs with it. It is not a great performance (or a great role), but Milland obviously has great fun playing, the devious, oily and self-amused villain. The film is his for the taking, since the other actors, with the possible exception of John Williams, seem indifferent to the material. And it is apparent that Hitchcock found little of interest in the material either. That gives Milland ample opportunity to amuse himself with this trivial little toy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITWhen Truffaut interviewed Hitchcock about this movie he said that it was a Broadway comedy he bought just to do something while a bigger project was being discussed (a spy story in the line of "North by Northwest" that finally wasn't made) and that it wasn't an interesting film at all. All right, I agree that it isn't one of Hitchcock's deepest or most personal films but it's really worth seeing -more than once- for it's great, twisted, plot, the acting of Ray Milland and John Williams and Grace Kelly.He originally released it in the 3D-vision system but as the big 3D hit was already over, most theathers didn't give the glasses to the audience.Let's say that it's a really thrilling movie, based on dialogues (wich is very odd coming from Hitchcock) but with a great timing that doesn't let the tension down for a single minute. The "good" characters, specially Robert Cummings, are really very annoying, but this probably can't be considered a flaw because the villain played by Ray Milland is very charismatic.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theatre Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple murder story about an aging tennis player who's plotting to have his wife murdered, Dial M For Murder was adapted from a popular play by Fredrick Knott, and while expertly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, one senses that the man's heart isn't in it. There's certainly no heart in the material. As a vehicle for stars Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings, it works well enough. Milland, in his last major hit as a star, is icy and convincing as the villain. Kelly was never a great actress, but is a pleasure to behold. She's well cast as the victim, though I can't resist the notion that any man who, however desperate, would seek to have her killed is not merely of the criminal bent but just plain bent. Cummings is bland in thankless support, yet his amiable disposition and general familiarity are somehow pleasing. John Williams, as a droll police inspector, steals every scene he's in, and became somewhat of a "name" for a while as a result. The movie is watchable, and hard not to get involved with once the plot starts to hum, yet it never shifts into high gear, due mostly to its theatrical origin. Hitchcock keeps the temperature cool throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagebound Hitchcock thriller with flashes of ingenuity, strong performances, and good suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is absolutely incredible when one reflects on the fact that Alfred Hitchcock made Dial M For Murder purely to fulfil his contractual obligations to Warner studios, and considered the film to be an effortless work that required little of him. He joked on several occasions that he could have "phoned-in" his direction (a clever little joke, as the film's most impressive suspense sequence involves Ray Milland "phoning-in" to his wife Grace Kelly in order to distract her while a murderer creeps up on her). The reason I say Hitchcock's casual attitude about the film is absolutely incredible is that it remains a very powerful and suspenseful film. How many lesser directors have expended every shred of energy on a film, only for it to be met with indifference or derision by the public and the critics? Yet here we have Hitchcock admitting that he has been neither meticulous nor ambitious in the making of his film, and has still produced something better than what most people could have done!! Such genius is at once arrogant and wonderful! Wealthy playboy Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is increasingly worried that his ravishing wife Margot (Grace Kelly) is about to ask for a divorce in order to run away with her lover Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Tony is especially fearful that a divorce will cost him rather a lot of money, and so plans to have his wife killed. Since Tony realises that the police would pin the murder onto him rather easily, he decides that his best chance is to ensure that he has plenty of alibis to prove that he is NOT guilty of the crime. He contacts an old school friend, Captain Lesgate (Anthony Dawson), and blackmails him into agreeing to carry out the murder for him. Tony plans it so that he will be at a social event on the night of the murder, ensuring he will have countless witnesses to confirm that he was nowhere near the murder scene. However, the plan goes horribly awry when Margot survives Lesgate's attempted murder and fights back, fatally wounding her assailant with a pair of scissors. Tony secretly tries to convince the police that his wife killed Lesgate in cold blood ? he figures that if he can get her arrested for murder, it will be just an effective as actually having her murdered. But Mark smells a rat and works with the police to clear the name of his distressed lover.Dial M For Murder took a mere 36 days to shoot, but is a very rewarding and cleverly assembled thriller. Milland gives a terrific performance as the sinister playboy, and is excellently supported by the stunning Kelly (who would later go on to make two more movies with Hitchcock). The attempted murder sequence is a highlight of the movie, with considerable tension generated as Dawson creeps from the shadows towards Kelly as she chats on the telephone. Dmitri Tiomkin provides an effective music score, and photographer Robert Burks makes brilliant use of lighting and shadows to emphasise the suspense. While the story is rather static, and virtually no effort has been made to use the openness of the film medium as opposed to the stage, Dial M For Murder remains a solid exercise in tension. It might not be Hitchcock at his best, but it still beats the hell out of most Hitchcock wannabes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable suspense/thriller with the emphasis on dialogue rather than action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another top-notch thriller from the master of suspense, 'Dial M for Murder' is one of Hitchcock's smaller films but still has all the hallmarks of quality we expect from him.The film is based on a stage play and, similar to 'Rope'(1948), has all the action (bar one scene) set in a single location - the living room of a London flat. The story develops around Ray Milland and his cunning plan to do away with his philandering wife, played by a rather lifeless Grace Kelly.The basic storyline is very strong and in some ways Hitch merely goes through the motions to produce a fine effort. The dialogue is first-rate, which it needs to be as some of the performances are run-of-the-mill. Milland is good, if not spectacular, but Grace Kelly seems bored and Robert Cummings, as her lover, registers little impression. It is left to the supporting roles of the killer and the Chief Inspector ( Anthony Dawson &amp; John Williams respectively) to provide the only performances worth a curtain call.The plot is great though and despite the whole issue of the latch-keys becoming a little confusing, holds the viewers attention right to the end. As good a reputation as Hitchcock has, there are plenty of other names who would have done as solid a job with the source material, so whether 'Dial M for Murder' enhances his reputation or not is debatable.The 1998 Michael Douglas/Gwyneth Paltrow re-make, 'A Perfect Murder', whilst not in the same league as the original, is still very watchable and well worth seeking out. No doubt Hitchcock snobs pour scorn over it, but I was pleasantly surprised and Gwyneth Paltrow is better in the role than Grace Kelly. Also, maybe its me but I always think the poster for 'Dial M for Murder' seems a bit strong for the time. Grace Kelly looks like she is being attacked sexually as she reaches back for the scissors. Maybe Hitchcock was playing out his fantasies !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Wendice (Milland) knows that his wealthy wife, Margot (Kelly) is having a long distance love affair with Mark Halliday (Cummings). Tony is quite jealous, but as an ex-professional tennis player no longer able to play, he needs Margot's money to sustain his lifestyle. So he decides to murder her, and concocts an elaborate plot to make it look like a burglary-murder. The plan seems foolproof, but its execution proves this a wrong assumption.Based on a stage play, the movie seems less like a movie than a filmed stage play. Almost all the action takes place in a single apartment. This is not a bad thing per se; what bothered me about Dial M for Murder is that it lacks suspense, and I felt I knew what would happen in each scene. That, and a rather lackluster performance by Bob Cummings, places Dial M for Murder in the (very small) category of lackluster Hitchcock films. But even then, it's still a decent flick.</fullReview>

Bob Cummings was so oily and unctuous, how could Grace Kelly even get involved with him? And the British may be so stiff upper-lip, but Harrison's tolerance of Cummings is unrealistic.Every other character is dead-on and perfect. I never understood the casting of Cummings.

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is a superb dialogue driven suspense thriller. Except for a minute or two of footage, all the action takes place in the apartment. The entire cast delivers its lines with conviction and realism. Every successive interaction builds on the suspense generated by the previous one. Ray Milland is so conniving yet sympathetic enough that one almost hopes that he gets away with it. I wonder if Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, or Jimmy Stewart, three of Hitch's most prominent leading men were afraid of jeopardizing their image and thereby their box-office appeal by agreeing to play a villain. Grace Kelly doesn't have much to do here but she does her job admirably. It was a great year for her. I think she made Rear Window and The Country Girl, for which she won a best actress Oscar, the same year she made Dial M. The actors who played the eccentric inspector and the paramour were also top notch casting decisions. Another winner from The Master, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't love it, but I'm still drawn to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIAL M FOR MURDER is not my least favorite Hitchcock film, but it also isn't my favorite. However, it has grown on me with repeated viewings, so I'm updating an old review I had deleted which I originally wrote after my first viewing. It's definitely a film I still want to revisit. I appreciate the stylization and simplicity of the set. Since this was originally released in 3D, that explains why the less is more approach works. The plot is plausible. Grace's wardrobe is simple yet lovely, and Grace herself is as beautiful as always. My issues were and still are with the casting and the acting...two pretty big issues. I don't believe for one minute that Grace Kelly's character would love, much less marry Ray Milland's. I also don't believe that she would become romantically involved with Robert Cummings. Fine actors on their own, they are not credible to me as love interests for such a young beauty. That element weakens the whole plot.The acting leans toward the over-the-top melodrama of the Golden Age. This is quite unusual and unnecessary in a Hitchcock film. Grace is guilty of it herself. Her accent bothered me originally. She sounds a little British and a little bit of Hollywood vocal polish. Milland, who can be very charming, is almost too bland and his clipped speech drains away his emotion to such a point that it is hard to connect with his character at all and to see how Grace ever could have fallen in love with him. Robert Cummings is pure American Pie, which he really is, but he doesn't seem like someone who would attract Grace Kelly away from her debonair yet older husband. None of the characters seem full of enough emotion to be caught up in a love triangle much less a murder plot. I am plenty capable of suspending belief, but if this movie is going to be so highly ranked in the IMDb 250 out of all the movies in the world, then I find it quite surprising and tend to wonder if guys are so stuck on Grace (in clothes or even in a nightgown) or loyal to Hitchcock that the implausibility of the plot with all of its flaws with the main characters is accepted without question.I have loved both of these main male stars as well as Kelly in other films. Sometimes I'll watch a film just to get to see these actors act. This one, even after repeated viewings, still bugs me, but I still find myself drawn to it regardless. I've finally realized that it plays like a play. it is simple and the supporting cast and mystery really drive the plot. That is a testament to Hitchcock's ability to pull together a film that doesn't compare in dramatic content to most of his other films, yet it still envelops and endures almost 60 ears later. I'd still say if you are stuck on a Hitchcock picture with Grace Kelly, then go for TO CATCH A THIEF or, even better, REAR WINDOW, but if you are determined to a less action-packed mystery, then DIAL M will draw you in every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By Alfred Hitchcock's standard, this is average. Fortunately, even an average Hitchcock picture looks good. The Master of Suspense works his magic on Dial M For Murder, but only sporadically. A clever plot allows Hitchcock room to breathe, while viewers become claustrophobic. Dial M's storyline makes that happen. It's complex enough to follow, so one might face a hard time playing catchup. (especially when distracted at certain pivotal scenes).The sequence leading to the attempt murder of Margot (Grace Kelly) is typical of Hitchcock. The tension slowly rises to an unbelievable high, and is the only entertaining highlight of the film. Even though the plot is clever, it sometimes get boringly executed. Hitchcock tends to indulge in overlong dialogue sequences in Dial M, a justifiable flaw that slows down (but builds up) the film tremendously. This is not Hitchcock's best, but it still gives an occasional chill whenever I recollect that above-mentioned sequence.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent working of murder but lacking that action kick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Wendice (Milland) hires Captain Lesgate Swann (Anthony Dawson) to kill his wife (Kelly) after he found out about her cheating and can therefore inherit her fortune.The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock conjures up a one roomed murder crime that showcases an array of heavy scripting and multiple dialogue that all comes together in a neat little package, if being quite a heavy burden to be.Dial M for murder, based on Frederick Knott's play (who also scripted the screenplay), brings a fantastic array of planning brutal murder and the drastic twists and turns that shake up afterwards. The plot initially is slow moving as we learn of Margot's cheating and Tony's knowledge of her marital betrayal. After a cleverly masked performance in front of his betrayer he phones Captain Swann about a car for sale and from here the script edges up to reveal the true intentions of Mr Wendice.Ray Milland speaks quickly and acts cleverly to get his way around trouble and looks conspicuously guilty but portrays a deft smear of innocence, and a wonderful performance it is. Grace Kelly is the shining beauty with a troubled agenda on her shoulders as Margot whilst Robert Cummings supplies a rather bland persona as Margot's lover and these performances are irrelevant in the grand scheme of this crime.The real intentions of Wendice unravel in an unashamed mask of honesty as he reveals every rule, every fabrication of his scheme to murder his wife and leave guilt free with her money. The use of blackmail against Swann is at length grammatically sound as they explore the foundations and consequences and benefits of following through with their intentions. As with strangers on a train the resounding use of a delicate issue in murder is given a full working over and yet unlike that film, this isn't short and snappy but overly long and tiresome.For all of Hitchcock's credentials as master of suspense and his adept style at giving the plot tension and excitement this 1954 release is void of any real vintage film making. For one the film is constantly talking and working out its own problems and misgivings and whilst there is absolute no denying the intelligence and brilliance behind one sole event, it grows weary with time and the eventual rapping up comes down to a debatable conclusion.This would be the most perfect picture ever created if there was a bit more action and adrenaline to go with the feel of the script. For example the actual murder is brilliantly twisted and shot and after that the film denies any responsible action, and it all bubbles down to talking about solutions and escapism.This is a good picture with a brilliant cast and a wonderful depiction of murder and betrayal but just doesn't generate a feeling of excitement and suspense other reviews have credited it with.</fullReview>

In real life, he could not do it because real life never works out the way you plan it.Well, when Ray Milland plans to kill his wife, things do not work out as planned and he does a masterful dance to keep suspicion off himself.He has to dance around Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), who turns in a magnificent performance.This was one of the best murder thriller I have seen and it displays Hitchcock's brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder, a movie about a married couple living happily in an apartment. On one night the husband invites an old friend who he knows to have a slight criminal record. He tells this friend about a plot to murder his wife. He has planned out the steps, and only needs this friend to do the dirty work. The friend is at first unsure, but the Husband traps him into doing it. The rest of the movie centers around conflicts between the characters about who was guilty of the murder. Many of these conflicts are interrogations from police officers, and the inspector. All of these scenes in the movie are very entertaining, well-produced, and well-acted. The movie holds up very well from beginning to end. It's not quite as good as Vertigo and Psycho, but its still a very fun movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the best decade of his long and illustrious career, Alfred Hitchcock put together yet another murder story that many consider to be a "filler" to pass time before his next great film, Rear Window. There is, however, much to say about this one, based on a play and directed in much the same way Hitchcock did Rope, also based on a play about a murder. Here, a man attempts to have his wife murdered, although it doesn't work out. So, he next tries to change stories to keep himself clean. But then there is a nosy detective... and his wife's lover keeps getting in the way...The play was confined to just one apartment room, and Hitchcock kept it mostly that way on screen, save for a few street shots and a party room. Doing this keeps our full attention on what is important; the setting of what will unfold here. Ray Milland does some of his best work here as the cool, sophisticated and unflappable husband Tony. Instead of flashing about as he did in The Lost Weekend, he keeps nearly all emotion bottled up and it is most effective when we think of him capable of murdering his wife. Speaking of her, Grace Kelly charms and wows in her first of three straight Hitchcock roles in a row. Of course, that is expected and Robert Cummings is also effective as the lover. One other role that comes to mind is that of British actor John Williams, perhaps better known as Audrey Hepburn's father in Sabrina. As the determined yet careful detective, he is not only sympathetic but fun to follow around as well.There is a lot to absorb here, and Hitchcock pulls no punches in giving it to us all. In fact, once the motives and clues start piling up, it can be difficult to know who is really the main suspect. If there is one flaw, it is that the final act goes a little long in the teeth and takes away from the marvelous buildup of the beginning. But, the attack scene is the best; effectively staged and quite a shock even after multiple viewings. It may not be one of Hitchcock's absolute best, but it works exactly as he intended it to and that makes it the kind of film that is important to understand the Master's masterful style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Very Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M For Murder is superior Hitchcock, not because of how much it embodies him, but because of how much it embodies what he is attracted to, the remarkably impressive perfectionism in a deed of malice, an ideal occasion for him to apply his own perfectionist style. Hitchcock was not a perfectionist in the sense that he was a refined, nitpicky gentleman of poise. He was in fact a shameless attention hog with a snooty English comportment. The perfectionism in his film-making comes from the same place that generates his never-ending need to appear on his own TV show, interviews, at some point at any cost during each and every one of his movies (this time, due to the story's confined setting, in a black-and-white reunion photograph), and even as the on-screen guide in the trailers of his later movies: An inexhaustible pride on his accomplishments, pure and obsessive joy taken by his prolific mastery of a challenging cinematic effect, suspense. This approach to perfectionism meets halfway with writer Frederick Knott's mature and controlled perfectionism. Knott details a rigid, clockwork scenario upon which Hitchcock magnifies just how inspired Knott's script is.Ray Milland plays the lead role with the same capacity for darkness and wickedness that he brought so stunningly to The Lost Weekend, another top-notch picture in which one would never have guessed for a minute that he was British. Well, here, he implies that he told you so, as he brandishes his classic native accent in his wicked portrayal of an ex-tennis player who impeccably hides his ulterior motives for having married the angelic Grace Kelly. For a solid year, Milland carefully and methodically plans her murder once they've named each other as beneficiary in their respective wills. She has no semblance of a clue that he is at all aware of her love for an American crime writer.The extent to which Milland effortlessly goes to polish every facet of a facet of his plot is astounding, we learn. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag holding one of the adulterous American's letters, and even simulated the role of an anonymous blackmailer to observe whether she would pay to have it back. He even surveyed them having a little farewell party in the American's studio flat, remembering even what they ate for dinner.Knott's firm and intricate narrative is as tight as a drum, infused with snappy complexity and even the humor and rhetoric grandeur residual from the original theatre production. Hitchcock emboldens the visual bearing of the movie. He cries, "I'm here, too!" with scenes shot entirely through a bird's eye view from the ceiling, and in his decidedly superstylized impression of a courtroom scene, with no props but lighting of various alternating colors.One example of a scene that streams seamlessly from one eye-bustingly gripping scene to another is one constructed entirely out of the technical aftermath of cinematography and editing, when we see Milland, repressing his anxiety for appearance's sake to an outer shell of petty restlessness, frequently looking at his watch. It is already past eleven when he notices that it has stopped. This is the unraveling arrangement of a minuscule race versus time swelled by theatrical music. Hitchcock's unabashed pandering for the status as his film's main character in spite of being on the wrong side of the camera for that ambition is actually an incidental charm, as opposed to the outcome of many self-conscious overstylized movies. You are a true artiste when your biggest weaknesses enhance your work, in this case by creating an inimitable spirit that permeates it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder (1954) **** (out of 4) A husband (Ray Milland) discovers that his wife (Grace Kelly) has been cheating on him so he hires a man to kill her but things don't go as planned. As was the case with Rope, this film seems to be a lot of good reviews but you never really see it get great reviews, which is a bit of a mystery to me because while it's not technically brilliant as some of the director's work it still remains a lot of fun with some nice suspense and good laughs. The performances by the three leads are all terrific with Milland giving one of his greatest performances because even though we know he tried to kill his wife, after things get off target there's still something about the guy that makes us want him to get away with it. Kelly is as beautiful as ever and Robert Cummings is terrific in his few scenes. John Williams is also great and adds a lot of needed comic relief. As with the before mentioned film, this one has a pretty simple story that would probably fall apart with a lesser director but Hitchcock nails all the scenes from the pre-murder talk to the finale where things start to unravel for Milland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of the Hitchcock Signature Collection (Strangers on a Train Two-Disc Edition / North by Northwest / Dial M for Murder / Foreign Correspondent / Suspicion / The Wrong Man / Stage Fright / I Confess / Mr. and Mrs. Smith), this is by far the best and the only one worth watching again. Has a very unique storyline, terrific acting, and filming. Dial M, though mainly taking place in just one living room, has a good story to tell. Includes great dialogue and comical moments -particulary at the end.Basically the story is about a man of the name, Tony, who had enough with his wife's affair and arranges for a friend to kill her. Tony is very intelligent and doesn't do anything without planning it ahead of time. Tony thinks he's come up with the perfect plan which can be carried out with no-one noticing. However thing go terribly wrong when Tony's friend could not pull it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly good Hitchcock thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M For Murder is quite a good triller from Alfred Hitchcock although tends to be a little slow moving in parts, especially the first half-hour or so.Due to his wife having an affair, Tony Wendice arranges with a former college friend to have her murdered. Things don't go quite to plan though and she ends up killing him in self defence when she stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors. Despite this, she is arrested and sentenced to death. She now has to plead her innocence...One of the low points of the movie is the first half-hour which features just Wendice and his friend plotting the murder his wife and it's shot in just the one room as well. A little too long is this bit.The excellent cast includes Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, John Williams, Anthony Dawson and Patrick Allen.Apart from that slow moving half-hour at the beginning, this is an excellent movie.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great thriller because of great script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial "M" for Murder is one of Hitchcock's best movies. However, that may have to do more with the superb script than with Hitch's directing ability.This movie was remade as A Perfect Murder starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. I believe the remake surpasses its original. This one is hard to talk about without giving too much away, but a husband is planning his wife's murder. Hitchcock must have loved trying to commit the perfect murder on the screen. This one almost pulls it off except for one little thing. That thing is pure genius when it reveals itself to you on the screen.This is a fantastic movie and stars Grace Kelly, so what else could you want. It will keep you riveted as you wonder who will stumble first. The story is the great part about this movie. I actually think just about any director could have pulled this off. The remake takes extra twists and turns and pulls itself off better as a movie. This probably makes just as fantastic a novel as a movie.Dial "M" for Murder still receives a major recommendation. Hitchcock did not overplay a strong script. That may have been his intent. I will have to think about this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must Be Seen in 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a chance to watch Dial M for Murder at Film Forum in New York in its original 3D format in January 2004. The film is one of Hitchcock's better-executed novelty experiments; cinematography, art direction, and screenplay are built up together to take advantage of the gadget. It must be seen in 3D, otherwise cinematography, which is precisely calculated to emphasize the depth with objects such as lamps, would look terrible, for example. Most actions take place in one room so that the audience could feel as if they were watching a play. The theme, tugs-of-war between the husband and the others, e.g. the hit-man, the wife, her lover, and the inspector, is a bit unrealistic but suitable for the setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staged, Scripted and Acted With The Utmost Precision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blending the suitably ostentatious with thrilling consequences is what Dial M for Murder is all about. Alfred Hitchcock decided to opt with the 3D technique when filming Dial M for Murder, a decision which was best suited for its time. Tailored from a stage-play by Frederick Knott, the picture ideally sticks to its original theatrical roots. Set in London and based around one set-piece (an apartment), the film tells the tale of a man who meticulously plans the murder of his wife by blackmailing a former classmate from college.Well known for his unification of exciting themes and sinister humour, Hitchcock crafts the work exclusively through elementary structural procedures. This is what makes the film considerably more thrilling than the generic thrillers of its time. One might go so far as to say that Dial M for Murder is Hitchcock's most alternative picture. For example, rarely does the camera leave the set-piece of the apartment, adding to the claustrophobic quality the film surrounds. Nevertheless, it is the suspenseful ambiguity which keeps the viewer engaged throughout the film's entirety.Hitchcock exploits household objects (e.g. lamps) as a method of creeping extra claustrophobia into the piece, while combining both theatre and film with an underlined posture. He also meretriciously chooses his camera set-ups; this inserts an extra level of composure to the piece. Sudden highlighting camera shots on vital objects often occur throughout, which subtly offer everything a defining edge of expertise. In addition, the editing is performed in a way which observes the characters, rather than manipulating them for the narrative.Yet when you have truly professional stars such as Grace Kelly, Ray Milland and Robert Cummings you can be certain that you are in for a treat. All the cast perform with supreme sincerity, capturing the anxiety through strenuous, one-to-one conversations. It is these conversations that thrust the narrative, but in a somewhat subconscious manner of implicit screen-writing. The presence of the script is that of a miracle, since the characters begin to comprehend situations by realising another person's agenda. Essentially, Dial M for Murder approaches the flaws that become evident through lies, and the morality of the film only enters in the darkest moments. Many of the scenes become a barrage of dynamic cat-and-mouse integrity, with characters "playing each other off" to gain the upper-hand.Dial M for Murder further proves Hitchcock's status as an auteur. A recommendation does not suffice; instead, I must tell you that the work is indispensable, making it a must for film fans. Not only does it continue to be unflinching, but also irreplaceable in its novelty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch and those scissors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is said that Hitchcock filmed the successful Frederick Knott play 'Dial M For Murder' as his creative juices were running dry and he needed a little inspiration. Hitch saw it as perfect vehicle for his favourite ice-cool blonde Grace Kelly. She stars as menaced wife Margot alongside the great Ray Milland, who creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable 'charming villains'.Ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice (Milland)needs money fast. His young, beautiful wife Margot is having an affair with another man, the writer Mark Halliday (an uninteresting Robert Cummings). Milland sees no problem with murdering his unfaithful wife- he's tired of her, and she has a very favourable bank balance. Of course, he doesn't want to do the dirty deed himself, so he blackmails an old college chum into committing the crime. He will enter the Wendice's apartment late at night, with Margot being home alone on account of Tony's perfectly-timed business-meeting, wait for Tony to call the residence and then sneak up behind an unknowing Margot and strangle her to death. It reads as the perfect murder- until things start to go terribly awry when Milland places the crucial phone call...Milland oozes charm as Hitchcock's villain. This is one of his best performances, coming close to the perfection of his portrayal of Don Birnam in 'The Lost Weekend'. He's so dry and funny and supremely confident in the success of his plan that we end up hoping he'll get away with it. One wonders why Grace Kelly tumbles for Robert Cummings. Boring, plain and unromantic as Halliday, he and Grace share zero chemistry . Is this is a deliberate ploy by Hitchcock? Grace herself is physically magnetic here. One of the most stunning women ever to 'grace' the silver screen, her timeless elegance is on full display. She equips herself much better here than in 'Rear Window' in terms of acting ability. Grace handles her role very well, she's never brilliant but she has some great moments, particularly in the notorious 'phone call' scene (watch what she does with those gleaming scissors). Hitch loved his icy blondes, and he also loved to place them in dangerous situations. Grace gets the worst of it here, but throughout her ordeal she looks beautiful, and her appearance in a sexy slip is given plenty of attention.There is plenty of great Hitch touches in 'Dial M'. It's essentially stage-bound, with most of the action taking place in the Wendice's apartment, and rather talky, yet Hitch works his magic and takes what could have been a standard crime pic into a very good suspense thriller. The latchkey McGuffin is a Hitchcock trademark, and I do love the opening sequence. Milland and Kelly (in white, with a strained look on her face)are seated opposite to each other at the breakfast table. Cut to a scene of the newly arrived Cummings, with Grace kissing him passionately (well, as passionate as these two mismatched screen lovers could get), a true scarlet woman in a bright red outfit and lipstick. Subtle brilliance by Hitchcock.Not up there with Hitch's masterpiece 'Vertigo' or 'Notorious', but a fine film otherwise.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a top rate suspense film from Hitchcok featuring many memorable moments, and some very strong performances from Kelly, Milland, and Williams. With a brilliantly executed plot and twisting story, this is one of the most impressively constructed films of the time.Kelly stars as Margot, an unhappily married woman who has been seeing crime writer Mark behind her husband's back. Her husband Tony is an ex tennis star whose wealth is slowly draining. Mark is an American, and is travelling over to visit the couple in London. However, Tony has known for a year that his wife has been with Mark. Tony concocts an ingenious plan to murder his wife, blackmailing an old college friend into doing it, and getting his wife's money in the process. It is the perfect plan, as Tony believes there is nothing to link him to the murder- a burglary gone wrong while he is not even at the house. However, the murder goes wrong, and Swann, his old friend is killed by Margot in self defence. The police are eventually informed, but not before Tony has come up with an even more impressive plan which will see his wife framed for the murder. Enter the Sherlock Holmes like Inspector Hubbard whose intuition and genius, along with the help of Mark's crime writing paranoia lead to the truth.There are so many twists in this film that the viewer is completely led in circles by the director. Aside from the brilliantly constructed plot, special mention must go to Williams as Hubbard, whose tongue-in-cheek performance steals every scene he is in. Like Hitchcock, he is in control of the characters and deftly unravels the crime. This should not be overlooked because of Hitchcock's bigger, more familiar hits as this is one of his best.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible story to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock has great opportunity to work with what he does best in 'Dial M for Murder'. The opportunities for suspense are endless in this story. The movie audience is let in on all that is going on. However, we don't have a clue throughout the movie how any of it will turn out. There are so many possibilities and very often a twist is thrown at us. It is great to watch Ray Milland react to and deal with each new arrival. He gives a grade A performance. And just when we think there couldn't be any more twists, the final one comes.I have to say: I always find moments of genius in Hitchcock's films. In this film the shot that was genius to me is as follows. When Margot and Mark are talking in the apartment and they hear Tony at the door, it switches to a shot of the door with their shadows on it, and the shadows quickly separate. I think that shot is a pure Hitchcock moment.This is a very thrilling movie to watch. I never knew what was going to come at me next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Hitchcock film that inspired 1998 "A Perfect Murder" with Michael Douglas. This one is better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1954 film, "Dial M for Murder" with Ray Milland and Grace Kelly inspired the 1998 remake, "A Perfect Murder." The general storyline is the same - controlling husband finds out about younger wife's affair and plots a murder to get rid of her and gain her wealth. Alfred Hitchcock directed this one and it is better-done, IMO, than the remake. More believable, better acting. So, here are some of the significant differences--This is set in London, the other in NewYork. Here he is a retired tennis player, the other he is a financial gambler. Here he goes out with the lover of his wife, and hires a petty crook to do the murder, instead of blackmailing the lover who then hires a crooked friend. Just to name a few.The "inspector" is interesting, as a side note. Apparently he was the model for the "Columbo" character played so succesfully by Peter Faulk. His methods and mannerisms are the same.Good movie. See it if you haven't yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the DVD version of "Dial M for Murder" again last night. It looked as good as ever, maybe even better than ever! Grace Kelly was so young and so beautiful, and gave Hitch a very inspired performance. She was a great actress and they obviously worked well together! All the other major actors give the performance of their careers as well. Brilliantly done and very satisfying entertainment. Interesting that it appears to be the last major film for both Robert Cummings &amp; Ray Milland, who went on to many TV shows, occasional B movies, and guest appearances. Even Dimitri Tiomkin delivered a very inspired score. While he was great at major themes and grand action music, he seems to ramble pointlessly in minor action scenes ("The High &amp; the Mighty" is a case in point. Some of the background music for the cabin action scenes seems pointless and unnecessary.) But...not in this case! He delivers a very inspired score that fits the film perfectly! (His last score for Hitch, by the way). Watch it again, you won't be disappointed (I guarantee...)!! Regards, Steve</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Best Laid Plan Goes Awry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS.Well, I just love it. There is, first of all, Frderick Knott's play. It's been done before and after and if you want to see how to spoil it watch the TV movie.But this is Hitchcock at his best, believe it or not. The acting is superb.Ray Milland has never been better as a suave, self-possessed villain. Grace Kelly makes you want to squeeze her. Anthony Dawson is a marvelous murderer. And Williams is a great investigator, as he always is. Two points. This was shot to be projected in 3-D and Hitchcock only gives us one blatant (and not very blatant) 3-D shot, in which Grace Kelly reaches behind her for the scissors. Two: Only once does Hitch depart from the procenium, an overhead shot in which Milland dumps suitcases around the floor.Do see it if you have the chance. Hitchcock had had a couple of flops before this, and said he made the movie simply to "recharge his batteries." It's more than that, but you shouldn't expect a flawless movie. If the performances are about as good as they get, the anfractuous plot depends a great deal on curious and sometimes unusual circumstances. Williams visits Milland at home and surreptitiously switches almost identical trench coats with him. Milland's unsuspectingly taking the wrong coat with him to jail is an important plot point. (How did Williams know Milland would not notice the difference between coats, that he would take a coat with him at all?)The chief plot point is that there are only two keys to the apartment, leading to the conclusion that Kelly herself admitted Dawson with the express intent of killing him. But Dawson's own latch key gets mixed up with the two genuine ones and this clears her. Dawson drives an expensive car, which must have an ignition key. He probably has keys to other secure appliances. How come he has no key ring -- just the single latch key in his pocket? The keys on my own key ring number more than half a dozen and I've forgotten what some of them are for. Yet Dawson, a tricky character with multiple identities, carries only a single key in his pocket?None of this matters. The movie is merely first-class entertainment. It doesn't carry a message, anymore than a crossword puzzle does. You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

When the murder does not go quite as planned, it appears that Milland's second plan (just dumb luck) may be even more ingenious. A stunning screenplay and top-notch performances (by Milland in particular who is one of the most under-rated actors the silver-screen has ever known) make "Dial M for Murder" a great cinematic experience that I bet you will have to watch more than once. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

And Grace Kelly wears torso-clinging scarlet lace with panache; as Milland's wayward wife, she glides and swoons with her usual high style.I was most charmed by John Williams as the Chief Inspector. The way he combs his mustache expresses something incredibly British with perfect pitch. He inhabits a stereotypical role with great subtlety.Not much was done to adapt this production from stage to film. But it's such a great period piece, who cares? Enjoy the apartment that you barely leave. Actually, you don't even get much beyond the living room. Check out the funky use of shadow and color, the daring camera angles.Rediscover a cinematic world where the director depends on a well-written script, seasoned actors and opinionated lighting, rather than quick cuts and multi-million dollar f/x!Watching Dial M in 3D, however, is rumored to be a fine thing should you choose the retro-techno route.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A relatively simple story that is very deftly handled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The star of this film is Ray Milland, though Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and John Williams are there to provide support. The marriage between Milland and Kelly is on the rocks, though neither is letting this on to the other. Grace has been cheating on him and Milland, who knows this, is planning on killing her. Why kill her instead of a divorce? Well, Kelly is wealthy and Milland wants to remain in the lifestyle to which he's become accustomed.Originally Milland's plan is just to have her killed by an old college associate who's gone bad, but when Grace miraculously survives this attack, his plans quickly change and he tries to make it look like she murdered the assassin. While clearly self-defense, Milland is very clever and seems to have thought of just about everything in order to get her convicted of murder. However, the plan is perhaps too clever and too well thought-out and in the end, there is a terrific confrontation with the police investigator and Milland's plans unravel.Probably the most memorable and amazing scene in the movie is the scene where Kelly kills the would-be murderer. It was done very vividly--particularly when he fell backwards--further driving the scissors into his body. This was a brilliant scene and it made me wince. In fact, throughout the film, there were many well-constructed and executed scenes that make it obvious the script writers and director were in top form. While not among his most famous films, this is one of Hitchcock's better movies and he has a very deft hand in creating a fascinating and literate murder mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expertly Made But Decidedly Minor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Hitchcock's version of the popular play was considered a shocker in its day, repetition of the story in so many versions has made the story itself seem rather tame: a husband, angered by his wife's affair and in desperate need of money, blackmails an acquaintance to murder her--but his plans go awry when his wife kills her attacker in self-defense.Both Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings, as the faithless wife and her mild-mannered lover, give enjoyable performances, but the real success of the film is Ray Milland, who brings a slightly oily charm to his role of murderous husband. Hitchcock's approach to the material is somewhat hampered by the fact that the film was originally shot in 3-D, and although the scene in which star Grace Kelly confronts her attacker is justly famous, the film is essentially a meticulous recreation of the stage success rather than a Hitchcock original.Although familiarity with the material robs if of impact, most viewers will find Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER entertaining in an old-fashioned sort of way. For myself, I wish the film could be released to DVD in the original 3-D format, so we might see how effectively Hitchcock handled the requirements of the form. It might very well breathe new life into an old favorite.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is a well chosen vehicle for Alfred Hitchcock, very similar to Rope. A suspense thriller set in the London flat of married couple Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, it had a very successful run on Broadway, 552 performances from 1952 to 1954. Unlike Rope, Hitchcock did briefly give the audiences in a couple of instances a break from the one room set of the play.Although shot in Hollywood, Hitchcock used a few members of the British colony to give the film proper authenticity. The character of Grace Kelly's paramour is American and Grace seems to have improved her British accent from Mogambo. The remake of Dial M for Murder was disappointing because of all the additions to a very simple suspense drama. The key here is that both Ray Milland and Grace Kelly so polite and civil to each other, like any other upper class couple. Then in conversations with other characters, Kelly with paramour Bob Cummings and Milland with Anthony Dawson the audience finds out their true feelings. It's all so genteel and very British, the completely American setting of the Michael Douglas film, A Perfect Murder was the last thing from perfect.Kelly's fallen for Bob Cummings, she realizes Milland is a wastrel, a word I wish would come back into use. Milland realizes he's drained the wife dry or coming pretty close so he hires an old college acquaintance Anthony Dawson to murder Kelly. Or rather blackmails him into it. That scene where he blackmails Dawson is one of both Hitchcock's and Milland's screen highlights.On Broadway, the parts that Milland, Kelly, and Cummings have were played by Maurice Evans, Gosti Huber, and Richard Derr respectively. Hitchcock retained from the Broadway cast Anthony Dawson and John Williams as the police inspector. In the case of Williams I should say THE police inspector. John Williams won a Tony Award on Broadway for his part. He set the standard as far as I'm concerned, maybe even more than Alastair Sim, for a British detective. Calm and detached, Williams goes far beyond duty requirements in relentless pursuit of the truth.Milland's scheme is a tricky bit of business involving his and Kelly's latch keys to their apartment. Quite ingenious in how Williams puts it together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be in the top 10 of Alfred Hitchcock's cluster of masterfully directed classic films. In her first teaming with The Master, Grace Kelly portrays a wealthy woman married to a fading tennis pro (Ray Milliand), who wants her murdered, because he knows of her affair with an American writer (Robert Cummings). Nicely shot in color, with a robust musical score, the picture was designed for 3-D, and the effects are quite minimal until the attempted murder scene, by a hired thug (Anthony Dawson). Later, due to Milland's interfering, Kelly becomes the accused, until a savvy detective (John Williams) unravels the case. Ray Milland is again simply superb, reciting fine dialog with great relish, while Kelly is startling beautiful and polished, until things begin to go awry....her hair and clothes become drabber. Stagy, mostly in one indoor set, even the outdoor London sets seem projection-oriented, but always gripping, fascinating, and nerve-wracking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous - why is this considered great?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many who believe that Alfred Hitchcock was a visionary genius; but personally, I fail to see the appeal in his films. I like some 1950s movies - those of Billy Wilder are great, but I find Hitchcock gets stiff performances from his casts, uses preposterous plots and in 'Dial M for Murder', there's a surprising absence of action - just a lot of talk. To summarise the story, a man plans an improbably complex murder; when the plan goes wrong, he frames his wife; but when his wife's friend and a sympathetic policeman get suspicious, they manage to trap him (albeit via the peculiar device of taking her from prison on the eve of her planned execution to help find the evidence to damn him and free her). He takes his capture with sang froid, and the film ends. I suppose Hitchcock was an original, in attempting to tell tales more complex than those previously attempted in cinema; but in an age of over-plotted and under-motivated thrillers, I wonder if his influence can be wholly considered good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good thriller with a great cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock serves up a grand suspense yarn about an elaborate murder-for-hire scheme. Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings form the triangle in the case of a husband who wants to eliminate his wife in order to inherit her considerable wealth. That his wife is involved in an extramarital affair means little to him as he sets into motion his plan that eventually unravels due to dogged detective work. As with most murder mysteries, money is the reason Milland wants to dispatch Kelly and enlists the help of an outsider to do the dirty work. John Williams is the droll inspector who takes the case apart and puts it back together with logic and old fashioned police sleuthing. The film has a parallel with another Hitchcock film, "Rope", in that both pictures were filmed almost entirely with one set piece. Still, this mystery remains one of the genre's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder is an exciting thriller. HItchcock sends you through many twists that are both thrilling and scary. Right from the start Tony Wendice is aware of his wife's affair with another man. As his planned out perfect murder of his wife goes wrong your left on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next. I wasn't completely against Tony's actions, as his wife was committing adultery behind his back. But, his actions are extreme and of course Hitchcock knows this and sets it up so that Tony will benefit by gaining all of his wife's money (which is a lot) upon her death. I really liked how Hitchock makes MArk, the man who Margot Wendice is cheating with, a writer of murder novels and at one point practically describes the whole incident, as it happened for real, to Tony, but actually has no idea that Tony is behind it all. This is a wonderfully constructed triller and just an amazing piece by Hitchcock.</fullReview>

No one can match him in storytelling even today. I loved it as much as Vertigo. I would put Vertigo slightly ahead of it, But it is no less a classic. There is a catch in the movie however which i would like to point The fact that all keys look the same. This looks a bit contrived , but come-on u cannot belittle a movie just on account of a single minor loophole. At the end Hitchcock beautifully and i cannot stress enough on the word beautifully, together to give a master piece.I don't think any other director can make a movie thats so entertaining and engaging when you know who is the murderer. I just realized that in-spite of having known all the facts in the movie, it still is heavily engaging. You know who the culprit and still Hitchcock keeps you engrossed till the end. This is a lesson to all those suckers who crave for twists in every goddamn thriller movie.Hail HItchcock10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a Detective Novel on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Retired professional tennis player Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plots against his wife Margot (Grace Kelly). Tony ended his tennis career after Margot complained about his schedule, and a year ago she began an affair, which he secretly discovered, with American crime-fiction writer Mark Halliday (Cummings). For several months, Tony has been investigating C.J. Swann (Dawson), a disreputable fellow Cambridge alumnus who lives in London, in order to blackmail him into murdering Margot.Like the earlier "Strangers on a Train", this film involves a tennis star's dislike of his cheating wife. Either Hitchcock has a weird love of tennis, or tennis players in the 1950s had really bad luck in picking wives.What makes this story really great is how the original idea backfires! A few times, the plot goes in a direction that the lead does not expect, but he is able to think quickly and modify his story for the police in away that keeps him looking innocent and his goals within reach. It's pure brilliance.But best of all is how this film works through like a detective novel, relying on logic more than physical evidence. The mystery writer, without blood or fingerprints is able to deduce a great deal of what happened simply by running thought experiments. How plausible this is, I don't know... but in this film, it works! I personally prefer "Strangers on a Train" or "Rope", but "Dial M" is by no means a bad Hitchcock film. I would urge anyone who has enjoyed Hitchcock in the past to give this one a fair shake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice look at the justice system with Alfred Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M For Murder is another film done by Hitch in the 50s, so the expectations behind this film immediately became high for me. Hitchcock has yet to fail me with his great murder mystery/suspense films, and Dial M For Murder is no exception to his list of great films.Like many other Hitchcock films, Dial M is a claustrophobic film. About 90% of it takes place in a single room. Hitch uses every object in the room very well, which continues to keep the movie interesting. Unlike a lot of films of the time (and even today), the movie follows the killer to begin with. The killer reveals his motive and everything else behind the murder of his wife which is to take place later that week. About halfway through the film, you begin to stop trusting the killer, and begin to trust other members of the (very good) cast. This is where Dial M For Murder won me over (although it wasn't done as good as Psycho).The cast, as said before, is made up of many great actors. Grace Kelly was in her prime, and everybody else had great chemistry with everyone else. The dialouge (as with most Hitchcock films with the exception of Psycho) feels dated, but for the time, the dialouge was handled very well.The movie, as to be expected, has several great moments of suspense. One scene (which drags out for about 5 minutes) contains unbearable suspense. Hitch does his films so that the viewer can't stand the suspense anymore, yet they can't take their eyes off the screen.What makes this film a stand out from other Hitchcock films is the twist at the end. No, it isn't a twist like Psycho. It's more of a small twist in the investigation that you wouldn't expect. The twist actually seems small and pointless, but if affected the outcome of the movie in such a good way.Highly recommended, but only to people who don't mind slightly dated movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dial M For Murder is filmed like a stage play, basically using one set for the entire film and a small group of actors. Ray Milland plays a tennis pro who wants to get rid of his rich wife played by Grace Kelly. Robert Cummings plays Kelly's old flame who comes to visit. Milland knows all about them and plans to use the opportunity to have her murdered. Ray Milland is very good in his role. The devilish grin he uses during the scene of plotting the murder is eerily similar to the one Jack Nicholson has made famous.Grace Kelly looks absolutely gorgeous on screen. She was also in Hitchcock's "To Catch a Thief" with Cary Grant and of course the great (and one of Hitchcock's best) "Rear Window" with Jimmy Stewart. Supposedly she had an affair with Milland which ads to the strangeness since he's playing a man who wants to kill her. Robert Cummings is rather weak in his role. This is not one of Hitchcock's great films by any means but, but with any Hitchcock film, even his lesser offerings are still highly watchable and better than 99% of most films made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock in his Hollywood days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M for Murder, was made when Sir Alfred Hitchcock defected to Hollywood to make films. It is here at Hollywood that his films receive wider commercial success. This culminated in this iconic director becoming less independent, but one who was obliged to adhere to the film companies' restraints. These restraints were in the view of the likes of Warner Bros' put in place to ensure their films were a profitable, and commercial success. It was this which it can be argued contributed in films directed by Sir Alfred, such as Dial M for Murder receiving negative criticism from the critics.All the same Dial M for Murder is quintessentially Hitcockian. Then, what makes a film quintessentially Hitcockian? For one, Sir Alfred Hitchcock is one of the few directors who really knows how to extract what he needs from his actors. It is because of this, that it doesn't matter whether the actor is good at acting. An example is given here in Dial M for Murder in the form of Grace Kelly. What is important to Sir Alfred here is that she has charisma which can be extracted and exploited by him, thereby making Kelly's acting ability irrelevant to what is required.If Kelly's role in Dial M for Murder was to be cast today, I think either Sharon Stone or Kim Basinger would do it justice, due to their similar charisma.Meanwhile, another aspect of Hitcock films which makes them Sir Alfred's own brand is his ability to keep the viewer intrigued without too much alteration to the set. This is exemplified in Dial M For Murder, as in Rear Window, where most of filming is shot in a stage like set, one room location.It is these elements, which make a film undoubtedly Sir Alfred Hitcock's own, that leaves one to wonder why the man perceived it to be important to have himself discreetly placed in all of the films he directed. Was he not confident in himself, or was he over confident, and therefore purely vain? Perhaps it was just for the purpose of being witty or for that matter cocky which compelled him to be noticed in his films. On the hand it might have merely been a ploy to encourage the audience, or viewer to pay more attention to the films.As to the plot of the film Dial M for Murder itself, I think it is a tad flawed. What seams obvious does not seam so to Kelly's character, Margot. That she is the proprietor of wealth, that her husband envies. This is not least because it undermines his traditional role as the patriarch of the household. Surely she could see that he'd only married her for her money. Of course this would make Margot feel unloved and used. Why else would she have an affair? I doubt that the reason is purely because she could, given that she owned all the economic power. This is because women, especially of that era were conditioned to be emotionally susceptible to the concepts of love and romance. But surely as the only beneficiary of her money, combined with the fact that she felt unloved by an obviously cold husband, was enough for Margot to see who was behind the plot of her murder! Finally, just because the Master of Suspense, Sir Alfred Hitcock, here manages to maintain the audience attention, without changing the set, this film deserves to be noted as worthy by the critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awe, come on! NO ONE is going to execute Grace Kelly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though we're convinced that a beauty like Grace Kelly won't actually ever hang for a murder she didn't commit, this is a fascinating flick, anyhow. Almost all of it takes place in only one setting - Margot's &amp; Tony's small but classy apartment. Evil Is Interesting: we're enthralled by Tony's (Ray Milland's) evolving plot to murder his adulterous wife. Tony is even seen as somewhat justified, since Margot is adultering with a younger, handsomer man, Mark, as played somewhat limply by Bob Cummings. Margot's affair may be acceptable continental behavior, but it's grounds for a man to seek violent forms of "satifaction" in solidly-Anglo-Saxon Britain. Tony is a professional murder-mystery-writer, so we the audience root for a fool-proof scheme out of this guy, but just in the backs of our minds. The players are set into motion! The proxy murderer enters the house with Margot there alone! Tony is across town enjoying his well-thought-out air-tight alibi! Mark isn't in a position to save her! Then, Tony's plot fails! Margo physically turns tables on the man set to kill her, smalltime crook Swan. The tension in the murder-room, with Margot struggling while being strangled, then killing her attacker is all thanks to a well-placed common household gadget! Tony's plot fails, interestingly enough, but his wife may be put to death my His Majesty's Government thanks to a plot twist. WONDERFUL, Tony thinks. It could all end there, with perhaps Margot getting a commutation to life imprisonment or something, so we don't feel so bad for her. But, Hitchcock and the author both work skillfully to fool us. The Fat Lady will sing later. Inspector Hubbard, of Scotland Yard, played by the comfortably-English and familiar John Williams, has these attacks of conscience and must "get to the bottom of things". Altho his unfaithful wife is now safely on death row, Tony finds a Brit version of Columbo keeps showing up to bother him with little details. Egged on by Margot's old boyfriend Mark, Insp Hubbard, who first helped send Margot up the river, delves even deeper into the case. Using relentless logic, Hubbard drives events forward to their logical conclusion, as we see Tony falling to pieces mentally, a bit at a time. The script is brilliant in several aspects, mostly for introducing murder-plan elements that first confuse the audience. As these puzzlements are solved, a new perplexity comes into play, and we don't understand Hubbard's crime-solving method until the very end. There's no mystery about who did what, but there is a great deal of mystery about how the bad guy is going to get caught! So, this filmplay is done quite smartly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ex-tennis star Ray Milland (as Tony Wendice) wants to murder younger, wealthier, and much prettier trophy wife Grace Kelly (as Margot). The beautiful Ms. Kelly has fallen out of love with Mr. Milland, and is more fond of smooching with old school-friend and TV crime writer Robert Cummings (as Mark Halliday).

Chief inspector John Williams (as Hubbard) eventually arrives to try and sort out Milland's immaculately plotted, but regrettably imprecise, murder plan...There isn't much to warrant director Alfred Hitchcock shooting "Dial M for Murder" in "3-D"; it's basically a one set stage play, with little lunging at the camera. But, it's a very well-written (by Frederick Knott) and entertaining play. Only Milland overcomes casting problems with the starring trio; his assured, urbane performance saves the film. Although beautifully decorative, Kelly is wildly miscast; it's difficult to picture Kelly and Cummings as old schoolmates, falling in love over spaghetti dinners. Incredibly, Kelly received several "Best Actress" award notices, while Milland was overlooked; he is amazing. Mr. Williams and Mr. Dawson are also excellent.******** Dial M for Murder (5/28/54) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, John Williams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RAY MILLAND, as a man who devises a plan to have a college associate kill his wife (GRACE KELLY) for her inheritance--and the fact that she's had an affair--is a pleasure to watch in a role that seems almost tailor-made for his emoting. He is just as effective as Maurice Evans was on the stage.Alfred Hitchcock has taken Frederick Knott's play (from a screenplay written by Knotts himself), and carefully built the suspense to the point where a clever mastermind is exposed. The business with the key is extremely effective and the lynch pin that destroys the husband's alibi.GRACE KELLY is smooth but rather bland as the wife (a role offered first to Olivia de Havilland whose salary demands were too high), and ROBERT CUMMINGS has a rather conventional supporting role as the man she really loves. But it's ANTHONY DAWSON as the college chum who agrees to murder Kelly and JOHN WILLIAMS as the fastidious detective who solves the case, that really remain in the memory.Among the more interesting Hitchcock films of this period, it's the sort of detective yarn any mystery fan would enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'M' for Murder, 'E' for Excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great master himself, Alfred Hitchcock, wasn't the biggest fan of this picture. While it doesn't compare to the complexity of the likes of Vertigo or North By Northwest, it's the brilliant simplicity that sets Dial 'M' For Murder apart from most other Hitchcock films. Taking place mostly in a small apartment, Hitchcock builds the suspense through the claustrophobic environment and that way that he deals us enough information to follow the plot, while keeping the real important cards close to his chest so that it's difficult to guess what's coming next. The film never has you sweating on the edge of your seat as you desperately try to guess what's coming next as some Hitchcock films have done; but Hitchcock still manages to achieve tension through his relaxed plotting, and that shows what an adept technician the man really was. The plot has the usual Hitchcock murder formula, and it follows a man and a plot to murder his wife. He blackmails an old collage buddy into doing the deed for him. After that plan goes awry, our villain sees an opportunity to turn the situation to his advantage again...but there's no such thing as 'a perfect murder'.The film has a cast of only five main members, and this helps the claustrophobia of the film, while ensuring that it's easy for the audience to know where they are with all the cast members. Grace Kelly is the biggest name on the cast list, and while her performance is a little too one-note, and she isn't given much to do; it's always a pleasure to see this classic actress in a movie. Starring opposite her is the excellent Ray Millard, who manages to achieve a great sense of underlying evil with his performance as Kelly's murderous spouse. It's Millard that really makes the film, and he was the perfect casting choice for the central role. My favourite performance in the movie, however, isn't from the leads; but from the excellent John Williams as the Chief Inspector. Whether it was intended or not, Williams brings great comic relief to the film and also manages to capture the essence of the great detectives such as Sherlock Holmes with his rather small part in the film. The plot is intricate and well thought out, and it will require thought to aptly grasp exactly what conspired. While Dial 'M' For Murder isn't Hitchcock's best film - I rate it among the best, and it comes with high recommendations!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dial M for Murder" is a fabulous movie about a well-planned murder that falls through. When Tony Wendice finds out that his wife, Margot, is having an affair with author Mark Halliday, he seeks revenge on her. He devises a well-organized plan of murder, using an old college friend as the killer. However, Margot is able to grab a pair of scissors as her assassin is strangling her, so she stabs and kills him. But Tony isn't going to give up that quickly, and starts to plot another plan immediately.With great performances by Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, and Robert Cummings, "Dial M for Murder" is a movie Alfred Hitchcock fans won't want to miss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good Hitchcock. 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitch is the Master, hands down. His Dial M for Murder is generally considered to be a good but mediocre effort. I myself give it an 8/10, which is good but low for Hitchcock. It basically consists of a murder plot gone wrong, and it's a good example of one. The writing is often amazing, and you're always trying to guess what's coming next. What results is quite spectacular. Dramatic irony is used to the max.I happened to see it in 3D before I saw it in regularD, which I was glad to get a chance to do. Unfortunately, the Master does not use it very well. I cannot imagine a single film of his that would benefit from such a gimmick. To do so, it would have to be rather light, which this one is, and also contain action. Perhaps To Catch a Thief would be best. Maybe North By Northwest, but that one is probably far too good for that. Dial M for Murder is one of Hitch's talkiest films, and only during the murder scene is the 3D used to great effect. Otherwise, it just distracts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mystery, tension, and resolution all very well executed by Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is in an unhappy marriage with Margot Wendice (Grace Kelly). Margot doesn't really have a problem with the marriage; she's got a boyfriend (Robert Cummings) who's going to take her away to a better life. Tony, on the other hand, has a problem with Margot's plan. Not only will he loose his wife but she's the one with the money and Tony has grown accustom to his life as a kept man. Mark Halliday (the boyfriend) comes to London for a visit. Tony sees an opportunity to solve his marital and fiscal problems with a simple phone call. Actually it's rather complex. How else would Hitchcock weave a plot around the mystery of what might happen when things don't go as planned.The mystery, tension, and resolution are all very well executed by Hitchcock. One of the really interesting aspects is the cunning of Inspector Hubbard (John Williams). He figures out who killed whom and who is plotting to deceive whom. This must be one of the rare movies where Hitchcock doesn't portray the cops as fools. Another interesting aspect of the movie is the way Hitchcock can twist our feelings. We know Tony's bad, but his plan is so cleaver it's easy to wish him success at murdering his wife. We know Margot is a lying, cheating, and `back stabbing' adulteress but when we see her being tried for murder, it's easy to wish for an acquittal. If you're thinking of seeing the 1998 remake starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow (`A Perfect Murder'), go rent `Dial M for Murder' instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most memorable Alfred Hitchcock movies. Small, but excellent cast. Suspense is thick. The plot is old, but the script if very witty.Ray Milland is a former tennis pro that discovers that his beautiful wife(Grace Kelly)is having an affair with one of his friends(Robert Cummings). Milland schemes a blackmail plot that is suppose to end with his wife being murdered by the blackmailer. The whole thing is botched and now the web of lies begins to grow. The investigation that follows is very clever.Rounding out the cast are: Anthony Dawson, George Alderson and a top notch performance from John Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dial A For Adultery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is considered a "sophisticated" crime film and it does have some interesting dialog and a story that keeps your interest. You have to pay attention, particularly at the end when the British police inspector explains how he figured things out.Ray Milland is the big star of this show, being in almost all the scenes. This kind of suspense movie is unheard of today - a thinking man's gentleman as the main bad guy - with little action in the film. That wouldn't be a success today. It was re-made in 1998 but had more twists and action scenes added.In this film, as in that re-make (A Perfect Murder), I found myself rooting for the husband. In this case, it was Millland, although he was a bit cocky.Note: It's a sad comment that Hitchcock, who didn't seem to have a lot of principles, made Robert Cummings - who was an adulterer in this film having an affair with Milland's wife Grace Kelly - into a "good guy." Nobody in the film challenged him on what he was doing. Apparently, adultery was okay with the filmmakers here. At least in the re-make, they made the adulterer into a scumbag (although they made the cheating wife into a sympathetic character! No matter who makes this film, they are still clueless when it comes to what's right and what's wrong!.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dial M for Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sir Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors that ever lived, but for some reason some people don't think this film is one of his best, I think its good. Its a good story about deception, suspicion and pure greed. Ray Milland plays the sneaky and quite bastard like husband Tony Wendice. He is married to Margot Mary (BAFTA nominated Grace Kelly). Tony has talked to an old school friend and planned a robbery for this "friend" to do in his house, for some reason. When the robbery goes wrong and Tony's friend is killed by his panicking wife, she is suspected of murder. (Coincidently when he calls her he dials the letter M, hence the title). Luckily in the end Tony gets what he deserves when the cops suspect him of deception. Hitchcock's cameo is on the left side in the class-reunion photo. It was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor to average Hitch, but essential viewing for the nightgown scene!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty poor Hitch. Too long dialogue scenes, not enough action - its like a static stage play. Very unmemorable "husband-wife betrayal" plot material.It has one scene, however, which makes it essential viewing for Hitchcock and Grace Kelly fans alike - for it is one of both their greatest moments, and the scene that made her famous. It is the scene where Grace Kelly answers the telephone in that diaphanous nightgown, and a man puts a rope around her neck. A fantastic scene, a memorable moment - the only really great thing in this movie.But its great enough to recommend it to you.5/10. But essential viewing for the nightgown scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dial N for Naptime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really takes someone as intellectually alive as Hitchcock to make a stinker as leaden, and dead on arrival as Dial M for Murder. There it sits, lacking any of his signature technique, stagebound and lifeless as when the first word of it was written, not benefiting from any of his intelligence. Characters talk and talk and talk, always indoors, in a drawing room, because it was written for the stage and Hitch couldn't be bothered to open it up. So it's unbearably claustrophobic. Even if you look out a window it's a phony as can be. Ray Milland is dull as dishwater. For a thrill, after what feels like 5 hours, we cut to the insides of a phone interchange.All of it seen through the eyes of normative British police who can't wait to put things right again. ho-hum. I'd suggest more needed to go morally wrong in this snoozer to generate some interest. For a director whose filmic inventions could fill an encyclopedia, this is a tedious, unimaginative project.The only memorable moment in this (which is also grotesque) is when the stooge hired to kill Grace Kelly fails, and falls onto his back, driving a pair of scissors deeper into his body. Hitch regretted this and never did it again. (The knife is never seen injuring Leigh in Psycho). Rent 'Sudden Fear' with Joan Crawford for some actual thrills eked from this same scenario.This should have been called 'Hitchcock Collects a Paycheck,' Dial H for 'Humdrum,' or Dial U for 'Unremarkable.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Film By Hitchcock(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI am getting into Hitchcock film nowadays so today I went to Hollywood Video and rented this. I must say, this is definitely in my top five favorite Hitchcock films. It has great suspense, like every Hitchcock film will and should have. It have terrific performances by the new Hitchcock star Grace Kelly, a great performance by John Williams, but not the composer. It also of course has the very good Robert Cummings in it. Some of the parts of the film, however, make no sense.Here is the plot. Like most Hitchcock films, it is not that easy to follow at first. Okay, here it is. A husband named Tony wants to murder his wife named Margot. He knows she loves another man named Mark. He also wants her money. Tony hires a man named Swann to kill her. Tony sets up the perfectly, or so he thinks. The plan can not more wrong than it did. For one reason, Swann is killed by Margot. She does it in self defense. She is arrested anyway. She is planned to be killed. An officer and Mark find clues of the murder. They find out that Tony did plan to kill her. Margot is released and they set up a plan to trap Tony. They do and the film ends with everyone have some alcohol.Overall, this is yet another classic Hitchock films. Like I said before, it is a little complicated with all the different clues but if you really think or listen closely you will understand. Also, I think that ending seemed a bit too rushed in my opinion. I mean, the alcohol is poured and the officer goes on the phone. Then there is the The End sign and the credits roll. That is all, no more, no less. Also, there is a scene in which Margot is found guilty that is so bizarre you might want to fast-forward through it. Anyway, this is a truly fantastic Hitchcock film that anyone that is a fan of suspense or Hitchcock of course will like.9/10Recommended Films: Rear Window.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would thrill a nerdy 10 year old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Complex artificial overly machined plot. Why are these things popular? They seem designed to thrill a nerdy 10 year old.I agree with another reviewer and wonder why is Hitchcock so highly thought of? This is B grade stuff that you feel you have to like because it is Hitchcock and Grace Kelly. I have heard time and time again that Hitchcock wasn't art but high craftmanship--I don't see it in this movie.A disappointing bore watch something like The Double Hour if you want surprise and intelligence.After watching this and A Lady Vanishes (really awful) I have come to the conclusion that Hitchcock is like Jacqueline Suzanne of novels mediocre boiler plate who knew what the public would buy. Well maybe a cut above Suzanne-- Trevanian or some author--not a Graham Greene.Do not recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Dial M for Murder Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial for Murder is one of Alfred Hitchcock's worst-yet one of the most famous-movies. The plot is about a man who wants to kill someone by, when she uses the phone next, strangling her. However, it backfires as she kills the henchman with a pair of scissors and a Plan B has to be devised about killing her while the police on the case. The story isn't the best, the only part of the story that intrigued me to watch this was to see what it had to do with a phone. The only scene that I excited me at all was when the main character realized that his plan backfired. Other than that, this is actually a very dreary film. But it's not all bad; the acting is great. I recommend this to anyone who likes murder, Alfred Hitchcock or just to see why it got to be so famous. If you're not one of these things, I suggest that you shouldn't be watching this movie at all.My Rating: */*****</fullReview>
