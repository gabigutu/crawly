		<shortDescription>Nobody said his movies weren't difficult at times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film occupied with moments. Wonderful moments. It is not so much concerned with mechanics of plot but for me, it never got dull. Wes Anderson has matured in subtle ways and this film is a well crafted blend of the personal and the pageantry - Powell and Pressburger and Cassavetes. "The Rules of the Game" and "Husbands." "The Last Detail" and "The River."The "spiritual journey" is used as pretext. Some people really don't like this. There is so much humor in watching three brothers stoned on Indian pharmaceuticals, trying to pray and getting sidetracked by arguments over stolen belts and confided secrets. They are flawed. People are flawed. Audiences tend to like their characters so likable that they are bland stereotypes. People can be privileged and disaffected AND still be beautiful and intriguing.In the end, this movie is a fun ride. A stroll through various imaginative carts, occupied by compartments of colorful characters and incidents. Wes is further interweaving his "dollhouse" aesthetic with the real world. He is not so hung up on inventing every little thing and I could tell he was finding faces and peripheral details just as they were, waiting for him in India.Nine bucks well spent for me. This guy's taking chances - some don't work. He's trying to push the medium forward in terms of tone. Some parts of his movies are difficult. Some people will get left behind. But for me, someone whose watched his films grow in scope and daring, I think he's an American treasure who may never arrive at the perfect film, but he'll continue to integrate cinema's history in new and exciting ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saddest, Funniest Journey to the Most Beautiful Non-Destination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a DAMN GOOD MOVIE. It's this bright, expansive, random, happy, sad, funny, stupid, and wise trip that these 3 brothers take, and I'm not here to give you the play by play. Watch the thing, and you'll see how it's not something that adds up to the sum of its what-not. It's just Not One of Those kinds of movies. Instead, it's one of those that has to be seen to be believed, and is worlds-better experienced than recounted. It's a Trip. Through the spaces between people, as well as within India.And Yes, it has much in common with the rest of director Wes Anderson's stuff, visually and thematically and tonally, in the best ways, if you ask me. I think he was really hittin' his stuff on all cylinders in this one. Just So Much that's implied rather than stated. So Much in the way that people and relationships can be both lamented And celebrated. He just brings So Much to the screen, but always leaves that space that demands the audience step up and meet him on the platform, with our own individual "baggage" we've brought along. It's Great.And maybe it was the way it was shot and cut and directed and acted, all very subtly, vividly, kinetically...Maybe it was the way the characters felt really REAL, fascinating and absurd and pathetic and majestic, all at the same time.Maybe it was because India is so bright and beautiful and exotic, to the tourist's and movie-goer's eyes.Maybe it was just random enough and specifically-rendered enough to really hit me RIGHT THERE, but IT DID.I enjoyed this more than any movie I've seen in a long time. Real Art made with Real Heart.So Sad and Funny and Just Damn Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighten Up, Francis!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is a metaphor-laden ride in which the characters all have baggage, both literal and figurative, that they cannot seem to shed because they have yet to understand that they would be less encumbered without it.I am a fan of Wes Anderson, even though his movies generally leave me with a feeling of numbness on first viewing, and a sense of uncertainty as to whether or not I thought the film was any good from a plot and character standpoint. I find myself remembering scenes and images and in the days and weeks that follow; I enjoy revisiting my memories of it and pondering the quirks of characters, the mind of the characters, and the intent of the director. There aren't any big emotional payoffs or any neat plot twists. Dialogue that seems nonsensical, trivial, or awkward turns out to be easily related to overarching themes as the movie unfolds and rewinds in my mind's eye. Or maybe it's all just a big, steaming pile of pretentious nonsense, too twee and too precious for its own good. I can't decide. I can never decide. I remain baffled and frustrated, but something about them keeps me coming back."I have GOT to get off this train," said the stewardess, Rita. The train is the biggest metaphor, bigger even than the pile of Louis Vuitton luggage the three brothers, played by Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman, drag all over India in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and a return to being brothers "they way they used to be". One suspects that they never were the way they used to be.Peter cannot let go of his father, who died in an accident he witnessed, and who he was not able to save. He carries around certain personal objects that do not fit him, or are outdated, like talismans. Meanwhile, he is terrified of becoming a father himself. Francis, survivor of a motorcycle accident that has left him wrapped in bandages, wants the brothers to become close, but constantly annoys both of them with his fussy, overbearing, control-freak ways. Jack pines for a girlfriend he can't leave, or who won't leave him, and of whom his two brothers disapprove. Meanwhile, he has casual sex with Rita with no more real forethought than he applies to slugging down narcotic cough syrup and pills of unknown provenance, just to make his surroundings more interesting and to take his mind off his ex-girlfriend.But the brothers' most profound source of unhappiness is that their own family has failed to live up to their image of what a family should be. This longing for an idealized family and parents is a major theme in Anderson's movies. They resent their runaway mother, who did not show up for their father's funeral, they squabble over who should have possession of their father's belongings.It is a bereaved Indian father who gives Peter the absolution he craves, not his brothers or his mother. Francis finally removes his bandages and lets his younger brothers see his wounds, both emotional and physical. Jack is the only one who seems largely unchanged?is this because the actor was a co-writer? It must be very hard to write for yourself.All this makes it seem a serious movie, which it is not. There are two good hearty laughs to be found in it and many wry smiles. The brothers are exasperating and shallow, at times even petty, and yet you find yourself liking them all the same. I found these characters to be intriguing. Peter seems the most outwardly normal, but he has the strangest quirks. Francis is oddly sexless, almost monastic. One suspects he may very well end up living much as his mother does. I kept waiting for him to make some comment about his scarring and how it might affect his romantic life, but he never did. Jack is highly sexed, yet seems uncomfortable in his body, hiding behind his little porn star moustache. He yearns to be mysterious and exotic, or a romantic expatriate artiste, but when he attempts to act as such, it just comes off awkward and forced.Owen Wilson is an actor I've never had a whole lot of use for, but I must admit that he was very good in this movie. He brought a sweetness to a character who could have been simply annoying. Adrien Brody was fine as Peter. His character had to display the most emotional range, and was also the most physical, with some episodes of good slapstick. Anderson clearly understood Brody's strengths and made them work. He and Wilson were effective in scenes together and had the chemistry of real brothers. I was less impressed with Jason Schwartzman. I have liked him a lot better in other movies. I felt he was overshadowed in this film whenever he had to go up against Brody and Wilson, despite being given the funniest lines. He did well in his scenes with Rita.Wes Anderson's movies have been criticized for being too white, too rich (his main characters usually don't have money worries, Max Fischer aside), and for having a void in the center. I think setting this movie in India with all its beauty and diversity and having some of the strong supporting characters be Indian helped with the whiteness factor. But to criticize movies like this for having a void in the center kind of misses the point. His movies are about the void?the one that exists between people who yearn for that sense of connection. And the best way to bridge it is to stop taking yourself so damn seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is unlike the average comedy. While not being truly laugh out loud funny, the film is clever, well written, with memorable characters and one liners that grow wittier over time. The only type of movie it can be compared to are other films by Wes Anderson, the director of Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and the love it or hate film, The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. All of his movies are extremely stylized, with slow motion sequences, wide lenses that slightly distort the frame, and privileged, depressed characters with family issues all thrown together in a slightly artificial, timeless, carefully detailed environment. While with The Life Aquatic he may have tried to do too much, The Darjeeling Limited shows Anderson finally perfected his style. He knows when to throw inside jokes to his most loyal of fans, while keeping his stories fresh and personal, without acknowledging the critics who blame Anderson for repeating himself.The film is absolutely engaging from the very start with a hilarious, memorable cameo by Bill Murray, trying to catch the Darjeeling Limited train in slow motion, yet is outrun by Adrien Brody's Peter to the tune of The Kinks' This Time Tomorrow, one of the three Kinks songs in the film (all are accompanied by slow motion sequences). Brody, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson play the three Whitman brothers, Peter, Jack, and Francis. Wilson's character has organized a spiritual journey through India with his brothers who have not spoken to one other since their father's funeral a year ago. Performance-wise, the standout is Wilson, in what might be his best role yet. Owen Wilson seems to play himself in all of his other movies, with Wes Anderson being the only writer/director to truly know how to use his talents. The characters begin to realize that one cannot force a spiritual journey, no matter how many temples visited and organized rituals performed for brotherly bonding as printed on a laminated itinerary. The bender that results is a ridiculously entertaining blend of comedy and drama successfully aided by Anderson's great choice of music and colorful, dynamic cinematography.Extremely recommended viewing (other than Anderson's previous efforts) before watching this amazing film is Hotel Chevalier, a 13 minute short film directed by Anderson and starring Jason Schwartzman, available for free download online through Itunes. In the film, Schwartzman plays the same character that he plays in The Darjeeling Limited. Also starring is Natalie Portman as Jack's ex-girlfriend, who makes a brief cameo in the feature film as well. The short film helps establish Schwartzman's character, and provides clues on certain details of The Darjeeling Limited. Also, a couple of funny moments in the feature wouldn't make much sense without seeing the short. The emotional, yet blissful experience that is The Darjeeling Limited is Wes Anderson's best film thus far, defeating Rushmore for that top spot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More spiritual. More guided. Same Anderson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When deciding whether or not to see this film, the question is very simple: Do you like Wes Anderson's previous work? If you answered yes to this question, you will adore The Darjeeling Limited. If you answered no, you'd better spend your money elsewhere. I personally, fall very deeply into the former category. I've always been a huge Anderson fan and adore all four of his previous efforts, and this certainly ranks among his best (top three, easily). This is a much more guided, inspirational and personal work from the man. While his other features have been more minimalistic and set between a certain group of characters, Darjeeling takes on a much larger world.The story is about three estranged brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). About one year ago their father died and they went their different ways. Of course, nothing can start off too happy in a Wes Anderson world. Francis attempted suicide (the irony is painful), Peter is having a baby with his wife Alice who he always thought he would divorce and Jack is trying to get over a rough break up (some inside jokes for those who have seen Hotel Chevalier are included). Francis decides to reunite these brothers on a spiritual journey across India, via train, and everything happens to go horribly wrong.The chaos that ensues is quirky, hilarious and utterly perfect for fans of Anderson like myself. The performances from the three leads are brilliant, particularly Adrien Brody whom I thought was going to be out of his Oscar-winning element but actually fit in so well that I preferred him to the rest of the cast. There is a huge turn into a more somber mood about halfway through that brings up memories of Luke Wilson's big scene in The Royal Tenenbaums (nobody tries to commit suicide, mind you) and the film picks up on the dramatic sentiment before jolting right back into the uniquely brilliant world that always keeps my sides in stitches. The man's genius is as strong as ever. This may be his best film and it's certainly his most poignant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson hits it big with offbeat, quietly affecting effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the trademark quirkiness yet insight into many profound truths of human behaviour one would expect from director Wes Anderson, it should come as no surprise that his latest film, The Darjeeling Limited, demonstrates the majority of these traits with particular flair and distinction, arguably Anderson's strongest work to date. The typically disjointed plot details three brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman) who, in an attempt to bridge the gap between them, embark on a "spiritual journey" across India by train. Of course, considering Anderson's tendency towards offbeat comedic situations, and a series of problems involving Indian cough syrup, a poisonous cobra and pepper spray, the journey does not, of course, go as planned, and the brothers are forced to cope with their increasingly difficult situation and each other in turn. Do not mistake the film for the conventional road trip buddy comedy it may appear to be - Anderson is far too eclectic and clever to subscribe to such traditional fare, and his film is instead a far more emotional effort. With a particular knack for intricate character and storyline development, Anderson's script carefully doles out tidbits of character history throughout, painting a gradual and remarkably detailed portrait of the central characters as the film progresses. Though the film may drag or feel as if it falls slightly short of its true potential at times, on the whole it is far to easy to be swept up by the film to dwell on such minor concerns. The gorgeous Indian scenery is captured with particular affection by Anderson's jarring cinematography and sharp eye for intriguing colour schemes. The film's wonderfully fitting soundtrack perfectly compliments the sublime visuals, making for one of the most aesthetically pleasing films in recent memory. The central three actors are the real draw of the film, and all three boast excellent chemistry throughout. Owen Wilson, as usual, is effortlessly funny as spiritually obsessive control freak Francis, but also brings a tragic undercurrent to his character, made more poignant due to recent real life events out of character. A superb Adrien Brody steals the show as the emotionally unstable soon to be father Pete, demonstrating both previously unseen comedic abilities, and genuinely affecting emotional clout. As bitter writer Jack, Jason Schwartzman proves proficient at raising many a laugh, but despite his strong performance is easily overshone by his two co-stars during the film's dramatic moments. Watch also for amusing cameos from Bill Murray and Natalie Portman (featured more significantly in the film's 13 minute prequel found online at www.hotelchevalier.com), and a somewhat forced supporting role from Angelica Huston near the end. Like the rest of Anderson's other work, audiences will likely either love it or hate it. This is not a typical belly laugh evoking comedy ?-la-Superbad - the humour present is more sly and chuckle worthy, and prides itself more on precisely crafted characters and situations than sight gags and one liners. Those willing to appreciate the film for what it is will enjoy an intelligent and touching spiritual meditation on family, and life in general. The joy is in the journey, and a journey as quirky and sentimental as this is one easily worth taking - for those willing to put forth the effort to overcome mainstream expectations, the film will not disappoint. -8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson delivers. Again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzmann as three brothers who haven't spoken for years, on a train. In India. By Wes Anderson.It's a good idea, isn't it? No...it's a great idea. Three good actors in three-well written roles in an open, exciting and unpredictable environment, while they're also stuck with each other in a cramped an uncomfortable train carriage. With more than a little baggage...However, despite the bright, new and fantastically shot environment and the well-cast new member of the Anderson family, The Darjeeling Limited is what has become a typical Wes Anderson film. Despite its relocation from the suburbs, or more recently, the deep blue sea, it's still a film about a dysfunctional family and their endeavours to become...slightly more functional. The comedy is derived from sibling tension and the conflicts of the past, and even the music, that typical Anderson blend of quirky yet affecting relatively unknown tracks which is very good and works in all the right ways, feels comfortable and expected despite its "newness".I seem to be griping because Anderson's fifth movie is as good as the others. And in a way, I am. The Darjeeling Limited is the work of a director who has found his groove (or in this case, his track) and doesn't show signs of trying to get out of it. As a result, not much of it really feels surprising. It's just as well he's good at what he does then, isn't it? It's the way Anderson handles the family drama that sets Darjeeling apart. While it's funny in all those idiosyncratic ways, making light of familial relations and awkward interactions, Anderson's warm, tender approach draws you into the lives of these characters. And, because of their respective flaws and quirks, they become more than characters; you can see them as people.Anderson's movies have always had genuine heart buried not too far below the layer of offbeat style, so despite its familiarity, Darjeeling is arguably in this respect his best work. You can see a part of yourself in each of the Whitman brothers, and in cinema there is no substitute for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to The Darjeeling Limited with reasonably high expectations having enjoyed Anderson's earlier films and given that my family were originally from Gujerat (not far from the film's locations in Rajasthan). However, I found it to be largely crass, laboured and insensitive. It's the kind of film that Americans who have never been to India might enjoy, but for anyone who loves and knows the country it's quite another matter.It's hard to warm to any of the characters - they are a series of quirks rather than real people (eg Jason Schwartzman doesn't wear shoes, for some unfathomable reason). In particular, it's not so great to watch bland, unlikeable Americans going to India to 'find' themselves when the film is so uninterested itself in India. Here it is nothing more than a colourful backdrop. Anderson clearly cares for it so little that a scene supposedly taking place in the foothills of the Himalayas was clearly shot in Rajasthan. For those of you who haven't been, the foothills are about as dissimilar from Rajasthan as Montana is from New York. They are a world apart.The film is laden down with some of the worst metaphors that I have seen in a supposedly 'intelligent' film. When the three brothers finally discover the real meaning of life, they literally abandon their baggage - they dump it on the station platform! It's a long time since I've seen something as laboured as this.This film is cultural appropriation of the worst sort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snotty little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After their very wealthy father of the Whitman family dies three very wealthy brothers set off to India to find their wealthy self-indulgent mother who is undergoing some mental catharsis guilt trip by acting as a nun in a Quasi Christian temple in India. On this journey through India, these three brothers attempt to also attain some spirituality by undergoing ridiculous made up spiritual rituals. The film actually begins with this meaningless episode of Jack Whitman, played by Jason Schwartzman, staying in an upmarket French hotel and having a reunion with his girlfriend played by Natalie Portman. There is a very gratuitous naked scene of Natalie Portman (More for the benefit of the Coppola family she obliges) and that just about ends her contribution to the film except for two seconds at the end. Bill Murray and Angelica Huston also make cameo appearances. The contrast between the three brothers and the absolute poverty of India is brushed over by some stupid interaction in the saving of a child's life and the funeral of one that tragically dies. There is a simplistic attempt at symbolism in the act of unloading luggage.This very cheap self-indulgent film was a further extravagant means of introducing another member of the Coppola family into the film business in the Family Nepotism tradition.This film was written and produced by Roman Coppola and his cousin Jason Schwartzman along with Wes Anderson, who directs the film (he directed the Royal Tenenbaums). Owen Wilson and Adrian Brody play the other two brothers. The film is stupid and tells us nothing about the human condition other than extremely rich trendy men can make short films at the drop of a feather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a bad film to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have ever traveled India as a Westerner, considering yourself to be aware of cultural ignorance and stigmata and have discovered that world full of variations, full of true spiritually in every aspect of life (living, death, beauty, ugliness, dirt, colors, poverty and richness), this film will touch you in the most embarrassing way.I have never seen any Wes Anderson film before, in fact I hoped to see a film which makes a clever and funny statement about civilization torn lifestyle .But all I saw was a shallow college movie, taking place in an India which does not exist like this, depicted in a very insulting and tactless way.The plot was hardly fathomable. An upper-class family fell apart some years ago or something... and tries a reunion somewhere on a trip from Radjasthan to Tibet? The three main character's adventures seamed, apart from their stupidity, straight out of a puberty driven boy's daydreams, including conquering princess-like Indian girl servants , rescuing kids of a village from a bridge destroyed by the power of nature, encounters with poisonous snakes and tigers, romantic dates on a Paris rooftop etc.All boring, I hardly laughed once. A film which deepens stereotypes and which is a loss to everybody who is expecting a somehow intelligent or funny film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were so excited to see this movie--we loved the Royal Tenenbaums, we love &amp; travel to India often, we love all the actors BUT we could barely get through it. It was boring, pointless, not funny and was almost insulting in it's completely false representation of Indian trains and the people who work on them. You would NEVER EVER find a women waiting on men on a train, wearing a short revealing dress. I'll never say never, but I doubt that even a prostitute would have sex with some white guy on an Indian train. Maybe it was supposed to be a cartoon with all the garish painted interiors and bogus events (a train getting lost?). I could have tolerated that if there was just anything to hang on to in the story. It was the worst movie I've seen in many years! Worse than Ishtar!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complex and beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After three viewings of "The Darjeeling Limited" I find myself quite certain that this is not Wes Anderson's best film in the sense that it's not his best-paced film and it may have some moments that are a little too heavy-handed. However, I find that these little flaws add to the charm of the film because of the way it is constructed and written. It almost feels like one is part of the journey and since no journey of this sort is perfect or fully enjoyable it's almost fitting that this film isn'tI laughed out loud more during "The Darjeeling Limited" than during any other Wes Anderson movie, although "Rushmore" is probably more of an outright comedy. This screenplay wasn't written with Owen Wilson, as Anderson instead chose to team up with Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman for this project, presumably due to Wilson being too busy to do it. The result is a slightly inconsistent (and, as mentioned before, heavy-handed) screenplay but one with loads of delicious irony, wit, and dry humor. It's great stuff, really. There is a lot of depth to be found here as well, especially with Anderson's use of recurrent imagery in the film. There is perhaps more maturity and understanding of human nature here than in any previous Wes Anderson films.The acting is once again top-notch here from Brody, Wilson, and Schwartzman, and Anderson's use of music is again incredibly fitting and beautiful while also being perhaps less frequent and distracting than his other films, allowing less room for accusations detractors frequently make that Anderson is nothing more than a glorified music video director. Also of note while discussing music is the use of various Satyajit Ray compositions in an acknowledgment of one of his cinematic idols and main inspirations, not only for this film but in general."The Darjeeling Limited" demands multiple viewings. It is a rich, complex, detailed, and gorgeous film which is a unique and fascinating look at some familiar thematic material recurrent in Anderson's work. It's not a perfect film, but it's definitely one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is certainly a visually appealing movie. The rich colors of southeast Asia mesh wonderfully with Anderson's penchant for precise set-pieces, and it make the entire experience a pleasure to watch.&nbsp;As for the rest of the movie, you probably already know if you're into Wes Anderson's brand of story. The father issues, the esoteric musical choices, the slightly surreal quality of each character - it's all here. The three brothers are well-conceived, with personalities that directly influence the overall narrative and the resolution. I liked it. It's more of the same, but pleasant enough to make that seem like a minor issue.Oh, and be sure to watch the Hotel Chevalier short before The Darjeeling Limited. It helps fill in the back-story for one of the brothers, and it's an interesting movie in it's own right. &nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second only to "Rushmore"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that arrogance is in the atmosphere of all of Wes Anderson's films and his style will probably never change, but I LOVE every single one of them (even the overblown "The Life Aquatic" gets me giddy). He knows how to push my emotional buttons and entertain the hell out of me, something that I find rare in most movies I watch. Usually if I want to be entertained, I feel the movie has to compromise the emotional value and vice versa. With Wes, I'm laughing, being entertained by the characters AND caring for them. The second that Adrien Brody ran past Bill Murray in slow motion running toward the train as The Kinks' "This Time Tomorrow" kicked in, my heart started racing at the idea that I was about to watch a new film by Wes, which I look at as something special that comes every few years. Wes' detractors complain that he is a pretentious one-trick pony, a true statement, but to me, not a negative one because I love his universe and I love being invited into it in every one of his films. While I love both of them, I occasionally wish that Tim Burton would make a film that wasn't some kind of Gothic fairy tale, or that Paul Thomas Anderson would make a film that didn't star his own ego. With Wes, I want him to just continue what he's been doing: keep using his same awesome style while taking baby steps of progress. The writing, acting, directing, soundtrack, production design and cinematography (okay, EVERYTHING) are top-notch in "The Darjeeling Limited". Hell, if "Rushmore" wasn't such a damn masterpiece, I'd say Wes has made his best film yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Train of lost souls trundles to nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really a stinker. Everything is good about it except the characters and the writing. It has high production values, the acting is very good, but the characters are shallow, narcissistic and nothing more than sum of their hangups. It's like some teenage film school freshman was given unlimited resources to try to create the most quirky characters ever, without a story to hang it on. Perhaps it's how a spoiled, rich teenager would imagine adults to be, selfish, whiny, demanding and spiritually hollow. The three brothers are riding a train in India in hopes of finding and visiting their mother who failed to show up at their father's funeral. We are treated to a relentless display of the brothers' bizarre and exhibitionistic behavior as the train trundles through the Indian countryside. They behave like chronically depressed 4 year olds. Maybe the filmmaker thought he was getting at contemporary angst, maybe he just thought he was creating amusing madcap clowns in the spirit of "A Hard Day's Night." But these clowns aren't young, their antics don't amuse, they grate. We come to hate them as much as they hate each other. We don't care whether they find their mother or not. The older brother's head is always swathed in bandages, the result of a motorcycle crash which may have been an attempted suicide. He orders the other brothers around and they seem unable to stand up to him. One brother reads a couple of paragraphs from a story he's writing. The story is as shallow and pretentious as this movie and these characters. Here's the spoiler: they do meet up with the mother (Angelica Houston) who's the biggest narcissist of all. Dressed in white robes and made up with black eyeliner, she holds forth in some sort of Christian mission in the foothills of the Himalayas. Well, you might have known it...these losers were nurtured by this pompous and vain woman. No wonder. In the end the brothers are running to catch the train to go home, as they run they drop their baggage. That's symbolism; get it? They're shedding their baggage, right? But these characters are so light you can't imagine them having any hardly weight at all, even with their baggage. Without the theatrically contrived baggage they wouldn't have any material existence whatsoever. For the last hour of this film every scene looked like it was going to be the last. The camera focuses on the bewildered faces of the brothers, the music swells, the camera pulls away. At last! you think. It's finally over. But no, there's another scene, and another, and another. At one point they witness a young boy drowning in a canal. They try to rescue him, but can't. They take his body home to his village. There is a funeral. The scene is empty; it's like it happens in dream. The brothers appear unaffected. It is impossible to care about them. I've almost forgotten about this movie and I only saw it 2 days ago. Please, save yourself the boredom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson Hits Rock Bottom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have enjoyed Anderson's earlier efforts. Bottle Rocket (very funny), Rushmore (a sheer delight), Royal Tenembaums (not bad) and Life Aquatic (good fun). However, i found this to be largely crass, pointless and amazingly obvious. This is the kind of film that annoying young whipper snappers who wear skinny jeans, brandish ipods and have free access to their parent's bank accounts, who happen to feel the need to go to Thailand or India in order to discover themselves in the most clichéd possible way, will enjoy.I found it hard to empathise with any of the characters - they are merely a series of quirky quirks who live through moments, admittedly played well by Wilson, Schwartzman and Brody, but even good performances cannot save this dross. India itself is only used as a colourful backdrop and there are only so many slow mo soundtrack scenes one person can bear.The film is a mish mash of some of the worst metaphors that I have seen in any film, EVER. When the three brothers finally discover themselves, they literally throw their 'baggage' away as they run for the leaving train (in slow mo whilst some music is playing, i might add, aarrrrgh!). I can't remember the last time I've seen something as laboured as this trying to pass itself of as something interesting and multi layered.If i had a De Lorean, i'd hit 88mph, go back to the point when i first decided that i wanted to watch this atrocity and say to myself "don't do it, trust me, i'm you from the future and i've seen it".A complete waste of time. You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Liberals stumble through India</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this smug and never-funny comedy-drama a worthless trio of brothers try to find common ground on a train trip through India seeking out their mother. (Mom went to India and failed to attend their father's funeral in New york, the pretense of the movie.) All three brothers are obviously billionaire losers with no apparent earning skills or character values. Their wasting of money reflects the values of the coke sniffing Limousine Liberals who pollute the film industry these days; and this film is Exhibit A as to why we ought not shell out $10 for movies to support the lavish lifestyles of talentless actors like these three.The Owen Wilson character -- who never earns a dime -- nonetheless wears $3,000 loafers and a $6,000 belt. We know because he brags about it. Well, my gosh, I wear only Florsheim shoes and buy them on sale for under $60. My leather belt costs $20 and lasts 5 years. The Wilson character looks like a bum, while I look great. Near the end, the unemployed bum brothers decide not to take their flight home and they (get this) tear up the tickets. Is this supposed to be cute? Or is it just stupidity? The runt-with-mustache brother sees an India woman who's hostess on the train. He seduces her in 2 seconds flat with "Join me for a cigarette in the rest room?" Naturally, they have jackhammer sex with the girl smashed up against the wall -- the only kind of sex Hollywood losers seem to know about. Tell you what: I could do better. Most 15 year old boys could do better. A virtual amateur would know how to have sex where both people maximize the pleasure, and this does not involve slamming the girl against the wall. (Hint to filmmakers: Getting undressed helps.)There is an optional (and pointless) prologue wherein the runt-with-mustache brother is aimlessly hanging out -- for at least two months, we're told -- in a suite in the Hotel Raphael in Paris (approximate price $8,000 per night) waiting for his girl friend to find him. (Real nice for an unemployable drifter.) Having already spent $ 1/4 million on the room he orders a cheese sandwich. Finally the girl shows up and they order two bloody Mary's before launching into sex (this time not against the wall); not Great Planners as the sex will be interrupted by Room Service bringing the Bloody Mary's. Fortunately for both, the script writer forgot all about Room Service -- as he also forgot any degree of sense or probability anywhere else.The film opens with a totally unrealistic scene of a man speeding through town in a taxi. Good grief, that could never happen in India. Take New York traffic and multiply by 5; nobody speeds in India. Traffic is gridlock.Shame on the 3845 empty-heads who scored this boring mess a 10. Whether that was Studio Feed or honest opinions movies will never improve so long as truly bad movies earn a 10. Happily this film flopped fast at the box office. Perhaps that sends a message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saying yes to everything, or trying to anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to note about Wes Anderson's new film (featuring Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrien Brody, as the Whitman brothers, Francis, Jack, and Peter respectively) is that it was shot in India, mostly on a colorful old train traveling across Rajasthan. The train perhaps replaces the elaborate constructed set of the ship Anderson used in 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.' That ship was a bit of an albatross. The movie cost $60 million to make and is Anderson's least admired work. The train is part of a faster and cheaper production and it's crucially different: it's a real train, in motion during the shoot. It's still perhaps an arbitrary and whimsical set?and has the kind of bright pastel colors Anderson likes?but this time, as Brody has said about the shoot, they were learning to "live in the moment," just letting things happen, and using whatever they observed of Indian life as elements in the film. Every time they turned around there was something unfamiliar, remarkable and new to see; if they could, they worked it in. This isn't navel-gazing (though there's that) but also discovery and wonderment. It's partly a homage to Anderson's fascination with India and admiration for Jean Renoir's 'The River' and the films of Satyajit Ray. The soundtrack isn't just sweet Seventies rock but music from Ray's classics.Every Anderson film is about families (and his crew and casts are like family); this one is mostly, of course, about sibling relationships. Wes wrote the screenplay together with Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, who're both cousins, and old friends of his?and hence like brothers, paralleling the film's three. They also went to India and took a trip before the writing, living the experience before they made it into a screenplay.'Darjeeling's' trio of obviously privileged sons have been estranged for a year, since their father's death?which their mother, Patricia (Angelica Houston), now in a convent near the Himalayas, chose not even to attend. (There's a flashback of the brothers en route to the funeral, with Barbet Schroeder as a German mechanic.) Francis, the eldest, has summoned Jack and Peter to this Indian train voyage as a way of bonding, and at the same time seeking spiritual enlightenment.But before we get to that, there's a kind of pendant, called 'Hotel Chevalier,' which sometimes will be shown with 'Darjeeling,' sometimes not. It's a ten-minute film with Jason Schwartzman and Nathalie Portman. And it's a perfect little film in its way. Schwartzman is already Jack, though the film was completed a year earlier. He's enjoying solitary luxury in a nice Paris hotel, when his girlfriend (Portman), also estranged, turns up. Jack, who likes to go barefoot and wear expensive suits, is a writer, and this sequence comes up in 'Darjeeling' as a short story he's working on. 'Hotel Chevalier' is a bridge into the full-length film, and was also a way for Schwartzman to readjust to working with Anderson as an actor after the long interlude since 'Rushmore.'Everyone is damaged. We know how actually damaged Owen Wilson is from the news of his recent suicide attempt; and Anderson's comedies are perennially tinged with melancholy and dysfunction. Francis (Wilson) arrives with his head all bandaged up from a terrible motorcycle accident. Peter (Brody?the only Anderson newcomer among the principals) is running away from the pregnancy of a wife he regrets marrying. Jack is pining for the girlfriend of Hotel Chevalier, who has apparently slept around. She can't commit to him and he can't give her up. The brothers stop at temples and see sights and shop?for Indian medicines to get high on; poisonous snakes; pepper spray. The men are bossed around by the train's chief steward (Waris Ahluwalia), and Jack has a quick affair with a stewardess, Rita (Amara Karan), whom the others know as the sweet lime girl. Francis, who bosses his other brothers around, also has a secretary and planner, Brendan (Wally Worodarsky) who prints up and laminates little copies of their itinerary, which changes from day to day, and has such tasks as keeping track of the brother's extensive array of custom Marc Jacobs Vuitton luggage, which belonged to their father, and finding adapter plugs. Brendan eventually defects, but Francis hopes to lure him back.The brothers effect a rescue of some boys in a capsized raft near a waterfall; but the boy Peter tries to rescue doesn't survive, and they all go to the funeral. They weren't going to go and see their mother, but they do; Huston gives an especially strong performance. A ceremony to celebrate their bond and spiritual union goes wrong, but later they do it again. And this time it works. The movie begins with Bill Murray (Steve Zissou in Anderson's last outing) who runs after the train and misses it. The throwing away of the baggage is perhaps a little too obvious a symbol.. Maybe the rescue episode feels contrived and emotionally detached.Either you like Wes Anderson or you don't, no doubt. But if you share my impression that he's one of the most important American filmmakers of his generation, his new film is obviously essential viewing. It looks like this time has gone better than the last, even if Nathan Lee is right in saying it's more "a companion piece to 'Tenenbaums' than a step in new directions." It will be nice if a lot of people get to see it proceeded by 'Hotel Chevalier' (which, anyway, will be on the DVD). The New York Film Festival 2007 has chosen 'The Darjeeling Limited' for their opening night film. This is a new direction for Anderson, which is to just let things be, or, as Francis says in dictating the course of their journey, to "say yes to everything." To try to, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch it carefully from the beginning with no preconception or bias the movie has immense subliminal humour and relaxation effect. It puts you in a pleasant stoned-like state if you watch it on a Friday after a hearty dinner:) Of all the movies I've seen this one doest it for me. You feel like buying a ticket - and going on a trip of your own. I do not like most of the actors but they have natural humour and played so brilliantly that I forgot the gripe. The movie does not force a sense of anything - you listen to the sounds of nature, the rural and the industrial landscape. The soundtrack is perfect. The 3 main characters are not successful or content with their lives yet they are forced to go on a "spiritual" journey because they once agreed to it (brothers). I imagine it is hard to market a situational comedy these days a la Wes Anderson, Cohen brothers, Jim Jarmusch with so many fast-paced bubblegum-plot flicks spewed by the industry. This plot would sound stupid if I hadn't known a family that did the same back when I was a kid.</fullReview>

They are empty characters that are never fleshed out and the drugs don't add any dimension to it either. It just falls flat.I had high hopes for this movie and am deeply disappointed to have watched such a waste of resources on such great actors.The pretentious feeling of Life Aquatic is still there but this time no Bill Murray to save the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a very good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>99.9% of the time I do not like to comment about films I have seen that I do not like; however, this weird film is the exception that proves the proverbial rule. Dargeeling was not so much a bad film, meaning the production qualities were poor, as a film that should just have missed being given financial backing.Spending two hours watching a film about three American guys who I would never consider sharing a meal with is not terribly productive or interesting and therefore not even remotely pleasurable. A movie must contain at least an element of civility about the characters in order for me to devote time to its watching; unfortunately, Darjeeling contained no one, save the Indians themselves, who even came close. Even the mother, after her appearance, failed to be of the slightest interest. The most interesting people in the entire movie were the train conductor and his girl friend and you must worry about her because of her attraction, regardless of how minimal, to Schwartzman's character, Jack.I guess if you do not mind watching three American moronic losers despoiling the beautiful country of India while ostensibly trying to "find themselves" is your choice for spending three hours of time, then this is your movie.If, as Total Film writes on the advert, it is "Funny, Smart and Poignant" then my definitions of those words have been wrong since primary school all those years ago because I found the film to be just the opposite.I fully admit to not knowing about the production dimension of movie making but Wes Anderson's talents have alluded me: the plot was nonexistent, the camera shots were ill defined, and Hotel Chevalier is not a "delectable appetizer" but a moribund beginning to a moribund main feature.I am the wrong generation for Dargeeing Limited; maybe if some other nationality had made it the film would have been a better way to spend the afternoon. Hollywood can't do it though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, on paper, an interesting concept, and a solid, reliable cast was brought together. Nothing wrong with the locations. But what in the world happened during the filming of this movie? It is an example of one of the worst-case scenarios of best-laid plans gone terribly wrong. Oh, well, even the best ideas sometimes suffer from poor execution. The plot was thin, basically non-existent, and the acting was surprisingly flat. The directing was mediocre at best. The editing was choppy, and the acting may have suffered from poor directing and the near absence of plot, and an uninspired screenplay. There was not one funny scene. Not even one scene worth watching, with the possible exception of the "surprise" appearance of Bill Murray missing the train. But that was at the very beginning, and everything else went nowhere or downhill from there. A remarkably disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What in the name of Slumdog Millionaire is this? Mind you, I loved Rushmore, but Oh Lord! How do you screw up a cast like this? And how do you misuse Bill Murray by just letting him run for a train he clearly won't catch? The Whitman brothers reunite after a year of estrangement on a train in India of all places. Francis is the oldest bro with his face banged up pretty badly, creating itineraries on what to do, what to see, etc. on the trip and intent on staying on schedule, all the while it's all a plan for the three of them to reunite with their mother who abandoned them after their father died (not even attending the funeral) to be some nun in a quasi church/ashram/temple/somethingorother. Peter is the middle bro whose about to be a father and not too keen about it, tends to steal things like Francis' belt, hangs on to his dead father's things, and buys a cobra for...I have no friggin idea why. Jack is the youngest still hung up on a ex-girlfriend back in Paris, but has no problem having a quickie with Rita, the stewardess on the train. After all their secrets come out, getting thrown off the train, trying to rescue some kids but one unfortunately dies, attending the funeral, and finally seeing runaway delusional mom who apparently has no interest in her sons' lives, abandons them yet again that the brothers leave on another train to, I guess, sort out their lives.I have no clue what the point of the film was, but all I got out of it was this: if your an adult and your surviving parent decides to run away to join some ashram/cult/whatever instead of attending the dead spouses' funeral, forget searching for them, just cut your loses and move on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a funny comedy, something with a little higher standard as the typical ben stiller comedy. The promising lineup with some serious comedy-stars like Owen Wilson (Shanghai Noon) or Bill Murray (Ghostbusters) gave me the hope for two hours of classy entertainment.My hope has been smashed in to pieces, before the movie even begun. The pre-movie or the part 1 of the film, call it how you like, was extremely boring. Despite it contains a nude scene with Natalie Portman, i wouldn't rate it worth seeing. The Story makes absolutely no sense, neither the dialogs do.And like this, it goes on and on, you get no informations about the characters, you don't get to know, why the travel trough India by train. Not until the End is in sight, you get a little involved into the past. But in all those snatches of the past, you're not able to get a clue what this is all about. For me, the story was either absent or at least unbelievable lame.So, the Jokes sadly were lame too. The only funny thing in the movie, i can remember, is the stereotype of the annoying German tourists. The rest? Forget about it, i bet you will have more fun, watching the sales counter of a random junk food restaurant.My conclusion: I suggest you, to safe your money and your time and to choose another movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Three Stooges meet The Guru Pitka</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Whitman brothers haven't seen each other in over a year. Francis (Owen Wilson) invites his brother Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schartzman) on a cross-country train trip through the heartland of India in order to reconnect, bond and find themselves on a spiritual level. That's their internal arc. The external arc is to reunite with their mother who is now working as a nun in a convent at the "foot of the Himalayas".The Darjeeling Limited is actually a run-down train, the kind you would find in just about any third world landscape. The Darjeeling Limited (the Movie) attempts to mix farce with scenes of dramatic pathos unsuccessfully. For most of the movie, the three brothers are depicted as losers with a ton of emotional baggage, unable to resolve grudges they hold from an unfulfilled childhood. Unlike the Three Stooges (who mainly depended on quirky physical routines), there's little to distinguish the three witless Whitmans. Francis is the goofy businessman who spends most of the movie with his head wrapped in bandages after getting into a motorcycle accident prior to hooking up with his brothers; Peter is ostensibly running away from the responsibilities of adulthood as his wife is now 7 ? months pregnant back home; and Jack is a struggling writer with a propensity for casual sex (he easily beds a stewardess on the train). Note there is a 13 minute short film on the DVD entitled "Hotel Chevalier" which illustrates the ending of Jack's pretentious novel.Act I concerns the brothers' unfunny vignettes aboard the Darjeeling Limited. The main bit concerns their smuggling a poisonous snake aboard the train which almost gets them thrown off by the conductor. Eventually, Peter accuses Francis of being an "Indian giver" after he takes back an expensive belt he had given him earlier. They get into a physical altercation which spills out into the passenger section. This finally gets the hapless siblings thrown off the train in the middle of nowhere.Act II switches to a rural Indian area where the brothers witness the capsizing of a raft manned by a group of boys. The brothers jump into the river, save two of the children but are unable to save a third. The brothers are about to take a bus but are suddenly invited by the villagers to attend the boy's funeral. Obviously, this is the scene where the brothers are supposed to 'grow up' and the audience is supposed to sympathize with them. In better screenplays, moments of sympathy for the protagonists come much earlier (usually at the beginning of the story). Here, the rescue of the children occurs at the midpoint of the film and it seems out of place with Act One's slapstick tone.Act III reunites the brothers with their mother, the nun in the convent played by Anjelica Huston. There's a lame joke about an escaped tiger eating one of the nun's brothers followed by the mother making breakfast for the brothers and then disappearing. Unperturbed, the brothers go up to the mountain and bond with one another. The final scene reprises the first: the brothers just miss the departing Darjeeling Limited and must jump on board just as the train pulls out of the station.The performances here are uniformly forgettable. The usually grim Adrien Brody should be singled out for proving that he's unfit for comedy. The leering Jason Schwartzman does his Ron Jeremy imitation and Owen Wilson takes a pratfall or two. Finally, there's the director, Wes Anderson, who must be castigated not only for his self-indulgence but for having a sense of humor that is thoroughly juvenile in tone and scope. Let's hope that some of the film's bloated budget went to helping some of the indigent local population who assisted the crew while working on this film. The true star of this misguided production was the Indian countryside and its people whose earnestness is contrasted with the shallowness of the film's creators.</fullReview>

Let's wrestle for a bit and then go to the dining car. Shall we let the audience go home now. Sure why not. They already paid.

		<fullReview>"The Train to Darjeeling" starts with a brilliant scene, where a tourist in India played by Bill Murray dashes towards the station in an attempt to catch the Darjeeling Limited train. Ultimately he fails, but just before the train chugs out of sight he is overtaken by Peter (Adrien Brody), who is quick and young enough to scramble onto the last carriage, thus making the trip. This signifies the end of the movie for Murray (save for a brief cameo in the denouement) and subversively introduces the true protagonists of the tale. Peter has come on-board to meet his two brothers: the ever-planning all-controlling Francis (Owen Wilson) and the more reclusive Jack (Jason Schwartzman). Together they plan to venture to find their mother (Anjelica Huston), now leading a monastery in northern India. Along the way they are sure to witness a myriad of goofiness, eccentricity and quirky events, undeniably self-regarding, coupled with issues of abandonment and sentimentality, as this is a true Wes Anderson movie.The opening scene basically underlines what this movie is: a collage of great scenes, but patched together by typical quirk-heavy Wes Anderson fare. Despite a great admiration for the moments on offer, the overall content and premise lingers obtrusively for the runtime. A supposed spiritual journey derailed by petty matters, but somehow still ends with a revelatory conclusion (as the heroes 'cast away their baggage'). The story crafted around peculiar incidents and focused on supposed character peculiarity needs appropriate viewers, whilst Anderson's trademarks are invariably unconvincing, somewhat repulsive and overly contrived.The plasticine aesthetic of Anderson's dreamworld does have some charm, but lack the subtle content to complete the picture. Nonetheless in this 'hate him' affair "The Darjeeling Limited" has enough awkward charm and lingering emotionality to actually make it likable and arguably the most accessible of Anderson's creations. Occasionally amusing, elsetimes emotionally involving, most times however only niggled at my interest - lacking any effervescence it is overwhelmingly melancholic, almost on the verge of inducing sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely NOT Wes Anderson's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have really enjoyed the directors' previous work. The Darjeeling Lmtd does bring some of the same, strong characteristics of his previous films... good music... great color... interesting characters... where this one falls short, is on the comedy-meter. It's just not as funny, nor is this one as inventive with it's editing or as upscale in it's production/editing value. I enjoyed Life Aquatic...and loved Rushmore...but this one, quite honestly, bored me. I really struggled to get through it. Sure, it has it's quirky, funny moments.. ...but the story is just too slow moving and doesn't have near the energy of his other films. It's kind of stagnant. I REALLY wanted to like this... i was really looking forward to it... but I can't give it a recommendation and I'm a little surprised at it's score here. I'm sure some fans will disagree, but I think this is carved at the bottom of the Wes Anderson totem pole. Where I can see some Wes Anderson fans enjoying this... those who haven't liked his previous work, or have been split, will absolutely hate it. 52/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darjeeling Limited will please fans of the director, but not much else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited-**1/2-Worthwhile- Directed by: Wes Anderson. Written by: Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola, Jason Schwatrzman. Starring: Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Adrien Brody, Anjelica Huston, Amara Karan, Wallace Wolodarsky, Waris Ahluwalia, Irfan Khan, Barbet Schroeder, Camilla Rutherford, Bill Murray.Director Wes Anderson continues his trend of original, droll comedies with yet another original comedy about three brothers that go to India to reunite and reconcile their relationship with each other and their eccentric mother (Huston in a funny role). Along the way, they build trust and keep secrets from each other.Anderson is a clever storyteller with lots of resourceful and creative visuals that reflect his ability as a filmmaker. His humor is droll as always and contains witty dialogue that holds our attention in unison with the clever visual effects. Anderson establishes himself as always within his films and remains uncompromising in his storytelling with lots of social satire and brotherly love thrown in for good measure.The only flaw with this film is the fact that there is no story here other than a good idea with a lot of great looks and style. That is Anderson's main weakness as a writer/director is his lack of a compelling story to place all his talent into. The film's length reflects that flaw at 91 minutes and still feels a bit longish in the whole scheme of things. I respect the ideas of the movie and the cinematography's smart and appealing look, but I cannot justify style over story even with such a talented filmmaker like Anderson behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this, basically based on the other IMDb ratings - after all, seven out of ten!! I kept waiting for it to get interesting, in vain.I can't complain about the acting - when the script is so absolutely boring, it's hard to fault the actors. Sure, they were believable - as a trio of extremely boring siblings. If you ask me to summarize the plot - well, they took a train ride. They got there. Nothing happened.Was there a love interest? I have no idea. Why did the brothers not get along? No idea. They probably bored each other too much. Did they reconcile? Well, that was left out, also.My one positive statement - pretty scenery.I won't call this movie a train wreck - a wreck would have at least made it a bit more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell was that??? Was that supposed to be a comedy? This movie is one of the stupidest movies, if not the stupidest, I have ever seen. I've seen the rest of Wes's movies and while they are usually not very good, this was definitely the worst. There was really no humor in the entire film. I could care less about any of the characters, they were all extremely blah. After getting done with the movie, I just wanted to take a gun to my head. Luckily, I can go watch awesome, quirky, wonderful comedies like Scrubs and Arrested Development to ease my pain. I'm not really sure what else to say about this mess, but I really want to let people know how truly awful it is so they can avoid at all cost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of Wes Anderson, I thought the Royal Tenenbaums was great and Rushmore and Life Aquatic were at least intriguing, but The Darjeeling Limited is a pointless, shapeless thing that sucked up and hour and a half of my life and left me with nothing. It's never terrible. The acting is good, it's a nice looking movie and it works very well and an India travelogue, but it just seems so utterly pointless. The characters aren't especially interesting or compelling and the plot is just a bunch of stuff loosely strung together. I was tempted to give up on this movie an hour in but I wound up sticking with it to the end, which I regret. The best I can say for it is, it's short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes is really one of my favorite directors, so this review can and will be a really partial, so take that in account.In "The Darjeeling Limited" Wes continues to work around family issues and bonding, so if you liked The Royal Tenenbaums like me, it will grow into you too. It presents the story of three brothers that meet again and travel to India in some kind of spiritual pilgrimage after not speaking to each other for a long time given certain events.The movie dissects the fraternal relationship between them and links smoothly to their parents, their personalities are well defined and its development can be easily spotted along the movie. Soundtrack is superb and shooting locations are really interesting, however India and its culture could be more well explored, movie itself creates a beautiful but shallow picture of the country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was watching this movie and all I was thinking was: "WOW", "BEAUTIFULL" &amp; sometimes a "HUH?" ran trough my mind. I always enjoyed Wes Anderson movies, but this one really made me love him. These actors really felt like stages in my life. (I liked Owen Wilson very much while growing up, a couple of years later I LOVED Adrien Brody for his part in "The Expiriment" and Jason Swartzman recently for "Saving Mr. Banks") The composition, lighting, directing, moving, talking, silences,... I liked every single bit of this movie. And they never stopped focusing on that style. They never lose it like in a lot of other movies. I've downloaded this one, but as soon as I'll find this one on DVD I'll buy it IMMEDIATELY! Just like I've did with "The Grand Budapest Hotel". Wes Anderson became an Inspiration to me, and if someone won't understand why, I'll make them watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too old now but if I had to do it all over again I'd take a long train ride on a luxury train in India. A train that stopped at interesting places and gave it's passengers time to explore. This movie was damn interesting and it romanticized India! I was entertained throughout and eventually bought the movie on DVD for a few more viewings, I'm done with it now as I've virtually memorized it at this point. There were scenes that I found myself literally howling with laughter, for the first few viewings, and now I no longer laugh so I'm clearly done with the movie. However I actively seek out Wes Anderson films as they are so different from the usual fare, campy films with legs! I recommend this film to anyone with a heart and a brain! If you lack either give it a skip, you won't get it nor will you enjoy it! By the way Bill Murray has a great cameo! Oh I almost forgot I met Jai Prakash Sharma, the chief priest of the Jain Temple at Ranakpur (Ranakpur is one among the most famous Jain Temples to visit. Ranakpur is easily accessed by road from either Jodhpur or Udaipur), Jai also had a cameo in the movie. Jai was the passenger on the bus after the village funeral who asked Owen Wilson's character the question; "What brings you to this place?"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darjeeling Limited is like black coffee; an acquired taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will spare the spoilers or even the summary because reviews should not equate plot summary. The truth is, you have to have a taste for Wes Anderson for this film. I personally enjoy every second, but the plot is slow and has little direction, it's not bad, but I see how some claim to get lost or bored. You simply must enjoy the journey following 3 people in a direction they and you don't know where it will lead. And though I find the story interesting, humorous, and special, it may not relate to others in the same fashion. The humor is quick, dry, subtle and sometimes dark; the jokes are short and the majority of the humor lies within the repetitiveness of the characters individual traits (ex: Jack's "the story is fiction" slogan). It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But if it is your style, it may be your favorite Anderson film, like it is mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "delight" and gentle, touching farce set in India...do watch it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited (2007)A slow easy funny ride. It parodies a spiritual journey but in some ways it is also a genuine one. Three brothers?Americans with lots of personal issues?are on a colorful slow train in India. They have met up after their father's death to presumably (possibly) find their mother who has joined an obscure convent.It's endlessly delightful and wry?comical in a happy, charmed way. Of course, this is a Wes Anderson film. Think of a slightly more grounded "Budapest Hotel" or a less fanciful "Moonrise Kingdom" (to name two of his films). Anderson is a true auteur director?there is no mistaking his movies, and that's a good thing. Stylized, colorful, filled with whim and whimsy, improbable but also tinged with a reality that matters, too. So expect a series of odd, winking events that have strains of serious inquiry behind them, at least a little. That is, it's not total farce. But it's not a demanding movie at all, despite the possibilities. It's fun and bright and endlessly curious. And pretty. As usual, Anderson's set designer was given free reign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Local, Not an Express.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three brothers (Wilson, Schwartzman, and Brody) travel to India to seek out their mother, who has become a nun in a small village in the foothills of the Himalayas. They are searching for the reason she didn't attend their father's funeral. That's not all they're searching for.The movie reminds me of something that might have been made in the mid-1960s when cinematic conventions were being discarded and the possibilities of the art explored. In the old days, we saw a man sitting in a chair, heard a knock at the door, and saw him look up, there would be a cut to the door opening. Here, the man looks up and there is a sluggish pan to the door, the shot covering a lot of humdrum space. In the old days, when three guys ran to catch a departing train, they really ran. Here, they run is slow motion and throw away their luggage or -- adding some symbolic weight to those shed suitcases -- their "baggage".Lots of nice location shooting of some of the more arid parts of the subcontinent, mostly the Northwest. Camels, colorful wardrobes, quirky Sikh railway conductors, a beautiful girl who is perfectly willing to accommodate a man in the rest room but at their next meeting rebuffs his attempt at a kiss. Sometimes it's a little amusing, sometimes, as at a funeral, it tugs at our compassion. Mostly it's in between and it barely held my interest.Obviously the three men are on some sort of spiritual quest. They do some praying, burn incense, and do some sort of unexplained mystic Tai Chi exercises for no particular reason. I didn't get it. It can't be that I'm not spiritual enough because I am convinced there is some cosmic force at work -- call it what you will -- or why do my T shirts always come out of the laundry inside out? The performances can't be criticized, partly because so little in the way of skill is called for. The dialog tends to be delivered flatly and facial expressions are minimalist. I couldn't really find any flaws in the direction either. I just wondered where this thing was going because, whatever its destination, it seemed to be taking forever to get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Wes Anderson movie to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read several dozen reviews and let me just dispel a few misconceptions. The brothers are NOT on a spiritual quest. Two of them are basically tricked into going on a pretense set up by Francis (the oldest). Francis wants to find their mother who did not attend the funeral of her husband (their father) the year before. They do however end up spiritually enhanced by the end, finding peace within themselves, and each other. The moment actually happens at the funeral of a local village boy, not as they are racing for the train. Bill Murray ... I thought this was a fantastic way to introduce a new character into the Wes Anderson line up. Bill did not miss the train, he missed the movie! Who beats him onto the train? Adrien Brody does. This is a great little joke for all those Anderson movie fans. When Murray tells the train ticket cashier, "That's my train", he is really saying, "that's my movie"! He misses both, and I thought it was hilarious.Anderson has really hit his stride with this film, and folks either get it, or they don't. His slow motion tactics work perfectly when employed, and his musical selections are as good as always. The cinematography is visually stunning and first rate.I look forward to many more entertaining films from the Anderson cadre of actors/writers. Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman are truly gifted talents, and the collaboration works well. I hope Adrien Brody continues to be included in any subsequent films as he was a nice surprise. Hopefully Natalie Portman will be also.One bit of trivia: Jason's character (Jack) goes through both Part 1 (Hotel Chevalier) and the Darjeeling Limited completely bare foot. Nice touch.This movie is a gem and a real keeper. If you get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brothers seem like strangers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy doesn't exactly reach the dark side, but may be a little irritating more than anything. Three American brothers, Francis(Owen Wilson), Peter(Adrien Brody) and Jack(Jason Schwartzman), meet for the first time a year after their father's funeral. They meet on The Darjeeling Limited, a train that travels through India. The brothers seem to know very little about each other, but Francis is sure this a good way to get into each others life. The whole trip is regimented by Francis, who has plotted the trip almost down to the minute. The brothers are not just annoying each other; they are actually thrown off the train... luggage and all in the middle of a desert. Somehow this journey ends up being an uninvited reunion with their mother(Anjelica Huston). This whole trip was planned by Francis hoping for a spiritual self-discovery. Wilson for sure has the ability to wreck your last nerve. In cameo roles are Natalie Portman and Bill Murray.The soundtrack holding the story together is a fusion of Indian compositions and tunes by The Kinks, The Rolling Stones and the quirky, but enjoyable "Where Do You Go To(My Lovely)" by Peter Sarstedt.</fullReview>

And what a waste of India! Did they really film this in India? Most of it was so overlit they may as well have been on a Hollywood backlot. And where were all the people? The animals ? The scenery?

		<fullReview>To me - and I know many, many people will disagree - Wes Anderson is another one of those directors whose movies I only like one of - I actually quite enjoyed The Life Aquatic (mostly because of Bill Murray and the quality stop-motion animation), but that's it. Everything else he does is just irritatingly boring, dull and completely unfunny. I've tried to like his movies, but I just can't. I hate directors whose movies are odd for the sake of being odd, and not because it's funny or it makes sense; it's just downright pretentious. He's not even weird or odd in a good way like David Lynch. Some might argue that his humour is too sophisticated or high-brow for my caveman mind, fair enough, I'm just here to speak my mind. This review is applicable to all Wes Bentley films (except Aquatic), so hopefully I won't have to keep repeating myself. Oh, another thing; I absolutely can't stand Jason Schwartzman!

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson in India</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson is one of those filmmakers that creates strong feelings. There are about three current opinions on him; One, he's the single greatest American filmmaker alive today, Two, he's a pretentious hack , or Three, he's a heart breaker who used to have so much promise but hasn't made a good film since Rushmore, or The Royal Tenenbaums. Holders of the last opinion tend to be the loudest because they feel betrayed. They loved those early movies and everything after is just a pale comparison or a slap in the face. They look like Wes Anderson movies, They sound like Wes Anderson movies, but they're awful. They aren't funny, they're too long, and they don't have any point. Like the Pavement fan who wished they released more songs like Cut Your Hair and fewer like Brinx Job, they're angry that Anderson seems to now be making navel gazing exercises for no one else but himself and a few of his hipster friends. He's committing the worst artistic crime, not being untalented, but not living up to the talent you have.The Darjeeling Limited isn't going to change anyone's opinion. For the lovers, he can do no wrong, for the haters, he can do no right, and for the broken-hearted, its one more broken heart. This isn't Rushmore. So what is it? Let's leave the lovers and haters behind for a minute and look at the film on its own.The Darjeeling Limited is the story of three estranged brothers trying to reconnect on a long train ride through India, with the possibility of reaching their mother at the end of the line. But this isn't a plot driven movie, it's a film that plays to the senses. Visually, it's absolutely stunning. The colours and images are indelible. Like Renoir's images of the Ganges in The River, a film which is felt throughout The Darjeeling Limited, Anderson captures the vibrancy of India. Or at least the India of films. Anderson's films are never concerned with reality, but with a fairytale world where everyone speaks like a character in a novel, and every room looks like a painting. This is India is seen through the eyes of the West, a foreign, exotic place where lost souls (called Whitmen) can find themselves among the saris, spices, and mountains.It isn't a negative thing- Anderson's New York is just as mythical- just business as usual. As a result, the story loses some of its emotional heft amid the, breathtaking colour, set decoration, and stylized line readings, but it doesn't matter. These things make the movie. The story is long and meandering, but so is the train ride, and so is life. It's the small joys, tragedies, and weird moments that happen to us in life but we notice more when we travel that this movie is about.As someone who has lived in another country for the last few years, the way that the characters experienced India and the way Anderson filmed it resonated with me. For the people that live there, these small events and beautiful views are just part of the rhythm of daily life, but for the traveler, the viewer, or three wounded brothers searching for spiritual meaning, they are magical. That feeling of wonder and reexamination of the everyday is what people have been going to India for years for and what the film is trying to capture. If you allow yourself to accept the pace and rhythms it's a pleasant way to spend a few hours. Just like a train ride. The three brothers never really appreciate where they are until they throw away the past and throw themselves into India. At the start, Owen Wilson's character says, It's the same thing with The Darjeeling Limited. The movie works to the degree that you surrender to it. It isn't Bottlerocket, or Rushmore, or The Royal Tennebaums, but it's beautiful, rich, and strange. It's a Wes Anderson movie, and one of his best.</fullReview>

I think that something is rotten in the world if people finance this incredible show of nonlogical and abusive actions. I feel as abused as if some stranger slap my son in the face without reason. I hated other movies in the past, but none has ever reached this huge difference about money spent in the making, with such a good result in artistic imagery, and this low point in morality, stupidity, praise of stupidity, etc. etc. Well, as you may have noticed, I didn't like it, and I hope that the disgust for this lack of smartness and morality is shared by the majority of viewers. The votes are saying the opposite, so I am going to bed with a little discomfort about my fellow human beings.

		<fullReview>From the point of view of a Wes Anderson fan, I thought this was an absolutely wonderful picture. There isn't anything bad at all I had to say about it when I got out of the theater. In retrospect, I have to admit that the film was very deliberate (or slightly contrived to use a less favorable term), but that is Wes Anderson's style so that is what I was expecting. What I wasn't expecting is how well the narrative, the music and the cinematography flowed together. Everything really gelled; it was seamless. It was so seamless that I didn't even notice how deliberate it was. I can't say that I felt that way about any other of Anderson's films. It definitely feels like he is maturing as a filmmaker and he is choosing his material better in the editing room. This is my second favorite Anderson film, right behind Rushmore, followed closely by Bottle Rocket and the other two are a toss-up for fourth place. I really hope this starts playing outside of New York so that the rest of the country can see it. Oh! and the soundtrack is amazing! Really great Bollywood film stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit to having trouble in appreciating the films of Wes Anderson It's not that I don't like "quirky": it's just that his movies appear to be so self-consciously quirky that they don't feel as if they have anything to say about real life. 'The Darjeeling Limited' is about a trio of American brothers who travel to India on a personal quest, but it's a film that say's nothing of relevance about either America or modern day India; Anderson even seems to be admitting this himself when, for example, he has a ticket clerk on India railways speaking in a perfect American accent - is this genuinely quirky, or just an admission that the film is distinctive only through including what we have good reason not to expect? Owen Wilson plays much the same role he played in 'Bottle Rocket'; the usually great Aidrien Brody is wasted. Of course, there are funny moments, but there's the overwhelming feeling here of a film that's trying far too hard not to be real. A movie this daft needs to be funnier, instead, it feels like the work of a film-maker too much in love with himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson films are required viewing for the hipster crowd, and regardless of whether or not the movie's any good, it'll make money from the cult following. But coming out of DL, I feel like I'm a victim of marketing. A film needs more than some critically-acclaimed actors, a cameo Bill Murray appearance, a retro soundtrack, and some bright colors to impress me.Don't get me wrong - I'm a fan. But I'm seeing a disturbing trend. What made the original "indie" films so successful was a good juxtaposition of all of these elements, along with an ensemble cast of characters who were quirky and likable yet flawed. The characters in DL are flawed but not particularly likable, beyond possessing the faces of actors who we already know and love. None of their quirks are very enduring, none of their actions are very interesting, and their relationships are mystifying. While we do eventually get some insight into why they are the way they are, some of the details of their important relationships are never explored. Are we expected to take everything at face value? I think comedy is at its best when the characters are relatable, and I just can't relate.I found most of the soundtrack - particularly the first "short" at the beginning of the movie - terribly annoying, as if the bottom of the barrel is being scraped for retro tunes, which I know can't be true. The movie mostly lacks any semblance of symbolism, except for one moving scene, which is fairly isolated from the rest of the story. Bill Murray is on screen for a good 2 minutes in a completely insignificant role, seemingly added for fanservice purposes only.This movie's been done before, and better. Others may be captivated by style alone, but to establish longevity of the genre, substance will need to evolve as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went by the votes on IMDb which seem to be majorly rigged. This was the most boring &amp; foolish movie to start the year with. Owen Wilson is as usual irritating to the hilt. Being from India, I couldn't figure out what movie actually meant. They better not release this movie in India if they don't want people burning down their house. Funny it may sound but a train doesn't get lost in India. Why would Natalie Portman waste herself in such a juvenile attempt at humor? It was way below expectations. The director did use some props well in the movie. They looked more like additions from Actors themselves. Less spoken about Owen Wilson, the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Owen Wilson doesn't have a particularly wide range as an actor. He's always been the mild mannered, genteel fellow who might try to talk you out of a fight instead of punching back. Which I think makes him perfect for the role of Francis Whitman. It isn't until halfway into the film that we find out his is the big brother of the family, and yet he makes it obvious with every sly condescending remark, every controlling flick. The moderate delivery of Wilson's dialogue does not hide his selfishness, the size of his ego, his hypocrisy. But he is not overt about it, which adds an additional layer to his character. Later we see almost the exact same mannerisms in their mother; the talking on the other's behalf, the obsession with routine and agreement, the emotional bankruptcy. How might Francis have ended up with a different upbringing?Francis' 'plan' is full of contradictions from a man who is still grieving. He casually mentions he has brought along his assistant for the journey, complete with typewriter and laminator to constantly etch out and revise their itinerary. Such meticulousness is the complete antithesis of a spiritual journey of exploration and reawakening. Francis is in denial; like so many Anderson character before and after him, he wrests for control that isn't there, and lashes out at others for his own faults. When his expensive loafers are stolen, he yells out at no one in particular, hoping they will stop the rogue thief. Still, this pales in comparison to the communal anger at the grief and misunderstanding at the time of their father's death; a flashback reveals their shared tension, but instead of reconciliation, they have bottled up these emotions and pushed the slow release button that has lead them to this journey. No wonder they all do the ritual in their own way with careless abandon, and no wonder Francis is mad that they have not 'done it right'. When people talk about Wes Anderson, they point to his style, because it is the most immediately noticeably aspect of his films. And of course there are the inevitable complaints about the deadpan delivery of almost all his ensemble casts. What is remarkably impressive is how Anderson has maintained a steadfast dedication to the same basic stylistic concepts but continually evolved them within his films. The Darjeeling Limited is picturesque, no doubt about it. The exotic Indian splashes of red, orange and yellow create a very visually appealing and vivid palette. But he also weaves within an irony; the brothers are all so self-centred and consumed by their ennui (taken after their mother) that they are oblivious to the beauty around them. Francis is obsessed with getting each segment of his spiritual journey correct. Peter is struggling with the coming challenge of fatherhood, reluctantly. Jack's mind cannot wrest away from the romantic despair of his recent break-up. A specific aspect of his style that is often brought up is the immaculate symmetry in his compositions, and how he aligns the profiles of his characters perfectly so that they are staring straight on into the camera. He learned this from Ozu of course, who illustrated the quiet intimacy of Japan with his trademark tatami shot. Anderson evolves as an artist by not merely borrowing but subverting; in Tenenbaums, in Life Aquatic, and here, the characters speak directly to each others eyes, but might as well be a thousand miles apart. It is not until the letting go of their emotional baggage that the faux intimacy and beauty becomes true. Anderson starts with a riveting cameo from one of his favourites, Bill Murray. He shoots the intro like a tense action chase sequence, as though Murray was the main character, and has just missed a vital train that will derail the film's plot. Later, as we dolly through the train's compartments, we see him again, no longer rushing and running, but content. The story, and journey, comes full circle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Limits of Control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three estranged brothers, who parted ways after their father's premature death, try to reconnect on a train ride through India in this typically quirky Wes Anderson comedy. While the action mostly occurs aboard a moving train, the film still basks in India's natural beauty and the film has an innovative sound scope with local music softly playing in the background at several pivotal points. The film has a number of funny moments too, though Anderson also attempts to weave in a dramatic angle with less success. Owen Wilson has an interesting character as the most controlling brother, set on his siblings following a tight itinerary, but none of the brothers are really likable human beings (one has left his pregnant wife, another seduces what women he can find, the other is a control freak) and therefore it is difficult to care about their spiritual/emotional journey. The purpose of Bill Murray's character is highly questionable too, though his brief reappearance towards the end is great as the film takes the metaphorical nature of train compartments to unexpected heights. The vast majority of the film is not quite as solid though, and amusing as it is to see the three stars squabbling like little kids and spraying each other with mace, a premise of dysfunctional brothers alone is not quite enough to carry an entire film. For what its worth, Anderson recommends watching his prequel short film 'Hotel Chevalier' beforehand. It is not really necessary, but it is so wildly different in tone that it is almost worth seeing for what Anderson can do when he restrains his comedic vibe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is an amusing journey that is engaging, funny and heartfelt, and features 'Wes Anderson's' immaculate and whimsical visuals that draw you in completely into the world he creates. The plot of the movie revolves around three brothers who travel across India in an attempt to bond with each other and to re-discover their individual lives. I have not seen many 'Wes Anderson' films and the immediate thought that crossed my mind after watching this movie was that I HAVE to go and WATCH some of this director's work. I emphasize on the watch here because this movie is a visual masterpiece just like 'Anderson's' 'The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)'. All the attention to detail given to the visuals gives this movie a very surreal feeling, which is then balanced out by its eccentric but realistic characters. This contrast of visuals and characters is what makes 'The Darjeeling Limited' unique. I do, feel that the movie shines more visually than through its characters, but mainly it manages to balance these two aspects pretty well. The visuals, as I have said above, are truly amazing. The first thing I did after this movie ended was to check how 'Wes Anderson' manages to make his movie look so gorgeous. His production design, lighting, use of miniatures, handmade art direction, is so on-point in this movie that not a single frame looks imperfect. The overall cinematography by 'Robert Yeoman' and the direction of technical aspects by 'Anderson' are one of the best I have seen in sometime. These visuals give the movie its own persona and bring life to its settings and surroundings and just engage you so much that you want to just keep looking at the screen to notice this artful world. The movie, fortunately, also manages to create characters that are worth caring for. The major three characters in this movie are all pretty eccentric but have a lot of characteristics that would make you relate with them. The characters are written well (almost all characters have an arch) and performed very well by the cast. The supporting cast is effective with 'Wallace Wolodarsky' standing out the most with his very funny act as 'Brendan'. From the central cast, 'Owen Wilson' is the funniest and most engaging character of the three brothers. He is given some of the best dialogue in the movie and he delivers his lines with aplomb. 'Adrien Brody' is also very funny as 'Peter' although I wish his character was a bit more engaging. 'Jason Schwartzman' is probably the weakest character of the lot but still manages to do pretty well in his role. His story with an Indian girl (played well by 'Amara Karan') seems a tad of cliché and that just makes his character a little bit uninteresting compared to the other two. The biggest positive of these actors, however, is that they work really well together. The chemistry between the three brothers is really effective and you really feel this relationship as the movie progresses. The minor problems I have with The Darjeeling Limited have to do with its tonal inconsistencies and some of its music choices. The music, actually, for the most part is pretty effective and adds to the visuals of the movie. However, in some of the emotional scenes, the music seemed rather awkward and it took some of the emotion intensity out of the scenes. The other problem I had with the movie was that sometimes it felt tonally inconsistent. At times, the movie seemed to switch jarringly from comedy to drama and that reduced the impact of the comedy as well as the drama at those certain times just making the overall impact of the movie a little less than what it could have been.Overall, however, I see The Darjeeling Limited as a visually splendid experience with characters that are engaging enough to probably make you want to watch the movie more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a year since the funeral of their father. The three Whitman brothers haven't spoken with each other since then and meet up on the train "The Darjeeling Limited" in India. Francis (Owen Wilson) is heavily bandaged and organizing the trip. Both Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) have personal relationship problems. The brothers don't trust each other and have complicated relationships.I'm a good but not fanatical Wes Anderson admirer. I love his quirky unique style. Firstly, I love the Bill Murray cameo. It's a fun misdirect and shows Wes is playing with us. My problem with this movie is that I don't enjoy spending time with the three brothers. I have a real difficulty connecting with any one of them. I feel exactly like Rita when she asks "What's wrong with you?" They are an infuriating bunch. Like Rita, I want to like them but they make it extremely difficult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson's best (Only seen 3 of his films)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is now the 3rd Wes Anderson movie I have seen, the first two being the most recent Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel. While, I thought both those films were pretty good, I was not in love with them or Anderson like so many other movie fans (gave them both 3.5 stars). With this revisit of one of his older films I have come to the conclusion that I need to see more. The Darjeeling Limited while being mildly heavy handed at parts is a dryly hilarious and beyond charming film even with its pretty unlikable characters. My favorite Wes Anderson film uses some beautiful symbolism and comparisons of life to help these characters find themselves and their meanings of life.Check out some of my full reviews at: reviewsbycaleb.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterful Piece of Work from Wes Anderson,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast. It's a very artistic and well acted film, Wes Anderson hits it out of the park once again, he's a strange director and I find that I either love or hate his films, but this one is certainly one that I thoroughly enjoyed, the character development is outstanding and it is also very humorous at times. They gave Bill Murray a very small role in this movie that I found ridiculous, it serves as no importance to the story and was basically only there to tease us, I felt like a twist was coming that would connect him with the three leads, but that never came and left me disappointed, wondering why they put him in the movie in the first place. The three lead roles are outstanding, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman are all very believable as brothers, they all play off each other very well and the chemistry is evident throughout. Filled with great laughs and some very dramatic scenes, I would recommend the Darjeeling Limited to anyone looking for a good comedy or drama, but keep in mind Wes Anderson films are of very acquired taste. Three estranged brothers try to reconnect on a train journey across India. Best Performance: Jason Schwartzman Worst Performance: Anjelica Huston</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>three brothers, one on a spiritual quest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You either like Wes Anderson or you don't. He has a quirky sense of humor, demonstrated to great effect in "The Royal Tennenbaums" and "Rushmore." I can remember my first year in college going to a Woody Allen movie, Play it Again, Sam. Around me, people were doubled over in laughter. At the time, I just didn't get him. I do now. I think Wes has the same impact on some people.Three brothers - Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) - meet for a train trip across India. It is a year after their father died in what sounds like a terrible accident. Their mother didn't attend the funeral. The trip has been arranged by Francis, and he seems to be the only one who wants to be there. His face is bandaged from a terrible accident that was actually a suicide attempt, and he is hoping this will be a reconciliation for the brothers and a spiritual journey.The three overmedicate themselves on Indian pharmaceuticals, at times chugalugging a bottle of medicine. Jack has broken up with his girlfriend and has sex with one of the train's pretty attendants. Peter's wife, whom he had planned to divorce, is pregnant at home, giving birth in a few weeks, and he buys a poisonous snake. Later the snake escapes and they are thrown off of the train.Francis tells them eventually that they are going to see their mother (Angelica Huston) who lives in the Himalayas. Can these three men reconcile amidst a funeral they attend, a man-eating tiger, and a very big hill?This film is more subtle than the ones I mentioned above. Before the main film, there is a vignette with Schwartzman in a Paris hotel when his old girlfriend (Natalie Portman) arrives. This is a reference to "Hotel Chevalier," but I don't think you need to have seen it -- it gives some background into what's going on with the Schwartzman character.The beginning of the movie is pure Anderson with his quirky humor. It turns quite dark later on, and the ending is pure magic, quite beautiful. I'll be honest - it's not my favorite, but I certainly did enjoy parts of it. It did not hold together for me as it might have, however. For me, the only brother who registered much was the Wilson character, and Angelica Huston's character was well done, and she was just as you'd expect from a woman who had spent time in meditation in a peaceful land - centered, with a lot of self-knowledge, but separate from the world she left.I just don't know what happened to Adrien Brody's career. If you like Wes Anderson, I can tell you that you should like at least sections of this film. It's odd, but I for one can't deny Anderson's unique abilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful visual aesthetic but cold human drama and retreading old ground for this director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's 2007 film THE DARJEELING LIMITED deals with three brothers from New York reconciling after they meet up in India. Peter (Adrien Brody), Jack (Jason Schwartzman), and Francis (Owen Wilson) haven't spoken since their father's funeral a year before. After surviving a motorcycle crash, Francis has invited them to ride on a cross-country train known as the Darjeeling Limited, during which they are supposed to bond, reknit their ties, and find spiritual peace.The India depicted here is rather fictional. There are some indications that Anderson spent some time in India beforehand and knew the country, but the vision he wanted to bring to the screen was the secondhand India that Americans would know from old colonial-era reports like Rudyard Kipling and films from many decades ago. Furthermore, India is a pretty backdrop and a tool to help the three brothers find themselves, but no more. Even the main Indian actors here (two train attendants played by Waris Ahluwalia and Amara Karan) are people of South Asian descent brought from the US and England respectively, immediately obvious from their American and Londoner accents. It is disappointing that Anderson generally fails to engage with the nation he sets his story among, especially as he began work on the film in the wake of Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION, which had drawn similar criticism.But what of the drama between these three brothers? I found it difficult to be moved. At this point in his career, Anderson was rather stuck in a rut, retreading the same ground of family disharmony and deadpan responses to life's crushing blows. Where Anderson shines in spite of the disappointing script is his eye for detail, and his treatment of the film set almost as if it were a painstakingly created diorama. For the film, he had custom-designed such minutiae as the labels for a fictional Indian cough syrup, the brothers' set of vintage suitcases, and of course the film's eponymous train. The mise-en-sc?ne is invariably delightful; nearly every shot has some gorgeous play of colour or writing in perfectly proportioned fonts.With that visual richness but lame story, I cannot really recommend this film to a general audience, but it may be worthwhile for Anderson fans who have come to like his aesthetic from another film of his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under average adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-5/10The Darjeeling Limited is a comedy drama from acclaimed director and writer Wes Anderson about three brothers on a kind of spiritual journey through India on a train. I didn't enjoy it though and the lack of humour and real gripping story makes it rather passable in my opinion. It is overloaded with Andersons style and although he doesn't destroy it nor do a bad job, it just didn't work for me.The story is just too unfunny, don't get me wrong a lot happens and it can be exciting in a sense with everything they do, but as I say no jokes, and if there is any, they just don't make sense or work. I think although the writing isn't funny, it could also be claimed the directing also fails in the humour side and even the actors involved seem like there not in a comedy movie.The movie is strange, in a good way but in certain scenes it is over the top strange and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It could be said this is just quirky and I know for a fact that some people will love this in a kind of cult movie kind of way, but this just wasn't for me. I think again Anderson's style is just too much and because he uses his unique style, it feels wrong in this setting.Although I may seem negative it isn't all bad and I mean that, one point that really stands out whilst watching is the camera work and although done like Anderson usually always does, it is beautifully shot by cinematographer Robert Yeoman. It also has wonderful sets and of course the train scenes are not only well shot, beautifully crafted looking wise too, the miniature house like style of the sets is one of the remaining features that stay with you afterwards.Wes doesn't write it so well but he doesn't do a really bad bad job either here with the script working well for the more serious moments, but falling flat on the comedy side of things. The script is written by Anderson, Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman(who also stars as one of the brothers in the movie) and they all make a screenplay that doesn't balance out as I said, a bit more laughing kind of lines mixed with the emotional times would have made this much better.The directing is also the same case as with the script with Anderson failing to balance the emotion and comedy well creating either awkward scenes or parts where your not sure if that was meant to be a joke or not. I think the main cat do that a lot with Owen Wilson feeling as if he is there to provide comic relief, but actually ending up probably the least funny of the three brothers and Adrien Brody although acts well, also comes up slightly short.Overall I felt it to be a below par film and one that not only doesn't stand up on it's own feet, doesn't stack up well in the vast library of Wes Anderson movies either. I think as I said about the cult movie like feeling, many will and can enjoy it and parts can be interesting, and that's not to mention the absolutely beautiful setting of India also so all in all, enjoy the view definitely but really don't expect many laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly not a commercial prospect...but as a study of acting and film technique, pretty jazzy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer-director Wes Anderson co-wrote this screenplay about three brothers (estranged for a year after their father's funeral) taking a journey of re-discovery by train through India; halfway into the troubled jaunt, one of the men explains his impetus for the trip--to track down their mother who is apparently hiding out in an Indian church and calling herself Sister--which leaves the two other brothers fairly uneasy. Antagonistic, needling, and yet dryly resolved comedy-drama with artistic flourishes throughout and three quirky characters who grow on you. Owen Wilson does some of his best acting as the planner of the group, an obsessive-compulsive armed with an itinerary, covered with bandages from a mysterious motorcycle accident. Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman (another writer on the project, along with Roman Coppola) bristle at Wilson's inflexible planning, and yet their built-in brotherly rapport allows them to disagree without resorting to the standard movie put-downs. Brody, in particular, uses his lanky body to great advantage here; he isn't seen as the smoldering one, he doesn't trade on his handsomeness, but instead plays a nervous husband with a baby on the way who doubts his marriage (he never thought it would work, not from day one). The trio play off each other with marvelous accuracy and, although there aren't big laughs at every turn, the mood of the picture is sustained quite beautifully. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

And at the moment we meet native English speakers in India, we know we'd be in search on a spiritual plane and that there might be some drugs involved.This remains a mystery to me, why most of the Westerners think of visiting India as a spiritual journey.

In these days of hand-held and cameras that bob around endlessly I am eternally grateful there are still a few filmmakers like Anderson who know what a tripod is. I almost don't care about the content of a movie anymore as long as the camera is STILL.As for the movie, I enjoyed it. It's shallow but the visuals are stunning. This is a major travel-porn movie. Plus, I enjoyed every one of the performances. The cast was stellar, down to the smallest role. Sure it's about rich people who have the means to go "find themselves" while so many people don't, but I approached it in the same way one would approach one of those delightful singing/dancing comedies of the 1930s full of rich people who seemed oblivious to the fact that there was a depression on. Darjeeling is lovely escapism with just a touch of meaning and depth. I enjoyed the ride and was not bored. Ain't that what movies are about?</fullReview>

Things that are Dramatized in an Anderson Film barely seem to Register as Actually Happening, let alone being Dramatic. Even the Most Dramatic of Things like a Baby on the Way with the Father and Mother Teetering on Divorce, the Death of Their Father, or Mother becoming a Nun in India.The Three Brothers on this Trip (Owen Wilson, Adrian Brody, and Jason Schwartzman) are on Their Way to See Their Mother, who has Gone to a Catholic Convent in India.

Not if Your are Watching Without Expectations of Conventional Hollywood and Trendy Movie-Making.Overall, Like All of Wes Anderson Films there will be Loud Dissents and Even Louder Applause from Fans that, just Once in Awhile, just for a Change, Appreciate Things Like this.

		<fullReview>If this movie was something Wes Anderson had to get out of his system before he could make his perfect masterpiece ("Moonrise Kingdom"!), then so be it?we just didn't find it all that enjoyable to watch. In some ways, it plays like a road-company version of "Tenenbaums"?three damaged adult children trying to deal with the legacy of their distant, selfish parents (though we don't actually meet Dad this time). The Jason Schwartzman brother obsesses about women, the Adrian Brody brother obsesses about possessions (though he doesn't have much follow-through; he buys a cobra in a bazaar, then puts it in a shoeshine box it's sure to escape from), the Owen Wilson brother obsesses about their parents and the other brothers? The setups seem like they should be funnier than they are; the train crew gets lost in the desert of Rajasthan, and one of the brothers has to explain why that shouldn't happen if the train is still on the tracks. (If you don't like movies about rich, aimless white boys, then this one isn't for you.) Toward the end, WA tries to get a little character arc going?the bros get thrown off the DL and have to deal with a real-life emergency that isn't about them?but it's really too late for that, at least from the viewer's perspective. Great performances (I liked the scowling steward and the sultry tea hostess), great vistas (especially the view from the Himalayan mission station where Mom (Anjelica Huston again) has gone to escape from the rest of them), great cinematography, great soundtrack as always ?except for that one annoying song JS plays real loud on his Ipod during his tryst with Natalie Portman in the opening scene? Summing up?if you've seen "Moonrise Kingdom," "Rushmore" (on cable a lot these days) and "Tenenbaums" and you've still got a hankering?then by all means? I still haven't caught up with "Bottle Rocket," "Zissou," "Mr. Fox" or the new one about the hotel, and at this point, I'd have to spend more political capital than I possess to get them into our Netflix queue?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great look at family dynamics with a Wes Anderson flair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited isn't a movie that a lot of people talk about when it comes to Wes Anderson. I would dare its forgotten most of the time despite it having a big cast. It's a shame because it's definitely his most underrated film in his filmography despite it also having some problems.Good: The central plot involving the brothers was great. Brody, Wilson, and Schwartzman were great together and really played off each other like siblings. Their dialogue was funny and quick and the scenario brought a lot of insightful drama about family and spirituality. The movie looks gorgeous easily becoming one of Anderson's most deliciously beautiful films he's made thus far taking full advantage of the Indian landscape and culture.Bad: Like Steve Zissou, I felt the running time a bit seeing how it went on a bit too long. The last fifteen minutes or so I felt were tacked on and wasn't necessary per say in the story. I don't think the comedy really hits as much as his other films as well.Overall, I feel this is the Wes Anderson film I will like more the more times I watch it. Great acting and visuals with pacing issues, but still worth a watch if you are a Wes Anderson fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delight, But Not the Best of The Famed Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of Wes Anderson's slightly earlier films, The Darjeeling Limited (2007) did not exist in the director's now famous, aesthetically perfect, symmetrical style; however, I still found the film to be a delight. The story of three estranged brothers who have been reunited after the death of their father. Comedy ensues, as the three brothers are on The Darjeeling Limited, a train traversing India, to find themselves.The cast, led by Adrien Brody and Anderson alums: Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman, featured many interestingly flawed, hilarious and unforgettable characters. My favorite running joke took the form of a poisonous snake, which was smuggled onto the train and was almost grounds for getting the trio kicked off of their journey. The film had humor and it had heart, but it could have been more interesting. There were dry spells and some of the antics became old quickly. All-in-all I enjoyed the film, but it certainly was not one of Wes Anderson's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very Wes Anderson movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Version I saw: UK DVD releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 6/10Wes Anderson has a very wry, arch approach to making films. He uses the techniques of film-making - tracking shots, pans, set-building, choosing and scoring music, plotting and characterization - in a clownish, exaggerated way which is hilarious when done right, and he generally does it right. I have enjoyed his films ever since The Royal Tenenbaums in 2002, and have sought out those he made before that point too.The Darjeeling Limited is said to be his worst film by fans and skeptics alike, and I can see that point of view, but it's still a Wes Anderson movie, and his hallmarks are all there, making it enjoyable nonetheless.The film is all about accepting defeat, and learning that distance in relationships is not always a bad thing. Again, a very Wes Anderson, very post-modern message.In the meantime, The Darjeeling Limited is arguably his prettiest, most artistically photographed film, showcasing the Indian locations nicely. If you don't enjoy it for Wes Anderson's self-conscious quirkiness, you can enjoy it for that.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously i liked it. It has almost everything i seek when i am searching a film: it is smart, funny but with also a serious and even dark tone, is full of symbolism, it has an unique and stunning cinematography, and the acting is really satisfying. It is a flawed film, fact, but is ambitious and successfully delivers it's intended message. message.The cinematography, as i already said, is stunning and very peculiar: the zooms are very weird, and in lots of scenes the camera changes the focus not by the traditional 'edited' way, but simply by switching the focus using the analogical method. Also, it rarely changes the angle in a scene. The colorful scenario with strong contrasts is also noticeable. The red is arguably the predominant color in the entire film, with all it's variants. The plot itself has a few flaws i guess, but it's overall very consistent. It is a film about a spiritual journey the three characters pass through. There is lots of symbolism in the objects, so this film definitely requires full attention to be really understood. And even if you are not used to films like these, you should definitely at least try to watch it. Mostly because it's not boring in any ways and it has a relatively short running time. So, very solid film. 7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Wes Anderson's very best films. Three brothers come together under the characteristic manipulations of the eldest for a cross country journey through the colours, spices and challenges of India. Each at their own life crossroads, their neuroses lock together in an ironic self-perpetuating dance which any set of siblings will readily recognise. Willfully lost and living at once in the past, present and future, their manufactured search for some kind of spirituality leads them to confront the profound and the banal of real life. Poetic, thoughtful, hilariously funny and beautifully realised, it is utterly wonderful. On my Must Watch At Least Once A Year list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lovable, bittersweet tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson 's (American director, filmography: Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou etc.) movie: The Darjeeling Limited starring : Owen Wilson- as Francis, Adrien Brody- as Peter and Jason Schwartzman- as Jack. It was released in 2007, and shot in India expect the airport scene (which takes place in the U.S.). The genre is basically comedy-drama, but it also can be an adventure movie. Naturally, the first thing you observe during watching a film is it's spectacle, in here that's awesome, but not because it has been over-edited, but because particular colors (yellow and blue) are recurring themes during the movie( and because of India is beautiful.) Three diverged brothers (Francis, Jack, Peter) 1 year after their father passed away meet again and decide to visit their mother who lives in India. They travel on a luxury train called Darjeeling Limited. Even if it is said that it's a comedy, there aren't as much jokes as we expect, even so as a whole it's an entertaining work. The first main points are the chiselled characters, their fears and conflicts and the amazing acting according to this. The other main point is the music, it doesn't really fit into an Indian ambiance, but after all it really suits the movie. The majority may won't like the film, but I think that it's just because they couldn't reach the deeper message of it. For whom who loves the absurd things this is a must-see. I would recommend it for mature audiences, not because it's cruel or graphic or violent or because of the lot of profanity, but it's a bit hard to understand. It's a lovable, bittersweet tragedy. During the journey we can see through the three brothers' spiritual self-discover. Francis is hyper-optimistic, Jack is melancholic and flirty, and Peter is almost neurotic. The conflict evolves when they have been forced to get off the train because of their uninterrupted arguing. The film also features famous movie stars like Natalie Portman or Bill Murray. It was written by Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson. The film is supposed to culminate in a reunion with their mother. It's a typical Wes Anderson movie and it deals with his recurring themes such as despair, abandonment, sibling relationships etc. In the soundtrack, we can notice some classical movements ( Debussy, Beethoven).It's about facing with one-selves and about our self-image, about the search for identity, self-restrain, cascading and in a general way about the importance of the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent watching, despite some glaring issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what many critics say, this movie is worth a watch or two, if only to watch the interactions between the characters (the three brothers).The acting in this movie was its strongest asset, and I believe Owen Wilson truly captured the role of the leader/controlling older brother. Perhaps people who grew up with 2 of the same gender siblings can relate to this the best. Being the oldest of my two same gender siblings, I could totally see the interactions as believable and relatable.Thinking about these brothers and the effect their parents had on them gives this movie a strong dimension.However, critics of this movie succinctly pointed out some problems that cannot be ignored. Suspending disbelief is one thing, but it did seem that the India shown in the movie was uniquely constructed for the benefit of the brothers' growth as characters. I seriously doubt any stewardess in India would have sex with a stranger on a train. Read up on some brutal sexual attacks on female passengers to get an idea of the sexual freedoms there.As touching and as sad as the funeral for the boy was, it came off as heavily contrived, with an Indian boy matching each white man, and the Indian characters coming off as one dimensional and only to serve as a growth experience for the main actors.Symbolism is always an asset in this movie, but in this movie the suitcases, the funeral, the feathers, the slow-mo effect seemed very heavy handed and deliberate. There is the unpleasant feeling that you are being manipulated and "improved" as a person by being introduced to this stylishly modern and quirky world view. This detracts from the strong character work by the actors.However, worth a watch! Owen Wilson does a great job and Adrien Brody is cute as hell in those slouchy dress clothes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lies somewhere between Rushmore and The Life Aquatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say first of all that I am a fan of Wes Andersen's style. I loved Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, and Fantastic Mr. Fox. I love his films' deadpan, understated humor; their quirky but appealing characters; and their soundtracks. Even The Life Aquatic, which I would have found unwatchable if Bill Murray wasn't such a delightful comedian, made me laugh out loud at points. Bill Murray makes a brief cameo in The Darjeeling Limited that is no more consequential than a Hitchcock cameo. The story centers around three brothers ? the spiritual Francis (Owen Wilson), father-to-be Peter (Adrien Brody), and sensitive writer Jack (Jason Schwartzman) ? going on a spiritual quest through India a year after their last encounter at their father's funeral. The characters, while likably portrayed, are not as developed or defined as past Andersen characters. Their interactions, however, capture the awkwardness of relatives who don't particularly like each other. The story resembles a series of loosely-related vignettes featuring the same characters rather than a cohesive narrative. Some of these vignettes are funny, some unique and moving, while some are too self-consciously sentimental or just too weird. Wes Andersen fans will be satisfied. Like his previous films, The Darjeeling Limited transports viewers to another world, entertaining them with uniquely funny and poignant lines delivered by familiar favorites (newcomer Adrien Brody holds his own as well). Those new to Wes Andersen films should see the three films mentioned earlier before giving this more flawed film a try. Non-Wes Andersen fans, stay away. His style hasn't changed, and he veers into some inexplicably strange territories.</fullReview>

The characters, if I had brothers they would probably be similar to Francis, Peter and Jack. The country, India, is a magical and fascinating place which I had the good fortune to visit many years ago. The people are awesome, truly beautiful and fascinating.

		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is not out-and-out terrible; it's pleasant, engaging and India is beautiful.But in a sense, it's all the worse for that. Because you can't tell that it's pointless; all indicators -- the quality of the cast, the story setup, the characters, the quality of the filming -- suggest that this is going to be something special, so it's not until you've seen the whole movie that you know you've wasted your time.The movie is a series of long, odd "humorous"? situations without punchlines or even punch. Part I is an encounter between Jason Schwartzman is hiding from the world in a 5-star hotel. His estranged lover, Natalie Portman, tracks him down. Ought to be good, but they engage in some cryptic dialog, never crack a smile, and that's that. Sadly like everything that follows, it amounts to nothing. Doesn't really make sense and there's not even enough there that you even wonder or care about what it's all about. Because obviously the writers don't even know or care; it's just some stuff that looked good on the screen.Typical of the shoddiness of story is the bizarre waste of the Bill Murray character, who appears in a several minute sequence rushing in a taxi and running for the train. Nothing at all comes of it. It has no completeness in itself, but neither any connection with the story. He never appears again except in a meaningless montage of characters, aptly closing a meaningless film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant, one-way ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is a landmark piece of work for director Wes Anderson. It is perhaps his most mature effort, it is his one of most beauty, and it is remarkably imaginative and gives its characters a place in the story. His last effort, The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, was a gentle journey, but made its environment and imagery so overscale compared to its characters. Here, there is a much more human approach to its subject, and to top it off, likable characters.If you think back, we haven't always been greeted with the kindest of chaps in Anderson's past filmography. In Bottle Rocket, we dealt with three nitwits who had some charm, but inevitably, some unusual perks to them. In Rushmore, we had the most unlikable of them all; an overconfident, narcissistic schemer who would consistently try and manipulate the system to get his way. It wasn't until The Royal Tenenbaums that Anderson started to seemingly care about his characters, and we did too.The same happens for The Darjeeling Limited. These characters, maybe not as developed as they could be, still have a lot to offer and they show it. They have trademark eccentricities by a director that can employ them with great convincing dialog, and provides a lot of fun and eye-candy on this relatively concise journey.We are taken on a zany ride with three brothers, Peter Whitman (Brody), Francis (Wilson), and Jack (Schwartzman), who are traveling on a train, called "The Darjeeling Limited," across India. Francis secretly wants to meet up with their mother (Anjelica Houston), but for fear of uncertainty amongst his brothers he keeps that plan a secret. The brothers haven't spoken since their fathers' funeral over a year ago and that's where the fun begins. Their interactions are stiff, awkward, and very offbeat.Each character comes with their own noticeable quirks and differences. Francis is controlling and his face is heavily bandaged up from a previous car accident that almost killed him. Peter wears his father's glasses, even though his prescription doesn't match his own. And Jack always walks around barefoot and doesn't seem bothered by it.Now, there are a few troubles I have with The Darjeeling Limited, but thankfully, are overshadowed by some positives. For one, I feel that despite having the cutesy Anderson spin on the subject, this is still "white man in wrong world" - a fish out of water story, if you will. The script still can't help to be persuaded to usual outsider clichés and disconnected foreigner dialog. Not to mention, like in every Anderson film, certain sequences feel very methodical and tone deaf, sometimes even disjointed. Thankfully, it isn't absurdly long like The Life Aquatic and manages to overcome these instances rather quickly.On the bright side, Anderson's tight, erect framing adheres to the film quite nicely. Almost every shot has such attentiveness, despite being shot on the train, that it makes for a charming experience. Visually, this is probably the best looking film of the man's to date. It captures India, a place of offbeat yet invigorating charm, with such respect and attention to detail, that it gives you the essence of warm and comforting atmosphere, without being too familiar and indistinct. It's bright, lively, colorful, and absolutely intoxicating.The Darjeeling Limited is preceded by a short called Hotel Chevalier, a thirteen minute clip providing adequate backstory on Jack's relationship with an ex-lover in a hotel room. It acts as a prologue to the events in its film companion, yet doesn't offer too much to say. It's almost as if Wes Anderson is parodying himself by focusing heavily on music, richness, and look rather than explanation or dialog. It's a decent short, but I'm bothered by the same complaints I have about Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. It's sluggish, begs an explanation, and is suffocating in its detailed design. Thankfully, its film companion is different, and offers more exotic atmosphere and characterization than to be expected.Starring: Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Anjelica Houston, and Bill Murray. Directed by: Wes Anderson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could you not like this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst I wouldn't say this is Wes Anderson's best film it is still a good one. Set in India on a train called The Darjeeling Limited (hence the title) the film follows three brothers, played by Owen Wilson, Adrian Brody and Jason Schwartzman, on a journey intended to bring them closer together - they haven't seen each other since their father's funeral a year earlier.Many people have gone on about how the film is supposed to be very spiritual and quirky and so on. I think that its in a way the complete opposite, at every moment of supposed spirituality something goes wrong in some way and the moments that bring the brothers together are not the spiritual ones but the failure to complete those spiritual tasks, their fighting and their journey. I didn't think the film was hilarious but then its not supposed to be laugh out loud stuff. Like Wes Anderson's other films this one has, for me anyway, that fun, feel good vibe that means you'll accept all the strange occurrences, like a train going the wrong way or someone stealing a shoe. The acting was good, though on the face of it they have rather simple roles, the chemistry between the three was great (especially considering it was Brody's first time with Anderson). In terms of directing, I'm a massive fan of the doll house type shots that Wes Anderson does, I think they're cool as hell the way you switch between different circumstances. I also think he deserves further kudos, given he was filming in India he could have gone a bit wild with crazy views and strange people but instead it was subtly very beautiful and whilst there was a lot of fun hippy type colouring in parts it was never wild or out of control and that fitted in well with the rest of the film.This wasn't my favourite Wes film but its still excellent. The thing that lets it down is the script or overall story, a lot of weird "stuff" happens that's hard to explain unless you've seen a Wes Anderson film. That was great and I'll always enjoy that but there was no real resolution here, I smiled at the end at felt happy I guess but usually after watching his films there's a greater level of emotion and message than I felt after this one. Either way this a really fun film, go and watch it but although it is in India, don't go into it expecting some incredible mystical experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is a film that I will gladly recommend to almost everyone to watch. To summarize the film, it's about three brothers who haven't seen each other in one year, and who are brought together by Francis (Owen Wilson) for a self-defined "transformational spiritual journey". The idea is naturally absurd, that the "spirituality" of the journey is the point of it. He further tries to create transcendence in a bottle with "itineraries" printed daily that schedule trips to temples and shrines. Francis is sadly genre- savvy, and this causes the failure of the journey- the three brothers quibble and quarrel over everything. No one fully trusts both of the others, and all three mercilessly back-stab and betray the others. However, little merriment is derived from this - all three actors are deadpan, and speak haltingly. This results in a movie told without words, and instead the story is given during the dead space. Most of the arguments are over possessions, such as sunglasses and belts and food. The journey that they are making is really the antithesis to any spiritual journey- instead, they become further mired in their earthly issues. During the trip, they use drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol to further avoid spirituality, and so they do, until they are booted off the train when a quibble becomes a quarrel becomes a brawl. It is then that their journey truly begins. They are lost in India, and it is then that they can find spirituality. In an attempt to save children who are drowning in a river, they forget any arguments they were having and run towards them, dropping their luggage heedlessly in the road. This symbolism is not by accident; they have begun to lose their trappings, their "baggage", and it is only then that they can find themselves and each other. The movie ends with very little reconciled, but all three are on a train again, having lost all their luggage except for their clothes, and for the first time in the film, they look at each other and smile.The film is a colorful movie- every shot frames at least one, often two or three colors in conjunction. A relatively simple palette of mostly primary colors contrasts with the stuff-filled trains that they ride; every object on the train is painted with false opulence. The richness of color stays throughout the film, well into their visit to rural India. It lends a magical feel to the movie, a feel that in India, everything is brighter. The cinematography often centers on the three men sitting side by side in passivity, often with cigarettes hanging from their mouths and tumblers in hand, the very image of just not caring. This also changes towards the end, and due to the actor's talent, they can change just sitting to sitting with purpose and poise. All three of them are greatly underrated (yes, even Oscar-winner Adrien Brody).In conclusion, the movie is truly brilliant. You will feel changed and moved by it, and in fact I made this account just to review it. It will enchant you and hold your imagination, and you will not do anything for the rest of the night but think about it.9/10</fullReview>

While you get high production values, some nice cameos - the staff on the train were great, I felt this was not enough to make it worthwhile. The viewer needs to be able to identify with these characters and the three brothers here were either non-communicative, childish or boring. I loved the silly pomposity of the characters Anderson portrays in the Royal Tennebaums and Aquatic Life, partly as the setting was so surreal and comic, but this is just a train ride with three boring people going nowhere. There is a glimpse of redemption at the end (which would be giving away too much of the plot to reveal), but the emotional impact of the events is not discussed by the characters or properly explored by the director. A comedy about westerners in India is an interesting premise, but this does not work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is not a bad film, and nowhere near one of the all time worst films. But, in no way, shape, nor form, can anyone who understands and appreciates the art of cinema call this a good, much less great film, and those who have praised it or claimed it was one of the best films of its year are idiots, pure and simple. It is, in a sense, the sine qua non of mediocrity, and Anderson is the same thing in the realm of directors, which only begs the question as to what The Criterion Collection finds so valuable about his cinematic canon. More than that, I get the real sense, given Anderson's comments on the audio commentary track, and in the extra features, that he is not even trying to grow and make films of substance and quality any longer. And this is a shame, because Rushmore, the first film of his to break big, was a good film, and one which showed potential for Anderson to become a valuable asset for American cinema. In fact, only David Gordon Green's debut film, George Washington, showed more potential for a young American filmmaker, in the last dozen years, yet he too has stagnated, although his problem is more based in mere selling out to Hollywood and its conventions, whereas Anderson seems to be just creatively dead. Given his working and personal relationship with Roman Coppola- who's proved he's a good screenwriter, it would seem that Coppola would be the person to turn to for his next film's screenplay; to get outside of Andersonworld. If not, he may be doomed to becoming his generation's Tim Burton; a thought even scarier than any of that perpetual juvenile's own films.</fullReview>

Anyone with half a brain knows why the heroine (called sophisticated by one dumb right winger's description) sleeps with the youths. It's not to be gone into here because it will spoil the film for those with taste and integrity. Of course, this review will be buried by the onslaught of one star reviews, but at least I had my say.

		<shortDescription>The scenery was the biggest star of this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I have gathered from Anderson's Royal Tenenbaums and Life Aquatic, I figured The Darjeeling Limited would be another deadpan cookie cutter since many of choices frequently involve similar actors in 2 or more of his films. I would hate to admit that this movie did grow on me midway through.The casting of the three "brothers" Wilson, Brody, and Schwartzman actually worked as they gossip, fight and bond through this interesting "spiritual" journey. Anderson meticulously unravels each of their personalities with detail and intrigue without too much exposition thrown in all at once. The scenery of India and its environment was very appeasing to watch with the different types of people in this huge conglomerate of culture. Anderson throws in his occasional trademark diagonal close ups in certain shots to give it that grind house 70's look. The Indian natives acted perfectly natural and nothing seemed pre-staged in the way they go about their day to day lives.Angelica Huston has a cameo in the end as well as a frequently used Bill Murray while neither were all that awe inspiring. The spiritual journey doesn't really mark anything in the end and is a bit confusing to what the movie was trying to accomplish as far as a moral other than the unity of the trio. The rather open ending was nonetheless the downfall due a lack of climax. I am still trying to wonder about the justifications on why the trio continue to ride the trains though there are more important matters in their lives that they should attend to. (Spoiler) Why would Brody's character want to remain bound to his brother when his wife is close to giving birth? The movie does continue to be complacent in its execution without any justification.I recommend this movie for any Anderson fan though it isn't for everyone. The scenery and the chemistry between the three brothers are probably the movie's biggest strengths.</fullReview>

In any case, there is a interesting back-story to this family that you never quite get. It is a film for which the question "Why?" is totally out of place.The Indian landscape, colors, pictures, sunlight landscapes, architecture, faces, are an assault on the senses and, I guess, a confrontation and challenge to the Western visitor. The "short" at the beginning of an elegant hotel in Paris becomes part of a frame when we hear the voice of Joe Dassin singing "Aux Champs Elysees" in the final scenes. The images stick with you long after the film is over, like the smell of incense that has soaked into your hair and clothing. Life happens. There are people whose senses become awakened by exposure to Eastern modes of being. Renting this movie will save you the cost of the trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting watch for the small screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a personal movie. It suffers from a serious lack of narrative, a vulgar use of color and style, an overdose of characters, a lack of depth in developing the characters. The lead actors deliver a professional performance, nothing particularly spectacular. Most of it just reprises of their early-career roles. The locations are excellent, editing very good. Use of a lot of clichés through the story but that's really not Wes's fault. The good thing about this movie is probably the traditional Anderson perspective and the graphicness of the visuals along with tight editing and texturing of the colors. But if the reader is familiar with his earlier body of work, then one does not encounter anything different in this movie.My final word will be: If you are a freshman student of some aspect of performing arts, watch it. If you are more experienced, there's really nothing here for you to learn.If you belong to South Asia, watch it. For everyone else, if you have the time for introspective entertainment, watch it.If you don't fall in the above categories, then this is just another well crafted but forgettable indie-spirited movie which will not be referenced after a while and become another item in the resumes of the whole crew. Miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously the filmmakers seemed to care less if you like the film--some will adore it and many more will feel baffled why anyone would watch such a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three brothers (Jason Schwartzman, Adrien Brody and Owen Wilson) are on a LONG trip through India, though for about half the film you have no idea why they are there. In fact, they spend their time snipping at each other and seem to have nothing in common. They seem disconnected and rather self-absorbed. Only late in the film do you learn that they have come to the country to search for their mother--a mother who abandoned the family some time ago to 'serve God' and help others. Along the journey, they mostly reveal that they are rather soulless jerks--though there are some positive aspects to the journey (such as when one nearly dies trying to save a child). My assumption about the men is that are supposed to be soulless, mixed up and disconnected as a result of their mother abandoning them....or not.Like most Wes Anderson films I have seen, this one does NOT appear to have been written with any intention of making any money at all. Instead, his quirky films seem designed to please Anderson and his friends (who appear in his films again and again) as well as to impress many of the critics and lovers of artsy films. However, I can guarantee that the average person would NOT like "The Darjeeling Limited", as it seems to meander too much, has little in the way of conventional plot AND because it seems like a comedy with no punchlines. In recent years, Anderson as well as Sophia Coppola ("Lost in Translation") and Jim Jarmusch ("Broken Flowers") have produced very similar films (ones, incidentally that have Bill Murray in them)--films that have practically no commercial appeal and which seem to just meander. Some adore these films and some hate them (read through the reader reviews--you'll rarely see such divergent reviews on a film than these). Me, I like SOME (such as Anderson's recent "Moonrise Kingdom"), but can't see the point to many of them. And, as for "The Darjeeling Limited", I see glimpses of something I like but that is all--such as a scene here or a scene there. In fact, the film is super-frustrating as just when I think I'm starting to like it I realize, no, I do NOT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three idiots on a train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie...really I did. But it's a bunch of nothing happening as three idiot brothers travel across India on a clapped-out train, ostensibly to see their estranged mother. Having sat through this terrible movie, I can understand why their mother ran away from them. They spend the entire journey arguing like kids and being stupid, whilst the sumptuous colours and sights of the Indian sub-continent slide beautifully by. The script is agonisingly banal and the characters are shallow; it's impossible to feel anything other than antagonism towards them. I have rarely felt such antipathy towards characters before, but by the 30 minute mark I was ready to throw shoes at them. It's not just that I found them annoying but also because I was losing the will to live. But I soldiered gamely on until the end in the name of stubbornness. Owen Wilson was once again execrable and confirmed my belief that he cannot act at all, while Adrian Brody at least has a body of mostly excellent work to prove his credentials. It's a bad movie, don't waste your time with it. Watch Rushmore or The Royal Tennenbaums instead. This is a complete dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off..let me say I'm a big Wes Anderson fan. Mostly his earlier stuff..Bottle Rocket and Rushmore ( a Life Aquatic is pretty bad too..its not horrible though) i liked Royal Tannenbaums but not as much as BR or Rush) are two of my fav new classics. This film though is just pointless. It rambles on with no coherent story or point like I said. Typical cast of quirky characters u get from Wes..Plenty of Wes-isms that we like. This movie though really disappointed me. Maybe he has just lost his touch. I saw it coming a bit in A Life Aquatic. It's like when people say the work suffers when people become " aware" of themselves. Ala Woody Allen. It's just a lot of fluff and style..no rich charters and dialouge and or STORY..I noticed most of the bad reviews are from people who are from or have been to India. This def has a slight exploitive aspect to it ( see as in a lot of Wes' films. Hes a hipster hero..i expect that..Which is fine, ( See Sofia Coppola) but only it wasn't clever and u walk away with nothing, and if U asked me an hour later what is was about and what happened I'd say mmm mm?

		<shortDescription>The best work i've seen from Wes Anderson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson hasn't directed too many films. I haven't seen too many of them. I saw part of The Royal Tennenbaums,I saw The Life Aquanic, and I saw this one. So really I have only seen two of Wes Anderson's films. So really I can't quite say that this is the best work he's done. But out of the two films I have seen, The Darjeeling limited is his best.The Darjeeling limited is a little bit of a mixed bag. It has many moments of hilarity. But it also has an occasional scene of drama. Overall, the film is pretty spectacular. Also, there are occasional scenes of weirdness. Overall, there is a lot to enjoy about this film. The film is about three brothers(played by Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman)who haven't seen or spoken to each other since their father's death. Owen Wilson's character decides to bring the three brothers together after an accident. So the three brothers meet each other on a train heading for India where they are going to visit their mother.Along the way, the buy a pet rattlesnake. and eventually after a fight they brothers are thrown off the train. After that the brothers rescue two children, but one of them dies. That is the dramatic part of the film.A lot of stuff happens in this film. not only is the film funny, strange, and dramatic, is also very entertaining. The acting is all very good. These are all very good actors. This is a good director. I also loved how there was a shot film before it started this way we know what they are talking about through some of the film. There are cameo's by Bill Murray and Natile Portman. This is a very good film. To Wes Anderson, make more.The Darjeeling limited: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a short commentary about the Darjeeling Limited before it was finished. It seemed interesting, and with the cast assembled I felt it would probably be a good movie. Of course, when I did finally see it, I was excited to see it was another Wes Anderson creation. Following three brothers on a spiritual journey to find their way back to each other, couldn't be more realistic. Siblings often know each other so well, and yet they never really know each other well enough, as is the truth with these three brothers. Still grieving over the death of their father, they argue and come together over and over again. They confront their mother along the way and each other about the events that followed the death of their father. When it is all said and done, no three brothers can come together and find such a spiritual bond as these three. I cried, I laughed, and I fell in love with the music. I can't see any other actors playing in the roles of these three quirky brothers and I can't believe how amazing I felt when the movie was over. I got the message and I hope you do too. I enjoyed this movie so much, I added it to my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbolism does not a good movie make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm familiar with Wes Anderson's work, though I've never been a rabid fan at all. This film was too steeped in it's own aspirations to be intelligent and full of symbolism, that it forgot to do what movies are meant to do - entertain. If you're going to make a film that is full of symbolism which you'll only really pick up on during repeat viewings, then ensure your film is worth watching more than once! I watched the film with a friend, who fell asleep 15 minutes into it. I managed to make it all the way through, but toward the end I was on the PC and looking up explanations of the symbolism in the film, because otherwise, there is no point. I didn't feel like thinking about the movie too much, because the characters were so droll and thinly painted, it just didn't keep my interest.It doesn't help when the movie is constantly slapping false emotion in your face with blaring, "quirky" music and slow motion. That does NOT help get a point across. In my case, it simply annoyed me.There were one or two moments in the film where something actually happened, and I was entertained for a split second... But then it collapsed back into overly long scenes of dry, inane dialogue. The performances were bland, and it really didn't seem as though anyone was into the story at all - even the director. I'm sure the idea sounded smart on paper, but the execution was incredibly weak.Yes, the art design and cinematography were interesting to look at - that is where the film succeeded. When you take the symbolism into account, there IS potential for an interesting story in there somewhere, but as it is, it's hidden amongst a bunch of boring dialogue and (some subtle, some blatant) visual cues. I'll give it a 5/10 because the idea was there - too bad the execution was so soulless. In reality it probably deserves a 4...</fullReview>

The opening sequence and appearance of Bill Murray are one of the few bright spots in this film, making me actually appreciate Anderson's last film, The Life Aquatic, more. Perhaps Owen Wilson contributes more to the writing than one would expect, considering the two Anderson film's he doesn't share a writing credit on are easily the weakest. Solid production design, Robert Yeoman's camera work and Anderson's usual visual flair are not enough to save it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just like to start by saying that I never write comments on IMDb regarding movies however this would have to be the most pointless, boring, crass, poorly directed movie I have seen for a very, very long time that I thought I would make the effort to warn others. Not only did this movie not make me laugh or entertain me in any facet, it ended up making me increasingly angry as it droned on, to think that I had actually spent money on it. I am also blown away by other user comments that score this movie incredibly high which in my opinion because this Wes Anderson has a cult following of people who are prone to add votes and comments to IMDb that it has been given an overinflated overall vote in IMDb. I think you could put a video of a pot of coffee boiling for two hours in front of some people, say its directed and written by Wes Anderson and they will still write in and say what a great and wondrous journey it was and give it 9 out of 10. I probably think this movie might deserve slightly higher than a "1"... however after seeing some people give this 10/10 I thought it would help to even things out. I have seen other Wes Anderson movies and found them enjoyable however this particular movie was pathetic and should be avoided at all costs.</fullReview>

Watching these three dysfunctional brothers on their journey to no particular salvation is an absolute marvel.The parallels to real life notwithstanding, Owen Wilson gives one of his best performances and reminds us that there is more to his talent than the mindless muck he so often associates with. Adrien Brody is the brother who just can't let go of their deceased father, and co-writer Jason Schwartzman is just perfect in his role. Certainly, I would encourage you to see the film prior to anyone spoiling the details for you, because as with life ... the joy is in the journey!

		<shortDescription>Not moving, not profound, not clever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd hazard a guess that the only method involved in the making of this shocker was Anderson's crew and actors settling themselves down in Rajasthan for a couple of months with no apparent plot or cohesive dialogue, filming the ensuing wacky shenanigans then crossing their fingers and hoping that a meaningful film would result. That's certainly how it appears anyway.I'm a big admirer of (and have on DVD) Anderson's previous efforts, as well as being an old India hand, so I was really looking forward to this. However, I found it a crushing disappointment and the director has some real work to do on his next outing if his reputation is to recover from this absolute train wreck of a film. Other reviewers have stated that you either love or hate Anderson's films (presumably to rationalise the many bad reviews); well that maybe the case to some people, but not myself. I loved Rushmore, Tenenbaums and Acquatic but hate this one with a passion. In a year or so, Darjeeling will correctly be regarded as the juvenile, vacuous, incoherent, patronising excuse for a movie that it is. What is astonishing me are the positive reviews it seems to be getting from many on here and in the media. Is it that the - sometimes spectacular and mystical - Indian setting is conning some punters into believing that they're actually watching something moving and profound? (Just as the Andes-based "Motorcycle Diaries" did to many).The handout I received in the theatre stated that Anderson credits the films of Satayjit Ray as a being major inspiration for TDJ. Just how does that influence come through? Let's see: 1) It's a film 2) it's set in India 3) Er...that's it. Unfortunately this film has more in common with "Carry On Up the Kyber" (a far superior work) than the Apu Trilogy or The Music Room. Anderson's film proves conclusively that Americans just don't understand India. The director's "middle-class, disturbed, quirky family" premise has well and truly run it's course with this effort and it's high time for him to move on. I rate this just below "You, Me and Dupree" as worst film of the year. Excellent job, Owen Wilson!</fullReview>

The relationship between the three brothers is well written and represented, and the three leads solid. Adrien Brody in particular shines the most as the film's MVP. I think some of the scenes here really do transcend into something more cultural that isn't usually as prevalent in Anderson's films. As it is, it's also not as "out there" as I expected, certainly not in comparison to some of Anderson's other films. This is definitely recommended, sort of underrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is about 3 brothers Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) who have not seen each other since their father's funeral over a year ago. The death of their father has affected them all individually and along with other problems in their life has left them somewhat flawed and drugged up. Peter has girlfriend issues, Jack has father issues and Francis has family issues, he wants to be closer to his brothers and be a happy family and yet his demeanour drives them away.The lack of seeing each other inspires Francis to bring them together so they can carry out a 'spiritual journey' across India on a train in order to rekindle their relationships with one another become closer and more brotherly. However this idea does not go completely to plan with much brotherly bickering and fighting, the involvement of some pepper spray and one of the brothers buying a highly poisonous snake which he then misplaces amongst some of the things to look forward to.The brothers and their interactions and chemistry with each other is where this movie wins from my point of view. Despite showing hardly any emotion- they never seem sad or cry, rarely smile etc. they convey what they are feeling in different ways. Having only ever seen Wilson in the bumbling comic/romcom type role, I was impressed with him in this where he shows off his talents as the brother who needs to always be in control. Brody also impresses with Schwartzman, despite not quite being as good as the other brothers still performing admirably.The shooting of some of the scenes in the train reminded me in principal of similar work in the movie The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou whereby the camera moves alongside the train cutting between rooms as if the nearest wall to the camera did not exist (I've heard it called the dollhouse effect?). This similarity was explained when I discovered both movies were directed by the same man, Wes Anderson.These types of shots could be achieved due to The Darjeeling Limited being filmed inside a moving train- Anderson rented a ten carriage train and locomotive engine, completely redecorated it and then ran it between Jodhpur and Jaisalmer on a live section of railway track. This unsurprisingly providing a great challenge for cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman as nothing could be fixed to the ceiling and filming equipment couldn't be more than a metre out of the windows. He does a fantastic job though which has to be highly commended.This is not an 'in your face' comedy but is rather more sly, subtle and witty one which I preferred in this context. There are some great one liners that I particularly enjoyed. The characters make it what it is while dragging their emotional (and actual) baggage around with them for the whole of the movie. If you like Anderson's other movies then this will not disappoint either.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiritual shenanigans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this is strong, because of the devices that control it and which Wes Anderson adeptly executes.One is the consciousness of story folding and unfolding, where coincidence is a cosmic joke (such as when Bill Murray in the beginning ostensibly misses the train of the movie) and the narrative is experienced by the characters as the capricious whims of a higher decree. When the train for example has to make a stop in the middle of the desert to orientate (itself the source of metaphorical amusement) and Owen Wilson is told that "they need to locate themselves", Anderson quickly points out the obvious symbolism.Here, perhaps more profoundly than anywhere else in the movie, I feel the hand of the director as the hand of god. The more the characters try to effect control over their lives, the more he wrestles it away and tosses them around. Owen Wilson's onanistic desire for a spiritual journey Wes Anderson denies or taunts, incorporating instead the sought after symbolic dimension as a quip within the film.The other is the mock spiritual journey embarked upon by the three brothers, which happens irreverently, indifferently, with mock devoutness or none at all, among consumption of copious amounts of painkillers, whiskey, and shenanigans involving deadly snakes and bathroom sex, and which, by circumstances out of their control and by the filmmaker's higher decree, threatens to turn into a real spiritual journey. Anderson divines this with a solemn scene of death, and the subsequent funeral.But where does he go from here, how does he chronicle the change in the lives of these people and to what effect?The answer for me is that he doesn't, he's not equipped for it. Naturally the three of them learn to be whole again, in a touch of humane but formulaic optimism.The experience of the spiritual journey then is more prefabricated than the mock escapade it follows. The fallacy on the filmmaker's part rests on the belief that the usual tics and mannerisms, which are ornamental in style, decorational, can assist closure. In order to make the train in the end, the three brothers need to let go of the suitcases of their dead father (a presence that looms over the film). This equally shameless symbolic touch, which earlier was a source of ironic amusement, now Anderson wants us to experience in sentimental earnest.The two moments where the film is elevated, both hinge on inscrutable feelings.The one, when the three brothers, now reunited with their mother in the Himalayas, sit around a table saying with the eyes only all that needs or can be said. The other a little later, when back in a train station the three brothers make the same phonecalls, resuming their troubled lives as though nothing happened.The film's problem for me then is not that it suggests these people were changed in their escapade very little or none at all, this is a valid observation, but that the film didn't. But whereas the irony that shows these people trapped, estranged from one another, is executed with a certain complexity of narrative, the closure is altogether easy. Reflecting, living through an experience, is hardly required here, simply watching this will do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darjeeling Limited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owen Wilson nearly looses his life in a motorcycle crash, and after somewhat recuperating orchestrates a spiritual journey on a train vacation in India with his estranged two brothers. His head and face covered in bandages, Wilson has an itinerary of what the three of them will do during their time together, but things soon do not go according to plan. Director Wes Anderson's camera is often accessing the surroundings of our three principles(Wilson, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman)as they bicker, make up, bicker, make up along the trip through India experiencing various situations--fighting over secrets they keep from each other(Brody's wife is pregnant, Schwartzman's problems with a European lover and his return passport as a precautionary measure if things between the brothers got too hairy), trying to track down their mother who has since started a mission for the Lord somewhere(she's always abandoning them, even doing so when they finally find her, sneakily when they are asleep), coping with the loss of their father when he was hit by a taxi(and fussing about Brody's using all of pop's things such as his razor to shave or wearing his shades), the rescue of Indian boys who nearly drown while trying to cross a stream(Brody's kid isn't so lucky), Schwartzman's awkward sexual relations with an Indian train stewardess, bringing a dangerous snake on board and losing it in their room, etc. Anyone accustomed to Anderson's style knows the acting is reserved and very subtle(there's a reason why Owen Wilson is often a star in his movies) and he communicates to the viewer through visual methods(how he shoots over the shoulder when the brothers open their suitcases or how he pulls the camera back outside the train windows, following the characters from different cars, looking upon them from afar). Anderson seems interested in not just his main actors but what is happening around them, such as when they are among Indians in their village(and a commune where the three are invited after saving children from drowning)..I think this indicates that his movie just isn't about the men, but their experiences and the place for which they find themselves. I felt Anderson loves India and cares deeply about the people there. And, what I found most satisfying was that these brothers do bond, despite numerous obstacles which might threaten to disastrously halt Wilson's desire for the three of them to find a peace and love that is lasting and special. Anjelica Huston has a small part as the mother hiding away in a convent from her sons, reacting disappointingly when they question why she didn't attend their father's funeral. I didn't think THE DARJEELING LIMITED(which is the name of the train for which the brothers spend most of the first half of the film traveling on)was as successful as something like THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS(this film really spends most of its time with just the three central characters and their experiences, instead of the typical huge ensemble we are used to seeing in a Wes Anderson film)or THE LIFE AQUATIC, but seems more personal to the director. There's a sense of loss and mourning that permeates throughout the movie, the brothers having to deal with a missing father and mother, not to mention happiness and purpose. Both Bill Murray and Natalie Portman appear in cameos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit limited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had been bypassing this for a while at the video store as it looked a bit wussy, plus Owen Wilson as a lead character doesn't generally lead to a great movie. But with the tripe on offer lately, decided it was worth a go."The Daarjeeling Limited" is a the story of 3 brothers who are brought together by the eldest brother Francis (Wilson) to unknowingly go and see their mother and try to bond again after a year or so of not seeing each other after their father's death. Their meeting place is "The Daarjeeling Limited", a train that travels around India. The aim is to see some places and go on a spiritual journey. Things don't go to Francis's plan though and after they get kicked off the train for bringing a deadly snake onboard, they are dropped off in a very remote location and forced to find another way to their destination. Their lives are turned upside down not long after when they come across three young boys who are drowning in a raging river. I won't share what happens, but the scenario has a deep impact on all.Solid, but not sure why. None of the characters were particularly likable and the story dragged at times. I guess the appeal lied within the symbolism and the different scenery and culture. Some good moments, but a tad few and far between for my liking and Wilson and Brody weren't given enough opportunity to display some of his talents.Not bad, but won't be in my DVD collection anytime soon. Pleasant enough and more food for thought than in most of the rubbish at "Blockbuster".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie to regurgitate!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to say about this movie......I thought by the description it would be an "Owen Wilson family friendly comedy", something light and commercially funny....to my amazement I was pleasantly surprised as it is definitely not a commercial comedy. There are plenty of funny moments in the movie but seeing it leaves the viewer with a refreshed feeling from the lightness and apparent simplicity of the the whole movie.The characters supposedly take us through a spiritual journey goofing around in India traveling on a train while actually its a movie about lost family ties, guilt and other sweet 'luggage' a family conveys to its members.I didn't 'get' many of the metaphors (baggage's, train etc) in this movie but I kept going over the characters and scenes because the movie in my opinion doesn't start or end, its just a part a large family story of sons looking for closure and resolution.The enigmatic character of Bill Murray is what pushed me to research about the movie....and I finally got the puzzle pieces I needed.For me it's an all star cast and ALL of the actors were amazing. No CGI/nudity/guns/car-chase/explosions just a very good story that respects the viewer.Well worth seeing, a breath of fresh air.One should see 'Hotel Chevalier' before Darjeeling Limited since its the prequel. A movie to regurgitate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Indy film with a studio feel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film. I enjoyed it. It had style and an artistic bent to it. But some things kept me from really enjoying it fully.Fist off were the three actors chosen to portray brothers. They're great actors, but they didn't resemble one another in the least. Maybe I'm being too picky, or maybe I'm missing some deeper inner meaning in the film, but it seemed a little artificial. It felt like a film made by independent film makers who, at heart, were really studio film makers, although they themselves don't realize it.Even so, I liked it. As far as the "road trip" genre goes this one strikes some reasonably good chords. The relationship is nurtured and grows through a confluence of disconnects and confrontations, each one leading to the other to reveal the characters true selves.Set against the backdrop of India I was very glad to see the film makers striving to take advantage of a very exotic part of the world, and to give the audience a taste for the location. But, I was disappointed that the culture was not fully embraced nor explored. It was touched on, but set almost as an off-screen character than active participant. To find out why you need to see the film yourself :-) A minor high was seeing the use of the quick zoom in this film. A thing rarely (if ever) used in contemporary cinema, and for good reason; it's cheesy. But its use here, though mildly off, works for the film. Another plus is the chief purser. Though an Indian Sikh he doesn't play the stereo typical Indian with a pointed Punjabi accent, nor is he apologetic. Even so he has not lost his cultural roots.The humor is somewhat bland and flat (as was the intent), but the laughs expected and implied by the film's trailer were simply not there. And that was a let down.The film staggers along at a brisk pace until a third of the way into act two, at which point some substance begins to trickle into the three brother's lives. Their introduction, and subsequent rediscovery, isn't what I would call a great Hallmark in cinema, but it is interesting to see how the film makers concocted and executed the ultimate tale.One gets the sense that the cast and crew really wanted to be on the edge with this film in a good way, but one couldn't help but get the feeling that they lacked the spiritual experience to do justice to this tale. Their technical experience is there, as is the basic art skill, but to make a film like this really soar beyond that which it's already achieved, there needed to be a few more "dramatic" moments for lack of a better term.I couldn't help but feel that Wim Wenders, Percy Aldon, or Richard Donner probably would've really sunk their teeth into this material, and take it the full distance it deserved in terms of spiritual themes. As it is now it's a respectable film, but it could've been a great deal more. Other films in this genre include "Fandango" and "Mystery Train". If you liked "The Darjeeling Limited", then give these other two films a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful "dramedy"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched Wes Anderson's "Darjeeling Limited", what made it so amazing was that it was a hysterical comedy that didn't crack a single joke. The film had a very serious plot about three brothers who take a bonding trip across India, but the tale of the three lovable, but flawed brothers is filled with events that are when viewed alone, appear serious but are, when put into context, hysterical. The acting is also fabulous. Owen Wilson and Adrien Brody are as good as usual, but the one who surprised me was Jason Schwartzman. His kind, but romantically challenged role is both touching, and funny. I highly recommend it to anyone who liked such films as "Little Miss Sunshine", and also from Wes Anderson, "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou".PS. Look for an early cameo by Bill Murray!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It appears as if you missed the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review does not completely apply to you, but works nonetheless. I think that you gave a very bad review to the film and you were completely unfair. Here is why...With regard to the film not being "...at all insightful about human nature" and Wes Anderson's not having any "substance" in terms of his career and the film I would like to disagree and offer support for my disagreement. I am not sure if the dissenters are familiar with Freudian psychology- the basics would do- but many modern personality theories are based off of Freud's work, especially his division of the human consciousness into three parts: the Ego, the Super Ego, and the Id. Owen Wilson is the Super Ego, Adrian Brody is the Ego, and Jason Schwartzman is the Id. The reason that this is at all relevant is because the film is completely focused on Freud's theory to such an extent that one of the only real criticism I can give to it is that it is nothing but human nature and substance and neglects adding aspects of the fantastic, which I understand to be Anderson's style for the most part. This seems to be the exact opposite of the criticisms offered on the boards and as far as I can tell the only legitimate- which is to say non-name-calling- critique offered thus far. This actually leads me to a bigger point which is, unless you can offer some meaningful contribution to the discussion other than "this was pointless" or "this movie sucked" you should keep your thoughts alone where they start until they gather together to form a criticism that is more than shallow. The movie was very good and had a point in that it was able to tell us a story about the human consciousness in a relatively easy to understand manner. This was a brilliant display of Freud shown through the story of an unhealthy human consciousness that is split after the tragic loss of the father and abandonment of the mother. To further emphasize the point Wes Anderson and co-directors literally had the mother abandon the brothers at the end of the film, and to make it even more perspicuous the brothers literally left the "baggage" of their father behind when they were trying to catch the train that literally contained their lives (their women, their children, their snake, etc). I don't know how they could have told a more meaningful and human story to be honest. Feel free to disagree with me on any of the points that I have made here, but please, if you do so, try to make the disagreement clear and substantive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even More Exasperating Than "The Life Aquatic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If narcissistic self-indulgence is the cardinal sin of good film-making, then Wes Anderson is the Antichrist--except he's so darn quirky. Let's face it, when you walk into a Wes Anderson film (or anything involving Owen Wilson) you have to expect magnificent squirreliness. Whether they admit it or not, that's what die-hard Anderson acolytes truly crave.Unlike Tarantino's Death Proof, which is a ridiculous mess that doesn't work, The Darjeeling Limited is a ridiculous mess that does work, at least in the quirky world of Wes Anderson. Thus, it's somewhat silly for people of Indian descent, or anyone else for that matter, to be offended by this weird travel-romp epic. After all, this is not supposed to be the real India; this is Wes Anderson's quirky-world India. So you either avoid it or wallow in it. I chose the latter, and I am better for it.Okay, I admit I'm not the biggest Wes Anderson fan, although, I kinda liked those early, yet unpretentious, quirky little films Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. And the classic mockumentary about the making of The Royal Tenenbaums was a real hoot (included as an extra disc with the DVD package). That pseudo-documentary, ostensibly a behind-the-scenes look at film-making through the quirky eyes of Anderson, actually imparts great insight for those wondering: "What happened to Wes Anderson?"It's by far my favorite Wes Anderson movie, and should be listed on IMDb instead of Hotel Chevalier.In reality, I think both Anderson and Tarantino are geniuses. They are able to lead fantastic lifestyles because early in their careers they established themselves as auteurs capable of attracting a certain level of guaranteed box office and critical acclaim. As a result, the quirky director needs no clothes to acquire train-loads money, millions of quirky fans, and adoring starlets ready and willing to take off their clothes (see the luscious Natalie Portman in the Hotel Chevalier opus).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another hip, sad, and rewarding journey from one of the most idiosyncratic of America's auteurs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always predictable what Wes Anderson will do, least to a point. We know his style by now, which is loaded with quick, self-conscious pans and whip-ups with the frame, the meticulous attention to detail of objects and things as in composition of the actors just like a pad of paper or a river, slow-motion during intense/emo moments, and a tale of family and/or love that is complicated by the shallowness and flaws of the characters. It's almost comforting to see an auteur like Anderson at work, because as you know what you'll be getting, it's never boring. And he's a weird master of oddball dialog ("How can a train be lost?"), as well as mixing a combination of awkward comedy and sincere, tragic drama. If it isn't any great film it at least is one of the most admirable, colorful independent films of the year.It's the tale of three brothers, estranged and each without trust for one another (this includes withholding info like Adrien Brody's soon-to-be child, and a belt, plus a passport, and the end of the trip being to meet their much more distanced-from nun mother played by Huston), who are on a train across India. Like The Royal Tenenbaums, Anderson's masterpiece, its about characters who have created little bubbles with their quirks and troubles, the chief one being that they can't seem to communicate very well with one another. At least, anyway, from Francis (Owen Wilson) to Jack and Peter (Schwartzmann and Brody). Soon, in road movie fashion, they get thrown off the train, and come under a circumstance that nearly throws off their whole journey, and rightfully so. One's never too concerned with plot; one probably keeps on watching because there's so much to take in with the three brothers, and how each actor puts in their personalities so convincingly that, along with the script, we know this is how they've been their whole lives. Among the three I'd say that Owen Wilson takes the cake. Head bandaged throughout the film and with a penchant for bossiness with an itinerary, it's a subtly tense part for someone of Wilson's gifts at deadpan and charm. He's even more of a tortured soul than he was in Tenenbaums, just a little more complex with relation to the passed-on father and mother, and he makes Francis into one of his most touching, and saddening and prescient, performances. Brody and Schwartzmann are also up to task, making even the moments where a scene or beat falls flat on the train amusing and strange.And back to the style- watching Anderson and his crew at work is, within the predictable strands of an Anderson flick, unpredictable, or unpredictably inventive. As mentioned, the use of slow-motion is extraordinary even in the conventional realm; we've all seen a scene where a character chases to catch a train. There are a few of these scenes in the Darjeeling Limited, but every time, backed behind by the exquisite, flowery music, it's effectively timed and some of the closest times the director has come to "pure" cinema, in a sort of sense. Particularly a scene when the brothers are walking to a funeral for a boy who died tragically (that, by the way, is a small gem of dramatic daring and a step forward following some genre confusion in Life Aquatic), and they're seen going in slow-mo like it's something religious. I also liked how Anderson skipped into the structure with the flashback to the car shop: it penetrates the psyche of the characters just a little more, aside from being a sad, momentary expression of the human spirit.As Anderson goes on to make more films, maybe his outlook might expand too past familial bewilderment comedies (there is more of a concern this time for the "other", albeit, like Renoir's the River, through Western eyes). If you're already a fan of flicks like Rushmore and Tenembaums, go see it, and if you like the actors all the better. It shouldn't disappoint. Though it likely won't turn on too many who already have dismissed his body of work.</fullReview>

I smiled throughout the whole thing just cause it was a Wes Anderson movie.The German ladies were good! My thoughts on Peter/ Adrian Brody's character (Minor spoilers). I have read several reviews where the guy says he "regrets" marrying his wife Alice. This is not true. He says he loves Alice and wants to be with her forever, but he just figured that their marriage would end up in divorce.Finally, I would love to see a sequel to this film. There were several plot points that weren't wrapped up.

		<shortDescription>An interesting journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited follows three brothers on a train journey across India. Suffice to say that in the course of their journey they will be faced with some complications. Things most definitely do not go according to the original plan. And it is in those times where the trip veers off its intended course that the movie is at its best. It's not really a comedy but the film certainly has some nice comedic moments. There are some good dramatic moments but I don't think one would label the film a great drama. It's a journey which more often than not is certainly interesting but which in the end leaves you wanting a little more. For all the great moments, and there are more than a few, it doesn't quite all add up to a spectacular finished product. It's a good movie which you feel could have been great but fell a little shy of that standard.Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman play the three Whitman brothers who having not seen one another for a year are now embarking on what Francis, the oldest of the brothers, intends to be a spiritual journey. Francis is obsessive-compulsive to the extreme and his brothers often find him to be more than a touch annoying. But, as played wonderfully by Wilson, Francis comes across as rather endearing. Annoying yes but in an endearing way. The fact that he goes through the whole movie with his head and face heavily bandaged due to a motorcycle accident probably doesn't hurt in making Francis a sympathetic figure. Brody's Peter and Schwartzman's Jack do not immediately appear to have as many obvious quirks as Francis, seeming to be much more "normal". But we will see that Peter and Jack certainly have their own issues to deal with as well. And while if you had to choose one Wilson would be the star of the show both Brody and Schwartzman do excellent work as well.When the journey inevitably veers from its spiritual course is when the movie shines. Seeing the way these three very unique individuals react to one another in trying circumstances is a treat. Some of these moments are wonderfully comedic while other moments are appropriately solemn and serious. This is a train ride full of surprises which allow the brothers to learn a great deal about themselves and in the end maybe about each other. The film does wander at times. For all the good moments there are other times where the film struggles to maintain momentum. And really there isn't much of a plot to speak of. But while it may be a relatively simple story it is generally an enjoyable one. It must be said that director Wes Anderson has crafted a film which certainly looks amazing. Whether it be the wonderful Indian exteriors or the brilliantly vibrant interiors of the train itself the film always looks terrific. And the three lead actors do the visuals justice, giving excellent performances in bringing this charming story to life. It's not a perfect film by any means. It's a movie you'll embrace more for its moments than for the final product as a whole. There is the nagging sense that it didn't quite all come together. But all in all the movie works. You could do a lot worse than to take a ride on The Darjeeling Limited.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, "Darjeeling Limited" was banal and possibly even pointless. I don't think I laughed once, but then again, I didn't laugh at "Rushmore" either. In my opinion, quirky, unusual, or strange isn't enough to make me compelled to watch a film. I also do not find drug addiction, profanity, or sex-capades particularly amusing. A film needs to captivate me in some way, and this one just didn't. True, the cinematography and subtle acting were the highlights of this film... but beautiful scenery isn't enough to make me watch something, and as for the subtlety of the acting, I have to give a care about a character in order to appreciate the actor's performance. Don't get me wrong, I'm not telling anyone to avoid watching the film - I didn't hate it. I think people should probably watch it and make their minds up for themselves. I just personally didn't enjoy it and am glad I rented it rather than having paid for the theater price to have seen it. (p.s. I actually somewhat liked "Life Aquatic" and would recommend it over "Darjeeling Limited")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it i only feel compelled to write a review when i think the movie sucks? I like all his previous movies and love the subtle comedy, believe me...BUT THIS! this has like 2 funny parts and the rest is slow and boring. I wouldn't say it's crap, and i appreciate it for what it is, but it didn't do anything for me at all, easily forgotten. The tall brother who wears the glasses had absolutely nothing to add, and his character is almost non-existent. Owen Wilson is OK, but it just wasn't funny to me, and the storyline wasn't gripping enough to give me anything else. It wasn't sharp or witty. I think his comedy has become so subtle i can't even detect it anymore! Wes, sort it out! Storyline in nutshell, 3 brothers meet up in India for a spiritual journey to help them get back to being real brothers. During their journey, they ride a train (The Darjeeling Limited), they visit a market and temple. They finally meet their mother, but she does a runner somewhere. When they are about to board the plane home, they do a u-turn and go back on the train, dropping all their luggage on the way which is a bit over the top. (please don't tell me this is a deep symbolic moment because dropping your luggage when you clearly don't need to is just wasteful not to mention littering!) Watch one of his other movies instead. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Darjeeling Limited' is a whimsical film. It is essentially a tale about three brothers and their searches, one for brotherhood, another for love &amp; his writing craft, and the third for who he is in the world. Maybe I am wrong but it is my perspective and I ain't no English Professor.Yes, it has a moral like most Wes Anderson films, i.e. The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic, but in 'The Darjeeling Limited' it is eased on to you rather than like some of his others, which I felt was like thick gooey syrup poured over you.Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody), and Jack Whitman (Jason Schwartzman), are brothers. We meet them as their train trip begins, a trip that will traverse the country of India, to spend time together, share new experiences, and perhaps to 'become family again', as Francis hopes for.Brother Francis is heavily bandaged about the head, that we discover is following a near fatal accident, has caused this reunification. The brothers, we garner across the movie, have not spent much time together since leaving their dysfunctional childhood home after college. He is quite a painful character in the extent to which he goes to in trying to arrange his brothers to get this 'togetherness to recur.Schwartzman is perhaps the most endearing one. He is a writer but is unable to write originally. Is this since he had his failed romance? Or fathers death one year before? This 'dilemma' is not solved, meanwhile we are subjected to tidbits of his life, snapshots, in a written form (that we see recreated on film or during the course of the film) and we and the bros. are meant. Brody we learn is to be a new father, left his wife back home in America, and is struggling with this new phase of his life.Bill Murray pops up here in a funny cameo in 'Darjeeling?' Along with Wilson, he is another in the Wes Anderson 'family', appearing in three of his films.Sometimes I feel Wes Andersons films are like trying to compete at the Olympics in the 'most dysfunctional family' event. Like 'Oh, we beat the Simpsons, the Tenenbaums (and now the Whitmans - is that a pun or a 'homage' to the highly regarded American author?)'. 'The Darjeeling Limited' is an okay flick to see if you want a bit of fun, fluffy feelings, sightseeing, maybe a little cry, you might feel good after it, and see some of India too (shot on location). You might feel ill too. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Lost souls swimming in a fish bowl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many people who have written comments on this film have said, I do believe that Wes Anderson is one of the most most important American filmmakers of his generation, however, not many other decent filmmakers exist in his generation. Obviously, he is better than Brett Ratner, or Micheal Bay, but compared to the generation before of Kubrick, Sydney Pollack and Roman Polanki (I realize he is from Poland) Anderson has a lot to live up to if he wants to be on the level of the big boys. That being said, Darjeerling Limited is a precious film which in theory is a great concept. Three emotionally damaged brothers from the leisure class exploring a land rife with spirituality, on a train together forced to cohabitat in close quarters while seeking "bonding" and "spiritual enlightenment", however, something is inherently contrived from the beginning. The opening short is somewhat pretentious in its attempt to become mysterious. Not without its charm, the hotel room is great, with its yellow and red interiors and Natalie Portman is gorgeous with short hair and grey overcoat, Wes Andersons true calling may be interior design because he dresses such pretty sets, but anyway, the film is clever without being laugh out loud funny and interesting for those like myself who have never been to India. The film does have its charm in that we have three lost souls drifting in a sea of loneliness all cramped together while speeding to some unknown and far off location. The problem is, we have seen Anderson do this before. I understand he is at the point now that he can pick and choose and continue to remake the same film, if he really wants to become a Kubrick, Polanski or Bunuel, he must make something different and show that he is more than a talented interior designer with a Beck like knowledge of film and the ability to cut and paste in order to build elaborate collages. Lets see him do a Horror film for starters, what made Kubrick great is that he could do comedy, horror, drama, period pieces, he was constantly pushing the envelope like any true artist yearns to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like it - so will you if you're like the characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy is not my favorite category of movies but I really enjoyed seeing the Darjeeling Limited (DL) and highly recommend it, not just for the story, but also for its cinematography and soundtrack. While watching it, I was reminded of Dedication, a delightful romance/comedy film that I had seen about two months ago. If you like either or both of them, it is very likely that you do have something in common with those characters. Otherwise, you might have found them clueless and a waste of time.In DL, Francis, Peter and Jack are brothers who are trying to re-establish their bond with each other, while in Dedication, Henry is a cynical guy with obsessive-compulsive disorder finding himself in love with a warm-hearted girl. (I really can't help linking the two movies together although DL is way more sophisticated and subtle.) These characters are alike in the sense that they all have troubles in relating to other people, especially those they love, and sometimes they even cannot connect themselves with their own feelings. Somehow they have managed to get around their emotional weaknesses until a crisis happened that cast them into a situation requiring them to deal with their issues. In DL, Francis almost died in an accident, which pushed him to coordinate a journey to India to look for his mom with his brothers. It turns out that each of his brothers is having a difficult time with their loved ones. In Dedication, Henry's best friend died and he was left alone and lonely. Needless to say, the process of re-orienting themselves is not easy. This theme is actually a serious one while the humor of the movies is mostly manifested by the contradiction/struggle between what the characters say/do and what they actually think/ feel.I read some DL reviews, which have dismissed the characters as self-absorbed people. I do not agree and I feel empathetic with the characters instead. I see them as people who yearn for love but only find themselves very much disconnected. The mishap seems to have resulted from them unwittingly transferring their feelings towards family to their romantic love relationship. I was touched at different points at the movie, like Peter hiding himself in the toilet to cry over the short story written by Jack, who denies the fact that the story is actually about their family; Peter saying that he loves his wife but does not think their marriage will last long because the way he was brought up; Jack being obsessed by his ex-girlfriend after breaking up with her; the three brothers confronting their mom to find out the reason why their mom abandoned them when they needed her, etc. Another interesting character who is just as lost as the brothers is the Indian stewardess, who has to betray his boyfriend by fooling around with Jack before she allows herself the break-up. It is not clear what she feels about Jack but she was crying when Jack, along with his brothers, was kicked out of the train. She asked Jack," What's wrong with you?" and the answer given by Jack kind of saddened me ? " I don't know." Maybe because I am projecting myself to the characters or maybe it is the way that the director has meant to portray the characters, I feel that the brothers, especially Peter and Jack, are withholding their feelings in order to protect themselves. That is why Peter is expecting the failure of marriage and Jack would rather steal an affair with the stewardess than try to work things out with his girlfriend. (Note: I saw DL about a month ago and did not see Hotel Chevalier, which could have helped me understand more about what is going on between Jack and his girlfriend.) True, Jack did not know what was wrong with him and neither did his brothers - until after the funeral of the drowned boy whom they tried to save. Before the invitation of the funeral, they were heading home; after the funeral, they decided to face their fear of being rejected by their mom and go seek her out. What did the funeral do to them? It is an experience of reciprocal empathy.Given their "self-absorbed" personality, they would not have shown empathy to others if not for the life-and-death situation of encountering three drowning boys in an Indian local village. Their empathy was appreciated by the village even though one of the boys could not be saved. They were treated like part of the family of the drowned boy. I believe it is this experience of regaining empathy (that was displaced in their own family due to the run-away of the mom) that transformed the brothers. That is why although mom turned away from them again eventually, they did not grief and even become tougher than before. There is a scene where Francis was removing the bandage in a restroom. This act is a symbol of the brothers' reviewing their emotional wounds, which however still need time to heal. Nevertheless, now at least they are aware of what is wrong with them and what they want to do about it Just a few more words about Dedication ? the story is more straight forward. Henry was transformed by the empathetic responses from Lucy, the new love he found. And, the thoughts of Henry are mostly delivered to the audience by the words from his deceased friend in Henry's dream. In other words, the structure of the movie is simple compared with DL. Yet, it is very much worth seeing because of the wonderful acting of Billy Crudup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a dull page, to a vibrant camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson is one of a handful of young American filmmakers who has amassed quite an impressive underground following after only a few films. Those that already know to expect offbeat, awkwardly written, eccentric characters ruling the screen will likely have a smile plastered across their face the entire duration of what is surely one of the more original road trip films to emerge in many years. Now, I do not belong to that Anderson cult. I've mildly enjoyed what little I've seen of his, but usually found him to be somewhat overrated when hearing him discussed in (younger) film circles.It does seem apparent that The Darjeeling Limited suffers from some of the same creative indulgences that stamped some of the substance out of his previous writing partnerships. Here even more so, we have a carefree, plot-light script which relishes in it's ambiguity almost as much as it's Western spiritual ironies. The trio of actors who carry the film provide an enjoyable, intuitive comedic chemistry between them, though rarely impress individually, even coming across as underdeveloped or lazy at times.Yet somehow for all it's shallow shortcomings, Darjeeling remained a transporting, visually ravishing, magical quirk-fest thanks to the wonderful direction of these three actors physically in individual shots, amazing locations, and inspired prop design. The attention to detail inside the train alone (where a good half the film takes place)leaps off the screen and sucks viewers into the half-baked odyssey. Because of Anderson's keen eye, even an unfulfilled conclusion does not really tarnish viewer's intimate and alternative trek through India as it has never been experienced before.</fullReview>

Wes either had a humongo budget for this wreck or wages in India are even lower than I have been led to believe. No wonder all our jobs are going there.In short: Take another train.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is itself allegorical, right? The journey, the events could actually happen anywhere, not just on a trainride in a strange land? And so we see lives that have gone through various trauma, some of which is shared and some of which is idiosyncratic, and those events are revealed in different -metaphoric- ways. All events have an interconnectedness in this paradigm . . . nothing happens without some effect on everyone else, yet the effects are at times ignored or denied. Some of the effects show up dysfunctionally, some irrrationally, and some are hinted without being shown. The deeper ties that bind us are depicted as uncertain, impermanent or somehow unattainable to knowledge or experience. Do I have this right? I was not that taken with the movie.I usually like Wes Anderson's work, and wanted to like this one, but it left me a little cold. I wanted more and the more didn't materialize. I wanted it to go to a deeper level, and it couldn't or wouldn't. Maybe that was the point of the movie, and it succeeded....? Maybe I should watch it again. Maybe I have misjudged it. Maybe.Maybe I wasn't in a receptive mood when I first screened it. I have done that with a few others that when I went back a second time I discovered I had my head in a strange anatomical position first time around, and like them on second view. Maybe.I don't want to dis-recommend it to others. It may have an impact for them it didn't for me. It does show familial relationships in a most unusual way, and a way I actually found agreeable. Family ties are very strange, and stranger still when monkey wrenches are dysfunctionally inserted, and the script does touch this in its metaphoric weirdness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie much more than I did since I've liked many Wes Anderson movies in the past. This movie just didn't do all that much for me, though.Sure it's shiny and detailed and Wes Anderson has a distinctive visual style. He can repeat motifs over and over. He can play up his own little inside jokes for his fan base, give them a wink as if to say "isn't it fun being part of my club." The fact is that I didn't actually feel like the characters were in any way real. They were all exaggerated cartoons. I know that's Wes' style and it works sometimes, especially in the more comedic moments and when the characters weren't mostly just a stuttering of themes without direction. Thanks for showing us your stylistic twitches.As profound as this movie wants to be, it often came off as simply pretentious and too clever by half.I'm sure the people will fall all over themselves to defend this movie, say it's the best thing ever made and they're happy that they're elite enough to understand it while anyone who criticizes it didn't truly understand.Fine, reinforce your clique if it makes you feel better.But perhaps I (and others who criticize it) understood it just fine, but didn't have a need to try reading in as much profoundness, where there really wasn't much of actual substance there. Lots of style, lots of repeated elements, lots of flash. No one would claim that it's lacking in style, just that it lacks in believability and real feeling. The cartoon characters didn't tug at my heart strings, sorry.It's probably worth seeing for its stylistic elements, I just wouldn't go in counting on lots more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love all kinds of movies, including little "indie" films, but this movie I just did not get. I have enjoyed the key players in a number of other films, but I did not find any of the performances in this film compelling. (I can't imagine that this film will do anything to revive Owen Wilson's career as a leading man). There is no plot to speak of. It is not at all clear why Jack and Peter have bothered to show up on this "spiritual journey" orchestrated and micro-managed by their very annoying brother Francis. These three have the spiritual depth of a playa lake. As they snipe at each other and routinely betray each other's confidences, it isn't hard to understand why their own mother has gone to the ends of the earth to get away from them. None of the three brothers are likable; all come across as impossibly self-centered. After following them around India for the duration of this overly long film, I simply couldn't care less what happened to any of them. I wish I had turned the thing off after the first 10 minutes and done something useful with my evening... cleaning the oven or scrubbing the toilets would have been more pleasurable.</fullReview>

Three brothers that have nothing to say to each other keep repeating 'We have to say so much to each other'. That's it. For an hour and a half. It seemed to me like it was presented to us in real time (10 days and more). I can't understand why did it take three people to write the script for this. If there was one less or more, would it be better or worse? This is the film that could end at every minute. To cut a long story short: no story, annoying acting (especially Owen Wilson's role), dialogs that overcomes stupidity in it's pure way, unnecessary flashback scene... I didn't care about any of the characters, nor should you. Only the cameo part by Bill Murray was promising in the beginning, and after that...

		<fullReview>This is a perfect example of how to ruin a very good idea. The movie had all the ingredients to be a very good one. When we read the review on IMDb and watched the trailer we had some high expectations....: Greeat scenery, curious casting, funny dialogue and apparently a story of touching encounters between brothers and the strange world they move through... So what happened in the cinema? We'll tell you... It starts with a GREAT 'corto' (Intro) featuring Nathalie Portman in a romantic scene that reminds us of magic realism, playing in a french hotel room, great dialogues and very daring, exposing acting. Yay! Great promise! Yes! We came to the right movie! Guess what? WRONG!!! There is no depth in the characters, although they make you laugh the first 5 minutes, but from then on they're fixed, without any development, similar like the statues you will find in Madame Tussaud. However, the big fault in this arty-farty B-movie, that clutters with words like spirituality and issues around grief and brothers uniting, is the horrendous script. We also noticed Bill Murray for 1 second. He was running to catch a train... He didn't say anything and no matter how much we looked, under every rock and every plant, there was really no sense at all about that scene. Nothing. Nada. Just arty farty 'interesting' blah ... In the end of this awful ride full of repetitive scenes in slightly different angles viewed, we got the feeling that the director must have been drugged by something really boring like Prozac or I don't know what but it can be healthy. When the movie was finished, and we overcame our shock, we carefully looked around... Nobody dared to move. Awkward silence. Frozen faces all around. How can something be so boring? With this great cast, great topics, great setting and environment... how can you do that. This is not the kind of thing you want to see on the big screen and also not on DVD. This is a perfectly forgettable movie that will only leave an impression on Andersons mother...</fullReview>

Maybe the producer/directer watched too many of those stiff dull British films about the time we ran the place, then accidentally replaced all the Indian Indians with Americans in wigs and beards? There are good movies to be made about Indian experience (none of them from Bollywood - judging by the few I have seen).

Even Anderson's oddball dialog is missing in this film, though it's evident he tried. His unique style and taste from stage to sound is no longer enough to satisfy the basic requirements of a solid film. He has shot his wad. At some point I hope Anderson sheds the shallowness of mere decoration in favor of something soulful. In the end, it's all about story and characters and The Darjeeling is lacking both.

Anderson has such an opportunity to build another 'Rushmore' here, but falls flat given the task. He introduces so many elements and is virtually never able to meld them into a cohesive structure. He starts sub-tales and never finishes themThe acting too is flat and meaningless; frankly, Owen Wilson is the same repetitive character in *every movie* I've seen him in as he is here.Anderson has a real chance to show India, even if it would be as a side travelogue to the main story - he again, never gives even that simple component to us.Maybe he can revisit this in the future and fully flesh it out to deliver to the viewer the film he was so masterfully incapable of presenting with this version.Summary: wait for the DVD - maybe it will have more to it and you'll really not be missing anything that requires the Big Screen, as this lifeless story can easily be told on the little one.

		<fullReview>Despite the underlying pretentious nature of his films, I find that there is something to love or even downright adore in every Wes Anderson film. From Bottle Rocket all the way to The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Anderson has managed to amalgamate dry wit and genuine human emotion into some of Hollywood's (and the independent film scene's) most personal films of the last two decades. And The Darjeeling Limited is no different, but can easily be said to be his best work since Rushmore.Shortly after their father's death, three brothers, Peter (Adrien Brody), Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Francis (Owen Wilson), find themselves on a train in India. Francis, having organized the trip, wants the brothers to reconnect with one another, while traveling to some of the most holy locations in the country. Except they want to explore more than just holy lands.Despite being hyped to see another Anderson film, I have to say I was a little hesitant about the entire movie being set in India. It just gave off a bizarre vibe for me, and made me half assume that he went totally pretentious and was just going to deliver something akin to a Bollywood movie, but in his trademark style. But thankfully, it feels very much like the American film that it should be, and feels like it could easily meld itself within Anderson's filmography.The writing, as always, is top notch. While the actions and dialogue seemed to me to be a lot more slapstick than the usual not so subtle sand dry humour of his earlier films, Anderson manages to make it work. The words are so punctuated with that razor thin humour we are accustomed to, and the characters still act like they usually do. It just feels a whole lot less muted, and dare I say it, a little more mainstream. It does not have any adverse effects on the film at all, but it is worth noting especially for die-hard fans. The idiosyncrasies of the characters, while not amped to the point of overkill like in The Life Aquatic, are all very respectively done as well. They bring a lot of the biggest laughs for the film, but they also help hark back to the days of Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums. I am glad he continues to use them.What also works brilliantly for the film is the cinematography. Besides the classic shots and sequences typical to an Anderson movie (including some wondrous slow motion and plenty of tracking and lingering long shots), there are also many breathtaking shots of India. Whether out in the country or in the middle of a village, the film captures an enormous amount of colour and awe striking beauty. While I never noticed much care in the actual backgrounds until The Life Aquatic, Anderson seems very keen here on acquiring more than he needs in footage of India and its peoples. It gets overwhelming in some places, but only because it is so tastefully and meticulously created for the screen. It was definitely one of the highest points of the film.And of course, no Anderson film would be without its cast. The three main characters, played by Brody, Schwartzman and Wilson, are supposed to be neurotic and viciously confused brothers, and all three actors more than bring that sentiment to life. There is not one instant where they are not believable as the mismatched trio, and whether going for genuine laughs or genuine emotion, none of them drop the ball. They are very well tuned and primed for the idiosyncratic nature of their characters (Schwartzman actually helped write the script), and as quickly as the movie starts, they all disappear right into their performances. I think Brody does the best work here, but only because he is the most dead pan of the trio. It was nice to see some new blood being used by Anderson, and I hope his films only help bring him more talent.But on the same token, it was also a very nostalgic touch to include small (and tiny cameos) roles for quite a few members of his earlier films' casts from Bill Murray right down to Mr. Littlejeans himself, Kumar Pallana. Many of them do not offer anything truly significant to the film, but they help add to the thorough details in the backgrounds and foregrounds of scenes.If there is anything at all wrong with the film, it is the pacing. The film starts up quick, and blasts right through the introductions to the three brothers, before proceeding head first into their journey. But as the motivations and further elements of the journey begin panning into focus, the film loses its blinding speed and screeches to a halt. It picks up from time to time, but for a ninety minute film, it does drag itself a little. It does not get to the point of near boredom like in Life Aquatic, but it does take away ever so slightly from the film's lasting impact. Thankfully the story and acting are above and beyond excellent, so it helps the film not feel like it is stalling for no reason. But on the other hand, I just think they could have done without a few scenes, significant or not.I had my doubts, but Anderson and his crew helped prove me wrong on all counts. The Darjeeling Limited is another classic to add to his already offbeat repertoire, and it truly is the best one since Rushmore. He has helped construct a beautiful story about the search for identity, and in his own near-pretentious way, continued to show how easy it is for him to walk the line of dry humour and genuine human emotion. I loved this movie, and I wish every movie could leave me smiling like this one did.9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Logic and plot are not necessarily relevant to this movie. But it's a great deal of fun.There actually was a plot of sorts --a sort of hallucinogenic plot. It reminded me of a Beatles movie -- the rapid cuts, the Indian setting, the deadpan dialog, even the young men's haircuts. The photography, scenery and costumes were gorgeous.The relationship of the three brothers was believable. Francis was obviously the oldest. You could see where he got his assertiveness once you met his mother.The actors seemed to relish their roles. It was a pleasure to see Angelica Houston. Too bad Bill Murray's appearance was so brief. At least he got a trip to India out of it! And I loved the music! When the movie was over, I couldn't stop humming "Oh Champ-Elysees."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still in his groove, but . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of earlier commenters say they feel viewers have to take Anderson's films, technique, values, and all, as they come: He's found his groove, enjoy it or not. For me, Darjeeling Limited seems to show a filmmaker struggling to get OUT of his groove, while not abandoning the comforts of home.Among the latter: the utter irrelevance of money to his main characters; to call them "privileged" is wildly understated. They are so free of money worries that it becomes one of the main burdens they lash out against, without ever giving up one iota of the benefits offered. And not just money: Jack (co-writer Jason Schwartzman) is a "writer" whose Paris pied-a-terre is a luxury hotel suite, where he's supposed to be hiding out from "an ex-girl friend" (Natalie Portman, for God's sake: How privileged can you GET?) who flies in just to bed him.As always, Anderson's theme is finding meaning in a world where there are no limits to one's will, where you can only distinguish yourself from your velvet-plush background by wearing too much eyeshadow or running around the plains of India barefoot in a Briony suit. But unlike other Anderson films I've seen, here not only the characters but the film itself seems to be hurling itself (decorously, of course) against the walls of the doll-house. There's something scary about the joyful way the brothers throw their travel plans aside when they're invited to attend the funeral of the Indian child they failed to save from drowning: Whoopee, they seem to say, a chance at last to encounter Real Life, maybe we'll finally FEEL something! (This is not a criticism of Anderson or his film; I admire the cold honesty required to let this scene happen.) India, with all its turmoil and color, doesn't let film or filmmaker out of the doll-house. There's a truly eerie (studio) tracking shot late in the film in which most of the cast are seen, each in their own little candy-box train compartment, while the real Indian countryside scrolls by outside the windows. Anderson's not outside the box yet, but his awareness of the box is more than ever what his film is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>India inked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a troika of greats with "Rushmore", "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou", Wes Anderson extended it with "The Darjeeling Limited". This one has brothers Peter (Adrien Brody), Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Francis (Owen Wilson) traveling together on a train through India for a "spiritual journey". The dysfunctional family is clearly Wes Anderson's specialty, and he doesn't disappoint. Especially impressive is the scene showing the brothers before the trip to India (I liked how the scene throws the audience off).Are dysfunctional families becoming a cliché in Anderson's movies? Well, suspense was a cliché in Alfred Hitchcock's films, and Hitch made great use of it. Wes Anderson has made another good film here, and I recommend it. Part of the point is that, despite these people's problems, they're well-meaning. I can see the brothers as a branch of the brood in "The Royal Tenenbaums", with the luggage representing the emotional baggage with which the father left them (and then what they do to the luggage at the end).Anyway, a really good one. Anderson so far hasn't made a bad movie, and so I hope that he doesn't disappoint with "Fantastic Mr. Fox" (currently in production). Also starring Waris Ahluwalia, Amara Karan, Barbet Schroeder, Wallace Wolodarsky, Anjelica Huston, Natalie Portman, Irfan Khan and Bill Murray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This title is probably more suited to males that have brothers but definitely is not exclusive to this group.Our main, wealthy brother has had a life changing experience and is now looking to bring his family back together. What's left of his family comprises his two brothers and his mom. He (Owen) will spare no expense or detail to make sure that the end result of this journey will bring his family closer. There are PLENTY of adventures along the way that make this task more daunting than it should have been. By most accounts, these feelings (that the brothers share) could of been aired out during a Thanksgiving dinner but clearly, our group needs more time and energy to be heard. Their adventures make sense and it shows how dis-functional blood relations can be.Great writing, along with a spectacular cast make this character driven masterpiece worth investing time in.Expect some laughs, maybe a tear but also, make the time to follow a great story line. This is not a typical Hollywood format. But then again, that might be why I loved it so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Guilelessly Vague Work of Material Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This guilelessly vague dramatic comedy is a warm, engaging, funny film, very immersed in India, a land and culture of baffling beauty, and thus a brilliant opportunity for the stunning showcase of an art director. This Venusian journey of materialistic and tangible beauties begins with Bill Murray (I just contradicted myself, didn't I?) racing to catch a train in the Indian countryside. As he is about to lose the train we see Adrien Brody following the same desperate intention. Brody makes it, Murray doesn't. Brody makes his way to his compartment, where he finds his brothers, played by Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson. Wilson's head is heftily bandaged, as he was in a serious motorcycle crash. Brody and Schwartzman have come to India, apparently at Wilson's proposal, on the Darjeeling Limited, on what he wishes to be some kind of spiritual excursion.This is a great beginning which demonstrates the very character sustained throughout the film. Wilson plays an obsessive sort, which is why his younger brothers find it grueling to be in his company, which tugs the easygoing movie along. One of the film's draws is its Indian framework. Wes Anderson and his co-writers Jason Schwartzman and Roman Coppola avoid clear inducements of the exotic by surprising us. The stewardess on the train, for example, speaks standard English and seems American.Anderson employs India thankfully not as if he and his audience are tourists, but as a surrounding that is extremely palpable, a testament to the true power of cinema without the vain aide of Blu-Ray and Hi-Def revolutionizing, as we can practically smell India and dread the ferocious sun and the feeling of sweat. Take into account a long-lasting scene in which Wilson, Brody and Schwartzman sit at a table in the diner car with an Indian stranger with whom they do not trade a word. He keeps to himself. The brothers confront each other directly and overtly about their points of conflict and reservation. The Indian does not react in any apparent way. Then again, nobody ever does in a Wes Anderson film. But his tranquil being there is a camouflaged concentration of scene nicety, because all four of them could probably converse in English very well. But I think the world learns a great deal from Americans when we travel and assume that foreigners are not fluent in English. You think you like people-watching, it's people across the globe such as this Indian who take it to a whole new level.I also like how Wilson, Schwartzman and Brody elbow one another in an intimate, familial way. Yes, the film is competent with great presence and simple being and possession of itself, but it does wander. But it doesn't have an ultimate objective, other than perhaps a visceral experience of existence. Anderson may not have used a straight, constantly progressing story structure before either, but he clearly knows it, because the humor and poignancy come in the way he meddles with non-sequiturs and inconvenient interruptions of rambling.Note: Watch Hotel Chevalier with The Darjeeling Limited. Hotel Chevalier is the short film that precedes this story. It is a fun way of feeling more deeply in the know with some characters and more informed than other characters. It also has that Venusian subtlety of touch that Wes Anderson seems to bring to everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this was the first time Mark Mothersbaugh(of Devo) didn't do the music, and it kinda shows, it all sounded like Anderson's ipod left to shuffle (i almost thought this was gonna be a theme of the film, but it was just a passing in-joke), the music highlighted where emotion was happening on screen, but didn't really give me any sense of "what emotions" we were supposed to be experiencing(save for the i-pod scene already mentioned), it all just felt kinda vague like someone left the radio on in the other room. And I'm talking about the pop songs, the Indian music was okay.Though it was enjoyable and I feel like I would watch it again(and have), I just wanted more, and not in the "I hope this never ends" way, but in the "really there's not another half an hour here...or something?" sense of wanting more. The discarded luggage at the films end, though a nice bow at the end of the package, felt sudden, not unresolved, just sudden.Maybe Schwartzman as screen-writer wasn't the best idea, then again Coppla's "CQ" was okay at best, so who knows where it went wrong, and though it could have been worse, and wasn't that bad, it just left me kinda disappointed.Still Wes Anderson at his weakest is still more interesting to watch than many at their best. I can see how people could like this though, some of it feels like "Bottle Rocket", another beloved Anderson film I was't too thrilled with.Hotel Chevelaire kind of makes up for some of the weaker bits, in retrospect. It's just an encapsulation of everything great about Anderson, the music, the shrines, the dialog, the camera-work...and Natalie Portman doesn't hurt too...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Wes Anderson has created a film that has interesting and odd, including its character, script, and plot. He returns to familiar themes of family (mainly mending relationships with parents/children). The movie is not always easy to understand and the ending may leave some seeking more. There is character development, but there seem to be some holes and the plot seems to jump forward at times. But for those who can comprehend metaphors and tolerate ambiguity, viewers may leave the film satisfied.As usual, the movie's charm comes from its oddball characters, and script and thanks to the cinematographry and colors of India, it is a beautiful movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is a spectacular movie. It is directed by Wes Anderson, the king of quirk. Though everything that happens in it is pretty ridiculous, as all his movies are, somehow it seems like that's the truest reality, like no other actions could be taking place. Nothing else would make sense.The Darjeeling Limited is about three brothers who take a spiritual journey to India to become better brothers. Francis (Owen Wilson), spurred by his survival in a motorcycle crash, calls the journey together on the train. Peter (Adrien Brody) has left his very pregnant wife to go on this journey. He is not happy about the kid. He always figured they'd divorce. And not because he doesn't love her, he just always expected it. Jack (Jason Schwartzman) hasn't been in the United States in a long time, and has been living in hotels, trying to get over his girlfriend, or get with her, or do something in his post-break up period of life."Hotel Chevalier" is a short film (to be shown before the movie). It tells the story of Jack and his girlfriend (Natalie Portman). He had been hiding from her in a hotel in Paris, but she comes and visits him.Separating these parts into two separate ones is a brilliant decision. There is no way "Hotel Chevalier" could be put into The Darjeeling Limited, and The Darjeeling Limited can be seen without "Hotel Chevalier," but it completes it and makes it into one continuous and brilliant piece of art.It is Wes Anderson's most Wes Anderson-y movie to date, but I also think it's one of his more accessible films, disregarding Rushmore. There isn't as much camp as most of his movies, and it's not as funny throughout as most of his movies, but it still has that amazing Wes Anderson light gravity. I think the multicultural-ness of the whole thing is a positive; Anderson writes and directs it spectacularly, with amazing care. It's almost like a precursor to Slumdog Millionaire, the American's first steps into India without getting fulling wet, a fully American movie that just happens in India, thus transforming it into an Indian movie.The screenplay was written by Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola, and Jason Schwartzman, Anderson's best screenplay-writing group to date. Schwartzman and Wilson are no outsiders to Anderson's movies and therefore do wonderfully, as they truly understand their roles. Brody is a new addition, but does spectacularly, and in my opinion is the best in the bunch. Anjelica Huston is the mother-goddess in this movie as well, a force that drives almost every Anderson film. No one lives without her permission, and they can only live according to her standards. It's such a fascinating character that is present in The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited. The art direction in this movie is brilliant like all of his others. He understands an aspect ratio like no other director I've seen. He knows how to use a full screen, and make the space a character itself in the movie.It's nothing short of wonderful, true, poignant, brilliant, ridiculous, and stunning. No character has an unmotivated action, even though it seems they all are acting however they want whenever they want. You can tell exactly why they all do what they do. It's just so perfect. Not perfect, but perfect in that it isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The films of Wes Anderson have been compared to the cartoons that appear in 'The New Yorker' and the cartoons that appear in 'The New Yorker' are not like the cartoons that appear anywhere else. It's as if they were designed, not just with 'The New Yorker' in mind, but so that they would be integral to that magazine and just couldn't exist outside of it and you either catch the joke or you don't and even if you catch the joke you could be forgiven for thinking that maybe they aren't that funny. Clever? Very. Funny? Well, funny peculiar rather than funny ha-ha. And each successive film of Wes Anderson is becoming more and more like a series of 'New Yorker' cartoons animated into something approximating to real life. Not that you are ever likely to meet these people, and if you did meet them you might find yourself driven to contemplate suicide or murder. No-one in a Wes Anderson film goes out of their way to ingratiate themselves to you."The Darjeeling Limited" is no exception. It's a true original and yet it is utterly familiar. That's right, we met these guys before in "The "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" and before that in "The Royal Tenenbaums"; not precisely the same guys but everyone in a Wes Anderson film is drawn with the same brush, they all look the same and they all speak with the same voice. If you don't like one Wes Anderson movie you won't like any Wes Anderson movie. Fortunately, I love Wes Anderson's movies and again, "The Darjeeling Limited" is no exception. It is just as gorgeous to look at, (indeed, more so), just as funny, (and yes, I do laugh at Wes Anderson's films), and just as touching, (thematically these are movies about family and love and affection), as his earlier works.If there is a common theme running through Wes Anderson's films it is family and the relationship between siblings and their parents. Anderson may milk such relationships for their comic potential but neither is he afraid to introduce a totally discordant note either. It isn't all smart gags; people die as well, (here it's a child). Consequently, "The Darjeeling Limited" is one of the most moving of Anderson's films, (which doesn't mean it isn't very funny almost at the same time as it is drawing our tears).Despite it's exotic location, (this time three brothers make a 'spiritual' journey across India), it's probably closer in tone to "The Royal Tenenbaums" than it is to "The Life Aquatic ..." and they would make a perfect double-bill. Some critics have bemoaned Anderson's apparent 'failure' to do something different even when moving half way across the world but if it isn't broke, why fix it? No-one else could have made this movie; in that respect it's unique. It is also some kind of classic and I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, I am a fan...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and I find myself wishing more and more after every movie Wes makes that he was actually a friend of mine in real life. I like his artistic and unique point of view as a director and I think he's got a great sense of humor. I believe the trouble some people have with his movies comes from a set of expectations we all have going into a movie we've never seen before. It comes from that commercial formula most movies fit which is harmless so long as it's backed by good writing, directing, and acting---PLUS---those tricky-ass movie trailers we see, so rarely do they squash down a whole story into a real snippet of what you're going to pay for. I find that especially true about all of Wes Anderson's movies. They're so very different and unconventional that the marketing people CLEARLY don't know what the heck to do: his movies don't squash well. I LUV Royal Tenenbaums, I think it's my absolute favorite Wes movie but going back and watching the previews that were made for it, they don't do diddley squat in getting it right. SO the thing I've found with this movie as with The Life Aquatic is that it was 1000 times more fun the second go around. I remember seeing The Life Aquatic in the theater and wanting so badly to love it from the get go like I did Tenenbaums and instead found myself totally unnerved and unable to sit back and enjoy the story because it was so loose and, while entertaining, unsettling. I was apprehensive the whole way through about what might happen next in the story. Then I watched it on DVD and it was like a WHOLE OTHER MOVIE---and I LUVED IT. I still crack up at every great, wry Bill Murray line it.So, after watching the Darjeeling Limited for the first time and feeling unsure of it altogether, I decided to leave my initial reactions as they were, wait a few weeks and then watch it again to see what strung itself together for me upon a second viewing. After the second viewing: Bingo! Loved it. I found myself smiling, laughing, truly observing and noticing all kinds of soft little nuances as they came into fullness for me. It all came through: the acting, the look and feel of it, and the story. Of course, it has moments in it that will be a lot funnier to you if you come from a bigger family. I'm one of four girls and the oldest so I absolutely LOVED the part in the temple where Owen Wilson's character looks down at Adrien Brody while all three brothers are kneeling to pray and says "Is that my belt?" and Adrien Brody (the middle brother) says, "Oh, yeah. Can I borrow it?" then Owen answers, "No, not right now. I was going to wear that, I was looking all over for it this morning. Give it back." Adrien Brody rolls his eyes and relinquishes the belt, Owen follows the handing over of said belt with, "Next time, ask first." I JUST ABOUT DIED----THAT---THAT little scene RIGHT THERE sums up the biggest, longest living gripe that I have as the oldest sibling---the younger ones always take your stuff!!! ALWAYS!!! always---every oldest sibling will tell you that is the gospel truth, my friend. I have said, "Next time ask first" and "I was looking all over for that, " or, "I was going to wear that" like a broken record for the better half of my life! I also loved how Owen's character was the list maker, the one who felt he had to be in charge and take care of his brothers (which they totally resented) and yet at the same time could act so selfishly. I do that myself to greater or lesser degrees. It got me thinking that the selfishness is a natural reaction to feeling like you have to be responsible for your younger siblings all the time or you used to always have to be. It's sort of like being made into an extra parent without being asked,---your mom and dad let you know all the time that you have to watch so-and-so, and you're in charge while they're gone and it's your ass if they do anything stupid, blah, blah, you're the oldest, you're the oldest, you're the oldest... and you love your siblings, you do---but the kid in you that just wants to be a kid and not responsible for anybody misses that luxury dearly so you act selfishly sometimes to just be you and not "the responsible one", even as an adult.I just want to say: I can COMPLETELY understand why there are Wes Haters I do. I get where the haters are coming from. It's a tricky thing, being made to "work" to find what the director is trying to do with a movie. If you don't get it, it was a failure, if you see it, what a clever, artful success. It's okay if you don't like it, don't get it. I'm sad 'cause I feel like you're missing out, but that's okay. Different strokes for different folks. Just don't be so mean to my pal Wes, he doesn't make movies to tick you off---he makes them for himself, he makes them to tell stories, and he makes them for everybody else out there like me that he's won over by doing so in a way we just can't help but freakin' love---and us Wes Fans, we freakin' love the way he just keeps on doing his very own thing, disregarding any negative feedback. That's the best part, he does the work HE wants to do without compromising it for a minute. C'mon---as a hater you at the very least have to appreciate that kind of selfish, artistic integrity---the man doesn't sell out. Pretty rare in Hollywood, I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film about relationships and symbolism. To really enjoy this movie you have to get that, particularly the symbolism.The main characters do not have a perception of themselves, except through each other. When one brother makes a phone call, for example, it takes the other brother to explain what he is up to. They need each other to understand each other.I note the criticisms of the culturally insensitive perceptions of India, but, to me, that is the point that somehow location is going to improve their spiritual condition. The Indian perception is exactly the criticism that's been voiced. A silly white middle class American perception. That's the point. I mean, allowing more time at a train stop to buy an adapter than visit the temple. How 'American'.The real metaphors of redemption are channeled through Brodies character but you wonder if the mother's role in their emotional development isn't as much as fault as the deceased father. Even creating a new threat to family reconciliation in the absence of the assumed 'feared' father figure.This is a movie that has could do with more than one viewing as the subtleties are very rich. If there is a flaw it is that the more obvious symbolism tarnishes a very smart movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True escapist bliss!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True escapist bliss! So trippy, like being sucked into a new world you don't really want to leave. The story seems to unfold as spontaneously as the characters take it. The direction and editing make you feel like you're on the trip with the brothers Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) Whitman, who, in their own clumsy way, try to find some meaning in their lives after the death of their father.It's fascinating how the subplots, other characters and attention to detail don't detract from the main story, without the feel of an omniscient manipulation behind the scenes. You tend to accept anything that is thrown in an attractively haphazard fashion on screen; you drink in all their imperfections and are hooked for more. The casting of the brothers is perfect; their faces are all so enticingly odd, they don't really seem like they're acting.I feel this is where quirky director Wes Anderson excels: being able to march to the beat of his own drummer while getting others on board with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated both The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic, but for whatever reason loved this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It figures that the first Wes Anderson film critics and audiences decided to turn on would be the one where I found myself liking him again. In fact, this might be my favorite of Anderson's films, or it at least ties with the only other one I love, Bottle Rocket. I enjoyed Rushmore, but found it overrated. I despised The Royal Tenenbaums and thought The Life Aquatic was a slight improvement but still disappointing. When Darjeeling showed up, it was more or less dismissed as a retread of his previous two films. So how could I hate Tenenbaums and Aquatic but absolutely love Darjeeling? It's a mystery. I can say what I don't like about Tenenbaums and Aquatic, and I think I know the difference, but, not having seen either of those two films since they came out, it's mere speculation. Perhaps if I went back and rewatched them, I would find that my tastes have changed enough for me to allow them into my heart. For the first time ever, that's tempting. My perception now of the difference is this: I found the dialogue and plots of Tenenbaums and Aquatic to lumber around lackadaisically. I found myself paying way more attention to the vibrant visuals and great music on the soundtrack (both certainly on display here; that song that plays during the accompanying short Hotel Chevalier, and also briefly in Darjeeling, is freaking awesome), trying to avoid being too annoyed (worked the second time around, but I was merely annoyed at Tenenbaums). I never felt Anderson convinced me of the universe he was creating with these two films. The actors really didn't seemed convinced to me, either. The Darjeeling Limited seems like it has more of a purpose, like it moves forward without too much dilly-dallying. It's fast paced, and the stylized dialogue convinced me of the film's universe. In the end, I don't think The Darjeeling Limited is much more than a lark, but it's so much fun that I didn't feel like I had wasted my time. I laughed, and a lot, where I didn't at all during the previous two films. And I did find it touching at certain points. Maybe I could latch onto it because I am one of three brothers myself. Overall, a marvelous movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, Mr. Anderson...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you write a review of a Wes Anderson film? It's like trying to write a review of life. Or at least a slice of it. That pretty much sums up Wes Anderson's work; life or something like it. There are only two types of people, those that love Wes Anderson's work and those that don't understand the humor. I fall into the previous category. He takes people that we all know in real life and stretches them a little bit into the absurd. Caricatures, if you will, that he places into real life situations and with real life emotions. The Darjeeling Limited is no exception.Three brothers who have not spoken in a year are reunited on a train in India by the oldest brother played by Owen Wilson. Without telling his brothers, who think they are on a spiritual journey, Owen has planned the trip around finding their mother who never showed up at their father's funeral and has become a nun at the base of the Himilayas.The boys are popping Indian painkillers, drinking Indian cough syrup and trying to get along as they wing their way through the Indian countryside. They are soon kicked off the train for having an extremely poisonous snake on board and are stranded in the middle of the desert. This is where the story takes a dramatic turn. Not nearly as dramatic and shocking as with Luke Wilson in The Royal Tenenbaums, but enough to make you appreciate these characters even more. Never fear, though, hilarity ensues again before the end of the film.As usual, the casting is perfect and all of the leads shine in their respective roles. The cinematography is beautiful and the music feels almost as if it were a character in the movie. A terrific, quirky film that will have you watching with a goofy grin on your face and feeling good about the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasionally brilliant, elusive 'rail movie'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an interesting coincidence, both the pre-film trailers and the film itself appeared to have a common theme on the night, the awkwardness and clumsiness of Americans trying to find themselves a "genu- wine" spiritual experience in the midst of perplexing and ancient foreign cultures.The Darjeeling Limited (the name of an Indian train) follows the adventures of three brothers, played in descending order of screen age by Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman. Following the death of their father they undertake to track down their absentee mother (played by Anderson regular Anjelica Huston)who appears to have had a spiritual epiphany of her own and has run off to India to be a Catholic nun. One of the main themes, and pleasures, of the film is the changing objective of the trip. Initially intended as a 'bonding exercise' then as a sightseeing tour (exasperatingly micro-managed by the saccharine yet hectoring Wilson) the purpose ultimately evolves into a mission to scold their mother for failing to attend their father's funeral. Having finally ignored their mother's thinly veiled warnings not to come, they find the feisty Huston quite unwilling to be scolded, after which she disappears and the brothers depart India barefoot, devoid of possessions but we presume rich in spiritual treasure.Anderson appears to have reached a new level of film-making maturity in TDL as evidenced by the depth and detail of the characters, and all three brothers present as likable, convincing and complex by the film's conclusion. Despite the fact that they are banding together to seek something, each of them is shown to be running from something; Wilson from his fortune and business responsibilities, Brody (unaccountably) from his wife and new role as a father, and Schwartzman from a toxic relationship. The brothers mature via a series of mishaps and adventures (being thrown off the train by a cuckolded train-guard boyfriend, rescuing several boys from a raging river, et al) and achieve their spiritual enlightenment, as we always suspected they would, from their experiences rather than the shopping-list of temples obsessively mapped out by Wilson. The characters themselves, and the shining saffron/orange art direction throughout, are the most appealing elements of the film. Anderson would also appear to have an affectionate leaning towards 30s decadence, as evidenced by touches in both TDL and Royal Tenenbaums (such as the wonderful Vuitton luggage suite, and characters who habitually wear dressing gowns).In criticism though, perhaps I'm dating myself by daring to suggest that the contrived quirkiness of this director, so beloved of Generation Y, is a tedious detraction rather than an enjoyable element of Anderson's films. The 'short' at the beginning of TDL serves no real value other than a momentary wry smile, likewise the meaningless inclusion of Bill Murray and sundry other cul-de-sacs. Likewise the pace of editing suggested a firmer hand might have been beneficial, although this may have been intended to reflect the torpor of Indian culture depicted on the screen.For this reviewer, TDL remains a pleasurable buddy 'rail' movie with a number of genuine laughs (unlike the execrable Life Aquatic) and fused together with love between decent and affable characters, a rare enough thing these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, I recommend this movie to any Wes Anderson fan, but if you're new to this director and you have yet to jump on 'the train,' (No pun intended), this is a fantastic place to start. Set against the backdrop of preset-day India, three brothers try to piece their lives back together after the shocking death of their father. As always, Wes gives us dead-pan acting, dead-pan camera angles and dead-pan composition, his signature moves. We are never quite sure whether to laugh or to cry, but we know the emotions we feel inside. Anyone who has ever tried to reconnect with any family member needs to see this movie, you will see the parallels, as crazy at it may seem, it's true. Everyone of our families has a character just like in any of Wes' films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deapan Acting and Slow Pace - Somehow Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a lot of things- I think the primary motif and theme is the male body- the three brothers wear slim fitting, 60's or 70's style suits and accessories, and are often shown in little more than a pair of boxers or light cotton pajamas. They run in slow motion; they place themselves physically close to one another even when they are in conflict; and Jason Schwartzman's love scene with "Rita" is visually PG (no nudity, no obvious humping) - but when he licks his fingers and puts them "somewhere" down below the camera frame, he participates in one of the more sensual sex scenes I have seen. Moreover, the brothers save the three Indian boys from the river and must grasp onto them physically, bodily - this contact is essential. The father of the one dead boy also washes and oils his son's corpse. The film is about heterosexual, intimate, male-male contact- how men can become close to one another physically, emotionally, and spiritually without any suspicions of homosexual undercurrent. This male-male friendship - maybe bro-love? - is the rock upon which the shifting visual sands of the movie comes to rest. Women disrupt, but bring joy - brotherhood is difficult, it is not a choice, but it is somehow far deeper than romantic love. The film is beautiful - pure, sensual, deadpan, intentionally eccentric Wes Anderson - but betraying, as always, an emotional impulse towards the "family romance" - the inimitable love between family members that respect one another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another strange voyage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A voyage to a destination, wherever it may be, is also a voyage inside oneself . . . ." Laurens Van Der Post It's another strange Wes Anderson voyage, this time on The Darjeeling Limited, both title and train. It's much more eccentric than the train ride for Murder on the Orient Express, less humorous than the boat ride in The Life Aquatic, and much less fun than the families in The Royal Tenenbaums and Little Miss Sunshine or for that matter Dan in Real Life, but it has more somber and deeper moments than many of those while being the least comic in the Anderson canon.Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) are brothers renewing their relationship by a trip in India on the titular train. As with most Anderson characters, the trip is usually to themselves and from messy lives.What they learn as a result of the kooky occurrences along the way is never too deep to mitigate the raucous shenanigans. In the case of The Darjeeling Limited, they do learn to create their own meaning and avoid poisonous snakes. After that, I am per usual a bit stumped at what Anderson is striving for beyond a fascinating menagerie of characters and some new age sensibility about family unity and the random universe.Anderson, however, couldn't have asked for a better alignment of the fates because the troubled actor Wilson goes through the film with a bandaged head, much bigger than Jack Nicholson's bandage in Chinatown but with the same symbolic baggage: life can be dangerous for the seekers and the snoops.Speaking of baggage, in case you don't get the baggage motif during the film, Anderson hits you over the head with it in the final sequence, leading me to think he needs cheap help to relay meaning as we do to understand it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVED IT.From reading all the comments I've realized it's one of those movies that you either love or hate. I think people who didn't like it are probably interested in those obvious lame comedy movies or action movies.This movie had a wacky sense of humor that made me burst out laughing throughout it. A great story and a lot of symbolism.The movie is about a broken family, mostly three brothers who obviously love each other but are just distanced. Their oldest brother played by Owen Wilson tries his best to reunite the family.Their love for each other and their brotherhood is beautiful. I think I understood it because I myself have three sisters and we act the same exact way borrowing stuff without asking, fighting for no reason, telling on each other and so on. That is how sibling really act.The acting was magnificent. But Adrien Brody was seriously INCREDIBLE he was the star of the movie I do not have words to describe how good he was! The place where the movie was shot was also very beautiful, the bright colors, the music, everything was perfect.I recommend this movie to people who appreciate profound movies with a quirky sense of humor.And at the end of the movie in the part where they run to the train and let go of the luggage, I almost clapped. Beautiful metabolism I hope everyone picked that up!Bravo to Wes Anderson. Amazing director! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different patch of comedy Altogether</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this film, we really get to see a hell lot of India. The story basically outlines three brothers and how they set out to India to discover themselves and their relationships with each other. The basic motive from there on becomes to visit their mother. The story is very well defined, but lacked in some portions, like when they finally meet their mother, or the flashback when their mother did not come for father's funeral. Other than that, the train sequences were absolutely brilliant. One really feels the adrenaline pump when they go for the second time running to the train in the end. Another sequence which, I particularly didn't like was the part at the village. the introductory scenes where they relax in the village could be a little more thought of. so the film is basically an adventure, and the characters are very well portrayed. To show all their experiences, there is a sequence where the camera just tracks from left to right and we see all their adventures in like a train coach, this comes in when they tell their mother without any words. i think thats a fabulous scene. Overall the movie is good, but only for a one time see. You cant see this movie again and again, because it will then just bore the hell out of you. it is very slow story, but the whole movement is agreeable and works well. The comic treatment is different but really works well. It is situational comedy and if you fall for it, then you may really like the film. Really good work done by the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The next Martin Scorsese? Not yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson (Director of "The Darjeeling Limited") has been dubbed the next Martin Scorsese by none other than Martin Scorsese himself. One of the greatest and most talented directors working in Hollywood today sees some of himself in Wes Anderson, a fine accolade to pay to anyone. Being familiar with Wes Andersons work (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou etc) I can understand why Scorsese would believe that. During his career Wes Anderson has been a director that has exhibited audacity and experimentation similar to that executed in Scorsese's early work i.e. Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. However, resemblance can only be found in the fact that both have brandished something fresh and encouraging and not in their talent or artistic accomplishment. This is palpable to the fact that The Darjeeling Limited lacks artistic amelioration which can be attributed to Anderson's inability to progress artistically, and ideally, in other areas or genres during his 13 year career. This film illustrates how Wes Anderson is clearly a director that is still maturing in his abilities; it is just unfortunate that his chosen films all follow such similar paths. In being congruent to Andersons previous works The Darjeeling Limited centers around a dysfunctional family, it draws upon their character idiosyncrasies, their awkward encounters and their eclectic motivations. It concentrates on three brothers and their spiritual journey across India. One of the brothers, Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) has a hidden agenda that emerges during the trip. The agenda being that they are really going to see their mother who has become a nun. Stylistically the film is a joy to watch with it primarily being split up in two parts the first being a 13 minute short prologue called Hotel Chevalier in which the audience is treated to a back story, or prior understanding, of one of the brothers. To undertake such a decision (splitting the film) highlights Anderson's distinguished audacity as the only reason for Hotel Chevalier being a standalone chapter or even feature is that it establishes the second feature as being purely about the journey. The vast majority of directors would have incorporated this little tale into the main feature, or even dropped it all together. Once The Darjeeling Limited begins we are treated to a cameo by Bill Murray running for the train, only to be left behind on the platform ? a lovely metaphor for Anderson leaving his last film (The Life Aquatic?)behind and moving onto to something fresh and new. Unfortunately the film doesn't, it quickly becomes another Anderson vehicle that borrows and re-appropriates ideas and themes from his previous films ? just executed better.Anderson utilizes an array of techniques including slow-motion, whip-pans, long-lens zooms and gliding tracking shots that are all stylistic in approach (and witnessed in his previous work) but not really aiding in the narrative. For example, if we hark back to the work of his admirer (Scorsese) we realize that all of his camera techniques were used to complement, illustrate and further the narrative ? not just because they looked good. Quirky camera-work could complement a quirkier story (A Life Aquatic?) but in The Darjeeling Limited it is just pleasing on the eye. Furthermore because some of the techniques used are reminiscent of Bollywood cinema the films tinkers on the edge of stereotyping a nation, collaborated by its colourful imagery, spiritual platitudes and almost superficial script with lines such as "I love the way the country smells. I'll never forget it. It's kinda spicy". Although I love the manner in which Anderson works on screen I feel that his direction has now been confirmed as being rather formulaic, almost a one trick pony, much in the same way as the British director Guy Richie. Some fans will undoubtedly love his approach and crave his next release but artistically I feel hard done by that by this stage in his career he hasn't truly evolved.Overall the film is a joy to watch, it is a lovely tale of three brothers coming together and putting their differences aside. It is heartfelt, pleasing and very symbolic to their goals - the luggage they carry around being particularly emblematic especially as they poetically shed it in the final scenes. The performances are good, the story evocative and the production is, for me, the film's most striking feature. Despite my criticisms though, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone wanting to see an American film that steers clear of the more popular and mainstream ideals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old Wes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited may not be one of writer/director Wes Anderson's best films, but it retains a quirky sense of humanity and endearing character that makes it worth the whole two hours.This film tells the story of Jack, Peter and Francis Whitman, three American brothers who have not spoken to each other in over a year. After Francis gets into a near fatal motorcycle accident, he decides to bring his siblings together and take a spiritual journey across India in order to repair their broken relationship.Let me state first that if you did not like any of Anderson's previous films, than you will most definitely hate this movie. It's his directing to the very core, using all of his MO's and usual tricks to make a captivating, if not ridiculously long dark comedy that is truly about the family ties that bind.It contains just the kind of humor I've come to love- ranging from subtle, one liner jokes to outrageous chases involving cobras, pepper spray and dubious bottles of cough medicine. The actors take this humor to the very next level by putting their all into even the most ridiculous scenes, so the audience needs no help completely submersing themselves in what's going on.For all it's merit, The Darjeeling Limited leaves something to be desired in the realm of things happening. It's a film that requires some patience from it's viewers, as it has quite a few empty spots that could, in the end, have been edited out to help the flow. I mean, I love the shots of the India, they're beautiful, but I think I could deal with maybe less than a half an hour of them.All in all, this movie is a slow moving treat that has it's own very unique style and pace. It demands a lot from it's audience, but in the end gives a lot back, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to try it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will all, of course, have heard this before. I went to the London Film Festival premiere of this magnificent film, having met Wes Anderson the night before. Lovely guy! I went to the screen talk, and he is hilariously funny.I thought his latest film is a work of genius. I was quite distressed to read a review in the London Times which gave it only two stars out of five. And criticised it relentlessly.I loved this film. It was beautifully shot; the mise en scene was perfect. And the performances - well, what can I say. And the script! And the soundtrack! And the way Wes collaborates with his wonderful repertory cast is superb.I was on that train. I would have found it impossible to watch the film without the feeling of being there. I was heartbroken when Adrien Brody could not save the child.The way Mr Anderson used the scenario was truly englighening. Comedy is often dismissed as lightweight, but this film, in my opinion, used the modality of comedy to address and explore a number of serious issues - as Wes Anderson so often does. The way he addresses his apparently lightweight work (hacks beware!) to matters dark and distressing, but which affect us all, is truly superb.I found The Darjeeling Limited both intensely moving and intensely exhilarating. And visually arresting, of course. Even now, I can close my eyes, and still see myself on The Darjeeling Limited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loosely realized and melancholic, another good Anderson piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be perfectly frank here: Wes Anderson is neither trying for originality nor trying ever to one-up himself. He is, and will always be, a filmmaker of a certain sensibility, and viewership of that sensibility depends on the viewer itself. If you like wry innocence, pastel depression, and endearing melancholy, Anderson is there for you (with a popular lo-fi indie music soundtrack to boot). If that type of thing just annoys or bores you, you know not to go. Also, no matter how simply his approaches come across, his movies have a tendency to reveal more the second time you watch it."The Darjeeling Limited" is a movie that, in total with his other movies, creates a very interesting arc. It is as loosely structured and whimsical as Bottle Rocket (and Owen Wilson kind of goes back to his Dignan character with this one), but is more mature and grief-laden. Bottle Rocket and Rushmore are positive slopes about life leading up to the apex of the Royal Tenenbaums, which ends in a death and subsequently leads to negative slopes about death and grief in Life Aquatic and Darjeeling Limited. I find this very interesting and I really wonder where Anderson will go next.In the meantime, the film itself, removed from all those external elements: The Darjeeling Limited is about three brothers on a so-called spiritual journey across India. Like many brothers, they have problems with each other and haven't talked in a year. Like grievers, none of them has fully gotten over their father's death. Like sons, they are under the impression that they can find their mother and take her away from the convent she joined. Like Americans, they have no idea that the moments they spend isolated together in random out-of-the-way locations are much more important to their spiritual discovery than any planned trip to an Indian landmark. And like tourists, they never can seem to realize that they just need to leave their luggage behind.It's warm, sentimental, and endearing, just like what Anderson does. The inclusion of Adrien Brody to his cast is brilliant--honestly, this film almost makes an argument that Brody is what Anderson has been missing all along, only that Anderson hasn't really been missing anything.On the other hand, and I find myself saying this more and more often and it's starting to annoy me, but what is it with contemporary movies and their inability to end? Anderson feels this time like he has to wrap everything up, but since the movie is already very loose and playful I'm not entirely sure it's necessary. Once again, it seems like there's three or four endings where there should be one. Have modern filmmakers just lost the fine art of the ending? Not that this one drags too much... the sensibility of it is enough that each subsequent scene manages to hold up impatience and continue with its melancholy. But still, I'm getting increasingly fearful that one of these days we're going to be regularly treated to hour-and-a-half movies with an added hour tacked on to the end.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A train journey for the spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Another cup of tea dear? It's Darjeeling." I've forgotten which aunt used to tempt me so, but she would not have been aware that though only 10,000 tonnes of Darjeeling tea are produced each year, about 40,000 tonnes are actually sold. This film is not about Darjeeling either. It is about families and travel and their effect on one's psychological state.Following the death of their father, Francis, Peter and Jack Whitman from an affluent but dysfunctional New York family are brought together by Francis (Owen Wilson) for a train trip in India on board the "Darjeeling Limited". The initially undisclosed objective is a reunion with their mother (Angelica Huston) who has become a nun in an Indian convent but Francis bills it as a spiritual healing experience. Each is carrying a lot of personal baggage ? Francis recently nearly killed himself (possibly deliberately) in a motor cycle accident, Peter (Adrian Brody) is on the point of leaving his wife just as she is about to have their baby and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is getting over a recent break-up. Naturally they bicker and fight and eventually get turfed off the train. The journey continues however, and it becomes even more eventful.Wes Anderson's India is indeed a fantasy, but quite a realistic one. The train attendants are a model of civility in the face of the Americans' increasingly oafish behaviour. The train's décor is delightful and the service excellent, though having it off with one of the passengers (Jack is desperate) is probably not in the attractive female attendant's job description. Alas, no such train exists - the real railway to Darjeeling in West Bengal is a 2 feet gauge "Toytrain" which lacks both a dining car and sleepers. The film turns more serious after the ejection from the train, and the "ugly Americans" become less offensive. In the end, we almost finish up liking, or at least understanding them.Despite taking a dislike to the brothers Whitman (why Whitman ? a reference to Walt the poet?) at the start I enjoyed the journey and was impressed by all the main performances. Owen Wilson as Francis is particularly good ? a big brash brat nearly at the end of his tether. I also enjoyed Angelica Huston as the Mother very superior.Anderson makes great use of the desert scenery of Rajasthan (which is nowhere near West Bengal). I liked the sight gags ? Bill Murray as the platform-running businessman, the 11 pieces of matching "elephant" motif luggage etc and I liked the respect shown for Indian culture. Travel may or may not broaden the mind, but it can provide some excitement, and there is plenty of that here.The version I saw had the 10 minute prequel "Hotel Chevalier" in which Jason has an unsatisfactory encounter with his girlfriend in Paris. I thought I had walked into the wrong film to start with, but it makes sense eventually.</fullReview>

He has made interesting looking films, some bursting with ideas, but has yet to deliver a truly great film, from first minute to last (and yeah, I've seen all of his films and not one of them works completely).As I watched "The Darjeeling Limited" I was stupefied. Scene after scene, we are treated to the most stilted and artificial dialog. There is no progression in this film, pretty amazing for a road movie. Only with the funeral of the young boy does the film touch anything close to recognizable human behavior.By that time I had my fill of these three brothers, and I have to say not for a minute- not for a SECOND- did I buy that these were flesh and blood human characters. There's not a frame where you're not aware that you're watching three actors in a very precious movie- and I like these actors. And the pretensions of the "Play With Fire" scene are insufferable.Also there is nothing in the film that can be even considered remotely funny.At this point I have to nip all these people who have been snookered by this movie in the bud. The most tiresome thing I read here is how clearly this movie isn't for everyone because it's so sophisticated, so "droll" (um, no), and not "obvious." With the clear implication that those of us completely unmoved by "The D. Limited" simply can't appreciate some of the finer things, and we must be simply conditioned to respond to "obvious" commercial film-making.Try again. I like and on occasion read "The New Yorker." I hate Jim Carrey movies and most of what passes for comedy out of Hollywood. And this is just as bad, just in an entirely different way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Need to Sleep??? Wes Anderson made a solution for you!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie is the not a good movie... It is weird, it as a bad plot. I cannot even identify it's genre! Is it a comedy, drama or what! I think it is just a bad idea, a bad spend of budget and a big waste of acting by two good actors such has Adrien Brody and Owen Wilson. They should regret the day, they accepted to participate in this movie. The only good thing in the movie is the Hot Sri Lankan girl that appears in a few scenes. I am being benevolent to give 3 on my vote... And the director Wes Anderson, as really a bad taste and a strange humor. The Royal Tenenbaums were also a movie that i thought to myself, who remembers to make a film like this. Some people think that the movie are original, i just think of them as annoying and uninteresting. But if you need to sleep, this movie is better that any sleeping pill. After 20 minutes you will be snoring!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to be remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have the capability to leave you speechless and awestruck; The Darjeeling Limited is one of those films.The Darjeeling Limited is an independent film directed by Wes Anderson. Wes Anderson has done other films including Rushmore, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Royal Tenenbaums. Those who enjoy Anderson's films will find The Darjeeling Limited just as enchanting and emotionally fueled as the previously mentioned.The Darjeeling Limited focuses on three brothers (Peter, Francis, and Jack Whitman) as they travel on a train (The Darjeeling Limited) through India. The three brothers haven't spoken in almost a year and the oldest (Francis) brought them to India to partake on a spiritual journey to try and "find" themselves." The thing that made this film so incredible was the fact that it had an emotionally impacting storyline and such an amazing set of actors to back it up. The three brothers are played by actors Owen Wilson (Night at the Museum), Adrien Brody (The Pianist), and Jason Schwartzman (Slackers).Owen Wilson brilliantly played his role of the older brother trying to bring his family back together. Not once during the film does he give the audience the slightest hint that he is anyone other than Francis Whitman. Throughout the whole film all three of these actors give an outstanding performance. The person who steals the film though was Jason Schwartzman.Schwartzman plays a small time writer who has just undergone a hard relationship. He writes stories about what happens to him and claims them "fictional." Schwartzman plays this part to the tee. Alongside such big names as Wilson and Brody he had a lot to prove and he did so flawlessly. Throughout the entire film his brilliance and talent show through.The people who enjoy movies with idiotic violence, unnecessary nudity, or high priced special effects probably would not enjoy this film. This is a piece of beauty that needs to be seen more than once to be able to fully understand it.Anderson's capability to be able to invoke such raw emotion in a film is something very few directors can do. Whether it has the viewer laughing out loud or has tears rolling down their eyes, this is truly a film to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rusty film that's at times very affecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first came to know of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson with their debut "Bottle Rocket." It's a great "little film that could" and a great showcase for Owen Wilson's deadpan buffoonery. It also set Wilson up to be a star.When "Rushmore" was released a couple years later, I was the only person belly-laughing in a half-full theater in Evanston, IL (the ones by Ryan Field and Mustard's Last Stand - they may be closed by now, I don't know.) I recall insisting I had seen a movie of amazing import and it has remained a favorite ever since. I guess you could call "The Royal Tenenbaums" Anderson's first attempt to wrangle control from Wilson and it shows in Anderson's increasingly fussy directing style - this style served the slacker comedy of "Bottle Rocket" well as it did the more indulgent art direction of "Rushmore" - a legitimate masterpiece. But the fussiness on-screen in "Tenenbaums" also scared me away from the Wilson-free scripted "The Life Aquatic" and my own instincts were confirmed by other Anderson fans.So it was with some hesitance that I finally saw "The Darjeeling Limited" which can most directly link somewhere between the lost, free-associative world of "Bottle Rocket" and the stagy, East Coast-y world of "Tenenbaums." It's a looser film than Tenenbaums and yet seems more emotionally stifled. I longed for one of the cast's wonderfully deadpanned characters to just break down and weep for all their obvious emotional trauma. What I would have preferred to see achieved in a meaningful scene (even a short one, like Ben Stiller's final, heartbreaking line in Tenenbaums - "I've had a rough year, Dad") was instead finished with stagy and obvious symbolism.I've loved Anderson's films for their war on intellectual snobbery and mass stupidity alike. But it seems that war is more Wilson's than Anderson's in the end. Even in Darjeeling, which Wilson is not credited as writing, he still delivers some of the best lines that illustrate the struggle between inner intelligence and connecting with other people. His character takes it upon himself to carry the emotional load for his younger brothers abandoned by their mother.I hope Wilson goes back to the page for their next collaboration - their best efforts have all been linked somehow to his input as much as Anderson's. It appears their personal relationship isn't fractured and yet they haven't written a script since "Tenenbaums" and Anderson appears to be setting off for more ambitious-appearing films, like the Roald Dahl adaptation "The Fantastic Mr. Fox" which will no-doubt be yet another showcase for his fastidious mise-en-scene. Let's hope after that exercise in art direction, he'll yearn for Wilson's earthy charm and the two will write another masterpiece on par with Rushmore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice, heartfelt story about three brothers on a adventure of discovery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This kind of film is not the norm for me. So, I was not running to the theater to watch it. I am very happy that I saw it at the theater, though. Dargeeling Limited is the sort of film that one needs to pay real close attention to. There are a lot of great moments between the three leads. They are the Whitman brothers, played by, Owen Wilson/Jason Shwartzman/and Adrian Brody. The title refers to the train that our brothers are taking through India. Directed by Wes Anderson, who also wrote the original screenplay. Anderson is not one of my top 20 filmmakers. However, I think that he deserves to be praised for this work. For a couple of reasons-originality, humor, great performances from the three leads, interesting settings, and original screen duologue. It needs to be said that some of the camera movement was a tad jarring. Though, that did not distract me from watching the film. It is always a treat when the cast of a film is joined by one of the most gifted actresses of cinema. In this case, that actress is Anjelica Houston. She plays the mother of the Whitman brothers. Her role in the film is very short, but she steals every scene she is in. With a performer of her talent, it seems effortless. In closing, this is a real well acted, and written film. I will recommend Darjeeling Limited to friends and family. I expect it to be honored during awards season.Josh Weinman</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of the strange comedy that Wes Anderson likes to throw at his audiences, I was extremely excited to hear that another Wes film was going to be released. Especially because it has many of the regulars including Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray (although his part is sadly quite small). I was also excited about fantastic newcomer Adrien Brody. Not only was I excited to see this film, but in addition, I was nervous. I had not truly enjoyed The Life Aquatic before, and I hoped that Wes could really make a film as good as The Royal Tenenbaums, or Rushmore. All that needs to be said is that he did. Excellence is shown in every seen of the film with great chemistry amongst the brothers Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrian Brody, with great scenes of Wes Anderson's true comic genius. The music was wonderful bringing back some fantastic Kinks Music, some Rolling Stones, and Indian music to go with the atmosphere. The character development could have been slightly better, but it was better that most movies already, and the comic moments could have been closer together, but those very minor faults were fixed with more character additions that were wonderful and developed well for however much time they received on screen, and the heart-warming scenes of three brothers trying to find themselves in a distance land while at the same time, dealing with the good and the bad of the world around them. Laughs come hard, tears may come on the end (depending on how emotional you are), and enjoyment can be found throughout Wes Anderson's terrific new film, The Darjeeling Limited. Pay, hop on, and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modest But Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three estranged brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman) meet up for a reunion of sorts on a train ride through India, to have a "spiritual experience" -- as Wilson's type-A, over-controlling oldest brother calls it -- and to reconnect with one another after their father's death. They realize that a truly spiritual experience cannot be forced, but comes when you're least looking for it, and they all end up a little happier if wiser by the time the movie ends.You're forgiven if you find Wes Anderson's hyper-self-aware style of film making simply too quirky to bear, but I myself really enjoy being in the worlds he creates on screen. I love what he does with music and art direction -- the meticulously detailed train on which much of this movie takes place is a wonder of production design -- but more than that I like how his movies make me feel. They all end on a mostly happy, uplifting note, but the happiness is always tinged with melancholy. The brothers in "The Darjeeling Limited" find a sort of peace with themselves and with one another, but their problems don't just vanish into thin air, unlike their mother, played in a small but typically wonderful performance by Anjelica Huston, who obviously can't deal with the death of her husband at all and holds a mirror up to the brothers, showing them the kind of person they don't want to be.Anderson's movies always have rather modest ambitions, but in his case I feel like this works in favor of his films rather than against them.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smooth Ride of the Darjeeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's make an agreement. Wes Anderson is a talented filmmaker. He has a distinct vision that may not be for everyone's taste but his films are always colorful and his writing is always exploratory. His characters are usually bizarre exaggerations of downtrodden souls struggling to get back to the surface. The situations they find themselves in are far removed from the realities of the audiences that flock to enjoy them. The same faces reappear in film after film, from Bill Murray and Owen Wilson to Anjelica Huston and Jason Schwartzman, making his films feel at times like you're hanging with the cool crowd. Their cool factor is only upped when they find themselves staring directly ahead in close-ups in the foreground of the screen ? one of Anderson's signature visual styles. All of these factors either delight Anderson's numerous fans by appealing to their desire to revel in offbeat humour or repel his detractors who consider his work to be pretentious and empty. Keeping with the film's spirit of healing and progress, I propose we leave what we know of Anderson behind us and open our minds to THE DARJEELING LIMITED ? his most accomplished and satisfying film. Can we agree to that?Wilson is Francis, the matriarch of sorts to Shwartzman's Jack and Adam Brody's Peter. He has convinced his two brothers to join him on a spiritual journey through India aboard a train by the name of The Darjeeling Limited. The last time they were all together was a year prior, at their father's funeral. None have healed fully from the experience and it is Francis' intention to reconnect the threesome so that they can all move forward together. Albeit a well-intentioned concept, the damage done by their family dynamics throughout the years has made it near impossible for them to trust each other. Whenever one is absent from the trio, the two remaining take the opportunity to share something they don't want the missing brother to know. It's as if they are choosing the brother they know will handle whatever news they are imparting better. Realistically though, they each know that the moment they leave the room, the brother they told will tell they brother they avoided telling everything. In that regard, they do want to share with the group but they just don't feel comfortable doing it directly. They play these boyish games while rejecting the need for Francis' persistent mothering but whether they are buying poisonous snakes at village markets or chasing each other through adjoining train cars, it is clear that there are still many stops before maturity.When the brothers are not busy sifting through the manipulation, they are seeking out spiritual enlightenment. With its rich tapestry of golds, blues and yellows, India makes for the perfect place for them to lose themselves with hopes of rebuilding. However, the copious amounts of extra-strength, locally found drugs the three share suggest that they aren't quite finished numbing their pain just yet. Regardless, the journey itself and its intended purpose imply that healing is desperately needed. What the boys don't realize is that healing can't be forced. They visit temple after temple and partake in many a ritual hoping to put their past to rest without actually talking about or facing their very real issues. They're trying so hard though and they clearly want it so bad, need it even. As they struggle to force it, it only seems to get further away from them. An urgency and a hope results in the viewer. These are likable guys and you want them to get what they need. In that respect, Anderson places you directly on the train along with them so that you too are along for the ride.THE DARJEELING LIMITED is not a train wreck in the least. In fact, it is the opposite. It is a scenic ride that chugs along toward inner peace. The lull of the train serves to calm the chaos and it soothes the viewer as it does the brothers. With the train constantly moving forward, Francis, Peter and Jack will inevitably reach their destination, even though they don't really know what that is. And with the speed it's moving at, they can't get off even though they might want to. Lucky for them, with Anderson wearing the conductor's hat, there is no chance the train will be derailed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman are the headliners of "The Darjeeling Limited," Wes Anderson's comedy in which three brothers, who have drifted apart since the death of their father, embark on a spiritual quest through India in the hope that the journey will somehow bring them closer together. As he did in his previous (though better) films, "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore," Anderson creates a slightly off-kilter world populated by benignly eccentric characters - only, in the case of "Darjeeling," the comedy is muted and the vision bland (making it more on a par with "The Life Aquatic" and "The Royal Tenenbaums," two of Anderson's lesser films).The price of Anderson's subtlety is that not a whole lot really seems to happen in the movie and the characters never get much of a chance to differentiate themselves from one another. Each of the brothers is assigned a peculiarly defining quirk or eccentricity, but neither the actors nor the filmmakers (the movie was co-written by Schwartzman and Roman Coppola) seem to know quite what to do with them. The result is that the comic bits fall flat, while the "meaningful" moments seem tacked on almost as an afterthought.Wilson (sporting a full head bandage throughout), Brody and Schwartzman do what they can with their roles but the monotonously deadpan tone of the comedy keeps them from breaking out on their own and engaging the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Wes Anderson...amusing, clever, hip and a bit lightweight. He needs to make a movie without his cocoon of film friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of Mickey yelling out, "Hey, gang, let's put on a show in the old barn!" we have Wes Anderson calling together all his film-making friends and saying, "Hey gang, let's make a movie in India!" And being Wes Anderson, we can expect the movie to be amusing, warm, clever, heavy on the protagonists struggling to learn life's lessons...and lightweight. The Darjeeling Limited, a story of three brothers traveling in India who are trying, sometimes reluctantly, to resolve family issues, has a number of fine qualities. Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman work very well together as the edgy brothers. All the actors are fun to watch. Bill Murray has an amusing and wordless bit as a man racing to catch a train. The settings throughout India are intriguing. There are one or two delayed jokes that can create a smile. But in my opinion there's just not much weight behind the hip, gentle humor. Anderson's fascination with relationships is nothing new. And with Anderson's need at the conclusion to underline the movie's message -- we need to discard all that old baggage we keep hauling around -- by making the message literal, we wind up not with a gentle moral message but with ponderous movie making. I have a feeling that if Anderson is unable or unwilling stop making movies without the comfortable cocoon of like-minded film friends around him, he's going to fade into repetitive irrelevance. Even cleverness is no substitute for a well-constructed story. For instance, The Darjeeling Limited comes with a 13-minute seemingly separate film short which takes place enigmatically in a suite in a Paris hotel. The two unnamed characters are played by Schwartzman and Natalie Portman. There are silent expectations and silent moments, some sad and smart dialogue, and we get the idea that the woman left the man, may be coming back into his life...but maybe not for long. A bed plays a prominent part, with Schwartzman staying clothed and Portman nude. What's the point? None, except as a little slice of accomplished film-making. We wind up, during those 13 minutes, getting involved with these two people and their attempt, especially by the Schwartzman character, to hope for the best. Ah, but then in The Darjeeling Limited, we find that the short was just a set-up, and an unnecessary one, for another amusing delayed bit of character humor. Was it needed? No. Was it clever? Yes. Is it an example of the kind of flabby storytelling and insider cuteness that can happened among film friends who are making a movie? I think so. What I really enjoyed about The Darjeeling Limited was life aboard the Indian train as it chugged through the countryside for half of the movie...what the old, elegant sleeper compartments and the fringed dining car looked like...how the tea and snacks were delivered...what the system of ticket taking was on board...how the train attendants worked...what the train stations looked like. But then I like trains. But I'm not so sure I'll be eager again to get on board another Wes Anderson movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As commented so frequently in prior reviews, Wes Anderson's poetic soul either speaks to you or it doesn't. Wes's movies are comparable to Bob Dylan's music. Subtle, big on imagery, metaphors &amp; symbolism. No good or bad, it just feels natural to you or it doesn't. I don't mind the repetitive characteristics of his movies....issues of redemption, self-truth &amp; coming to terms with family. When he done working those issues out personally, I bet he'll move on in his subject matter.**spoilers** (to read after movie) Symbolism: A. Arian B's character could not save "his" little boy as he could not save his father. In both circumstances he was covered in blood.B.By experiencing the moving Indian Family's funeral for their little boy the were able to heal their emotional displacement at their own father's funeral, and able to grieve them both.C.Jason S.'s lack of shoes (even in the Natalie Portman movie) represent him trying to "ground himself" on the earth and dirt because he was so lost.D.Most obvious symbolism: shedding their baggage at the end of the film...lovely imagery.I'm sure there is a ton more, I'll see it again. I love my poets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darling Darjeeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson strikes again. The hearts of adolescents, twenty somethings, and angst ridden aesthetes beware. Darjeeling Limited has come to deliver all the surrealist colors, sparse quirky dialogue and oddball characters that we somehow must love. Extrapolating on the trend, I first expected that the fifth or sixth(if you include Hotel Chevalier and please do) installment of Anderson's opus would be even more outrageous and stylized than the previous, Life Aquatic. But this film is almost toned down, and the scenery and people of India are aloud to shine fully without the distractions of clay-mation critters or a dreamy techno-color universe. Adrien Brody's presence is more appreciated for his spindly yet beautiful body than his lackluster acting, which makes me wonder where the leading man of 2002's well played flop, Dummy was. Nevertheless, combined with the now suave genius of Jason Schwartzman and that Blond Wilson charm the trio is so likable that I just want to enjoy a bottle of opiates and a cigarette with them by the campfire. Overall this film will most likely be forgotten. It is smaller than Anderson's other work, and I don't think it can stand to those massive casts and lengthy plots. Yet what does stand out is the mastery of craft. Every shot, every prop, every line is chosen with such perfect taste that I'm sure the one hour and a half can rival any four year cinematic education. Take a date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been my first real Wes Anderson experience (I saw Tenanbaums when I was 10, but hardly remember it), and I am so glad it was. He knows how to direct his actors so that their every expression is presented with wonderful clarity and realness. He knows his characters well and write them to do something they wouldn't do. In the beginning, there are a few secrets kept from a different brother, and you think that they are going to hold them in until a final burst at the ending, but instead they pushed out right away, and the story goes on. That shows the reality of these characters and their actions, and that this film doesn't live in la-la land. It lives with real people in a real world, and it tells a wonderful story, with well written dialouge and plenty of laugh out load moments, as well as a great soundtrack to move along. There is a strange feeling at the ending that makes you unsure if it's positive or negative, but you forget almost instantly afterwards because you still can't wipe the grin off your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was bot so much "terrible" as it was totally meaningless and strained. Wes Anderson, whose previous films I love, is starting to feel a bit like a one trick pony. This movie tries so desperately hard to be quirky and original, but just ends up with the feeling that we've seen it all before from Anderson, only this time around its worse. Everything feels familiar, and not in a good way. The tableau imagery, the quirky music, the pacing of the dialogue and events, even the characters seem kind of familiar.I hope that Anderson does better with his next film. It's about time that he renewed or reinvented himself. If he quits trying to be consciously quirky for originality's sake, I have a feeling that real originality will come, this time without feeling contrived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but it could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of director Wes Anderson's.I know almost everybody loves Rushmore and The Royal Tenembaums but they did not totally convince me.I know I'm in the minority in this,but I think his best movie so far is The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.That film had complex and honest emotions,and it was very interesting.Now,I think The Darjeeling Limited is quite inferior to The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,and even though it's an interesting movie,it did not leave me completely satisfied.First,let's go with the fails.I think The Darjeeling Limited lacks of a narrative focus and I also found this movie pretty diffuse.Still,this movie has positive points.The Darjeeling Limited has complex emotions and the actors are perfectly chosen for their roles.The one who specially stands out is Owen Wilson.He frequently appears on mediocre comedies but,in this movie,he shows that he can do much more than what he does on the comedies he participates.The Darjeeling Limited is a good movie and I had a good time watching it.But,I did not find it very memorable, and the screenplay does not feel polished enough.In summary,good effort from Anderson but not completely satisfactory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patronising and insulting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters are preoccupied with their own sentimental and narcissistic feelings. They travel through India with the attitude that the American foreigner is both best and desirable. Take for instance the scene of the Indian train attendant suddenly having sex with the American protagonist. How revolting an idea for any woman and how patronising to the audience. I suggest the film reflects American cultural insularity in the world to a tee - e.g the scene in the market place where they joke about not being able to get size 10 1/2 shoes - where have these grown men been all their lives - a poor reflection on all who took part in designing this film and its characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rushmore made me a huge Wes Anderson fan. I rushed out to see Royal Tannenbaums and loved it. Although Life Aquatic had some cool moments, I left that movie feeling pretty deflated. But okay, all directors are allowed slip-ups. When I saw the preview for Darjeeling I got really excited, and couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately, it's another big disappointment. All of Anderson's great visuals are there, and it's eye candy just like his other films. But, the film is really about very little; and anything it is about is not of great substance or original. This is a great shame as his early films really managed to fuse style and substance in a unique way. I hope this great director finds his course again. I so wanted this film to work, and it just fell flat. I was bored ten minutes in. Owen Wilson doing Owen Wilson got irritating, and as much as I love Jason Schwartzman and Adrien Brody, they didn't show more than about 3 expressions through the movie. I'm sure there are many die-hard Wes Anderson fans out there who will rave about the brilliance of this film, but if they're honest with themselves, they'll admit it's time for Wes to come up with something really new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experience to share, "The Darjeeling Limited" is the director's and year's finest feature yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's fifth film is not only his best but one of the most perfect film experiences I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. The film had me absolutely captivated throughout its entire running time. I found it impossible to divert my attention or find a flaw. An enlightening and refreshing piece of work. Anderson dips into similar themes like in his previous "The Royal Tenenbaums", "Bottle Rocket" and "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou" of family and loyalty; reuniting them and having his characters fix their loose ends. And again, like the others, one of the characters tries to repair it with a plan, a journey. It features his pleasant ironic humour, flawless choices of mood music and extraordinary art direction. He is a required taste, that I, of course, boast. And I now have the incapability to get it out of my head.Owen Wilson (Francis Whitman), Adrien Brody (Peter Whitman) and co-writer Jason Schwartzman (Jack Whitman) star as three estranged brothers, who have not encountered each other since their father's funeral a year before. Francis, who has had a near death experience so his face wrapped in bandages throughout the film, has planned a spiritual awakening aboard The Darjeeling Limited, which is heading straight through India, to re-connect with his living family and appreciate life, in the form of adapting to another culture. Unfortunately, through a complication of an escaped poisonous snake, a recent purchase of Peter's, and a man-eating tiger prowling their mother's territory, their arrangements are destroyed and so are their placements on The Darjeeling Limited leaving them 11 enthusiastically designed bags, a printer and a laminating machine. But that doesn't stop the spiritual quest they are searching for. In the end, its about 'Leaving the baggage behind (forgetting and forgiving the past) and seizing an opportunity (looking towards the future)'.Anderson has finally convinced me he is finest living director. He may have no range and one style. But he is no less than perfect at it. In "The Darjeeling Limited", you could just judge it from the first 5 minutes. Anderson keeps a welcome consistency in tone, visuals and humour. The unique design he has put forward to this masterpiece (which has been in developing from his previous films), is putting the focus directly in the middle of the screen. This feels as quirky as possible as directors usually film at an angle for a more realistic stance, plus its easier to do. The style felt truly phenomenal due to me sitting right in the middle of the theatre with no-one in front of me. What is wonderful to know is that Anderson (plus his co-writers, Roman Coppola and star Jason Schwartzman) wrote this as they experienced it. They went to India for the inspiration. This tremendous effort they put forward personalizes the film further. My summary line was "An experience to share?" which is in reference to them sharing their experience on film. Ironically everyone who went to see it with me hated it. Anderson is an acquired taste.The film has possibly the greatest art direction of all-time. It's so unbelievably striking and vibrant that I can remember every second of it. Everything. Everything is perfect. Everything is perfectly arranged. The way you think portraits as perfect. This had an extremely profound effect on me. I sat there; leaning forward (so I could see it first, in a way) with an astounded expression on my face and a completely tense position. I wanted to pay full attention because I knew this would be the greatest and most perfect film experience I would have the pleasure of having. I wanted to savour every second. Full concentration. Like most Anderson's, the choice of music perfectly compliments the mood; which feature in the films of the inspiration for "The Darjeeling Limited"; Satyajit Ray. It's a delightful unison I adore.A reason for why this film is so perfect is in the way it translates the relationship between brothers on the screen. It is impossible to hide secrets from one another (they only talk about each other to the other brother, who then just tells them instantaneously), as they know each other too well. And they understand each other too well. Meaning they don't argue or fight; much. Peter can tell instantly what one of his brothers is doing on the phone. Jack can't keep his secrets from them, because they know him too well. And Francis decides what his other siblings want, whether it be exampled from including Jack in arguments with Peter or ordering them their food. They feel the need to print their initials on their baggage and take far more medicine than they need. Being a child of three brothers like the characters in the film personalized it massively and I reached a far greater understanding of the film than I ever thought I could have. I can't and don't think I have fully expressed my incredible passion for this film. Perfect in every way. Any flaw you may have found cannot bend my opinion. I award it a top 5 placement in my all-time list upon my first viewing and might join the race for my favourite. Well done Mr. Anderson, I await your films to come.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun road movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of their father, three brothers Frances, Jack and Peter Whitman, who have grown distant, decide to have a life affirming bond building train trip across India to re-ignite their friendships. Their adventure takes in love matters, death, addiction to over the counter drugs and a quest to find their missing mother. I'd never class Anderson as being an out and out comedy filmmaker, as there are too few laughs in his films, but his films are amusing to a point and this is no different. Their journey is part your typical road movie, lots of oddball characters in an unusual environment. Darjeeling Limited is slow but entertaining in an odd kind of way and with a solid cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Enjoyable Wes Anderson Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say Wes Anderson films are idiosyncratic is like saying David Lynch films are surreal or that Alfred Hitchcock films are suspenseful - it's kind of a given. Anderson's oeuvre thus far consists of unusual comic drama hybrids featuring inept criminal capering (Bottle Rocket), a high school student's fall and rise (Rushmore), a deeply dysfunctional dynasty (Royal Tenenbaums), and a father-son reunion set on an undersea search for vengeance (the under-appreciated Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou). It's the details, though, that make his films wonderfully fresh and original; such as Max Fischer's (Jason Schwartzman) plays in Rushmore or the Adidas tracksuit wearing family unit in Tenenbaums or Seu Jorges Portuguese covers of David Bowie in Life Aquatic. From the first shot, The Darjeeling Limited stands far and wide from most modern Hollywood cinema, beginning with the short film Hotel Chevalier, the story of a fractured encounter in a hotel room with Jack (Jason Schwartzman, an Anderson regular and a Darjeeling scriptwriter) and his ex-girlfriend (Natalie Portman). The short film is separate from Darjeeling (it even has its own credits), though it features one of the main characters; it's referenced in the film, but doesn't having an overwhelming bearing on the plot. Though it may be confusing for some, Hotel Chevalier remains a nice touch for the fans, comparable with the Cousteau-esquire underwater film within a film that opens Life Aquatic. The main feature continues a theme of Anderson's latter works ? the family reunion. The brothers Whitman - a heavily bandaged Francis (Owen Wilson, who has worked on all the Wes Anderson's films), Peter (Adrian Brody), and Jack - meet up in India after a year apart to try and reunite with their estranged mother Patricia (Angelica Huston, an Anderson matriarchal character again). All three brothers, who last saw each other at their father's funeral, are on the run from something in their lives, as they travel by train ? the titular Darjeeling Limited - across the country. En route they aim to have a 'spiritual journey', with clumsiness akin to Homer Simpson's vision quest. The brothers can function when engaged in activity or exchanging prescription drugs, but tellingly, two given brothers will talk behind the other's back. Unsurprisingly, things deteriorate to the point that they get into a fistfight, thrown from the train, and inadvertently find the heart of India. Anderson, Schwartzman, and Roman Coppola's script shows great attention to the character quirks, leading to funny personality clashes, and the actors are each suited to their roles. Francis is controlling and dominant, even taking to ordering his brothers meals and having his travelling personal assistant write up their laminated schedules. Peter makes it seem like he's their father's favourite, by appropriating a lot of the dad's possessions after he died. Jack is obsessive about his ex and is making plans to abandon his brothers on the journey. As with earlier works, Anderson uses an unconventional narrative structure and tone, and mixes comedy with drama. After the short film, the first half of Darjeeling is often a hilarious travelogue of the journey. This contrasts with the slightly tragic second half, after the brothers witness the death of a village boy. Although this does have an initial jarring effect whereby you can note the exact point the film changes, the two contrasting halves work together through Anderson wisely sprinkling the sombre scenes with light comic touches. Anderson again uses the soundtrack to great effect, mixing sixties pop, like Kinks and Rolling Stones, with soundtrack music from Indian films: that said, I personally didn't need to hear Peter Sarstedt's 'Where Did You Go To (My Lovely)' three times; a song that shares a gene or two with the Father Ted Eurovision song 'My Lovely Horse'. There are other Anderson trademarks on display here, such as the use of slow motion and panning shots from the side of the moving train, reminiscent to cross section shots of the boat in Life Aquatic. Design details like the jungle patterned luggage and the skull and bones box further heighten the sense that you're watching a Wes Anderson film, whilst Robert Yeoman's cinematography is beautiful, capturing the vibrant colours and dustiness of India. And there are cameos from actors in previous Anderson film, like Kumar Pallana (Pagoda in Tenembaums, amongst others) and Bill Murray. Along with fellow Indiewood successes Quentin Tarrantino and Kevin Smith, Wes Anderson has created a unique cinematic world, has an individualistic cinematic voice, and consequently is loved and hated in equal measure. The Darjeeling Limited is a stunning and original piece, which stands well in Anderson's body of work. Darjeeling may prove challenging to mainstream audiences but is set to be adored by his not inconsiderable amount of fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching film of brotherly love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Darjeeling Limited' unequivocally won me over with a wink and a warm heart. This is quintessential Wes Anderson as we know it, which from the start makes this a film that will surely divide audiences down the middle. Love him or hate him, Anderson brings his latest effort to the big screen with an unflinching spirit that becomes the very definition of quirkiness. And for me, this was a wondrous train adventure that was a pleasure taking. Where it took me, that's less obvious. But I liked it, and that counts for something.Though it may take place halfway around the world in the cultural rich lands of India, 'The Darjeeling Limited' finds Wes Anderson in comfortable skin as he again tells the story of a broken family trying to heal their wounds. Literally and figuratively. It's a method that's proved successful in the past, and Anderson sees no reason to differ. And as long as he's able to deliver, I think I can manage. Because 'Darjeeling' is a beautiful film, and a surprisingly heartfelt one at that. This is a simple and delightful experience from the start, even when its destination appears to be perpetually unknown. This soul-searching film may not find our characters making leaps and bounds of improvement, but 'Darjeeling' isn't as lost as the train these people find themselves on. It's merely a chapter taken out of the lives of three brothers who find themselves brought together during completely different times in their lives.It's one reason why 'Darjeeling' seems to work so well. It's not bound by traditional standards like a beginning, middle, or end. It's a 'come as you are' kind of affair, and this film works wonders. The centerpiece being the brilliant performances delivered by Owen Wilson, Adam Brody, and Jason Schwartzman. I found myself believing these were three dysfunctional brothers, making 'Darjeeling' a believable and profound human film. And as we tour India with these three brothers doing what they can to come to terms with each other and derive some sort of meaning from their time together, don't think this is just another one-trick pony. Underneath its soft-spoken and dry humor, there are some startlingly powerful and poignant moments to be found within this textured and memorable journey.'The Darjeeling Limited' won't please all, but it's much more than I could have ever asked for in a Wes Anderson film. With its take-it-or-leave-it style of humor, a talented cast who breathe life into off-beat characters, and a touching story of loss and hope, this is a compelling and artistically beautiful picture that's worth catching. I don't believe the end result is what's matters most here, it's the moments in-between and sights we see that do. 'Darjeeling' doesn't play by the rules, it bucks convention without looking back. There's considerably more here than what meets the eye, and if beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder, it's up to you to find your own treasures within this tender-hearted film.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I ever seem to hear when researching about this movie is either how incredibly smart and beautiful it is or how much of a copy it is of other Wes Anderson movies. This being the first of his movies I have seen, I say that this movies is very enjoyable, even if it is so much like his other movies. His distinct flavor of humor and drama makes for very entertaining character study and dry comedy that is funny at some points and also quite melancholy. The three leads are very good, especially Owen Wilson as the older brother. All other characters that have tiny bit parts play them well, including Angelica Huston as the brothers' mother, and it all adds up to a very quirky, clever, satisfying comedy that is quite enjoyable. If this is what I have to look forward to when I see the rest of Anderson's work, then I don't think I have to be worried. I like the camera work, the dry humor, the quirky situations, the pop music score, and the beautiful shots of the train and India. It may be all Anderson does, but at least he does it well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that could have been a real discovery of India and Hinduism. Alas we are very far from that because of the absolutely egocentric and self-centered psychologically claustrophobic closing up of each one of the three brothers onto each one of themselves. They hate themselves and one another with the greatest amount of love and yet they can't stand one another. They are looking for their mother who disappeared before their father's funeral they had to bury alone. She took refuge in some kind of Christian nunnery in India and she just does not hear the voices from her sons or from the world or from even herself. She is entirely locked up in an supposedly altruistic dedication to the poor of India and does not see she is selfishly rejecting her own responsibilities towards her own children and family. The spiritual pilgrimage of these three brothers becomes a nightmare when they have to travel together in a deluxe first class sleeper compartment on an Indian train and can't stand their mutual guts. They will eventually get themselves kicked off the train. But we miss all the spirituality of this country, this subcontinent, not to speak of the Hindu religion that is reduced to a poor series of worn-out clichés. So what's left when the Darjeeling tea has been brewed, poured and drunk except some water to be passed in a few hours? It does not even appeal us to go there and experience such situations. They definitely have it too easy, climbing to the top of some sacred rock. It should be hard and there should be several stages to be respected. The path to enlightenment is in eight stages, at least in my Buddhist line. Here we have one single race and some foolish clown faces and antics on the top. Could have been a lot better with a little bit of an effort.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new direction for Wes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of Wes Anderson's work, I was very excited for this new film, and I was not disappointed. The art direction and script are characteristically brilliant, and the colours of India work beautifully with Anderson's style. I loved the idea of Schwartzman, Wilson and Brody being brothers, and Angelica Huston was wonderful as always. The fight scene on the train made me laugh out loud for about ten minutes.On the other hand, this was the first Wes Anderson film in which I could clearly sense the scenes that had been removed. There was some vital character development and plot linkage that was obviously removed, which was a letdown as it ruined the complete world that Anderson usually creates. The couple of harsher scenes surprised me as well; Anderson typically treats these subjects with sensitivity, and that was missing. I attributed this (rightly or not) to the addition of Roman Coppola, who I'm guessing came in on Jason Schwartzman's back.I can't help feeling that if Owen Wilson had co-written, this movie would have been amazing, but it still ended up better than any other movie I have seen recently, and Anderson retains that skill for mixing the hilarious with the tragic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quirkly Cadre Ride Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson films are an acquired taste. From BOTTLE ROCKET, RUSHMORE, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, THE LIFE AQUATIC, and finally this film, THE DARJEELING LIMITED, quirkiness is a theme that runs throughout writer/director Anderson's repertoire. He also loves working with the Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen) as well as Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray. So ? not surprisingly ? Owen, Anjelica and Bill all show up at some point in this one. They are, in fact, becoming what I like to call "the quirky cadre." Anderson isn't one of those "in-your-face" kind of directors. He doesn't spoonfeed you anything, and this is both fun and frustrating. The fun comes from personal discoveries related to the scenes and situations he puts his characters in. The frustration is that sometimes the disconnects are too extreme.This time we have the three Whitman brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson, CARS), Peter (Adrien Brody, HOLLYWOODLAND), and Jack (Jason Schwarztman, MARIE ANTOINETTE). Their father has recently passed away and the brothers take on a trip to India to find their absent mother. In the meantime, we get to witness the bizarreness of this family unit. Francis (Wilson) is a control freak who has to have every minute detail pinned down. Peter (Brody) is somewhat of a kleptomaniac. And Jack (Schwartzman) is a damaged guy stuck on a damaged gal (played by Natalie Portman, CLOSER). The three boys try to rediscover their brotherly bonds by taking The Darjeeling Limited (a train) across India in search of their father's hopes for them and their mother's reasons for not attending her husband's funeral. There are some absolutely hysterical, funny, and poignant moments, sometimes all wrapped up in one scene. The one that comes to mind the most is when the brothers witness a raft trapped in some rapids with three boys clinging on for dear life. They put aside all of their differences and go into savior mode without thinking, and it is a defining moment within the brothers' lives. What comes after is funny and sad. They finally break free of their bonds to their parents and leave all of their luggage behind (literally and metaphorically), thanks to the families they meet outside their own.The main frustration most viewers might have with the movie is the music. There really is no connection between what is happening and the tunes (Anderson, I believe, just enjoyed the Indian music and decided to incorporate it into the film, and be damned what anyone might think). The extreme disconnect was very bothersome for this viewer.Even so, this is a good quirky Anderson film with great color shots (the train and the surrounding terrain), an uplifting story (in the end), and some fine acting by all (especially by Owen Wilson).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes, You've Done It. Again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson is probably the only director that somebody can recognize just out of the pictures in the screen. Think about it. Is that a bad thing? No. But it's not a good thing either, see? It's good when every director gets his own style, a distinctive aura, or whatever, which sets him apart, which makes his movies memorable, but good directors take those things, and try not to make them blatantly obvious. They try to take the story they want to tell, and tell it the best way they can by making it their own. What they don't do is take their style, and the pictures in their head, and add words to it.It's hard to watch The Darjeeling Limited because you know you are looking at something that is good, that is entertaining, but that is, sometimes, unbearable. I laughed out loud a lot, but sometimes I sighed, sometimes I felt so detached from what I was seeing that I did not care at all. I hate to say that is a hit-and-miss, because it's kind of a hit you regret being hit by. You know what I mean? By the end of the movie you're smiling, and you like the characters, and you sympathize with them, and you feel satisfied when they walk out of that room and look at the camera one by one, but the fact that it makes you smile doesn't make you forget that you were bored with it halfway through, that you rolled your eyes in the middle of a conversation that is supposed to be important.And that makes you angry. So, you're angry for a while, and then you think about that part, with the mace, and the fight, and the snake, and you laugh out loud. It's confusing. And...I think the word I'm looking for is frustrating.At this point Wes Anderson is kinda becoming an obsessive compulsive version of himself. Dialogues are delivered so flatly that you can't be sure which parts are supposed to be funny, and which are not. Everything has to be put together nicely in the screen, which isn't bad, I like Anderson's style, but not when it's in every shot, and you're so aware of it that you can no longer admire it, and can simply hate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so that was probably the funniest moment but then again I wasn't expecting a laugh out aloud comedy. I like random films and this is random but at the same time makes sense. 3 brothers on a spiritual journey, or should i say forced on a spiritual journey by the eldest brother who probably wouldn't understand spiritual if it slapped him in the face with a wet kipper. It highlights all the typical yank on vacation traits that us Europeans see on a regular basis from our overseas cousins. After arriving at the "Most spiritual place in the world" what do they do suck in the atmosphere or stop and think for a moment trying to find, wisdom from within.... NO they go shopping for power adaptors, pepper spray and a snake lol hilarious. I like the 3 brother they remind me of mine, they are exactly the same, all totally different and fighting for attention amongst themselves. I can understand why a lot of people will not like this film as it has no particular story in the traditional sense and it leaves everything fairly open to interpretation for the viewer and i know how much that irks your average movie goer. Some comments of the film have been a little crazy, a few have commented on the ending where they throw there bags away when trying to catch the train " wasteful" and "littering" spring to mind. I think the whole point was letting go of possessions and having the freedom to say who cares about all that stuff. It was probably the only true spiritual thing these guys learnt throughout the whole film.Even after rescuing the kids from drowning Adrian Brodie says " MINE's dead" like the boy was his possession and that it was his duty to save him. It was the whole competing brother concept that dominated the whole film. Thats what brothers do they compete and argue and back stab but underneath they really love each other and it was nice to see them sharing a moment with the feather. lol feather hilarious.</fullReview>

Some only catch the tossing of the baggage at the end, but the movie STARTS with symbolism. I have brothers and the rolls were uncannily out of my life. I could put my own personal names to the characters. If you begin to understand the fact that they are brothers and what that really means; how they suffer together, and also still meddle in each other's lives for what they think is best for that person, then it clicks. The talking behind each other's backs, only to come back to them rang so true. I guess I can say that I liked it because it seemed to speak to me personally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film more than I expected, and it's probably Wes Anderson's most mature film yet. While it does feel very similar to the rest of his films, it still has a decent amount of originality. Unlike Anderson's previous films, the main characters are not very likable, though this is not unintentional, like it was in the Life Aquatic. Visually, the colors are very vibrant, and they give the movie a beautiful look without being too bright or distracting. The plot is also far less conventional than I thought it would be, though the ending is a little gimmicky. The performances are fine, good, but nothing special. In his direction, Wes Anderson abandons most of the quirkiness he's used in the past, which gives the film a more mature feel. All in all, Wes Anderson fans will be pleasantly surprised, while others may find it overly quirky and manipulative.</fullReview>

I realize that I'm about 3 months late on this one, but it came out in Toronto around the same time as awesome looking movies like Eastern Promises and Into The Wild, so it kinda got shifted to the bottom of my list. Anyways, I liked the film, but it wasn't great. I think I liked it better than The Life Aquatic, but I can't really remember that one too well, it came out a while ago.The film focuses on three brothers played by Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzmann, and Adrien Brody that take a trip into the middle of India on a train called The Darjeeling Limited. Wilson's character, Francis, reunites the brothers after an almost fatal motorcycle accident in order to take a "spiritual journey".Anyways, this film is entertaining, so I would recommend it on that alone, but I think the thing that holds it back is Anderson's unwillingness to show the character's emotions. It seems almost as though he's scared of turning the film into one of those manipulative dramas, so every time the character's get into an argument, he forgoes the emotional consequences and plays it for laughs. At one point, two brothers begin to fight over who was loved by their father the most, the scene only ends when the other brother sprays them with pepper spray and the crash into the hallway of the train they are moving on.Another problem with the film is its quirkiness for no reason. What reason is there for Jason Schwartzmann's character not to wear shoes? This particular example shows a logistical error in that there is no way Schwartzmann could have wandered India barefoot without hurting himself. Why does Adrien Brody's character, Peter, buy a poisonous snake except as a plot contrivance? Why does the luggage need to be designer Louis Vuitton in which each bag has a number from 1 to 10 on it? We do not need to see each bag in a prominent shot to tell us where we are in the plot.The best scenes of the film are the ones where Anderson does allow the character's to show their emotions. A flashback to a scene that takes place before the brother's father's (!) funeral is a good example of this, as is the short film ("Hotel Chevalier") that serves as a prequel to this. Anderson should have more confidence in his writing, these scenes don't come across as manipulative because Anderson's writing isn't manipulative.Beyond these qualms, the film is quite good. The music selection is awesome, as I remember it being for The Life Aquatic, and the set design of the train is spectacular. I just wish that Anderson would give that little extra oomph with the story and characters to turn the film from good to great.bartholomewrichards.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson Strikes Again - with less thrust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Foremost, I have to say - there is something in the words of those who say that this movie is for Anderson fans only. For example I, being a fan, loved it - but I don't know about my friends, who looked like they got run over by the Darjeeling Limited train after we left the theater. It's a hard movie to watch if your used to the generic fast-paced, low-IQ, effect-driven movies we see from Hollywood (although I am a respectable fan of those as well).Every aesthetic aspect of this film is wonderful (as expected from an Anderson production). Brilliant set design, wonderful costumes, and the cinematography... hard to describe in words - visual brilliance. Those of you who've seen his previous films will notice the trademark dolly shots and wonderfully-corny 70's style fast zooms. Just like in "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou", most of the movie takes place in small, confined spaces. Anderson uses wide angle lesses to capture as much space as possible in every shot - this adds by creating "barrel distortion" (when the picture appears curved because of the curvature of the lens) - adding even more to the quirky atmosphere.But, sadly, this film is not perfect. The dialog is sketchy at times and character development seems jumpy and not very well thought through. Anderson had this problem in "The Life Aquatic" as well - it seems almost as if he forgets at times to finish dramatic sentences. Things are often not fully discussed and because of this major plot points suffer from misunderstanding. But if overlooked - the plot is enchanting and intriguing at the same time. The acting is beautiful. Adrien Brody is a wonderful addition to the Anderson family.All-in-all, this is a wonderful film. It's not Anderson's finest, for sure, but it ranks high. Apart from suffering in the character development area, I assure you your in from a wonderful train ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about Wes Anderson's films that I find hard to shake, and not in the sense of an unsettling, emotionally moving experience--no, it's something to do with the director's invocation of classical film-making techniques matched against characters and plots that are at once contemporary and old-fashioned; the end result can, at times, be entertaining with an undertaste of self-conscious pretension. Now don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed all of Anderson's previous films (some more than others), but that underlying pretension (no matter how well-concealed) has always kept me from LOVING them. Until now. "The Darjeeling Limited" is definitely in the mold of Anderson's previous pictures, from the nostalgic, child-like visual details (the animal-patterned luggage, for instance) to the almost hopelessly passive dysfunction of the main characters (in this case, a trio of estranged brothers looking to re-connect on a "spiritual journey" through India on the titular train); but underneath it is a raw, vulnerable humanity that hits universal notes of despair (the death of a parent, for instance) and joy (one brother--played by Adrien Brody--is an expectant father) that really connected with me. The synchronicity between Anderson's penchant for specific music, character revelations, and a world of a very specific design remain equally aligned in "Darjeeling." Additionally, the pull away from a familiar American landscape and into the wondrous Indian locales complements the alienation of the brothers quite well, further rendering them strangers (among each other, even) in a strange land. The performances are heartfelt and naturalistic--while Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Brody may seem like the most disparate trio ever cast as blood relations, their rapport is fantastically (and often hilariously) believable. While I do take issue with a jarring juxtaposition Anderson inserts near the end (aligning the father's funeral with a funeral in India), the rest of "Darjeeling" is, as Wilson's character would assert, an "incredible spiritual journey" with a fine sense of humor, to boot.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed most of the movie except for the implication that Indian women are "easy" and that children are "so many," its OK to have one die just to add drama to plot.I was depressed after watching the movie, depressed because the movie promotes, begging the audience to watch without critical thinking, not asking, why are these subliminal messages always in movies involving Indian people??? Also, the picture painted of the mother is also a "put down" of mothers (women).So, the movie contains two strikes against women and a strike against Indian children.</fullReview>

Four children decide to save the Narnia with lion, the true ruler of Narnia.It's based on novel written by C.S Lewis. I watched movie, then I read the book. This movie reproduced novel in detail, but little be different. Because it not perfect, you may be discouraged. If you love Lewis's novel, you have own image of Narnia... However, story and cinematography are wonderful!! It's not only time travel story and sci-fi. If we watch this movie, we can mature to another level. This is very popular with children. But it isn't childish movie. This movie be loved not only child but adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much a Wes Anderson film but accessible and engaging due to the emotional content acting as base throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter and Jack are called together by their brother Francis for a "spiritual journey" by train across India to bond them together after many years of no contact. Francis has been badly injured after a road accident, Peter is imminently to be a father, while Peter is exiting a messy relationship. The three do not blend together naturally and there are still areas of conflict and impatience between them ? areas which will be further when the nature of their journey changes in several ways.Many describe Wes Anderson as one of those "love him or hate him" directors but I personally do not feel this way to that degree. While he is clearly an acquired taste in many regards, his films can still succeed or fail for me. With the Life Aquatic I felt there was just too much in the way of quirkiness without emotional substance behind it so I wasn't too sure if I wanted to continue to follow it up with this film. So I ducked it at the cinema but picked it up later on DVD and am pleased to report that, while it is undoubtedly a Wes Anderson film, it is more interesting and satisfying than I expected it to be.The story is essentially about the Whitman family and this dynamic provides the emotional foundation for the film. In this regard it did make for a hook for me, even if I'm not totally sure that "part one" was a worthwhile addition to part two. The characters are well written and there is enough in the way of development in the background to hold the attention. The journey is expanded upon by a story that is "unusual" but is far more accessible that Life Aquatic, perhaps it was because it was written during a similar journey to try and inspire the script. It did work because the characters are placed within a story that is unique and different but doesn't feel like it is just quirky for the sake of being quirky. Anderson may not have a great range but he can do what he does pretty well and shows it here. More of his direction of the cast in a bit but most striking is the design of the film in regards the look and sound of it. The bright colours make for some bold shots and all the scenes are particularly well framed. The soundtrack is a bit too "knowing" for some but it worked despite my feelings.With some of Anderson's films he has lost the cast behind the quirks of their characters but in this case he manages to prevent this happening. In response the cast all deliver performances that not only fit the tone of the film but are pretty effective at the same time. Wilson, Brody and Schwartzman all work well together and convince that the interactions of the film are not happening for the first time but have been ongoing for decades. They are the focus of the film but they are supported well by turns from Ahluwalia, Huston and the stunning Amara Karan. Despite these though, it is very much Wes Anderson's film and, speaking as someone who likes his style but needs substance, I was pleased that The Darjeeling Limited delivered in both regards. It is not so accessible that it will win over those who do not like Anderson's films but it does have the emotional content that I felt was lacking in Life Aquatic and is a better, more engaging film as a result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of quality comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two days ago, we've had the chance to watch Wes Anderson's latest:THE DARJEELING LIMITED. We really had a wonderful moment. This movie is really an amazing comedy, be careful, it's not a "silly" comedy. It's witty and draws most of its power from great Character writing. Once again we discover that to have a great film you need really interesting characters, and that's getting more scarce from the films I've seen recently. The three brothers of "The Darjeeling Limited" are so touching, humorous and cool that you immediately feel great in their company. The cast is amazing and we also have an Adrian Brody in one of his best roles. Besides from the characters, Robert D. Yeoman's photography is gorgeous, not in a"Showing Off" kind of way, but beautiful on color and simplicity. The script is also very well written (even if it could be 5 minutes shorter) and that's really an immense pleasure to enjoy short a great film. Another thing that really is important to me: that film should be an example of how you should show a foreign country/culture in a movie. That's one of the first American fiction films that I see, that was shot abroad and doesn't show the locals as complete idiots or builds his comedy on making fun of the country and all the hard time adapting to it. And it's not a holiday postcard either. So if the film is showing in a theater near you: run and watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but Anderson's shtick is starting to get kind of old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the films of Wes Anderson just as much as anyone else. In fact ? and I've mentioned this before ? 2007 has been a phenomenal year for some of my favourite film directors whose origins are rooted in the 1990's independent film movement. And yet, while many of Anderson's indie-film colleagues have delivered in 2007 seminal work, which shows evolution in leaps and bounds and immense newfound maturity, I couldn't help but feel almost cheated by Wes.Don't get me wrong ? I think that this is a great film. Despite the drastic change of setting it's still classic Wes, perhaps even a step back up to something more mature than the outrageously silly but still wonderful The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. The symmetrical aesthetic; the smooth, calculated camera movements; the quirky characters and deadpan, random humour; and yet, underneath it all, the depth in the flawed characters who learn a thing or two about their life.Wes regulars Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman deliver great performances as usual, and the newcomer to the troupe, Adrien Brody, further proves his worth as capable of delivering this kind of calculatedly hilarious performance; of all the latest Oscar winners, Brody is I think one of the most underrated, rarely getting (well-deserved) credit for his roles other than his harrowing turn in The Pianist. The cast may be a step down from Anderson's previous two films, both of which featured impressive ensembles ? but then again, Darjeeling Limited is overall more of a smaller, return-to-roots work for Anderson reminiscent of the personal journey in Rushmore far more than the collective experiences in The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic.But here within lies the problem ? it's a step back for Wes, and not a step forward. 2007 was a year that brought us seminal work from the top indie-rooted directors. While it may not quite match, say, Fight Club in terms of overall quality, I do think that Zodiac is David Fincher's best and most mature directorial work, and truly the first time that he puts all the emphasis on the story and the atmosphere and less on visual trickery. And the companion Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson that is, delivered a phenomenal work so utterly different from anything else he's ever done that it's truly a sight to behold; for the first time in his 5-movie career, Anderson took a step back and approached the film in an entirely unique, almost humble attitude of letting the substance carry the film, and not the style. And yet, opposed to these two determining works, we have two movies from equally acclaimed directors, both of whom also started in indie film, which come across as almost mundane: Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino (who directed last year's "Death Proof"), who, while their comrades are evolving in leaps and bounds, are still contempt to keep doing the same thing.This is a good film and I like Wes Anderson's movies in general, but I couldn't help but feel that his shtick is getting kind of old, especially when, in the same year, other directors have done such daringly different work. And just as I would love to see Quentin Tarantino help a WWII epic, so I would like to see Wes Anderson try something different for a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, Wes, we got your point now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another nicely made, strangely beautiful, interesting piece by Wes Anderson. As always, I liked the costumes, dialogues, sets, and the mixture of touching personal topics and shere absurdity. However, I think it is time Wes Anderson tries something new. After having seen all of his movies (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and this one), I think that another movie of this kind would probably destroy Anderson's reputation of being innovative. In actual fact, the Darjeeling Limited does show us little that we haven't seen already in his earlier works (the only exceptions being more sex and more landscape). Admittedly, The Darjeeling Limited is the most mature of Anderson's movies. So if you would like to get a taste of how his movies are - this is the one you should see (and Life Aquatic, maybe, which I liked the most).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really nice film basically, superior to the slightly too off-kilter 'Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou', whilst maybe not quite reaching up to the heights of 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. Excellent performances from three very convincing brothers in Wilson, Brody and Schwarzmann. Like Wes Anderson's other films, 'The Darjeeling Limited' is a difficult movie to describe, you really have to see it to get a real sense of what it is about. There are similarities with Anderson's other films - the cast, the music, the use of slow-motion, but the Indian background gives a fresh dimension to proceedings. Recommended but probably not to all tastes - when I bought my ticket the woman behind me commented loudly 'That's crap!'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road trip with a difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all love to pigeon hole movies and for me this falls into the category of a "road trip" movie. The only difference is that it takes place on a train, so we get to know a little about a few other characters in addition to the lead characters. The main focus of the film is the relationship between three brothers, Francis, Peter and Jack Whitman. As the train meanders across the Indian sub continent we get an insight into the relationship of the three brothers. The film is very nicely observed and the three leads played by Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman all put in good performances. There is no doubt that Wes Anderson is a highly skilled director. You get the impression that a great deal of time and effort is put into every scene. Perhaps the whole is not as good as it should be given how good the constituent parts are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The filmmakers made great use out of small, claustrophobic spaces as well as with the wide-open country giving them both a unique character and point of view not present in any other movie about India I've seen. It made me want to go on my own "spiritual journey." It is very difficult to light and shoot in spaces like the train, but Anderson, his camera and lighting crew, his actors, and his sound crew were able to pull it off and make it look easy.The actors playing the three brothers were very good. Even though they didn't really look like they actually could be biological brothers, it didn't distract me because the acting was good enough for us to believe that they could be. However, the performance and character that made the greatest impression on the film was the mother played by Angelica Houston. She gets so little time on the screen and yet, the performance and the hold the character has on the brothers' psyches are remarkable. Angelica Houston deserves a lot of credit for creating a fully interesting and even sympathetic character out of what was essentially a selfish woman in such a short amount of screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson Never Disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack: I wonder if the three of us would've been friends in real life. Not as brothers, but as people.Arguably the most original and/or most bizarre filmmaker working today, Wes Anderson never fails to bring us unique entertainment. 'The Darjeeling Limited' while not one of his best films, is no exception. It's an engrossing, neurotic, funny and dare I say emotionally moving tale about three brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman) who after their father die, take a trip to India to re-connect with their long-lost mother (Anjelica Houston). That's about all I'll tell you about the plot.The film is great yet I didn't appreciate it quite as much as 'Rushmore' or 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. It's far better than 'Life Aquatic' or 'Bottle Rocket', but 'The Darjeeling Limited' represents Anderson's most serious film to date. It's a bunch of quirky fun wrapped around a sad but realistic center.As far as directing goes Mr. Anderson outdoes himself, and the screenplay is magnificent (co-written by star Jason Schwartzman with Wes Anderson). The acting is all top-notch from the three brothers but the real scene-stealer is Adrien Brody, an actor new to the Wes Anderson territory. Brody is sensational in his role as the conflicted oldest brother. The supporting cast is all great especially Bill Murray in a tiny role that's hysterical. Natalie Portman is in the movie for all of about 1 second as Schwartzman's manipulative self-centered abuse-junkie ex-girlfriend, but she is absolutely phenomenal in the online short film prequel to 'Darjeeling' appropriately titled 'Hotel Chevalier'.All in all, I recommend 'Darjeeling' only if you like Wes Anderson films. Some people will loathe this movie, others, like me, will cherish it like gold. Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mixing the almighty rich losers from the US of A with the hopelessly pathetic poors and helpless Indians from the opposite side of the planet plus some over the top sketch, you have a strong soup hard to ignore. Ironically, this movie reminded me of "the war on terror" and its "decider" - rich loser squanders seemingly endless resources (blood and money) not of his own making to try to find non-existing meaning in his empty life. The only thing I could take away from the movie is - life is pointless and senseless for the rich as well as the poor. But at least the rich gets the chance to mess up the poors and expects the poor to thank him for 'saving' them. Arrogant maybe, but that seems to be the way the world works today. Sad but true. I have little sympathy to the 3 brothers and their empty life and hollow emotional journey. But the acting is mostly good. Then again, this movie is far from unique in its angel of depicting the 3rd world countries as just some far off play ground for the white Americans to make a mess and have fun with. The locals are just bunch of invisible animals and creatures to be used for prop, consumption, or practice targets. The poor maybe poor, but they are not necessarily more pathetic than the rich. Remember it's Owen Wilson who wants to kill himself. Right, life is just that 'boring' for him. And that is just too bad, because it says a lot about the 'human condition' today.</fullReview>

I'm sure the characters must have been written with the actors in mind because they fit the roles perfectly. Schwartzmen is perfect as a the sex-crazed ''lone one'', Wilson is excellent at playing the over-protective annoying brother and Brody is absolutely phenomenal as the depressed brother worrying over his soon to be child.Like the rest of his films the best scenes are the small scenes. The movie would survive without them, but it wouldn't be the same. The quirky camera movements that make Anderson and his cinematographer stand out from the crowd.Be prepared for a mind blowing scene involving three drowning children that brings the brothers closer than ever.

		<fullReview>My vote for "The Darjeeling Limited" is a perfect ten.I choose to give it a score of ten out of ten because this Wes Anderson film is absolutely hard to pigeonhole as it is neither a drama nor a comedy. Wes Anderson is not the first western director to make a film about the never ending chaos that is India.There have been many renowned directors before him like Jean Renoir's Le Fleuve,Louis Malle's L'Inde Phantome,Roberto Rossellini's India Matrubhumi and Reinhard Hauff's Ten days in Calcutta.who have made their films about India in India.It can be said that their films have always remained somewhat critical of India and its poverty whereas Wes Anderson is not interested in making a judgment about India and its poverty.He has eschewed any kind of controversy as his film is set in a highly famous northern region of India called Rajasthan and he shows only a very small part of India."The Darjeeling Limited" is a different film as it is probably the first American film made by an American film director in India.It is also unique as Wes Anderson's other films are predominantly about western characters and their confused lives and looking at his filmography,in no way can one guess that he would be making a superb film in Rajasthan,India.The theme of this film would appear as confused to many ordinary viewers but for cautious viewers its content is absolutely magnificent.This is precisely something which enhances its emotional as well as aesthetic appeal.Wes Anderson has worked hard to ensure that there is no spiritual quest in sight although the screenplay is woven around it.The fun part of the film concerns wacky,over the top,rambunctious odd behavior of three young American people.Those viewers who have already been to India especially north India as visitors,backpackers or tourists will have no trouble in recognizing the eternal turmoil of a state called Rajasthan where tourism,camel safari and horse safari are the main sources of livelihood.Wes Anderson and his cameraman Robert Yeoman have captured the chaos of Rajasthan in all its splendor.In some ways it can be said that Rajasthan and its second largest city Jodhpur have been honored to have put themselves on the world center stage after a superstar of Adrien Brody's stature has set his feet over there.There have been some absolutely fabulous views of temples in and around Jodhpur and of the train "The Darjeeling Limited" which originates from Jodhpur railway station.Wes Anderson is your director should you decide to be curious about India and simply unwind by watching a charming,good film with high entertainment value which can be watched with all members of the family.Let Wes Anderson be your guide for one of the most bumpy rides of your life.PS:Superstar Adrien Brody looks great as he rides Hero Honda CD 100 motor bike on a hot,humid road somewhere near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan.</fullReview>

Which I did, thoroughly.I was completely taken in by the story. The music as always with Anderson is pitch perfect and it completely sets the tone. The characters are believable and the writing is incredibly witty. For all its breathtaking visuals and its carefully constructed mise en scene, The Darjeeling Limited remains a character film. With each brother differing in personality (and appearance but lets not go into that) the film makes for a diverse and largely accurate view of sibling rivalry.The scenery is beautiful, the characters compelling and the writing has never been better. Wes Anderson has hit his peak, this is in my opinion, his best film to date. Its not as quirky as say The Life Aquatic. And its structure is not as full as The Royal Tenenbaums. This lands an effective blow with just over 90 minutes. 90 minutes which you will gladly give up again to revisit this gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed Anderson fans should revisit this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As my summary indicates, I believe that anyone that is a fan of Wes Anderson's work should see this movie again if they didn't enjoy it the first time. I say this because it was exactly my case : I loved Rushmore and Life aquatic and was disappointed with this one. But then I saw it again, and again, and with each viewing I am more impressed with this.The comedy here is even more subtle then in previous works so I think that was part of the issue. The overall themes didn't move me like Wes' other works until further viewings.The character's enter a spiritual journey in the country of a million cultures. You too must come along for the ride and let Wes take you where he wishes.I think this movie is so well balanced comedically that it might be Anderson's best effort so far, and it delivers dramatically and spiritually as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Picasso....Rembrant....Wes Andersen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picasso used a paintbrush for his masterpieces, and Wes Andersen uses a camera and pencil. Next to Rushmore, I consider this to be Wes Andersen's 2nd best film. Andersen's films portray a meaning in a quiet, distinct, and subtle manner which no other writer or director has achieved. Their style and grace have a warming familiarity that can be seen throughout The Darjeeling Limited.The Darjeeling Limited is a visually stunning tale of three brothers (Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrian Brody) who search for meaning in their lives by embarking on a spiritual journey to India. We've all seen films involving spiritual journeys before, in which most of them fail to live up to our expectations. TDL is the latter. Brilliantly filmed on location in India, the film is pure gold from start to finish. It makes India look like a welcome place for those in search of deeper meaning.The great thing about Andersen's films is that he can take a set of actors, that may not be especially great or entertaining, and turn them into intriguing characters who always leave you wanting to know more about. The Darjeeling Limited is no exception. The three brothers, who haven't seen each other in over a year, have excellent chemistry that shows what being family is all about. The characters show that no matter what distance or amount of time is set in between family members, they can always come back to each other and pick up right where they left off. This also includes their mother, Patricia (Anjelica Huston).When Francis, Peter, and Jack depart for India, we see the depression in them that is controlling their lives. By the end of the film, it is obvious that they received what they came for: personal enlightenment and inner meaning. They also rekindled their bond as brothers.The best part of a film like this is the bonding and brotherhood. Rather than two person interaction which can be seen in most films of the kind, we see a trifecta of interaction which is flawlessly carried out in the film, but more specifically in certain scenes. Three of my favorite scenes are: 1) When Jack, Peter, and Francis climb atop the steep hill to perform the flower ritual and end of fighting over the reason why they came to India 2) When the brothers attempt the flower ritual again around the campfire 3) After the brothers are booted from The Darjeeling Limited by the hasty conductor, when they encounter the children who are struggling to make it across the river.To conclude, The Darjeeling Limited is utterly fantastic. It is a film that should be seen by Andersen and non-Andersen fans alike.</fullReview>

Their "spiritual quest", however, veers rapidly off-course (due to events involving over-the-counter pain killers, Indian cough syrup, and pepper spray), and they eventually find themselves stranded alone in the middle of the desert with eleven suitcases, a printer, and a laminating machine. At this moment, a new, unplanned journey suddenly begins. Very funny and decent. The Darjeeling Limited</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Brothers Whitman--Lothario Jack(Jason Swartzman),repressed responsible Peter(Adrien Brody) and Alpha-male Francis(Owen Wilson)travel to India for a "spiritual journey",which seems to be as much an excuse to heal their relationship,strained since their father's death and mother's departure into the nunnery than any broad "spiritual" exploration. The process is long,odd and more than a little contentious,as would be expected.While I'm not quite what one would call a "fan" of Mr. Anderson's, I've liked most everything he's made. Having said that,I'd say this was not one of my favorites. The acting is maybe the best part,with the three leads becoming much more brotherly as the show's unconventional(to put it mildly)story plugs on. The pacing and focus of this film seems lazy or distracted,and while I understand that to be the general manqué of Anderson's movies, it seems even worse on this go-around. I know that the director inspires about as much negative passion as positive,so I am well aware that there are people out there that would be WAY less than pleased (if not flat-out bored) with this effort. I mention this because,for once,I think I could get where these people are coming from. Having said that,though,this movie still has a delicacy and care that compels me to think this at the very least as a sincere and honest attempt at creating a "thinking" piece. In some ways his most ambitious movie(i.e. the setting,the casting difficulties,the logistics) and in other ways maybe his most conservative(relatively little action and more focus on character and inter-play), this might be a real test as to how much of a fan you are of his movies and, for that part,also of Wilson,Swartzmann,Brody or Anjelica Huston (as the runaway nun mom) who are (with the exception of Brody) common contributor's to Mr.Anderson's cannon of work. While I'm not sure I could pass the test--"Rushmore" or "The Royal Tenenbaums" I enjoyed much more--I don't think that has to be a mark against this movie. A mild recommendation at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words go a long way, but they cannot do justice to this quadruple masterpiece that pleases eyes, ears, mind and soul alike. Wes Anderson takes us on a spiritual journey to India and creates a cosmopolitan fairy tale kingdom all his own in the process. Watched over by Louis Vuitton and Ray Davies as their unseen patron saints, the brothers Whitman go through the laughter and the tears (and the substance abuse) of a forced family reunion, haunted by the ghosts of distant parents and absent lovers. As part of Andersons's web of self-referential puns, Owen Wilson's control freak character Francis is created in the image of Chas Tenenbaum, the paranoid fire-drilling father of twins played by Ben Stiller in "The Royal Tenenbaums". On another level, the way Francis plans and handles the brothers' journey is an allegory of Wes Anderson's meticulous attention to detail as a director. The spring-steel train ticket holders, Peter's tinted Yuri Andropov glasses and the Hotel Chevalier "guest in residence" stationery Jack uses for his short story are among my personal favorites. Lovingly designed, spectacularly lit and superbly acted, "The Darjeeling Limited" is built to last. Even before the closing credits started rolling, I wanted to see it all over again, and I will. Guest appearance by Bill Murray in the part of a business traveler in such a hurry he must have the devil himself on his heels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great scenery and a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is one of those movies that Wes Anderson specialises in- that seem to prove that the destination is often not as important as how you get there. This doesn't mean he doesn't find different ways to change this up-far from it- as exemplified in his new movie about three brothers all carrying their own skeletons in the closet.Francis Whitman ( Owen Wilson ) has gathered together is two brothers Peter ( Adrian Brody ) and Jack ( Jason Schwartzman ) to share a trip aboard the Darjeeling Limited- a cross country Indian train. All three brothers have trust issues with each other-exemplified by the first 20 minutes of the movie. Through a couple of experiences though the brothers learn to work through their differences and move towards their ultimate goal.If this sounds formulaic it is because on a certain level the movie is. What sets it apart though is some amazing performances by the three brothers. Owen Wilson is great as Francis, showing a real subtle performance that is as good as any he has done. Jason Schwartzman as Jack is also good, though not quite as good as Wilson, he still pulls off a convincing performance. It's Adrian Brody though who shines as the best, showing Peter to be both damaged and somewhat running in autopilot. Another thing that sets it apart is the scenery, which truly makes you want to travel.The Darjeeling Limited is a film that that ranks as a great Wes Anderson movie. It's funny and touching without being syrupy. It reminded me of Little Miss Sunshine and is just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking in genuine emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-written by Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, Wes Anderson's The Darjeeling Limited is, like many of his films, a deadpan comedy about family dysfunction that flirts with emotional depth but never quite reaches it. This one, however, has an exotic setting in India, the enchanting music of Satyajit Ray, gorgeous photography of some of India's holy sites, and a lot of talk about a "spiritual journey". Yet this tale of the travels of bored young people of exaggerated wealth makes me wonder what spiritual growth means to Anderson other than as something to make people feel better about their unproductive lives. The film may be eventually be considered a sequel to The Royal Tennenbaums, a film in which children are adversely affected by the absence of their father, or it could also be looked at as another remake of Night of the Living Dead.This time it looks as if the three unhappy children are attempting to move to a different level, but it would not be cool if they actually discovered something larger than themselves to believe in. The three are brothers Francis (Owen Wilson), Jack (Jason Schwartzman), and Peter Whitman (Adrian Brody) who have as much resemblance to each other as Fay Wray and King Kong. The only thing they seem to have in common is that they are all obscenely wealthy, sporting 3,000 dollar loafers, eleven-piece designer suitcases by Louis Vuitton, and other accouterments of privilege that they bring without any reluctance to one of the poorest countries in the world. They are also loaded down with pain pills, cough syrup, and muscle relaxants and seem to be functioning on a somewhat primitive emotional level.Francis, a control freak who organizes every moment to the max, is all banged up from a motorcycle accident and bandages cover his face. Peter is unhappily married, talks about divorce, yet his wife Alice is expecting a boy in the next few months, so naturally the place he wants to be is 3,000 miles away. Jack, a short-story writer, has a thing about checking his ex-wife's answering machine and going barefoot for no obvious reason. After outrunning a tired businessman (Bill Murray), they board the long-distance train mocked up for the film called "The Darjeeling Limited". Francis' goal is to travel through India, see the holy sites, and meet up with their mother (Angelica Huston), a nun who teaches poor children in a remote convent in the Himalayas. The three haven't spoken to each other for over a year since their father's funeral but are reunited at the instigation of Francis who tells them that "we are here to find each other".Before long, however, they are squabbling as tensions grow about who their father loved more, what secrets they have kept from each other, and who is entitled to their father's belt and other belongings. Though on one level, the film can be looked on as a satire of the ugly American surrounded by beauty but unable to locate it on the map, the characters are cartoonish and never come to life, either as obnoxious tourists or spiritual pretenders. When the film takes on an aspect of reality in a very affecting sequence involving the drowning of a young boy, it seems incongruous, as if the projectionist spliced it in from another movie, and Anderson uses this tragedy only as a foil for the brothers to recall their father's funeral and discover their need to complete their journey.There is some hanky panky aboard the train as Jack pursues the stewardess Rita (Amara Karan), a caricature of the exotic dark-skinned beauty, but it seems inappropriate and empty of feeling. The boys in fact act out to the extent they are thrown off the train when they bring a poisonous snake on board and get into a fight in which Jack sprays mace on his brothers. Anderson has so much talent and had me thinking several times that the film was going someplace special and it does seem as if the brothers do come away with something valuable for themselves - quite by accident. Yet the final part of the trip, however, which is supposed to be the focal point of the film, turns out to be more of an afterthought and The Darjeeling Limited, in spite of its stunning color landscapes and hints of deeper feelings, winds down to a place lacking in genuine emotion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson has, for better or worse, become a respected and recognizable figure in film. This is great for those who truly appreciate his work, and bad for those who expect him to merely continue to be his previous work.This film is not perfect. I would not by any stretch say that it is his weakest film, but, despite obvious visual, personal and musical cues, it is his most different.The characters (and actors) certainly seem familiar. The look is 100% true Wes Anderson. The general feel is there and, yet, it seems to be a different take on his normal cast of sheepishly melancholic comedy characters. Things are much more personal this time.No, the movie is not attempting at anything profound (and, perhaps because it is less of an out-and-out comedy people are looking for profundity {and, perhaps, his ardent supporters are, sometimes, a little too ardent}), but it delivers in a familiar, happily-sad way which can be very effective when one is truly open to its openness.The worst thing one can do when going into this movie is want it to be something else. It should be taken on its own terms, accepted on its own terms, and understood as the modest, sweet, humorous tale that it is. It won't make any top 10 lists right away, but maybe its genuine simplicity and inexplicability will, in time, make it all the more memorable. It might just be the movie Wes Anderson has, truly, always wanted to make, and that should really be appreciated, for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge Wes Anderson fan but I was somewhat let down by The Life Aquatic, it was a good film, but good is not what I expect from Anderson. I expect great! So when this film came out I did not rush to the theater, I saw it a few weeks after its release. And for that matter I almost didn't see it at all.You've seen similar plot lines before in Anderson film's, with a sort of Family dysfunction that is trying to get resolved. But while this is familiar territory it is somehow new and fresh. You get the Anderson scenes, with the slow motion and music in the background but nothing is redundant.I guess it comes down to the characters, they are very interesting. There are also some hilarious moments, but only in the obscure sense. At one point Schwartzmann's character says Wouldn't it be nice to hear a train in the distance, to which both Wilson and Brody disagree, saying no that would actually be quite annoying.If you liked Rushmore, and Tenenbaums you will like this one as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable and bizarre comedy that contains a couple of undertones that I'm not sure the director wanted to be there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch films like these, I always look at the protagonists who are going on a journey of self discovery at the very beginning and then compare them at the very end to what they were like at the beginning; just to see if the script was smart enough to develop them in a sophisticated and entertaining way ? with The Darjeeling Limited, I did not get that satisfaction that I got out of films such as Thelma &amp; Louise and Road to Perdition. The film is, at its core, a road movie as was Thelma &amp; Louise and Road to Perdition although it's a single line journey that doesn't take place on a road but a train line for the best part ? it does venture off the railway line for certain reasons and the film lagged because of it but that's a separate issue. Where I saw this film, we were shown Anderson's short Hotel Chevalier about one of the feature film's main characters called Jack (Schwartzman) and his one night stand with an ex-girlfriend in Paris. I'm sure everyone enjoyed it for the almost naked Natalie Portman but remove her nudity from the short and you don't have much else except for the good use of a certain music track played through Jack's iPod which aided in the effectiveness of the feature.So with the film sort of started before it had actually started, I was intrigued at where The Darjeeling Limited was going to go. Unfortunately, the film does not hold up in the long run. I understood the journey of enlightenment and self discovery, something a lot of films tackle (or used to) and what better place to deal with such a subject than India what with all its spiritual beliefs and religion's that rely on meditation. There is definitely an undertone or an undercurrent running parallel with the main, routine narrative of three brothers on a journey but I couldn't figure out exactly what it was since there was so much bizarre content towards the end involving seemingly pointless and random stuff that I was zoning out. On the surface and for what it is, The Darjeeling Limited is a funny at times and entertaining tale about three brothers on a journey: the opening forty to fifty minutes are great fun with snappy dialogue, funny situations and good pacing throughout but oddly enough, as soon as they leave the train for certain reasons the film looses all the punch and energy and becomes something a little slower and a little different; suddenly, it looses its humour and it looses its focus since it's not a comedy anymore but some sort of emotional drama. The scene that sums this up is upon leaving the train, the brothers are at loggerheads and yet a certain event involving a child in peril forces them to re-join just when required.I also question director Wes Anderson's commitment to his content. The film already changes genre; which although isn't a bad thing if done correctly, but here it's for the worst. But the deeper problems lie in his consistency: the Indians on the train are poorly portrayed since the guard is a liar and a thief when it comes to the snake and the Indian woman is far too loose to be committed to her religion: she is an Indian character written by an American with American female character traits in mind; thus she comes across as a bit of a slut. I also found the undertones of fascism and Nazism a little disturbing. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but what was the relevance of the German couple at the beginning? Furthermore, the name of the garage the brother's father left his car at is entitled 'Luftwaffe Motors' Luftwaffe is the name of the German air force; the same air force that the British went to war with in 1940 ? why does Anderson use the name 'Luftwaffe'? Thirdly, there are swastikas painted on walls at various points in the film: one is on the ticket office when they are thrown off the train the second is chalked onto a wall nearer the end. I know the religion of Jainism uses the Swastika as their emblem and did so centuries before the Nazi's but with so many German references up to this point; you have to wonder what the hell was going on and whether there was a connection.But this is the film summed up. It starts off like it is going to be a good film about an important trip at three points in three peoples various lives but plays out once it, quite literally, comes off the rails. I hated the way the camera would pan instead of cutting to the next shot (cute the first time Wes but not after a while); I didn't like the way lingering shots of the boy's funeral and Indian culture as a whole were lingered on since Anderson is basically trying to educate us on a subject I don't think even he knows much about: the relaxed attitude to being in India; the portrayal of the Indian train stewardess and the way Peter (Brody) is almost mimicking a spiritual Indian act towards the end by doing his own 'Indian' dance/pose as he lets the feather go ? was that supposed to make us laugh? If so, why would the director think it was funny and the other rituals (such as the boy's funeral procedures and the spots on the forehead) not funny. This is a film people will enjoy on the surface but look deeper and there is certainly something there that is unnerving. The music is fantastic, the acting and overall characterisation is good and Anderson does make good use of the setting visually if not culturally. There are moments in The Darjeeling Limited that are funny but not in a laugh out loud way but that's the consistency of the film: subtle.</fullReview>

He seems to be rehashing the same material and themes over and over and over again, and as a viewer, this was by far the least rewarding experience I've gotten from any of his films. It was less funny, less emotional, and there was less action than in any of his other films. In summary, THE DARJEELING LIMITED offered nothing new to the viewer already familiar with Anderson's work. In this way, it seemed like a tremendous waste of an opportunity to do something more. Perhaps Anderson should welcome Owen Wilson back as his writing partner? Whatever the case, I, as a fan, make the plea that Anderson should attempt writing something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT for his next film, because right now he seems to be stuck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary movie that proves you don't need a big budget or flashy special effects to make a great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To everyone that thinks all Wes Anderson movies are the same, The Darjeeling Limited begs to differ. With a bizarre plot, quirky characters, and absolutely amazing acting, Anderson's newest film does literally everything right to break from the mold, and it's certainly not your typical Hollywood film. Darjeeling is filled to the very end with subtle humor and never relies on nasty gags or stupid catch phrases. The film stars Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, and Anjelica Houston, along with a couple cameos from Natalie Portman and Bill Murray.Three brothers who haven't spoken to each other in a year set off on a spiritual train voyage across India to discover themselves as people and become friends like they used to be. Francis (Owen Wilson) is the annoying, know-it-all control freak, Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is the quiet writer looking for romance and love, and Peter (Adrien Brody) is the outspoken middle child who is generally freaking out because he has a baby on the way. The three personalities of the characters mesh into one big, epic journey that scales all across the desert and India, most of the time on the train called The Darjeeling Limited.The acting and the dialogue is the best thing about this film, and the subtle humor makes for lots of laugh-out-loud moments. Owen Wilson gives his all to make his character Francis incredibly annoying and self-centered, wanting to control literally everything around him. Adrien Brody was my favorite actor out of the bunch, and it's so refreshing to see him appear in an indie-type film, as he usually sticks to the big-budget blockbusters like 2005's King Kong. He gives a really memorable performance and is a stand-out even among a very solid cast. Jason Schwartzman continues giving sensational performances in all of his movies, and this one is no exception. Ever since seeing him in Slackers, it was so obvious that this guy had a huge future ahead of him. Anjelica Houston, as always, absolutely shines in her small role. While she was disgustingly underused, her performance was one of the best in the film.Darjeeling Limited is yet another sensational Wes Anderson film with non-stop slow-motion musical montages and lovable characters. The best part of any Anderson movie is how the ending is happy, and yet there is always just a tinge of melancholy to it. This ending is no exception. While it cannot be said that Darjeeling is Anderson's best film to date, it is definitely one of the best movies of the year and an altogether amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three brothers and a "spiritual" quest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited (2007) was co-written and directed by Wes Anderson. It's basically a picaresque film about three brothers who travel across India by train on a spiritual quest.As it turns out, the quest is more personal than spiritual--the men want to recapture the close relationship they had as children. The actors who play the three brothers are all highly competent professionals--Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman. Wilson was brave enough to be filmed for almost the entire movie with his his face hidden by bandages. (Medical note: the bandages were as clean and pristine at the end of the movie as they were in the beginning. Absolutely impossible in view of the plot.) As in a picaresque novel, the brothers experience interesting, unusual, and--in one case--tragic situations on their journey. They also meet interesting people--the lovely Amara Karan plays a stewardess on the train, and Waris Ahluwalia plays the chief steward, who is not amused by the antics of the brothers. (For some reason, Anderson has chosen an actor for this role who grew up in Brooklyn, and has no trace of Indian-accented English.)Darjeeling Limited has real strengths--the incredible scenery, the fine acting, and a glimpse of a world that appears highly exotic to us. On the other hand, I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable, and I found the ending disappointing. It's certainly worth seeing the film for its positive qualities, but it's not worth a special detour. Incidentally, we saw the film in a theater. It will definitely lose something on a small screen.</fullReview>

This movie feels like it stretches on for hours in a story that could've been told in a matter of a few minutes.I could not relate to any of the characters nor did I think that the choice of actors were at all believable as brothers. There are most definitely some very funny scenes and witty lines that had me laughing but overall I was very disappointed I wasted $10 and an evening of my time watching this movie. This is a movie worth seeing in my opinion, but one that would be best rented if you don't want to walk out of the theater feeling like you too wasted your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday, when it opened here, and generally disliked it. I confess that I am not a Wes Anderson supporter: if I liked Wes Anderson films, then I would probably have liked this film, since it does seem very like other Wes Anderson films. But I disliked it probably as much as other Wes Anderson films.What struck me most strongly this time was that I suddenly realized why Wes Anderson films ... or at least this one ... are so easy for me to dislike. It is because they seem above all imbued with a sort of consistent misanthropy.Or at least this one does. The stylistic and structural elements are not repugnant to me. The cinematography seemed to me to be stylized but delightful. The scenes generally unfold as highly stylized tableaux vivants only loosely concatenated by a very loose plot structure. But the humor was what was most striking. I felt like I was once again a sophomore in high school, with a sneer on my lips for anyone and anything around me. And that is the kind of view of life that I feel I am invited to in this movie. Everything, and everyone, deserves a sneer, seems to be the Anderson message. Even ... in a particularly brutal sequence ... the death of a child.Contrast another film maker known for his stylized approach to film: Quentin Tarantino. A Tarantino movie seems to invite me to almost the opposite of a sneer for everything; rather, I feel invited to like and respect and find something good and worthwhile in everything. In an Anderson movie, in this one in particular, I am invited to view everything with an amused contempt.Thanks but no thanks.I did love the scenes in India. The acting of the main characters seemed competently consistent with the tableaux vivants they adorned. There is a sort of crisp cadence to the unfolding of the loose concatenation of scenes that to me was appealing.But all in all, I think I'd rather watch things that don't invite me to that sophomoric sneer that I thought I had long ago left behind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At this point in time I see 7.6 stars out of of 10 with 19,747 votes counted. Has the world gone insane? Is everyone in India voting for this piece of trash? This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. You had better get lots of sleep before watching this one. I fell asleep twice while watching it on DVD. It's unbelievably boring throughout. Owen Wilson is terrible. The other two main character actors were marginally better, but there just isn't any story. How can anyone portray these characters? I'm just dumbfounded that this movie can have such a high rating.Here's the one thing I found about IMDb. Don't pay attention to the stars as much as looking at the user comments that "hated it". This one has several pages of "hated it" comments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not at all good to watch.I was pretty surprised with the houseful crowd in the theater. The movie is boring all the time where i took at least 3 breaks to watch the movie. This movie actually tests the patience of the audience.........................The cast looks good on paper with adrien brody and owen Wilson but the characters in the film are not at all suitable to their skills of acting.The darjeeling limited is actually a name of the train where the title seemed to have no importance when it is related to the story. The only relevance with the title is that the three brothers spent most of the time in the journey of the train. I went along with five of my friends to watch the movie just to come out with headaches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Darjeeling Limited is a great film with both comedy and drama, a mix I very well like. After viewing the Darjeeling Limited, I was both entertained and enlightened into the films of Wes Anderson. I've never seen a Wes Anderson film before the Darjeeling Limited, except for a part of the Royal Tennebaums but I was to young to understand it. The acting was very strong by the three male leads (especially Schwartzman). But the only complaint can be shown that Adrien Brody was a little stale in the first 15 minutes of the film. Meaning, that it felt as if he, Adrien Brody, was playing his character. Not the character being the character (like he often makes). And it truly felt forced in those minutes. But after the rough entry he certainly delivered a strong performances. I also thought that Owen Wilson was exceptional being the 'watch dog' type brother. But to bring these characters to life, they needed Wes Anderson. He delivered a unique script and a great story, with structure, flow, and a somewhat focused story. But the flow was flawed in some aspects as I believed the movie dragged in a few rough patches. But as a whole, was clean cut and effective. Overall, The Darjeeling Limited was a great film with a few minor problems of focus and pacing. Even though the film had these problems go on the film was and is a great film and probably one of the most enjoyable films to watch of 2007. Also, a great soundtrack. I suggest you buy or rent the DVD and enjoy a feast of performances, comedy and drama. All in the same showing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching The Life Aquatic nearly three dozen times, I found myself counting the seconds to the release of The Darjeeling Limited. The film's limited release in theater's reassured me that Anderson had not "sold out" and had chosen to stick with his writing/directing/set-design that is so beloved by the theatrical cognoscenti. He has not been corrupted by the dollar. And, indeed, this film was a gem with lovable characters, brilliant use of space in the sets, interesting/humorous/touching story, meaningful dialog, and Wes' typical use of color and anachronistic props in his sets. I loved every second of it. And, as with most of his films, it improves with subsequent viewings. I don't really have anything to add to the comments of others here who love this film as I do. In closing, let me say that Wes Anderson is the man. Period. Keep them coming, Wes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Darjeeling limited is a story of 3 brothers and there journey across India in search of spirituality and there mother.This is unmistakably a wonderful film with exceptional cinematography.This film has a different take on humor. Which, I hope most people will enjoy.Owen Wilson is wonderful in his role as a control freak who plans everything to the last Detail. Which include hiring a travel planner who prints and laminates each days schedule and travels in the different compartment of the same train . Although I live in India and has traveled across the country, this film brings a refreshing change. The Art direction has a very retro feel to it. Although clichéd it brings out the colors of India beautifully.Its a 9/10 movie.Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a perhaps misunderstood example of film as metaphoric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the Nightmare on Elm Street or the Nightmare Before Christmas, Citizen Cane or Hell in the Pacific, The Darjeeling Limited is another example of Hollywood's pseudo-Eastern process of meta-absorption. In other words, Wes Anderson's film, like many of his made by others before him, is a metaphor for another film. Audiences may be initially confused by this interpretation, as his previous films explored an opposite paradigm of group dynamics in which the story's multiplicity was self contained; however, there are plenty of clues in the film's narrative and presentation to provide an entry to understanding. The introduction of The Darjeeling Limited not through a preview, but through a short film, Hotel Darchevaling, should clue anybody into the frame of meta-referentiality. Natalie Portman's actual nudity, as opposed to publicity concerning nudity in another film (whose name escapes me), which did not happen, is a crude way to establish direct lines of meaning between different narratives; an obvious concession to the American consciousness circa 2008, but one which we can accept, as everything, after all is context. The film itself is quick to provide other clues to it's unusual but not unprecedented mode of discourse. Bill Murray falls away, the stalwart usual suspect of Anderson's social dynamics left at the wayside to signal a new paradigm. The camera-work is a wide and linear, simultaneously distancing the viewer and exposing them to more of the action; a surefire technique to place the psyche onto subconscious tracks suggesting referentiality rather than interdependence. Most tellingly, the film is not, as tradition dictates, concerned with action, but with dialogue about action. This is not, I have determined, a commentary on American politics and life, as other critics have suggested, but rather more simply a necessity dictated by the film's nature, its entire narrative floating sheetlike above that of another; the social commentary which this may suggest is merely an ontological side effect, meaning created through similar structures in the relationship of concept to reality substrate. If there is any meaning in the similarity of the film's structure to structures in the outside world, it is accidental, and therefore all the more powerful. But to return; a question has most likely by this point suggested itself to you: what is the actual film, if The Darjeeling Limited is the metaphor? You can see it in the final shot: as the characters run to catch the train, a solitary figure also runs in the field in the background, heading towards some unseen goal perhaps 300 feet to the right of the train's direction of motion. I do not know what this goal is - the train is in the way - and by consequence I cannot identify the film. But the mystery, as in all films, is both the battle and the love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room for the audiences' interpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That "The Darjeeling Limited" is a movie about family dysfunction would suggest a logical continuation of director Wes Anderson's "The royal Tenenbaums". Whether it's a comedy or not is debatable. While there are absurdities aplenty, the caricature funniness of the three brothers is overshadowed by the always palpable sadness that possesses them.Set on a "spiritual journey" after their father's death, purportedly to rekindle some of their brotherhood bond, the three brothers are presented to the audience in three different levels of self-indulgence. Oldest Francis (Owen Wilson) is easily recognizable as one with an impulsive obsession to manage and control things (and other people), and towards the end, it is painfully obvious to us that this comes from his mother. In the middle is Peter (Adrien Brody) who seems always consumed in sulking anger and resigning gloominess, deteriorating relationship with his wife being perhaps the main reason. Inscrutable youngest brother Jack (Jason Schwartzman) seems completely devoid of any feeling until it comes to women, as exemplified by constantly tapping into his ex-girlfriend's (Natalie Portman) phone to hear voice messages, or losing no time in striking up a liaison with the train's attractive attendant Rita (Amara Karan).If this is a road movie (or a rail movie, to be exact), there is no particular destination. Oh yes, Peter reveals to his brothers in the middle of the journey that they are going to look for their mother (Angelic Huston), to find out why she failed to show up at her husband's funeral. Finding her however raised more questions than gave answers. It's as though what director Anderson wanted to do was to array a collection of raw emotions and let the audience assemble them as they please. Visually, there is always something interesting going on, as Anderson seems to have gone all out to make each frame a stimulating visual experience. The colour reminds me of Pedro Alomdover, not because these two directors' employment of colour scheme is similar, but just because they are each provoking in its own way.That this movie is an open invitation to the audience to interpret is perhaps best underscored by the character played by Bill Murray. It shouldn't even be called a character as this is only a cameo appearance as a businessman who fails to catch the train that Peter succeeds in hopping on to meet his brothers in the beginning. Some like to see him as the father who died, symbolically. Others have different interpretations. Take your pick.What really deserves mentioning is the 13-minute prologue "Hotel Chevalier" that was filmed as an entirely separate movie, complete with opening title and concluding credit roll. This is where Natalie Portman appears (except for a 2-second cameo in the main body of the movie) as the ex-girlfriend who tracks down and visits Jack in a hotel room in Paris where he is in some kind of self-imposed retreat. This short sketch is exquisitely filmed and in that sense deserves to be considered a separate piece of cinematic work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Anderson Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson returns with another subtle and beautiful comedy/drama about three brothers trying to come to terms with their father's death while taking a spiritual journey across India. Marring together traditional camera styles and that of bollywood films Anderson weaves the story through a tapestry of colourful set pieces and sibling rivalry. Brody, Wilson and Schwartzman play the brothers brilliantly each with their own unique mannerisms and ticks. Although different in some ways from his earlier films it still contains his trademark mixed bag soundtrack, use of slow motion and unrivalled attention to detail in every single shot. There are some laugh out loud moments but to me it was more of a none laughing comedy, that's not to say it's not funny, it is, it's just that you laugh inside more than outwardly as you identify with the uncomfortable situations. With little cameos from Bill Murray, Natalie Portman and Angelica Huston adding to the line-up the film gently travels along its path to hopefully enlightenment for the cast and audience alike. This won't be to everyone's taste, some will find it slow and too earnest, maybe even a little twee, but if you let yourself go along for the ride you should find the Darjeeling an interesting journey to take.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heat and Dust Anderson style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with a short film featuring Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman - it is well done but I could not see the point, maybe someone can explain that to me.So I will skip to Part II - this thankfully had no Natalie Portman, instead it started with Bill Murray on a madcap hair-raising taxi ride through the town of Jodhpur to the train station to catch the Darjeeling Limited! He misses it but Adrien Brody (Peter) does manage to get on with his numerous bags. He joins his brother Jason Schwartzman (Jack) in a train suite and they wait for their brother Owen Wilson (Francis) to appear. Owen has planned a trip for them to discover their filial feelings and bond as brothers. The madcap journey involves praying at various shrines, having sex with the attractive train hostess who delivers nimbu-pani (lemonade) and savory snacks, drinking lots of cough syrup, consuming heavy duty pain killers, and opiate pain killers dispensed through a dropper, pepper spray and a snake bought at the local bazaar, and engaging in some "mind cleansing" ritual with peacock feathers and chants! The snake escapes, the pepper spray is injudiciously used and the trio with their 14 or so suitcases, a printer and a laminating machine are thrown off the train. Now they are on their own in the desert, trundling their suitcases along and fall into another adventure that involves saving some drowning boys, but not all are saved. A funeral is attended and a sojourn in the village does finally result in the much sought after bonding between the brothers. It is in fact ironic that the brothers who are new to India achieve some measure of peace and acceptance of each other, while the mother (Anjelica Huston) who has run away to a convent in India, actually runs away again to escape from her progeny who are visiting her! The movie is exceedingly well done - the atmosphere is palpable, and one can almost smell the dust. India is shot au naturel with no glamor but is most appealing due to the personalities shown - some scintillating, some terse, others simply beautiful even when they do not speak much. One such personality is Irrfan Khan - he does not need words to convey his feeling in this film. Owen Wilson is genius as the rich, managing, conniving older brother wrapped up in bandages from his accidental encounter with a mountain. Adrien Brody is the funniest with that oh so serious face, and constantly wearing his dead Dad;s prescription sunglasses. Jason Schwartzman is excellent as the cool ladies-man younger brother who finally has to use the pepper spray! Most of the music is from Satyajit Ray films and a rare treat. The cinematography is brilliant with no gimmickry, the dialogs quirky and often hilarious, and the movie is infused with the mystical sense of a personal journey that seems like it is going nowhere until things finally click into place.A must watch for Wes Anderson fans but I think there is much here for all to like.</fullReview>

The packaging is fine, nothing great, but it works. The picture and sound quality are acceptable and make it a good cinematic experience. However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarrassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on ABF's top 100 best movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD with this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched! Personally, I think fullscreen is for idiots who think they're getting the whole picture when they're not. You people put no actual thought into making DVDs, you just slap some crap together and think its fine. No, it's not fine! Clean up your acts!</fullReview>

As to be found as Ironic, The film contrasts every aspect of itself with repeated broken pacts and more and more ironic scenes. In about a 4th of every scene, Three brothers are scene to be dropping some sort of narcotic. Again an Ironic tone emerges as the afore-mentioned scenes seem to be the only scenes were the brothers function as a whole. As Wes Anderson has struggled with the ironic comedy before,(The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, The Royal Tenenbaums)He triumphs with a Great performance by Adrien Brody. Even with Owen Wilson's, again, sub marginal bout with acting, The guile as a whole Brings this Film to a point that just may rival Sideways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darjeeling is very limited...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I say how much I disliked The Darjeeling Limited, let me start by saying that I consider Rushmore (1998) to be one of the more important films I have seen. However, since Rushmore and its predecessor, Bottle Rocket (1996), Wes Anderson has shown his audience very little to convince them that he's interested in growing as an artist. His recent films (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2001) and The Royal Tennenbaums (2004) , Anderson has been fixated largely portraying little more than spoiled and sheltered rich kids enacting affected and weak characters to heavy handed ends. While his first two films worked with themes very well (maybe the scripts were just better) his films since, have had little else to support them other than their evident quirkiness. His reliance on his childhood friends as a safety net to indulge him time after time despite the lack of palpable inspiration is regrettable. Is it too much to ask of a very talented director for a probing and mature evolution of his initial inspiration for film-making? Is it too much to ask of a very talented director for a probing and mature evolution of his initial inspiration for film-making? Professionally, one would maybe address the success of using his mostly ensemble cast to some triumph and then try something else after three or four films? Darjeeling has a great premise, very interesting actors and the stunning canvas of India to work with but all Wes could muster from it was a small collection of gags surrounding only a hint of actual family drama about three brothers whom I could hardly feel any empathy for. I didn't feel like there really was a death in the family and that the characters were just talking about it because it was in the script!Wes Anderson isn't here to duplicate the magic of Rushmore for me or any other disappointed film goers who loved his first two movies as much as I did, but it won't stop me from saying that I am embarrassed for him lately. He has devolved into a director who has left substance behind for style alone.In the interest of recognizing the diversity of public opinion let me add that when the film was over there were six or eight people who applauded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes me want to go to India. Wes Anderson gives some beautiful yet untouristy scenes of the land, people, and culture.Wes fans should like how this is more his standard style than his previous film, the too far-fetched "Life Aquatic." As in "The Royal Tenenbaums," he deals again with the dysfunctions and neuroses of family in a style reminiscent of J.D. Salinger, but with more humor. Here he tells the story of three brothers reuniting on a journey through India. The eldest calls it a "spiritual journey" but does it stay that way? You'll see.As usual Wes employs great music, indulging (maybe too much) in his trademark slow-motion scenes to carefully-selected songs. I especially enjoyed his usage of the Kinks "This Time Tomorrow." Joe Dassin's "Les Champs Elysees" was another nice touch, a tune I remember from 6th grade French. Personally I wanted more to be resolved in the end (which comes abruptly), but perhaps this was his intent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three brilliant actors teamed with Wes Anderson. This has to be Anderson's best yet. I love Wes Anderson movies. They are odd, real, and incredibly original. And Darjeeling Limited was all of that and more. Watching the movie made me want to go to India and experience all the adventures of the three brothers. It was so exciting to watch the estranged brothers come together through their history, misadventures, and matching trunks. Whether you have enjoyed Wes Anderson's past stuff or not, this is a must see. Owen Wilson plays the oldest brother, Francis, desperately seeking to mend the broken relationships between the three men, while also mending his broken head. Adrien Brody plays the disgruntled, still-grieving middle brother, Peter, who grudgingly came along for the ride. Jason Schwartzman plays the impatient youngest brother, Jack, who likes to turn his personal life into literature, and is seeking suitable alternatives to his recent break-up. The three come together on The Darjeeling Limited under the direction of Francis, and the story beautifully unfolds thereafter.</fullReview>

Wow, there's some dichotomy there ...For me, this is a parody of run-amok ego and empty spiritual seeking, nothing more, nothing less. These characters are not _supposed_ to be likable or deep; they're so unaware of their surroundings that they're caught in a keystone-cop kind of existence. The saturated, zoom-lens styling is vintage 1960 ... but, wait, there's an MP3 player throughout ... so there are still people like this today? If you're part of that scene, or envious of it, you won't find it funny. Otherwise, the laughs are rooted in amazement. There's no conventional narrative because ? as a schematic about living a tunnel-vision life ? not even a real loss can register for three clueless Americans for more than a day. This is India as seen through their eyes. They learn a little something, but not much. Sad and funny at the same time.This is a Rorschach ... my favorite kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with a soul.... and great music from The Kinks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that when you love a movie its because you see it at exactly the right time in your life to trigger a big emotional response. I'm 38 and this movie spoke volumes to me. What's it about? The plot for me is life itself... you start off with one plan and it ends up getting wrecked / rearranged by unforeseen occurrences and you're own lack ability to communicate properly with the people you love the most. Your intentions might be honourable but the results are often damaging. BUT&gt;.. that's not a bad thing. Because out of the chaos and misunderstanding that your plan generates something else emerges. Something you could never have planned out. Owen Wilsons character had it all mapped out but the behaviour of his brothers and his inability to tell them the real reason for the journey upfront results in them being thrown off the train... and that's where the real experience begins. Away from the itinerary... away from the known path and the tourist routes... in a place even the railroad hasn't got on its map. This movie is also an excellent mirror to hold up to any sibling relationship on the planet. The dynamics of being brothers (or sisters). Who gains the confidence of who? And how left out do you feel when someone close doesn't share information? On top of all this -the film is fantastic to look at and it made me want to see India for myself. I had no interest in going there before I sat down to watch the movie. So it succeeds in showing me something I'm aware of in a new light. It also manages to mix emotive subject matter with laugh out loud slapstick (When they descend the hill to board the train/when they fight over passports and run through the train). Finally - they used 3 or 4 tracks from the kinks album "lola vs powerman"... songs which are very cinematic and emotional. I love the kinks and so any film that draws attention to less well known songs by them is a good thing. "strangers" was written by Dave Davies about his brother Ray. They apparently used to fight like cat and dog and this echoes the theme of sibling difficulty in the movie...but also the sentiment of brotherhood that they all feel (lyric: for we are not two we are one). "this time tomorrow" from the same album is about constant movement and trying to plan the future at a time when you find it painful to look ahead at what's to come because deep down you haven't come to terms with the way things have recently changed. Again this echoes where the characters in the film are emotionally. Its 12 months since their dad died and the first year after a close death is often the hardest. Most of the time I find it frustrating when a film uses death as a dramatic foundation or turning point.... IE someone dies and everything changes in the story or the characters show more depth... but in this case it was entirely appropriate. Its real. This movie didn't depress me or leave me with any unanswered questions. A joy to watch and better (for me) than anything else the Directors done to date primarily because it got the job done in 91 mins rather than 120. It felt like quite a few things were stripped out before the final cut and that was most certainly a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an Adrien Brody fan, I have two ratings for his movies: "Worth seeing mostly because Adrien Brody happened to be in it" and "Would've loved it even if Adrien Brody hadn't been in it." THE DARJEELING LIMITED (TDL) is a little of both in the sense that TDL truly wouldn't have been the same without Brody, because he and Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman (who also wrote the great script with his cousin Roman Coppola and director Wes Anderson) have such perfect chemistry as the Whitman brothers: respectively, middle brother Peter, oldest brother Francis, and youngest brother Jack. TDJ also shows a rarely-seen side of Brody: his flair for comedy.At Francis's request, the estranged brothers meet in India, hoping to track down the mother who abandoned them and strengthen the brotherly bond that's been unraveling since their father's hit-and-run death. The Whitmans (Whitmen? :-)) find themselves (in more ways than one) having a series of oddball adventures through the wilds of fascinating, beautiful, hardship-ridden India, made all the wilder by Francis' well-meant but maddening control-freak tendencies (the man has his schedules laminated, for crying out loud!); Jack's fiction, which isn't as fictional as he claims it is (as a writer who's always getting family feedback, I liked the brothers' funny/poignant reactions to Jack's story); the brothers' lifelong expectation that everything will fall apart, including their relationships; and their tendencies to act, well, not exactly like Ugly Americans -- more like Dorky Americans as they get hung up on material possessions like Indian medicines, pet cobras, and the Louis Vuitton by Marc Jacobs luggage they inherited from their father in addition to all their emotional baggage (I wanted to cheer when they finally got rid of both).In addition to being believable as brothers, especially in their comical petty bickering, agreement-making, and secret-keeping early on, Wilson, Brody, and Schwartzman all look good in their own vaguely dorky way (that's meant as a compliment, I assure you :-)). All three of them have big ol' sad-puppy eyes; as my husband and I have joked, a good alternate title for TDL would be "THE 'AWWW!' MOVIE." :-) (As Peter, Brody's eyes are often hidden behind the oversize sunglasses he inherited from their late dad, making him look like a 1960s European movie star.) I wouldn't complain if the three of them teamed up for another film together, with or without Anderson (but preferably with Anderson, since everyone worked so well together)! Much has been said about how, after Wilson's real-life suicide attempt, seeing his head bandaged up for most of the film from what turns out to be a suicide attempt becomes doubly poignant, and I can't disagree, though I think TDL would still have emotional resonance without it. Watch for fun bits by other members of Anderson's repertory company, including Bill Murray as a tourist in a hurry and Anjelica Huston as the Whitman brothers' runaway mom.When TDL opened wide, Fox Searchlight attached HOTEL CHEVALIER (HC), the "prequel" short previously available online, to TDL as "Part 1" of the story (TDL being "Part 2," of course), giving us moviegoers two movies for the price of one. The episode portrays a tryst between Jack Whitman and the unnamed ex (Natalie Portman) he can't stay away from, with Peter Sarstedt's wistful song "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" playing in the background. (This song also plays in TDL when Jack is pitching woo at Rita, played appealingly by Rosario Dawson lookalike Amara Karan.) Schwartzman and Portman have a chemistry that's prickly yet sexy and wistful. Portman gives one of her best performances here; she's like Audrey Hepburn possessed by the world-weary spirit of Simone Signoret or Jeanne Moreau. I half-expected Portman to choke on that toothpick she always had in her mouth, though! Anyway, HC has a sort of yearning charm, and it looked like it was fun to film, especially the love scene. :-) As always, Anderson uses music well. In particular, TDL uses great songs by Anderson's fave band The Kinks, as well as lots of stirring music from the films of Satyajit Ray. I must admit I never knew Indian music could make such a good backdrop for chase/action scenes. TDL is the dysfunctional family comedy-drama of the year, and Wes Anderson's best film since RUSHMORE, for my money. Rent or buy the DVD when it comes out in February!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banana Noses!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who ever casted Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman all together must have a Banana Nose fetish. I can not see myself even being able to concentrate on the movie without being distracted by those disturbingly huge and ugly noses. "Honey what did he just say, I couldn't hear because the sound effects were too loud?". "Uhhh sorry sweet heart I wasn't even looking because I don't want to have nightmares about monster Banana Noses attacking me. Uhh I really need to go, I am about to upchuck the pop corn." What a ridiculous casting decision. Unless someone in Hollywood is trying to make Banana Noses an attractive feature and/or new accepted fashion thing, like oily skin versus non oily skin, etc. I have no idea what the heck they were thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a lovely, lovely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is bleached to the ruddy-yellows of turmeric, the color of curry, and to the color of saffron. It gives a dreamy quality to the thing... yellow's not a pretty or a soothing color, but there is a spiritual openness, a sun-bakedness, about it here. We occasionally get to balm our eyes in deep indigo for contrast and rest.This spirit quest is dreamlike, the men are plucked from their lives and placed on this flimsy, beautiful train, which rocks and sways as it cuts slowly across the savanna. It's a command performance called by the oldest brother who has had an epiphany, and there are some things to work out (that's about all he knows about it), and it will take all three.The dry humor of interaction that calls back to their history as brothers- which we are wisely left to intuit and guess at ourselves- is delicious and pleasing. Just the right notes are hit here.. we understand just enough of who these men, and these boys, are.It's a delight to watch the spirit of the quest move into and animate the brothers; to watch the playing out of old patterns, the play of old hurts and loves, the reaching back and reaching forward, the odd increase in both humility and surety that comes with spiritual growth.The music is exactly what it should be- intelligent, sensual, dreamy.The flat-on snapshot like compositions of the three brothers are interesting and effective.The picture moves well, and resolves well. It is sensual and touching and funny. It is beautifully shot. The players are well suited to their roles, and play off each other very very well. The extraneous characters and scenes are not extraneous in any way, they complement and complete..An absolute delight.</fullReview>

I am not quiet sure if I have the right to make such comments. But, I spend most of my time watching movies, as many as I possibly can. I love them. I also love to judge them and the actors/actresses in them. It does not make it right but I do it anyway.

		<shortDescription>A road trip extraordinaire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Andersson has made another quirky off beat comedy. As in his other movies the narrative and plot seem to play second fiddle to the mood, the visual exploration and the portrait of the characters. This causes the events to proceed very slowly at times but also lends the movie that quirkiness and poetic undertone that defines a remarkable work. Also there are laugh out loud moments between the dysfunctional protagonist brothers that give the occasional breathing space amidst all the moodiness. Last but not least the opening scene featuring Natalie Portman &amp; Jason Schwartzman should not be missed as it is one of the most interesting love scenes ever made. This movie comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson makes movies about dreams, family and relationships whose broken or shattered - and THE DARJEELING LIMITED is another run for your Anderson-money, as it is his most vibrating and oddly funny to date; The Three Stooges of Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman creates brilliant interplay as heavily-bruised Wilson's Francis has organized a spiritual journey throughout Rajasthan's vivid landscape, greatly captured by cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman - and the captivating story of these three brothers who meets up for the first time since their father's Manhattan-death is filled with oddity, whether it's the spiritual input, the symbolism throughout, Wilson's combination of humor and heartbreak or Darjeeling's Part 1 - Hotel Chevalier, which tells another story of Schwartzman's Jack, this is another beautiful story told by Wes Anderson.This is a train-ride actually shot on a moving train, and it feels like Anderson and company got things made up as they moved along. And the chaotic and struggling hypnotically feel makes it a genuine experience that's so very moving and as any Anderson treat, ingenious. This movie went straight to my heart - beauty and sadness hand in hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Wes Anderson Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another film that can be added to Wes Anderson's impressive resume. It has the trademark Anderson style and belongs right up there with Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, my 2 personal favorite Anderson movies. Like all of his other films, the music is excellent with songs from The Kinks and The Rolling Stones. The opening scene with Bill Murray and Adrien Brody trying to catch the train with "This Time Tomorrow" playing throughout the slow-motion sequence is a classic opening scene.Out of all the actors in the film, Jason Schwartzman delivers the greatest performance as Jack Whitman. Jason, who also co-wrote the film, has some classic one-liners that you will remember. He is one of the best young actors out there right now. Owen Wilson also was very good as Francis, as he tries to be the leader of the three brothers. In my opinion, Owen has delivered his best performances in Anderson's films, but then again it is hard to get any worse than movies like You, Me, and Dupree.Like other Wes Anderson movies, I was expecting a great film and he truly delivered one this time. I wasn't a big fan of his last film, The Life Aquatic, but he definitely got it right with this one. Rushmore is still my favorite Wes Anderson movie, but The Darjeeling Limited is definitely a must-see, even if you are not an Anderson fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed it. It's a interesting, and symbolic piece with fine performances all around. Bill Murray did wonders with his tiny amount of screen time, as did Natalie Portman. Angelica Huston also gave her best performance in years, although that says very little. Schwartzman gave the best performance of the three brothers. He was interesting, and brilliantly emotionally stunted. I also enjoyed Brody, and Wilson gave his finest performance ever, but I still figure he should stick to writing. The screenplay was the finest aspect of the entire film. It was very relatable, and interesting. All in all, a fine and well done film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take three brothers. Put them on a train in India. Add a girl, a snake and a tragedy. The result; yet another beautiful and insightful work of art by Wes Anderson.The plot is without a doubt masterful and intriguing. The eldest brother, Francis (Owen Wilson) has an epiphany after suffering a near fatal motorbike accident. Ever the controlling of the trio, he books them onto the luxury Darjeeling Limited to resurrect their brotherly bond. And soon confiscates their passports to prevent any unscheduled escapes.Meanwhile, Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) cope with the death of their father and disappearance of their mother by consuming copious amounts of prescription medicine, meditation and childish tale-telling. Their antics inevitably have consequences, and soon they find their rigorously controlled adventure take an unexpected turn that definitely wasn't on the laminated itinerary.But it's the composition and perfectly seamless acting that really makes this movie stand out. The exquisite soundtrack combines modern tunes with traditional Indian song, while the colours, chaos and spirituality of India make this one of the most intensely stunning pictures I have seen all year. A cult movie in the making.The Fan Carpet - www.thefancarpet.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magical Indian Tour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Wes Anderson's previous works, and I have to admit that I was shocked to see Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzmann as Owen Wilson's brothers at first. But it's all part of the plan - they don't look alike in any aspect, and the gigantic difference in height between the three is proof that Wes probably didn't want your 'typical' brothers. Kinda like the "Three Amigos". Their differences make them funny. The shorter guy is the most seductive one, the taller is a quiet man who's about to be a dad, and Owen Wilson really shines here as a borderline-nut case with a lot of heart. The director uses a lot of intentional repetition in different scenes which makes the viewer feel attached to the characters, almost as if you were one of them, and that's fun.The story is basically about these 3 brothers who go travel across India on a train (The Darjeeling Limited) on a 'spiritual journey'. Their goals are not certain and their agendas are not the same, but this is a case of a simple story well-told.I can't say enough about the quality of his film. The camera shots make it look like you're inside the train with them. There's a particular telepathy scene that is marvelous. The colors are like the ones you'd experience in a psychedelic trip, and the scenery is fantastic. The soundtrack is excellent as well, it really transports you into their world. This is AWESOME film-making.It's a different movie from all of Wes' previous works, but I can see he drew a bit from Bottle Rocket, Tenembaums and The Life Aquatic. Darjeeling's Owen Wilson has the same obsession with itineraries as in Bottle Rocket, the family theme is borrowed from the Tenembaums and etc. Basically, his themes haven't changed - they've been improved, and his storytelling technique is now more brilliant than ever. Be sure to check out the short "Hotel Chevalier", as it is great in its own right and tied to this film. This movie proves there are still very talented people in the business.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darjeerling might gently put you to sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Murray misses a train at the start of this movie and unfortunately the audience catches it and has to follow a very subtle and not especially laugh-inducing story for two hours. Remember, Murray is not really in this movie. By the time this is over you may be fondly remembering his elephant movie.Some who didn't like The Life Aquatic have praised this movie, all the more to prove how out of touch they must be. At least Aquatic had a little more whimsy and some actual humor. Darjeerling has some unfortunate things happening to a trio of dysfunctional brothers, at least one of whom (Owen Wilson) takes after mom in the untrustworthy department.A third act opportunity (I think that was when it happened) to redeem the characters doesn't last long as the film settles in for a bland sadness. The message about baggage is a little trite.I'll admit I like Mr. Beans Holiday a lot better. It had more sense of purpose.Owen Wilsons usual groove and presence are here, but imposing his current (summer/fall 2007) personal headlines upon his character here is more interesting than the movie itself. In fact, it would be easy to believe that the man faked us all out as a publicity stunt for this otherwise bland and unworthy movie - make that film, rather: the sort of filmy thing that will put most of us to sleep while critics credit its "ambiguity" as some higher form of humor. The kind where you put a finger to your cheek and say "Yes, I recognize that the underpinning of that line had a comic intent" instead of actually laughing out loud.If pretty pictures are the end-all, be-all, this movie has a few of those and presumably we are looking at some actual India locations. But be warned even on that score: most of the movie takes place on the train or on interior sets that could have been shot anywhere.It would be easy to sum up the movie as "the reason Owen Wilson did it," but despite its self-congratulatory tone and flat-out boring end result at least Owen doesn't have a screenplay credit on this one so he should take some comfort in that.It feels like a first draft script without a pass for clarity and comic inspiration. Boring pretty much sums it up. It settles for patting itself on the head for even thinking about anything reflective in Hollywood. Very shallow critics will love it. Real people will be better advised to look for something more fun. Even Wes Andersons previous efforts will do.</fullReview>

None, few laughs and most of them when the three brothers curse of lose a poisonous snake. No depth for a drama, no edge for film-noir. If you find rewarding spending 1:30 hours watching glossy-mag spiritual journey kind of advice with three characters 90% of the film in a fake zonked-out state, this film will fill you with joy, curry style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance and a great cast wasted....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this, plus the prologue Hotel Chevalier, at the Venice Festival.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film, it just seems like an opportunity missed. Anderson makes beautiful, intelligent films with complex characters. However, while all these elements are here, the story itself is too thin to pull it off.The ingredients are all there - three brothers embarking on a train and, hopefully spiritual, journey in India together. Owen Wilson is consummately intelligent and kooky as ever, Adrien Brody does what he can with the material but Jason Schwartzman really comes of age as an adult actor. The cinematography is fantastic (although as any Bollywood watcher will know, it's hard NOT to film India beautifully) and there are several iconic use of images and colours, not least the fantastically retro Louis Vuitton luggage, and some nice character and family quirks tenderly observed; but the film frustrates in only touching at the obvious depth of the main characters, and hence their motives. Thus it's hard to maintain interest in their denouement.The film is saved from superficiality mainly by use powerful scenes with local actors, participial the superb Irfan Khan, who demonstrates his skills again after his landmark turn in 'The Namesake', ironically a lesson to Anderson in the power of a great story. Amara Karan also is great support, let down only by her English accent slipping through.Worth a watch, not just for the expected occasional great lines and the heavyweight talent on show, but one can't help but feel that Anderson needs to leave this genre behind and show the world his talents more accessibly, perhaps by using actors he hasn't grown up with.Overall, a great idea, too lightly executed - these characters would have made a great novel, but 2 hours in a cinema doesn't do it justice.</fullReview>
