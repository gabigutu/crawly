		<shortDescription>Magical trip to demise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie!... didn't want to see it at first.. But, then, when it begins, you take the trip with Blake to the big sea.So beatiful pictures, such poetry in every single one of them. Hypnotic black and white scenes, still and vast nature, music that takes you down the other side.It's the unconsious trip of one man to death, slowly descending to another level, deeper into nature. Or is he already dead and is not aware of it? Rivers, trees, animals and spirits to guide him along the way. This is a trip to self-knowledge, a hallucinational, sweet and slow resignation from needs and senses.Amazing directing, incredible photography and an also amazing Johnny Depp, sunk in his own visions and thoughts, excellent in his portrayal of a man's abdication to parrallel levels of consiousness.Thank god there is the indie american film making, that we see such beatiful movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soul Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only the best films create mood, and this is one of the best of those. There are some superb moments, stunning music, and of course, loads of mystical meaning.Here is a quick key: The train journey is a metaphor for the passage of Blake's life as well as the passage of man into the dubious morality of the machine age. The coal-stoker on the train seems aware of Blake's destiny and shows that this is not just any train.We might take Blake as an incarnation of the real poet William Blake. The coal-stoker's obscure reference to the ship might indicate a passage across the sea he assumed Blake made (from England).The shooting of the buffalo from the train (huh?) shows man's senseless destruction of nature.The hellish machinery of the train is shown taking Blake towards Machine, the crossroads of man's conscience and a place already turned into a kind of hell. The girl's paper flowers show how even pretty things have degenerated into a soulless artificial state, but is also a sign of hope. She hopes to have real flowers one day - a sign that she has a good soul.After Blake collapses in the street there is a rather large shooting star, presumably to indicate that his soul had left him (Jarmusch is being coy if denies this blatant indication that Blake has "passed on"). In fact, the best interpretation is that he is not quite dead, but dying, comatose: that enables the film to work equally well on two levels.Here's the key thing: the real poet William Blake had visions and wrote a book called "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" (geddit?). This book is written in a weird style that sounds quite like Indian-speak. In fact, several of Nobody's lines are taken straight from the this book such as "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn of the crow". Ironically, in the film, Blake does not understand any of what Nobody is saying and calls it "Indian malarkey".We can take Nobody for a bit foolish in a real-world sense, but in the spiritual world we must assume he knows what he is talking about. When he asks Blake "did you kill the man who killed you?" and Blake answers "I'm not dead", we can assume that Nobody's knows something Blake doesn't. In a scene cut from the final film, Nobody says that he saw a bluebird drinking the blood from Blake's wound. This obviously showed Nobody that Blake's soul was worth saving - otherwise it would have been a vulture, not a bluebird, on his chest.Nobody = "no body". A further indication that he is of the spiritual world.Nobody and Cole (black as coal) are good and evil angels fighting it out for Blake's soul. They are each more or less indestructible, except that like good and evil themselves they can cancel each other out, as they do at the end.Everyone met along the way shows various types of human fallibility or degeneracy and each comes to a bad end, weeded out in the purgatorial process.The dead deer represents the woman he met in Machine, and bears the same wound. The embracing of the deer is Christian-type imagery, providing some indication of the good, redeeming side of Blake's character. During his "trials" (Nobody gives him the odd test) Blake shows both good and bad aspects to his character, and so at the end we can assume he drifts off into neither heaven nor hell, but in limbo.There's surely more. For example, the sheriff's head (that Cole crushes under his boot) is an exact replica of Lenin - implying that communism is more evil than Evil. And I was interested to see one reviewer mention that the name of the bar in Machine has some relation to the death of Stalin's wife.No doubt the film is worth more than one viewing. However you look at it, it's a terrific creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filmed Poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch is one of my favorite directors, and Dead Man is probably the greatest work he has ever done. Very rarely does a film come alive with a sense of poetry. The only other film I can compare it to would be Wim Wenders' Wings Of Desire. The film moves like a dream, floating and spinning around you. Neil Young's electric score churns like a ghost train and pushes the film farther. There isn't one performance that is wrong, nor is there ever a false moment. From start to finish this film pulls you into it's dream land, and carries you along on clouds until the finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profoundly spiritual film speaking to our true human nature in this world of illusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to check this movie out as I am now studying William Blake poems in my English class. This movie is flat out brilliant. To see Jarmusch make something as pretentious as Broken Flowers is kind of shocking. The amount of symbolism and metaphor in this movie is awesome. A real tribute to the actual William Blake. If ever Blake took a quest, this was it. I knew this movie was going to be good as soon as I saw the vast list of slightly eccentric actors lined up in it. This script must have touched something deeply spiritual in all of them and I, if I were them, would have felt as if I wasn't even in the film. So many times was I moved to tears. It is its own entity. Amazing movie. I'm definitely adding it to my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inescapable Doom at the End of the Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heading towards a metalworks factory at the edge of the known universe, a pristine, young accountant named William Blake steps into the ungodly, mechanical hell that is the town of Machine. And so begins this man's descent into purgatory...in the wrong place, at a point where time itself is nonexistent. Blake arrives in Machine after a demented, tireless train ride through what may be his own self. Spanning the beauty of epic horizons and dense forests, yet ending in the bleak misery of the barren desert, we meet this out-of-place traveler in a tiring, strange situation. His frailty is evident: alone, without a living heir, struggling to make his way amidst the freaks and grim destination that awaits. As expected, the town itself begs no welcome, as the malevolent rumors prove true, and leave Blake face to face with the dusty spines of inexorable destiny. In more ways than one, the Wild West awaits...From this point on, Blake embarks on his surrealistic journey into nothingness, as he becomes a marked man running from nearly everyone and everything. Trusting in a Native friend (appropriately named `Nobody'), the descent into Blake's rejection is juxtaposed with the realities of a truly inescapable destiny. As such, the notions of ill fate and bad luck are separately defined alongside each other. Soon enough, however, Blake learns to cope with the road to ruin, and from his relationship with Nobody, he begins to transform into the gunslinging poet he never was.In these aspects - the premise, the cinematic device, and the endless attention to narrative and metaphoric detail - the film is simply brilliant. Watching Johnny Depp's character transformation amidst Jim Jarmusch's artistic direction of both beauty and brutality is simply exceptional, despite any problems the film may contain. A feeling of purgatorial confinement is truly achieved as humor is mixed with suspense, and uneasiness blends with inevitability. This is definitely one of the few movies that strangely seizes the disposition, toying with it until sufficiently queasy.Nevertheless, while the story, acting, and cinematic composition of the film are excellent, certain directorial choices do prevent it from achieving perfection. The primary problem concerns the dreamlike quality interspersed through several drawn-out fades: while effective, they are overused, and only serve to impair the flow of the film and it's intended message. Another problem is the tempo of the action: the characters, while quick to quip and raise their weapons, engage in gunfights at the speed of snails. When a shot is fired, the attacker simply stands in place, only to be killed by the target he missed. This particular criticism can lend itself to the film as a whole, as well. In other words, had the entire pace of the film been quickened, perhaps Jarmusch's voyage into the depths of doom and despair may have been more effective. Lastly, as in many independent films, superfluous `art film' shots and indie flavor over-season the picture simply to separate it from big-studio Hollywood...though as the film progresses, these moments become less apparent. Overall, this film is one to be seen by anyone who enjoys a creative story with TONS of review value. Several notable faces make their way through the screen (Gabriel Bryne, Robert Mitchum, Crispin Glover, Iggy Pop, and more), and the dirty, electric twang of Neil Young's guitar fills the gaps with a dark, mechanical, Southwestern gloom. Enter the town of Machine, and you'll be processed as well. Just watch out for snags along the trail - they make the journey a bit annoying, and certainly longer than what is warranted by the reaches of the attention span...or simply the principles of artistic efficiency. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, well achieved work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Jim Jarmusch at his best. I re-watched this movie a week ago and I'm still amazed by how Jarmusch gets under my skin and makes me think. Jarmusch plays with one of his favorite themes here: death. But of course, he's not limiting himself to that. He's questioning the western as a genre, he puts music in this movie in a way that makes it necessary for the viewer. Without Neil Young's guitar, this movie just isn't the same.Johnny Depp plays William Blake an accountant from Cleveland lost in the west after some strange quiproquo. Blake is shot and dying throughout the movie. Helped with an Indian named nobody, he finds himself on his way to the other world. Lots of resilience shown by Blake, getting stronger and stronger as the difficult times are approaching. As much as the accountant never seemed to have evolved, he's taking bigger and bigger leaps as death is overshadowing him. Touching tale of friendship, resilience, death and guns! This movie is an all time great</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful journey through life and death...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Western genre has always been misunderstood as a simplistic, racist (and misogynistic) traditional genre due to the many mediocre Westerns of the 40s and 50s. However, real good Westerns have delighted us with complex stories that take advantage of the setting themes: the conflict between honor &amp; law, wilderness &amp; civilization, and life &amp; death. Director Jim Jarmusch, who has achieved fame and recognition in the independent film community, uses the elements of the Western genre to create his very own poetical meditation on these themes, giving the genre his personal touch crafting a powerful and original gem.Young accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) seems to have lost everything as his parents have died and his fianceé left him without a reason; so he decides to take a job in Machine, a town located at the end of "civilization" in the Wild Wild West. To his misfortune, the job he applied to has already been taken and now he finds himself really without nothing. However, his life will change forever after by a series of circumstances he ends up murdering a man, becoming an outlaw, although getting badly wounded in the process. Now, traveling along an outcast native who calls himself "Nobody" (Gary Farmer), he'll begin a strange and surreal trip that'll prepare him for the next stage.Written by Jarmusch himself, the film's story details Blake's trip guided by Nobody in a similar way to Dante's journey in "The Divine Comedy", where a series of "episodes" are used to explore different ideas and themes across the trip. Jarmusch subtlety mixes drama and comedy to deliver his philosophical meditation making the film an entertaining experience, never becoming boring or tiresome. The Western setting is used effectively to tell this story and "Dead Man" toys with the Western elements in a subtle, respectful and quite entertaining way that neither parodies it nor makes fun of it in any way.Shot entirely in black and white, the cinematography (by Jarmusch regular, Robby Müller) captures that feeling of loneliness and emptiness that William Blake's life has, as well as his collision with the wilderness of the wild west. Jarmusch camera-work together with Neil Young's excellent soundtrack give the film a beautiful surreal look that echoes Blake's equally surreal journey across the darkness searching for light. Finally, another interesting point is Jarmusch extensive care for detail in his portrayal of the American west, as well as his respect for the Native American cultures that play an important role in his film; making "Dead Man" one of the most realist Westerns ever made.Johnny Depp's performance is remarkable, and probably one of the best in his career. Blake's complete transformation across the film is a real challenge and Depp makes the most of it. Gary Farmer is equally excellent and he is as effective in the comedy scenes as he is in the drama scenes, showing his flexibility and talent. The supporting roles present an assortment of cameos where actors such as Crispin Glover, Lance Henriksen, John Hurt and Robert Mitchum (in his last role) appear giving outstanding performances despite the limited screen time they receive. Henriksen certainly delivers his best performance in years.Jarmusch's film is a brilliant poetical meditation of life and death, but its episodic nature make it feel even more slow than it is, as every vignette is separated by fade outs that break the mood created. This really damages the film's atmosphere, as it feels as a forced wake up after a pleasant dream. Another problem, is that fans expecting an action-filled Western may end up disappointed, so bear in mind that this film is more about feelings rather than actions. Despite his minor problems, the film is still a very enjoyable experience and a whole new way to experience Westerns, so even non-fans of the genre will appreciate it.To summarize, "Dead Man" is an atypical look at Westerns that presents Jarmusch's interesting views on life and death in an entertaining, attractive way. Among the revisionist westerns, "Dead Man" is a valuable gem that is worth a watch. Even non-fans of the genre will find something interesting in it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>plot lacks meaning?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please...if you think there is no plot and no meaning....visit a few Indian Pueblos, study some American history, read more William Blake. This journey into the fire of hell has the most beautiful and moving ending ever filmed. A train to hell...Have you ever had a dead end job? What is the connection to Nobody? Why is his name Nobody? What happened at the General Store? Why wouldn't the guy sell the Indian (Native American) tobacco? Please reconsider. This movie is not the best ever made, but it doe's have a powerful meaning as it looks into the hell that Native American's were put through. Depp is a messenger. I saw the film six months ago and felt that Depp's performance was superb. I felt that there was a powerful symbolism in the film related to our concepts of life, death, and dying. The ending is the journey into the other world. The questions the film brings up relate to our concepts on premonitions, rebirth, death, life, and dying. Isn't it amazing that a fellow was named William Blake only to be discovered by a man named Nobody? And, after all we put Native American people through, isn't it amazing that someone with the name of Nobody would venture to help a Dead Man, that is one who is sure to become dead. And what of the prophecy, when bullets become words....oh, the meanings may not be clear, but the provocation to thought is at a very extreme level. Joy to all. Live this life and remember, this is a sacred journey. Every step counts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An illuminating existential cautionary tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, you have to be a Jarmusch fan. If you walk comfortably through that door, you'll find he does a bang-up job with this existential Western. So does Johnny Depp, who plays the lead--a lost unemployed accountant in the old west who happens to be named William Blake. Gary Farmer, the Indian from Ghost Dog and The Score, calls himself Nobody because he doesn't like his given name that means "one who talks much and says nothing." Nobody serves as William Blake's savior, doctor, guide and boatman "across the river." Neil Young wrote and performed the score. Blake's nemesis is played by Lance Henriksen as a terse cannibalistic bounty hunter. Delightful cameos include Robert Mitchum, Crispin Glover, Gabriel Byrne, John Heard and others.Symbolism abounds--there are shooting stars, down-shots of a hellish factory where Blake wanders looking for a way out, mines and factories of "white-man's metal," plenty of dead animals, including a small doe that Depp lies down with after decorating his face with its blood.But the movie doesn't fall into the trap of making white men the fall guys for everything wrong with the world in which Blake and Nobody try to make a living. Nobody mistreats Blake's bullet wound and is arguably responsible for his ultimate predicament. Nobody isn't worldly, despite having seen Europe in his youth. He believes the same white people were in every town he visited. The northwest tribe visited at the end were petty people who obviously thought Blake and Nobody were not worth their attention, evidenced by Nobody's imprecations to "walk proud" to the mortally-wounded Blake, and his nervousness at what might happen if he didn't. And of course, there is Nobody's innocent belief that the hapless accountant is the historical poet and artist.Held together with Young's musical score--mixed a tad loud for my taste--and the deterioration of the finances and health of William Blake, Dead Man is more than a picaresque, but the overall theme is elusive. Motifs are another story, and are liberally sprinkled throughout. Perhaps that's the point, ultimately--in the face of death, nothing else matters, and all the symbols and themes add up to nothing, driving the story from existential to nihilistic. Personal friendship, religion, wealth, work, technology, tribe, humanity, God, love--all mean nothing or are actively detrimental. For a movie named "Dead Man," that's not an unreasonable interpretation.Depp is an ideal actor to portray the reluctant gunslinger, and his personality does more to hold the film together than any other single factor. The camera loves him, and his ability to portray a variety of responses to his predicaments, from confusion, surprise and anger to amusement, disappointment and ultimately resignation is the heart of this thoroughly enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Jim Jarmush re-visit the "western genre", he does so with poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally from Cleveland, William Blake gets a job as an accountant in a place called "Machine Town". Already in the train that takes him to the Dickinson wood factory an "unknown guy" warn him against the place he is going to. It is not fortune that awaits him but Death. Indeed the first night in "Machine Town", Blake is shot at and wounded. From this point on start a long journey of wandering in company of Nobody, an Indian and a philosopher. This black and white film is mesmerizing. Obviously the black and white marks a rupture between what you are used to?So in essence this rupture is between let say classic Western and Jim Jarmush western as he re-visit the genre. It is also a way to keep the audience to what is essential?Color is a filter that can distract you, the sobriety of black and white will not. But what exactly is essential in that movie? Beside the fact that Mr. Jarmush depict a brutal and impulsive America, the movie opposes a new born civilization that is already collapsing and a dying one that is still shining?But more than that the journey of William Blake is a metaphoric and circular voyage from misunderstanding to certitude. The guide Nobody, himself trapped between the two civilizations can not provide a cure to the passing man but may very well provide a path to a curing one. This journey from Machine Town, the "anti chamber" of hell to the sea, first step to Heaven is tremendously poetic and emotional. Also emotional is the evolution from misunderstanding to comprehension between Nobody and William Blake who eventually settles on what is essential reaching a common ground, clarity? Help by a haunting and beautiful score from Neil Young and an extraordinary cast the film succeed in transforming the wood wagon of hell in which William Blake embarks to the wooden vessel to heaven in which he will lie. One of the best films from Mr. Jarmush, Dead Man manages to take the audience in one of cinema most poetic journey?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Very Close to a Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That haunting score. The bravado performances of Johnny Depp, Crispin Glover, Robert Mitchum, and of course, Gary Farmer, who is the absolute star of the film. So many great lines! Every night and every morn Some to misery are born. Every morn and every night Some are born to sweet delight. Some are born to sweet delight, Some are born to endless night. We are led to believe a lie When we see not through the eye Which was born in a night to perish in a night, When the soul slept in beams of light. God appears, and God is light To those poor souls who dwell in night, But does a human form display To those who dwell in realms of day. Gary Farmer's character, Nobody, understands that poem, but he doesn't understand why Depp's character, William Blake, doesn't know about his own poetry. He does know that the dead poet has come to be his spirit guide, and tells him, "You were a poet and a painter, William Blake. But now, you're a killer of white men."GOD this film is f*cking brilliant! I have never seen anything like it! My wife, who loves epic westerns, and native culture, couldn't watch it at all, finding it "weird and pointless."Why then, have I sat captivated through it so many times, as if in a dream, buoyed along by the surreal imagery, perfect cinematography, flawless acting, and inspired soundtrack? This film goes so far beyond what film is supposed to do, in so many ways. It speaks to us of things many of us dare not learn, and so many of us dismiss it as pretentious pseudo-art. Trust me, this is REAL art, and it's FUNNY! This is the greatest deconstruction of a genre ever attempted, and it works on every level. God bless Jim Jarmusch for this visionary and profound work, and God bless actors like Depp and Farmer, for their bravery in executing it.Lance Henrikson? Michael Wincott? John Hurt? IGGY POP????Where do you find a cast like that? And don't forget Neil Young's soundtrack, which Roger Ebert described as sounding "like Young kept dropping his guitar," or something like that. That was truly the perfect soundtrack for this film. Ah, the taste of REAL art!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand how this masterpiece of a motion picture would inspire somebody to make films. My Father is an avid Jarmusch fan and lent me the film Dead Man in 2001 when I was 16, I know I only watched it as a sexually obsessed school-girl longing for some Depp action, but what it actually did to me was something entirely different. Atmosperically guided by a soulfully dark score by Neil Young often a lone guitar riff, the film is as cool as the fingertips of God. 'Dead Man's loose coolness allows for a freedom within the script and the characters that the director wields with delicacy and expertise. By this I mean that although some of the dialogue may come across as mysterious and cryptic, possibly meaningless to some, the characters are given gifts in the form of perfect style that allows them to be whole. The film is perfect. How can Film Noir be Western? and how can Native American wisdom be coupled with British Georgian poetry? Obviously with some ease at the hands of a talented man. These splicings are amongst others veined through the events of the film and make up a large part of that which draws a viewer into an actual relationship with the film and fuels burning interest in it down to each single word uttered in the dialogue. Visually, 'Dead Man' is attractive, with the strangeness or beauty of the actors, and the lighting and landscape, often barren or harsh, that sets a wonderful Gothic playground for Blake and Nobody and the pursuers. Almost adverse to sexy choreographed gun toting, 'Dead Man' shows Blake's clumsy murders as quirky and almost innocent, and they become stylised with 'cool' as Blake's poetry begins to write itself in blood. Jarmusch shows beauty in the Death that occurs in the wake of his protagonists Nobody and Blake and nothing vulgar touches them. Ugliness in the film is associated with mis-laid priorities such as the emphasis on the return of the Pinto horse rather than the capture of a criminal, and incessant talking as mentioned by Gary farmer's character 'Nobody' "he who talks loud, say nothing" and embodied by the character John Scholfield who eventually dies at the hand of an unwilling listener to his permanent tide of nonsense. Mismatched as they are wonderful or funny, the partnerships of the film are perfect, Nobody (Gary Farmer) the educated tribal outcast and William Blake (Johnny Depp the quiet accidental 'killer of white men' begin to illustrate the closeness of brothers through their misunderstandings and differences as they walk their destiny together. Believed by Nobody to be the true William Blake from the spirit world, Bill Blake from Cleveland, becomes indebted to his new friend who keeps him alive despite the difficulty of there being a fatal bullet wound in his body. The Trio of Philistine-hating vagabonds, the two bald marshals and the three grudging killers are amongst other well-formed partnerships that keep the plot afloat.Whilst violent but comic and perhaps at times unnerving, 'Dead Man' is casual while it is gripping, and involving while it is time-less and dream-like. With the gritty beauty of an imperfect lover that is perfect to you, 'Dead Man' is personal and passionately love-able. With 'Dead Man' Jarmusch has achieved an essence of poetic masterdom of all things being possible, to love a murderer, for example, where similarly of William Blake the Georgian Poet, in the words of a critic "proclaimed the supremacy of the imagination over the rationalism and materialism of the 18th-century".I watch this film a few times per year just to witness it's genius and allure, the way one might perhaps visit the Mona Lisa every so often if one lived by the Louvre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking meaning or plot but beautifully filmed and scored and very intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Blake is an accountant who travels deep into the west of America to the frontier town of Machine to take up a job with a metal company. He travels on the train for many days but when he arrives he is told that his job has been given to another man. Not sure what to do with himself he gets involved with a girl when her boyfriend, Charles, returns home to find her. He kills her and Blake is forced to kill him in return. He flees the town but collapses only to wake with the Indian Nobody nursing him and telling him he is dead. With a bounty on his head, Nobody leads Blake to the water where he will cross to the next world.I first saw this film when it came out in a (now sadly closed) art cinema in Birmingham. I have only seen it twice since then but it has always stayed with me and made such an impact on me. The plot is little more than a journey, a journey that is never really explained or put into any context. However it is the sheer imagination and atmosphere of the film that prevents this being a problem. The precredit sequence of the film will tell you everything you need to know - if you are intrigued by the scene, taken by the atmosphere and gripped by the intense train driver, then you will love the rest of the film. The scenes continue with the dark foreboding atmosphere and the strange but gripping cast of characters. It is here where the film happens and it is all the better for it.The support cast of cameos are all great and their characters include a silent hitman, a chatty hitman, a travelling group of homosexual rapists, a prophetic train driver and a gun crazy businessman. If this gives the impression of a `wacky' film, then trust me it is not - it is not funny, it is spellbinding. The characters come and go but they are so imaginatively drawn that they all remain memorable. Jarmusch's direction helps this as he gives everything an unique visual touch. The photography is beautiful and framed really well in black and white - visually the film stayed with me since I first saw it, it was so distinctive. Of course it may not have managed that without the haunting and menacing score from Neil Young. It works so very well and is part of the reason the film stays with me.Now that he is `Oscar Nominee Johnny Depp' and not just `Johnny Depp' it is interesting to look back on this film and pleasing to see that his ability to find out worthy pieces has not diminished with the odd bigger film here and there. He is the wide eyed innocence here and is very much just the vessel we use to sail through other characters. As an actor, he impresses with his willingness to play a low key role while the support cast shine in colourful characters. Farmer is good in his Nobody role while the best roles go to the main bounty hunters - violent and sullen Henriksen and the funny chatty Wincott. Glover shows what a real intense performance is and is creepier here than all his efforts in the Charlie's Angels `films'. The support cast features memorable turns from Hurt, Mitchum, Molina, Iggy Pop and Billy Bob Thornton. They, along with the visuals and music, are what makes this film so very memorable.Overall, this is not for everyone and I'm sure it will frustrate many with it's seeming lack of plot and lack of traditional narrative. However it is hard not to be taken in by the gorgeous black and white images presented here with the haunting score and a journey that takes in one colourful character after another. It may not have much substance if you're after plot but it will stick in your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enraptured by this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER First of all, I must say that for the most part I dislike Westerns; hate bloodshed and violence in movies; and, since I don't believe in killing animals or people, I don't like movies that portray either graphically. Having said that...Dead Man is one of the most remarkable and mesmerizing movies I have ever seen. I just came upon this move recently on IFC and I have already watched it multiple times. The cinematography is hypnotic and brilliant, reminiscent of some of the wonderful scenes in The Long Riders (another move that I "shouldn't" have liked, but did!).The acting in Dead Man-- incredibly quirky and on target for most of the cast--left me stunned by the talent of Depp, Farmer, Henriksen and Thornton. Neil Young's instrumental work--which is almost another character, providing a harsh, pounding voice--is such a complement to the movie, I cannot imagine any other music in its place.I have read most of the comments and it seems that only a few folks came away from this movie with the concept that I have - Blake is already dead. But Nobody sees that Blake should have died when he was shot. That's why he asks "Did you kill the white man that killed you?" Then when Blake says, "I'm not dead," Nobody assumes the role of trailguide taking Blake on the path to acceptance of his death.There are so many symbols, allusions and metaphors in the film, both obvious and hidden, it's like panning for gold. The film is so poignant at times it almost hurts, like the pain that Blake feels from the bullet near his heart. I can't believe I missed seeing this film "at the movies" and never heard much about it until recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would Blake make of it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****SPOILERS*****A polarising film this, with critical opinion at either extreme. I felt that it was a failure, though an interesting one. It simply failed to develop it's initial premise, it wandered and languished and as the film progressed it petered out, rather than rose to a crescendo.The cinematography was beautiful. Even on my VHS copy the screen shimmered like the films of old. Although the set-ups were often "stagey" and awkwardly composed, the camera moved delicately and precisely.There were some memorable performances, especially Robert Mitchum's bit-part and John Hurt's creepy company secretary. Johnny Depp seemed uncomfortable and, ultimately, wooden. Although the film is meant to be an existential-social journey, by the end he looked bored, reflecting my boredom with the film.I wanted to like it. The first part of the film set up what seemed to be a promising story, but this was all-but forgotten about as the film progressed. Occasionally one of Blake's would-be assassins might pop up, but this didn't seem to create any sense of drama.What is the significance of Blake's outsider status? He is an accountant who goes to work in Machine, but doesn't get the job (he's too late). Meeting a young woman who makes paper roses, he is shot along with her by her lover, whom he (Blake) kills. Then on the run, he encounters an Indian called Nobody (in Blake's poetry, God is called "Nobodaddy"), but thereafter it descends into a messy and confused saga.Films are stories and they need plot and characters, dialogue and development. This film had no real development, it lost momentum very quickly and retreated too often into "arty" face-shots, droning guitar music (the score by Neil Young by the way, along with the cinematography, was a highlight of the film) and fade-outs. I failed to see where the profundity lay.I am familiar with the works of William Blake, and took straight way to the themes of industry, capitalism, nature and lawlessness, but these were never developed in any coherent way. There was masses of significance piled onto William Blake's identity, but there was ultimately little that was made of it. What would Blake make of it indeed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The films opening and other parts of the film reminded me of A Hard Day's Night. The inventive, oddly humorous train ride and the constant search for Tobacco as the parallel in Hard Days Night was the constant notice of the clean old man. Then the scene of the tranvestite (which was intelligently cynnical), the guy with the British accent and the more down to earth red neck was of a british style of humor. But I have to say the most hilarious thing was Depp's clown suit or with the hat looked more like a leprachauns suit.The film is the first Western to authentically represent the true west. Unlike all other westerns I have seen this film brings out the dirt and truth of the time period. Even though the film is not really a western. I would label it more of a art film.The direction was amazing and the cinematography of the woods was particulary enchanting and beautiful. But the art behind the camera did not stretch to the music. I found it noisy and annoying even at times blatantly telling me to hit the mute button. But i endured through it, the worst part of the film.Thankfully(minor spoiler in only this sentence), Thel, was killed early. Her acting was lost. She sort of hovered in the camera altering her emotions constantly seeming unsure how to act. Compared to the professionalism of Depp I am grateful she had less than 5 minutes of screen time.Jarmusch did a very through(sp?) job of his script. His characters were filled out and overflowing in personality. The Indian(" Stupid ****ing white man.") was easily the best though. His humor balanced out the otherwise slightly bland art film. The bounty hunters had their strange qualities even their ironic ones(one sleeps with a Teddy bear). Or the fire sitters with even their shot amount of screen time. "Big George: What's a philistine? Sally: Well, it's just a real dirty person."The film started dragging towards the end. The camera man times would just stand there, too long, in front of Depp's face for no apparent reason. The humor also died down, leaving the film in the hands of its spiritual and poetic counterpart. One not all exciting. It also gave way to Depps transition into hardass that happened too quick. An over the night reformation doesn't happen especially if it involves going from not being able to shoot a gun with glasses to being able to with out them.The film moved gracefully and poetically. It was easily watchable apart from those final 20 minutes that became to lost in finalizing it's philospohy to provide entertainment. Dead Man was good but the masterpice some of the reviews claimed is as surreal as the film.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those who have eyes to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During my late teens and early twenties, I was taken to see many films by a friend of mine who was the son of a Persian film director.He was never interested in what I thought of a film until we were outside the cinema but told me how to watch the film, during the film.One of the first films I saw was Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law in the Turkish quarter of Paris with French subtitles. We sat in the front row and roared. We were the only ones. It all seemed rather lost on the rest of the audience. All the way through he told me the things to see.Here are a few. First, Robbie Muller's cinematography. Beautiful vistas moving to the pace of the film. Paris, Texas springs to mind.Second, the recognition of amorality in the world; a world of "nature red in tooth and claw". All of Jarmusch's films that I've seen have a "rough diamond" edge running through them. An edge where the animal response is the correct one - the place that Hitchock always alluded to but never dared go to.Third, "incompleteness" if there is such a word. Jarmusch always leaves questions dangling; Why was Carl Perkins better than Elvis (or vice versa)? Did Eva really go back to Hungary? Is Nobody already dead? In this sense, Jarmusch is more a novelist than a film maker - he leaves much for you to fill in with your mind's eye. Quite an achievement, considering how compelling the visuals of film are.For me, Jarmusch's daring is that he allows the viewer to fill in a lot of the context for a scene. The context, naturally, defines the scene, yet Jarmusch is bold enough to let the viewer place it later. Perhaps much later, when you've worked it out.So when I watched dead man, I was ready. The last Johnny Depp film I'd seen was Chocolat, superb. I understood and appreciated Robbie Muller's approach and I had most of Jarmusch to date under my belt.Two things sprang to mind with Dead Man. The first was a Sci-fi novel, written because the author was 20 something and needed the money. The second was the Tibetan Book of the Dead.The first occurred to me because of the way I encountered it. I was researching and building eLearning systems at the time and the eLearning crowd hailed Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card as the eLearner's sci-fi novel. I read it and the basic lesson is that the training has to be so real that the student doesn't know when it's really real and, even then half thinks it's training.The second occurred to me as a consequence of the first. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is a manual for dying and being reborn. It has options such as getting out of the wheel of incarnation altogether or doing a damage limitation exercise on how limited your capabilities are going to be in the next life - and everything in between.One of the central premises of this yoga is that life as we know it is a simulation of the real life - a kind of Ender's game, if you will. When one sees the finite from the position of the eternal, the question of where one ends and the other begins inevitably arises and it's this that Jarmusch captures so wonderfully in Dead Man.William Blake (the real one) had none of this knowledge that we have today but what he did have is opium. Survey the poetry of the opium-heads. They all had a sense of eternal spirit - it comes with the drug. It gives the connectedness and empathy of E with the hallucinations of A but the chilled response to it all of weed.Like Jarmusch, Blake, Coleridge and the rest recognise the harsh reality of the nature we live in, yet are still able to celebrate its beauty and the lessons that it has to teach us.The pace of Dead Man is that of an opium hit, one only has to take the stuff or read the Nobel Laureate Naguib Mahfouz's Adrift on the Nile to see that. The Neil Young sound track is naturally irritating if one cannot settle down into the pace of the film. For those who understand it, it is the hypnotic metronome that keeps time for days after the film has ended.Magical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a theater major nor am I an educated critic. 8 years ago while living in the small town of Crested Butte Colorado...I had an intimate psychological connection with a young lady who ran the local video rental store next to the 4 star restaurant to which I worked as a sous chef. At the time..when I came in on my nights off looking for a bit of diversion, she came to learn of my unique tastes...tastes to which I could not comprehend. She simply stated: "you need to check this out...I know you'll like it". She very accurately described it as "A western that goes.....this way"...gesturing by hand a very obvious diversion from the norm. I was hooked, rented the movie, came back the next day wanting to know how to own this masterpiece. She was quite taken by my satisfaction to the point that when I offered "any reasonable price" for the movie poster, she happily accommodated.I own maybe 5 movies altogether and this one is the centerpiece. Nothing less than a cultural masterpiece. Every once in awhile I pop it in to bring peace to my existence, or to recommend to a friend just to read the reaction that they derive.If you have been moved by this movie, you are on a path that you may not comprehend. Embrace and commence with the journey.....we are in a reality that is not commonly defined. To read this movie is to be invited..to a consciousness not known by our breed. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful study on William Blake's works, in ingenious storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised that many comments I've read do not take into account that this film is to William Blake's works what the Coen brothers did with "O Brother" and Ulysses' voyages in the Odyssey. One must be rather familiar with William Blake's "artificial mythology" to understand the prominent themes running throughout the movie, from start to finish. Reading and studying Blake's "The fall of Albion" will help significantly in appreciating the depth and genius of Jarmusch's vision for his work. Of course, Depp, being one of the most erudite actors of his age, was most likely drawn to the part due to the depth of William Blake's works and their significance to the script (just as he had done with Fear and Loathing and Hunter S. Thompson's works, both were born in the same part of Kentucky as well, not far from where I grew up too). Watching this wonderful film with no prior knowledge of Blake is like swinging a golf club with a blindfold. One will hit something, but the result will be well short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unusual, Surreal Tale About Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) encounters a strange Indian named "Nobody" (Gary Farmer) who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world.Okay, we have an amazing cast here: Lance Henriksen, Billy Bob Thorton, Crispin Glover, Iggy Pop, and Robert Mitchum's final role. That automatically counts for something. And we have the whole thing shot in glorious black and white, which is all too uncommon since the 1960s. That is another point.Now, on the other hand, commercially, the movie lost a boatload of money (making only about 10% of what it cost) and ranks as the most expensive of Jarmusch's films.And critically, it has mixed reviews. Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film, giving it less than two stars and saying, "Jim Jarmusch is trying to get at something here, and I don't have a clue what it is." He calls it "a strange, slow, unrewarding movie" and says the score "sounds like nothing so much as a man repeatedly dropping his guitar." Others, such as Jonathan Rosenbaum and A. O. Scott, have called it one of the best films of the 1990s.I happened to like it, though I did not fully appreciate the William Blake references (as well as Tom Petty references). But that is my loss, not Jarmusch's fault. And I am not sure I got the message, if there is one. And I still like "Broken Flowers" better... but there is still much to love here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incrediblely accurate and meaningful Native symbolism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the movie quite by accident. You see I like "Nobody", have wandered now for sometime to fulfill my purpose. More accurately, unlike "Nobody", I have yet to do that.I will reflect often on segments and the whole of the movie when working on my art (painting/sculpture). This, along with "life" experiences. I do not expect anyone to understand this. A writer I am not. But, I do know great and good things when I see, hear and feel them.You might understand this, I have no extensive knowledge of movies or movie-making in general with exception, of having a very high regard for persons making art and contributing artfully to a movie like this, Dead Man.My experiences with Native Americans across the USA beginning in 1968 and, after graduation from the Layton School of Art, (now a meaningful memory of all those who graduated from that fine school) I continue to seek out ways or stimulus to begin again, my art. This movie stirred visual, audio images as well as feelings sometimes I thought lost. Memories or my living and, deceased Native American friends and families, their stories, lives and feeling, that they shared with me. I was and, am honored by that.The style of the movie, the expertise of the artists and actors, filming and obvious research so evident, is fantastic. Very well done! I will lay money on - folks had fun making this movie and felt in meaningful. I will encourage many to watch this black and white film for its portrayal of a period in time but, more importantly the portrayal of Native American life and wisdom. The movie reflected honestly the humor and spirituality I experienced in real life within this community. You see, humor is part of spirituality. I am confident those developing this film experienced the same and translated it throughout the movies development.The Movie, the Art, is well done. Entertaining, which I think many Natives will appreciate when I show it to them. I will hear laughing. I plan on making this movie a part of my permanent collection.I recognize Mr. Depp is a superior Actor and he does deserve credit. What I find equally superior, the art of all the contributors that resulted in this movie, Dead Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film presents to us a disgusting, depressing and boring world. Normally these would be flaws, but to create a film like this, with deep meaning takes skill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quote: "Dead Man" is not a conventional western. Instead of containing cowboys and saloon shootout's it opts to deal with psychological and philosophical concepts. While this may seek to scare western fans away from the film, in a way it manages to draw more casual movie goers towards it. Now the reason why I actually decided to watch the film was because initially it was initially banned for possession, sale and distribution in my country- Australia (for a rather stupid reason). I was pleasantly surprised top find a film so rich in thematic discussion I wished I had the pleasure of experiencing it earlier."Dead Man" stars Johnny Depp as the broke down-on-his-luck accountant William Blake, who travels by train to the industrial town- Machine for a job. Upon arriving at the town, Blake is told he is one month late for work, and that his position has been filled by another accountant. Angered by the decision Blake confronts the owner Mr Dickinson to allow him to work there. Mr Dickinson behaves as his name would suggest and forces Blake out at gunpoint. Depressed Blake meets up with a woman and makes love to her. At the worse possible time the woman's fiancé comes in, shoots her and wounds Blake, before Blake guns him down. Bleeding Blake flees the town on a stolen Pinto.Luck continues to be against Blake as it turns out the man who Blake killed was Mr Dickinson's son. Angered by his son's murder (and his stolen horse) he puts three bounty hunters on Blake's trail. Blake is saved from death by a plump Indian who is referred to as- Nobody. Throughout the rest of the film Nobody serves as Blake's spiritual guide through the "Purgatory" that is the American West.Now I wish to emphasise the word "Purgatory". The world the film presents to us is disgusting and depressing and boring. From the first scene which feels like half an hour the film manages to make its audience fell bored- normally this would be an obvious flaw, but to create a boring world with meaning is not a flaw; but a skill. Murder, cannibalism and attempted rape also infest every corner of the west. Such decisions manage to enforce this sense of depression on the audience (this is partly exacerbated by the black and white colour of the film) so that we feel as if we are actually in a form of purgatory whilst watching it. Purgatory can also be brought up in a more literal sense in the film. From when nobody refers to Blake as "a dead man" I pondered whether Blake was a "dead man" or if he actually is dead. After contemplation I began to believe more in the latter as it linked more strong to the idea of purgatory. It feels in movie if Blake actually died prior to arriving in Machine and that what he is going through is actually a purging process, before he is allowed to enter heaven and that Nobody is his spiritual guide through purgatory.Not much good seems to happen to Blake during the film; he is shot more than once and appears to be being followed by death. Blake murders several men throughout the film (all of which are in self defence) in rather shocking ways. This takes its tole on Blake and brings him deeper into a sense of physical and metal isolation from others and himself. This strengthens evidence for the argument that Blake is undergoing a purging process.There are also several more spiritual undertones in the film, which are often very hard to identify in particular the struggle between good and evil, or if you wish to be more spiritual heaven and hell. As I have said numerous times before Blake is escorted by Nobody the good guy, while being chased by sadistic psychotic bounty hunter- Cole (evil black as coal). Both wish to claim his "soul" in this surreal world; Nobody wants to save him, Cole wants to kill him. This classic good vs. evil is also emphasised in Blake's character. At times he is good natured; helping a woman who has fallen in a muddy puddle and at times he is evil; shooting a deputy and a sheriff. But even when he is "evil" we must search for any meaning or beauty to what he has done. The sheriff for example looks remarkable like Lenin and his death at the hands of Blake and his crushing of his head by Cole can very well be interpreted as an act of evil stopping evil- a definite paradox. Nonetheless there is beauty in this act as before shooting the deputy and sheriff Blake says a significant one liner "Have you read my poetry?" This is quite significant as poetry in a sense regardless of its content is beautiful, and as Nobody puts it "You will now write your poetry in blood, not words" (Nobody says this as he mistakes Blake for a poet of the same name, unaware to an ignorant viewer such as myself, Nobody constantly quotes from the poets poems) . Hence in a sense the two murders though evil, are beautiful.Overall Dead Man" is a remarkable, surreal, depressing and at times a boring movie. But that is exactly what it should be. If you can handle the surreal and the depressing tone (as well as some graphic violence), and can appreciate spiritual and if you interpret it as such "religious" overtones, you will be astonished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, Jarmusch at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch older jarmusch classics like Down By Law, and Stranger Than Paradise, the out of the ordinary western theme of Dead Man, may seem like one of those later career director stinkers. But thats not the case. Dead Man is probably if not the best, the most appealing Jarmusch film. It has the same feel of a Jarmusch film, the long awkward pauses, and the real life dialogue and events that is original to him. But also another element of badness, and cool action type scenes. I wouldn't recommend it for people who are all big western fans, because thats not really what dead man is. It is a western, but it almost has a modern feel to it, and a lot of good filming not just crazy shoot em' up gun fests. And one scene, probably one the best scenes i have ever seen when Johnny Depp finds the dead fawn in the woods, and he feels the bullet hole and lies down next to it and cradles its body, what an awesome scene, up their with the Pulp Fiction Uma Thurman cocaine convulsing and Wild At Heart, when Nicholas Cage stops with his girl on the high way to dance. A cool and classic Jarmusch film, recommended to all jarmusch fans, and just fans of good movies in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man (1995):Nightmare Vision of the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Jim Jarmusch, Writer: Jim Jarmusch, Genre: Drama/ Western Music: Neil Young, Language: English, Color: Black and White, Running Time: 121 minutes, Starring: Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer, Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, Mili Avital, Crispin Glover, Gabriel Byrne, Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thornton, Jared Harris, John Hurt, Alfred Molina, Robert MitchumThis story of a young man's passage through a frontier crawling with violence, death and decay begins on a train whose soot-faced fireman (Crispin Glover) delivers an ominous prediction. Appearing in the car where William Blake (Johnny Depp), the film's protagonist, is playing solitaire, he warns Blake that when he reaches his destination, the town of Machine, he will find his own grave. As the train hurtles westward, Blake, dressed in a bow tie and checkered suit, finds himself surrounded by silent faces. Peering out the window, he sees remains of abandoned covered wagons and other signs of decay. When the train passes a buffalo herd, his fellow passengers go to the windows with rifles and blindly open fire.He arrives in Dickinson where he is going to be employed as an accountant but showing up at the place, he is informed that the post has been filled. When he confronts the owner,John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum), he is ordered at gunpoint to leave at once. Blake visits a bar where he meets Thell Russell (Mili Avital), an attractive woman who takes him back to her shabby rented room filled with paper flowers she has made. While they're in bed together, Thell's former boyfriend, Charlie Dickinson (the company owner's son, played by Gabriel Byrne), appears and shoots at Blake but kills Thell instead. Blake shoots Charlie with Thell's gun, and jumps out a window, but not before he himself is critically wounded. Blake suddenly finds himself a fugitive with a bullet in his chest. From here, the movie changes from a horrifying frontier into something more problematic and self-conscious. Pursued by bounty hunters and law officers, Blake makes his way westward until he reaches the Pacific. For much of the way he is accompanied by an Indian guide named Nobody (Gary Farmer), who has dressed his wounds and believes his companion to be the reincarnation of the English poet William Blake.When Nobody tells his story, it turns out that he, too, is a sort of fugitive. Captured as a boy by white men, he was taken East and exploited as a sideshow attraction and from there to England, where he was educated and discovered Blake's poetry. The Indian appoints himself the poet's guide back into the spirit world.So what is depicted in the movie is the idea that Blake encounters a world of danger and decay rather than promise and freedom. Dead Man suggests that the West was indeed vital, but was a place of death rather than growth. Instead of an optimistic assessment of virgin land and opportunity, the film presents the spread of what one might call "white blight," the viral meanness and ignorance spread by European industrialism onto the lands of the lands of the indigenous tribes. That Jarmusch respects but thankfully falls short of romanticizing his Native American characters is one of Dead Man's more singular points of interest. Like most great Westerns, Dead Man holds the American West and its (white) inhabitants up to close scrutiny, and in this sense its radicalism surpasses virtually every earlier example. The film's power is impossible to extrapolate from its commentary on history and society. One cannot overlook its acknowledgment of environmental degradation associated with progress, its depiction of an indigenous people's ambivalence to whites and their encroachment, and its nuanced grasp of violence, particularly gun violence (not a simple "anti-gun" op-ed, but a beautifully literal rendition of firearms' deployment by people in moments of passion, stupidity, and cold anger).It is scored by Neil Young, who lets loud, amplified electric guitar strains settle in among the pictures. The music is limited, but effective. It very well punctuates this imaginative Western which includes interesting meditations upon the myth of the frontier, violence, artistic outlaws, and the serious situation of mistreated Native Americans. Blake's arduous journey toward death is a wonder to behold.The movie takes place in a dream state. To drive this home, we see several shots of Blake falling asleep or passing out from pain, hunger or exhaustion. By the end of the film, the images we see are dazed and dreamy.It is not like any other western. It's not an easy film to watch, and I predict that a lot of people will call it "joyless". But, I also predict that with the passing of time, this movie will settle in and find a place as a cinema classic.Slow, dark and very cool, Jim Jarmusch's anti-Western movie can attract and at the same time confuse you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(WARNING: Contains some spoilers.)This was a marvelous film. It has meaning, it makes sense. It's not faking anything. While it does require certain knowledge to fully appreciate, there is definitely more to be gained than egotistical satisfaction by understanding it.What I was most impressed by was that even if you're not familiar with William Blake, Dante's Inferno and other literary references in the movie, what remains is still engaging and watchable. Certainly, at least some of the references slipped by me. I strongly believe the odd, clumsy style of the gunfights was no accident. With partial exception of the first exchange, they are designed to show the outcome as fate rather than to simply turn Depp's character from a total klutz to an adept killer.I would agree that fate in and of itself is not something valuable in a real context. We believe in choice and consequence. Yet, it's what drives this story and makes it work.The only part I felt was possibly drawn out too long was the beginning on the train before Crispin Glover's character appears. The scenes of Blake looking around could have been halved without sacrificing any meaning. It also may have helped sway those who jump to conclusions based on first impressions.I'm amazed it got an R rating with the head stomping scene. That was as gory as it was unexpected. I had no personal objection to it but I have to wonder how many might turn away at that point, if not at the cannibalism scene which followed shortly afterward.Unless you object to strangeness and less than quick pacing, definitely give this one a chance. You'll be hard pressed not to walk away appreciating at least something about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I would like to say that I enjoyed the movie, because it's got very beautiful landscapes and marvelous shots and the great Johnny Depp and it's pretty deep in meaning...well, I can't, I really really can't. I was bored to death and hoping it would end soon. The ending was beautiful, but getting to it was at times excruciating to watch. Yes, it's about the journey of a man towards death, or he may even be dead already,and it's about the "other" side after death and also about how everything in this universe is connected, even in death, man and nature and trees and rivers and the sea and so on...but you don't need 2 hours to deliver this message...I got at times the impression everyone on set had taken LSD and they were shooting their hallucinations on tape in black and white.Well, anyway, it's not enough for me, sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard the strum of a distorted guitar ten minutes into the movie, I thought "wow, that was annoying, I hope that never happens again'... If only I knew that the entire score was the same f***ing sound repeated for every literal beat of this movie.Nothing about this movie works:-the editing was so poorly executed that I thought my Wifi went down.-Every transition is just a fade to black as if it was made for TV in the 70's-The writing feels like a flower child wanted to write about his inner workings, but was too pretentious, high, and incompetent that it comes off as such. Any symbolism or spiritual undertones are so incredibly flat and obvious that it's ridiculous to even be labeled as 'cerebral' on Netflix.-the acting (aside from the young Depp) was so poor that it felt like a soap opera. everything from the stuck up, angry old man in his office, to the stereotyped Indian cut-outs to the shoot-out at the very end of the movie that made me burst out laughing at how lazy, stupid, and melodramatic it was.-there's no reason to film in black and white, nothing else was ever attended to in cinematography because it looked semi-artsy enough to hold over a regular audience without making anything original or coherent.-every act of violence in this movie appears to be baby's first SFX, the man's head getting crushed looked like f***ing clay. the child getting hit with a rifle didn't even come close to contact. The makeup of Depp's face looks like it was made of crayola wax.Don't watch this movie unless you have a hard-on for style over substance. but even then, there is no style to this movie, it's garbage. the only way this kind of laziness could be accepted is if it was made in the 30's. This came out the same year as Braveheart, 12 Monkeys, Heat, Se7en, and The Usual Suspects...This is 2 hours of your life that not only will you not get back, but they will be forced out of you like a f***ing laxative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I call "first class". Music, picture, dialogues, atmosphere, the actors' play ? I like it all. What I do no like is that at least one scene could be easily moved to "deleted scenes" section, while all the deleted scenes should be put into the film. You don't have to be a fortune-teller to understand what "one scene" I mean.It is always enjoyable when the film is opened wide for interpretations. This is the case. When does Blake die? Where is he travelling? Is it reality? Who is that cannibal? Why is he being hit by an arrow? Who is that "Nobody"? Where is Blake heading? Being myself a bit of a guitar player I really enjoy the score. It adds a lot to the freaky pace of the film and creates the bizarre atmosphere.Great job, Mr Jim Jarmusch. But 9 out of 10 because of the existence of something extra and the absence of something vital and important. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humor, poetry, scenery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a lot in common with Robert Altman's deconstruction of the American frontier myth, McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller. Johnny Depp's "William Blake" is as ill-fated as Warren Beatty's character, the streets are as dismally muddy, and Neil Young's jangly soundtrack even strikes a similar monotone to Leonard Cohen's songs. Both also display the beauty of the Pacific Northwest. If you already know and love the real Blake's poetry you'll enjoy how it is used in this film; if not you should be inspired to check it out. No need for me to belabor the symbolism here - you can have fun deciding upon your own take on that. But other commentators tend to overlook the humor in this film, from Jarmusch's silly inter-cutting of the revolving locomotive wheels with the outrageous characters on the train; Gary Farmer's fat, Europeanized Indian; Blake's cluelessness about his namesake; and Billy Bob Thornton and Iggy Pop as hilarious savages. Robert Mitchum and John Hurt make noteworthy appearances, and Lance Henriksen even makes a case for the Terminator role that he lost to Arnold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, mytho-poetic, and haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie, and it was so poignant that I find myself inspired to comment on it immediately. I focused more on the story's relative symbolism and underlying allusions rather than the basic synopsis and found an incredibly profound and primordial message.The fact that the main character's name is William Blake, who consequently was a great "visionary" (painted prophetic religious visions rather than scenes from everyday life, like his illustrations for the Book of Job (which incidentally tries to reconcile the co-existence of God and evil)) painter and poet, is not a coincidence. (But he needs glasses! By the end he doesn't though....) It sets up this sort of interplay between two different belief systems in regards to the central theme of death and spirituality. The store keeper (near the end who asks for Blake's autograph), who represents religion and strict dichotomy of good/evil heaven/hell, spouts off a bunch of rehearsed dogma about how Christ is going to exact his vengeance upon the "heathens" of the earth. Then Nobody, who can represent the more spiritual aspect of death and the nature of things, counteracts with a saying of his own: "the vision of Christ that thou doth see is my vision's greatest enemy." And there's also a lot of talk about "hell" and "philistines" oh the side of the "righteous" Christian folk...hell, to some of the characters represents the place where damned souls are doomed. In classical mythology (from which even more allusions are made), it's just Hades--dismal, but not good, not bad, just a place for the dead. I saw Blake as sort of an Odysseus as well, one of the few figures who descends into the Underworld and has the fortune to return. And even though Blake dies, death is only the beginning to another life. "Nobody" can also be a reference to the Odyssey, as Odysseus uses the epithet "Nobody" to trick the cyclops in order to escape death. Also, Nobody takes Blake on a journey down river (Styx, perhaps) and to an Indian village (curiously reminiscent of Blake's entrance into the town of Machine) where Nobody then approaches what only looks like to me the gates of hell guarded by a three-headed totem poll (Cerberus?). "Philistines" is another religious citation...a group that is known via the Bible to make frequent incursions upon the Hebrews, or it's a label that could mean you're simply "uncultured" I guess. But the Philistines originated from southern Greece and were commonly known as one of the "Sea Peoples," which ties in with the finale of the movie.Furthermore, there are a few groups of three in the movie. This made me think of the 3 fates and the 3 furies. The Furies are the enforcers of "just" balance in human affairs-- namely Cole Wilson, Conway, and the Kid...Mitchum wants his damn pinto back! By the end, there is only Cole on the shores (of the Styx), who to me represented Thanatos or death (who is often represented with a shaggy beard and fiery face)in his solitude, the man in black. But there was also Nobody, who could have also represented death, as Thanatos was often seen in a more positive light when "Elysium" became more of an attractive option--the man in white. Good and evil? Or necessary and dependent upon each other? After all, one cannot exist without the other.Anyway, although this might not be a comprehensive appraisal, you can gather the deeper meaning. The film is, in a word, beautiful, a beautiful story nicely told. And the music by Young compliments the ambiance of the film perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effortlessly cool and self-styled western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man is a unique piece of film. As this is my first taste of Jim Jarmusch, I had no idea of what to expect, but even if I had; I reckon that this film wouldn't have conformed to them. Dead Man is a surreal and trippy western that peels itself away from the staples of the genre and succeeds in creating something truly one-off and self-styled. Lead by a score written by Neil Young, Dead Man is continually satisfying and powerful; and you get the impression that every scene has been fully thought through, and is perfectly realised as the auteur intended. For this reason, Dead Man captivates it's viewer from the moment it starts until the moment it ends, and as it descends into full blown trippy weirdness, you can do nothing but stare in admiration of this strange gem of cult cinema. The plot is thin on the ground and it largely lacks meaning, but it doesn't matter because Dead Man is a purely aesthetic experience. Still, it follows William Blake (Johnny Depp), an accountant from Cleveland that arrives in a town to take a job offer, only to find that the vacancy has already been filled? Dead Man is filmed in very stark black and white, which only adds to the surrealism of the story. Had this film have been done in colour, it would not have captured the same atmosphere that the black and white gives it; and so this decision was an inspired one indeed. One staple of the western genre that Jarmusch is keen to retain is the use of close-ups. The director spends a lot of time caressing Depp's facial features with his camera and, at times, even focuses on his lead actor when the action doesn't concern him. Aside from keeping in with the western tradition, this also allows Jarmusch to keep the focus on the main character, which keeps the viewer focused on his plight. For this film, Jarmusch has put together a cast of B-movie icons that will have B-movie fans foaming at the mouth. Crispin Glover, Robert Mitchum, Billy Bob Thornton, Lance Henriksen, Gabriel Byrne, John Hurt, Alfred Molina and even Iggy Pop feature and it's great to see so many faces in the same movie. The cast is, of course, lead by a man who is perhaps today's best actor; Johnny Depp. Depp's name on a credit list speaks for itself, and I don't need to tell you that his performance is great; nor do I need to point out the effortless cool that this movie exudes, largely thanks to the great man's presence. My only advice is see it...see it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unique in style, weird and deep, great characters and settings, Jarmusch and wonderful actors. Everything seems to be a tad too good to be true, but it is true. It is ALMOST a perfect movie. But since I am a fan of everything quirky, freakish and unusual I may not be too objective when it comes to "Dead Man". Filled with strange turns, choices, habits, logics and actions far out of the world we are used to calling "Normal" this movie really takes you on a somewhat spooky and amazing journey. And not one moment of it is boring.One other thing that was very appealing to me, besides the weirdness of J.Jarmusch, was the leading actor, Johnny Depp. Although he started off as a "teen pin-up star" over the years he proved himself as a serious and very diverse actor. If you like unusual movies then you can trust Johnny Depp's ability to pick out the quirkiest of them all. Always adding his own very well camouflaged charisma and unique style, he was simply the best choice for William 'Bill' Blake in the Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie grew on me. The first viewing, I was both fascinated and horrified. But watching it several more times, the poetry, the journey west, and the simple lessons learned all added to the shear beauty of this film. But if you are quickly bored, squeamish, or need the standard 'Happy Ending' please steer clear of this one.For those other adventurous souls, there are so many amazing scenes in this movie:William Blake's journey west was his descent into hell; the fireman is his the ferryman.Blake carries a bullet (white man's metal....'I'm a magnet") next to his heart most of the movie.The deleted scenes include several jewels: 'a small blue bird tasted my blood.....'The scene around the campfire, with Blake surrounded by the trappers, animal skins hanging in the background, each plucking at various parts of his body, laying claim to the spoils (they think) was both funny and terrible.The wounded, lost, disheartened Blake mixing his blood with the dead fawn and laying down beside it to 'try on death'."Are you William Blake?"....."Yes, I am. Do you know my poetry?"Nobody, guiding William Blake toward his hopeful, peaceful destiny, trying to protect him from the demons trailing him, all the while preparing him mentally for his departure.The final images of Blake.....Humor mixed with beauty, laced with the grotesque.This is a fantastic film. I'm rather fond of it. Give it a try. who knows? It might make an impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Jarmusch Film "Dead Man" succeeds on all fronts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch is one of the undisputed leading figures of American independent cinema.His films are a proof of the "never say die spirit" of American independent cinema which has been instrumental in putting some of the most oddball stories about eccentric human beings which classical American cinema Hollywood would largely adore to ignore.The best thing that can be said about Jim Jarmusch and his film "Dead Man" is that it scores fairly good points in all the aspects of successful film making.In this film,the very idea of an American film star Johnny Depp traveling in a steam locomotive to far west is amazing as it allows us to believe that leading players in Hollywood are always willing to contribute to innovative ideas.No good film can achieve success without good music.A perfect tandem between moving images and sound is achieved by Paul Young's haunting guitar riffs.They intensify the brilliance of dramatic scenes as each sound from his guitar incites viewers to pay utmost attention to the film's development of dramatic sequences.The fact that actors make or break a film's fortune is in full evidence as "Dead Man" is full of talented icons of American culture such as Robert Mitchum,Gabriel Byrne and Iggy Pop. There are happy moments of glamor,sensuality and sexuality too in the form of screen presence of sultry Mili Avital who radiates immensely despite her minor role.Wicked people always meet an unhappy end is proved to all and sundry as all the bad men die in a manner which is neither glorious nor heroic.Deriding white men and his civilization is one of Jim Jarmusch's favorite pastimes.This activity is seen in full force as an Indian man repeatedly mocks William Blake who is none other than Hollywood superstar Johnny Depp.Dead Man is also a superb tale of human bravery as an innocent accountant learns to save his life when he gets hold of a gun after being falsely accused of killing an influential young man and his girl friend.Dead Man is a film which must be seen to experience its richness of ideas because a film full of rich ideas must be seen as no amount of worldly praise can make a viewer come near its greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Jarmusch remakes Apocalypse Now in the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine if Jim Jarmusch (or Kevin Smith or the guys from South Park) re-made Apocalypse Now as a western and you have some idea of where this wild fantasy will take you. Jarmusch (who has killed before with his Night On Earth, and lesser known but superior Down By Law) continues his imaginening of world's otherwise familiar to us, now seen through a glass darkly, ironically delivering a more accurate, if disturbing, vision of ourselves through our myths.Fresh from multiple losses (his parents' death and fiancee's infidelity), Johnny Depp plays William Blake a sensitive young man from Cleveland who travels west on the promise of employment as an accountant in a mining town only to find his position taken by another. Alone and nearly broke he befriends and is befriended by a local girl who takes him home for the night. Now a classic film noir twist (appropriate to this black and white film) moves the story along to where Blake is (mortally?) wounded in a gunfight and unfairly forced to run from a charge of double murder. Temporarily safe from his pursuers, Blake passes out from the loss of blood then wakes to find himself in the charge of an indigenous mystic who calls himself Nobody (Gary Farmer). Learning he carries the name of his favorite poet, Nobody befriends the wounded white man and seeks to raise him to what Nobody believes to be his former, more realized self by setting Blake on a warrior's journey of discovery. Meanwhile, the evil industrialist Dickinson(Robert Mitchum), whose son (Gabriel Byrne) was killed in the ill-fated shooting and whose favorite pinto is lost in the Blake getaway, seeks to enlist everyone he can in the hunt for his son's killer. He begins by contracting a trio of gunmen/bounty hunters played by Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott and Eugene Byrd.What follows is a journey told through the parallel narratives of Blake and Nobody and their most formidable, if also most hilariously dysfunctional, pursuers. The best element of the film is in the gentle humor and intelligence in the story of the deepening relationship between Blake and Nobody.While audiences will be familiar with Depp and many of the supporting cast, we have seen much too little of one of the great undiscovered (in the U.S.) acting talents, Gary Farmer. To see more of this great artist check out his (lead actor) work in Powwow Highway, Henry and Verlin, Heater and the short film Two Grey Hills.The willingness of other members of the stellar supporting ensemble (including Billy Bob Thorton, Iggy Pop, Alfred Molina, and John Hurt) to inhabit small, albeit pearl perfect, cosmically bizarre characters is another key element in the success of this film. Some of the best moments from these performances are Blake's encounter with the three trappers at their overnight camp, and the relationship among of the trio of killers, especially between Cole Wilson (Henriksen) and Conway Twill (Wincott). Many times the dialogue is delivered in a nearly-inaudible manner while the characters move in and out of frame, and you may have to rewind to hear it all (be sure to catch Wincott's last couple of lines).Still, it is the blending of Robby Muller's acid-dream cinematography and Neil Young's fuzz-peddle riven score with Jarmusch's own twin contributions as writer/director that yields such a combination of high art and entertainment. This wonderful parody of the genre, and the white version of the history of the Old West, is explicated through a re-examination of the myths on which they are based. It is only the wrapping of humor that makes the recounting of squandered resources (physical and spiritual) go down so easy during the first look at this film.Dead Man is a fine work of art whose sum is even greater than its considerable individual parts. I believe it is one of the most underappreciated films of the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so basically this is the story of a man who gets shot, and dies. J.Jarmusch had the idea of showing us everything that goes through the mind of a dying man, which is a good idea, that's why I did not rate this movie as low as I initially wanted to.Because I seldom got so BORED watching a movie. I think this is the first time I kept looking at my watch during a movie, wondering how long it would still take before he eventually realizes he died. True enough, Jarmusch is a good photograph, the sceneries are nice even in B&amp;W, the music is okay (I am really a big fan of those Neil Young riffs, actually that's what kept me awake and concentrated on the movie instead of the girl next to me, which I married a bit later, that is just to show you that no matter how bad a film is, it can still lead to something interesting).The first part of the movie is interesting, though. But the last half hour is definitely to be forgotten... If only I could! Now, every time I see J.Depp in a cast, I hesitate to go. That guy is such a great actor, why does he have to choose such weird roles ? Why are there so few that dare criticize this movie ? Because it's Johnny Depp and Jim Jarmusch ? Give me a break !My last advice is : Stay clear from this movie, keep your five bucks or whatever the price may be, and desert any video rental that proposes it. (2/10)</fullReview>

But underneath that jumble the story is unremarkable, trying to present the contradictions of modern culture in an Old West setting. The slow pace does not help things - the film only seems like it is 6 hours long. Even more pompous and tedious than the Coen Brothers "The Man Who Wasn't There". When Kubrik presented cultural contradictions like those in this movie in his films (such as Eyes Wide Shut among others) it worked, but Jim Jarmusch is definitely no Kubrik.</fullReview>

John Dickinson sends a posse of Cole Wilson, Conway Twill and Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett to go after him.I really like some of the odder surreal touches from Jim Jarmusch. The movie starts well with the train trip and the muddy town. The movie loses steam after the killings. Gary Farmer is a little funny but I get a sense that he's meant to be much funnier.

		<shortDescription>This film is a western film, so it is necessary to know what western as a genreis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a western film, so it is necessary to know what western as a genreis.What is scholars' idea about this film? In other part it is necessary a summary of the film and at the end some points about the film. Jens Martin Gurr (2006) wrote some points of Kites and Hoberman's views:" Jim Kitses's claim that "first of all, the Western is American history" (Kitses 1969, 57) and J. Hoberman's observation that it was "typically the vehicle America used to explain itself to itself" (Hoberman 1991, 851) could hardly be made about any other genre of film. If, therefore, one wants a drastic, a fundamental, a sweeping critique of the very concept of 'America', the Western is the natural genre in which to formulate such a critique. But since the Western as a genre encodes precisely that ideology, the Western itself must be inverted, deconstructed, turned against itself in order to deploy it for such a critique. Hoberman concludes his essay by calling the Western "a genre that once epitomized America to itself and to the world." WhileKitses writes that "the Western's myth has provided a national myth and global icon, a cornerstone of American identity." What about the film?As Jens Martin Gurr (2006) said:" Greil Marcus has called it "the best movie of the end of the 20th century."It is clearly dead man is a film in the tradition that has variously been called the post-, anti-, revisionist, or deconstructive Western, a tradition that has long dissolved the mythology of the frontier. For the point of his attack is not the Western as a genre but the ideology encoded in the Western ? and that ideology is far from dead. Jarmusch's film is arguably more radical than any Western before in using the genre fundamentally to undermine its encoded American ideology as propounded all the way from John Winthrop to John Wayne. Jarmusch's portrayal of a dog eats- dog capitalist America "can be read without much difficulty as contemporary"?Dead Man is a radically subversive 'post-colonial Western'?.Several Native American film scholars have praised Dead Man for its 'authentic representation' of Native American culture especially the reconstruction of a Makah village has been certified as "authentic"(Ibid, 2006) Roger Bromerly (2001) wrote about this film: "Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man is a narrative which offers both a critique of the cult of the Western and removes that protection from doubt which has so long characterized the Western narrative." Some viewpoints about the film The film begins by a moving train. Train and railroad are symbol of industrialization and Americanization of the west. It is a show of violence and pollution of the technology. William Blake is going to the machine city; it is at the "end of the line". A man who is speaking with Blake says some realistic points. When Blake show the letter to him and said he is going to take a job in Dickinson's plant, he said I cannot read but have not trust on Dickinson, paper, and everybody. Again he said about buffalo slaughtering by the American government.Machine city as an American dog eat dog capitalism Machine city is engulfed by inhumanity, pollution, corruption, insecurity, and inequality.It is city of the death and skeletons. Gun governing is symbol of the American violence in conquering west and confronting with the Natives of the west. Western part of America in this film is the rich's arena. Rule of the machine town is Rule of the jungle; "survival of the fittest". Darkness of the city sends these messages. This city in this film also portrays a gap between the poor and riches as deep as Mariana trench! Characters of the machine city are a good symbol of the frontier men who image themselves in the state of "the survival of the fittest". They are saturated in violence as violence is their essence. In one scene Cole Wilson, who hired by Dickinson is a cannibal to survival. Women's bodies in this film are an object for me. When prostitute girl is in her home and Blake ask about gun she says "because this is America". Blake's fleeing to the west is a good opportunity for the director to give a new perspective of the west, especially an exceptional and fairly of the Natives. Dialogues between Nobody and Blake is a creativity by the director to note American and Britain colonizer's actions, and depicting natives suppressions by the colonizers. Consumer of the tobacco in the film is a hint to its importance in history of colonialization.Nobody is a mixnative, because of this matter he is not respected among his people. In this film he is a leading man who leads white man. He is Reminder of the racist Britain soldiers, who captured him in a cage and circleas savage In American cities and in the England. He went to school; again he reminds colonized people mimic sense. He goes to school or doing other things like them. When he comes back to west is labeled among his tribe as a liar. He decides to call himself Nobody, who talks a lot and say nothing. He elected to live in exile and under a new name. He is educated. Director of the film with some dialogues in native language and without any subtitle and a pure portray of Makaha village challenges the former western Film which has represents natives.

		<shortDescription>A movie about death and salvation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch Dead Man: A Review By: Hossein Safari Email: Hossein5744@yahoo.com Jim Jarmusch, significant and meaningful movie Dead Man, was released in 1995 and can be classified in Western genre with some differences. It is indeed and anti American movie that depicts the gray color and hostility of the technology stricken of West which is against native and the nature of the United Stated. So the director has tried to depict the identity of the U.S. through its effect on a man who gets there. A superficial and rudimentary interpretation for this movie, which holds difficulty of interpretations in its nature for many of those who watch it and are regarded as escape watchers, is the concept of motion. The plot of this movie is laid out on a movement which is shown by the means of travel. Concentrating on this issue, the notion of motion and movement is depicted in the movie in most of the scenes such as traveling by plane, by horse, by boat and finally by canoe on the sea. All these movements are intentionally westward. The movement from East to West in different context and historical issues can be meaningful and symbolic in its own if one look at it deeply and it challenges the mind of the interpreter to see what is in West and to think about the goal of the movement. Taking a look at history, after the discovery of America many people tried to move to west, America, for a better life, progress, experiencing new things, freedom and things which one could not do at East. Eastern as European, Asian and African move to west and this movement can be interpreted as a kind of rebirth, recreation, new identity and to its own sense salvation. As we see in the movie the main character, William Blake goes West, to the city of Machine in order to make a new life but he couldn't and his rebirth was in a different form. Death is a symbol which is prevalent in the course of the movie, and it is depicted masterfully. In the beginning of the movie in the train that we see the locomotive driver comes and speak to William Blake and says that Machine is the end of line. It can be interpreted that it is the end of life that Blake is engaged in it and a rebirth for him. The atmosphere of the city is hostile the city is full of coffins, bones, skulls, and killing people there is easily by gun. As we see in the movie, everyone has a gun even ladies due to the freedom and dangers existing in the U.S. in a way that it has been a norm in the society. This movie presents the juxtaposition of binary oppositions that can be interpreted in Jacques Derrida term. Throughout the movie we see observe binary oppositions as life and death, modern and tradition, William Blake as an ignorant and inexperienced man versus and Indian named Nobody who is knowledgeable, innocence versus experience, respect and savage, white European culture versus native American culture, west and east, village versus city, violence versus calmness, darkness versus light, industry versus tradition. According to Jacques Derrida, meaning in the West is defined in terms of binary oppositions, in this system, one of the two terms governs the other; for example in the white versus black binary opposition in the United States, the African American is defined as a devalued and are regarded as inferior while whites are the dominant and valuable. In the literary textual interpretation of a genre, finding hidden alternative meanings in the text can be done by finding the binary opposition and see which one is dominant and the meaning can be conveyed through them.We see that how a modern man who is innocent and inexperienced comes to the West in order to find a job but unintentionally and through the inherent power of west, he changes from and inexperienced and innocent man to an experienced and guilty one and takes the American identity regardless of his own position and identity. We see that he is a man who is afraid of pigs and those who target gun at him but we see that later he would kill those who are after him easily. This movie has allusion to the William Blake prophetic poet of early Romantic period in England who cited these songs as Song of Innocence and Song of Experience which thematically leads human being to salvation. William Blake of this story is the exact allusion the William Blake the poet and as we see The Indian Nobody mistakes him as the real poet he has been in Europe for a while and knows the poet well. The movement in this movie can be regarded as a movement from darkness to light, from innocence to experience similar to William Blake poet. Indeed his being shot by a bullet is his death and life after that is his new birth and new identity in industrial violent West which is no against tradition. The end of the movie shows that Blake through experience has reached to salvation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this and compare to Depp's film Lone Ranger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see the film Dead Man until after seeing Depp's film Lone Ranger. Wow, what a pair of films. Would make a great double bill.Dead Man is amazing. Really makes you think about near death experiences and what consciousness may be like in the dying process. Death may have occurred before the film even starts but the time of death doesn't matter. The point is not to get obsessed with exactly when he dies but to allow yourself to drift into an altered state of consciousness as Depp does. This is a major film achievement since actual death is something we can only imagine. I suspect film is one of the few ways we can get close to the experience while we are still alive. Jarmusch has done it with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You were a poet and a painter, William Blake. But now, you're a killer of white men.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the time when Johnny Depp made high-budget movies with mass appeal and decided to follow every step of Tim Burton's descent into mediocrity, his talent really showed. 1995 independent film-maker Jim Jarmusch put him into what could best be described as an existential Western with lots of typical ingredients of the genre, yet the film refreshingly defies conventions and brings us closer to Native Americans than most traditional entries put together. Accountant William Blake (Depp) is sought for murder with a bullet stuck in his chest and finds himself on the side of the Indian "Nobody" (Gary Farmer), an outsider himself. The latter claims to recognize him, and it is the Indian's belief that determines the path they take together, uniting them in their spiritual journey...The differences to traditional Westerns don't end with the unique plot. The action is limited, the movie is slow, philosophical issues abound, there's poetry - filmed and literal - and symbols to interpret by the viewer are aplenty. As so often Jarmusch prefers black and white cinematography, a perfect choice for the matter at hand, and Neil Young's rather modern sounding guitar riffs provide eerie dramatic contrast to standard Westerns, even to Ennio Morricone's music in Leone flics. Dismissed by famous critic Roger Ebert pretty much as drivel where he has no clue what Jarmusch wants, "Dead Man" has nevertheless found loads of moviegoers who can connect with it on a personal level and thus elevated the film to a cult classic. No surprise there, really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I hate westerns," said the daughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this two nights ago, then watched it again last night with The Young Daughter, whom I had to bribe to sit down with me because she "hates westerns" and has the attention span of a teenage girl/guppy. As the film progressed, she became more and more focused and more and more astonished. Part way through, she said, "I don't know if I like it?" and then she went on to explain in great detail exactly how much she DID like it. Her only negative - if indeed that is what it was - comment was that it scored 11/10 on the BatSh**CrazyOmeter. "I want to be Nobody. He's awesome!" she announced, adding him to the list of fictional characters she finds inspirational. The others are, I think, Sherlock Holmes and Death, along with Neil Gaiman who is less fictional than the others.Me? I found myself thinking of everything by Kurosawa, and The Seventh Seal, and, for a moment or two, Blazing Saddles. It led to discussions about Carlos Castaneda and Danté's Divine Comedy. The Tibetan book of the Dead was also right in there as it surely had to be. What it maybe lacked in conventional narrative it more than made up for in provocation,inspiration and philosophical stimulation and it was a truly wonderful daddy/daughter meeting place. I'd recommend it for that alone.Like being exposed to some pieces of classical music which aren't quite as immediate as pop culture offerings, she realized that she really enjoyed it only after seeing it through, and wants to see it again.At the moment, I think it's probably the finest film I've ever seen, but that is context dependent, of course. It's hard to compare apples with oranges, or cheese with girders. However considered, it is a wonderful - awesome - film which I enjoyed immensely - more so on the second watching. There's not a spare shot anywhere in the film. Definitely on the re-re-watch list. One minor caveat: if you turn the sound up enough to catch the quietest dialogue, the guitar cutting in will take your fillings out.Don't attempt to operate heavy machinery immediately after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best things about this film--not to downplay the rest of it-- was the music of Neil Young. My son started watching this film as I slept on the couch. As I slept through the entire film, I would hear bits and pieces of the dialog and soundtrack. While asleep, I dreamed-- continually, it seemed--that I was at a Neil Young concert. Trading off throughout the film, his spontaneous, raspy, distorted electric style, and his signature, mellow, pick-less acoustic. It's pure, classic-Neil Young and fits this film like a glove. Since then, I've seen this movie roughly seven or eight times. Much is open to interpretation. I have to wonder if Blake was already dead (or destined to die) when he got on the train, on which the ride takes for- ev-er.The Train Fireman (Crispin Glover) seemed to have much insight regarding Blake's ultimate demise, i.e. as he talked to Blake, he seemed certain Blake's fiancé had found somebody else; he asks what brought Blake all the way out "to hell"; asserts that Blake is just as likely to find his own grave; when Blake tells him he's going to the town of Machine, Glover exclaims that Machine was the "end of the line!"...as if to say that Blake wasn't about to be merely tested, he was about to be tested in the ultimate sense, Glover also talks about being in a boat, on the water, and how it seems everything around you moves while the boat stays still--as if foretelling the ending of Blake's Earthly life, perhaps as he, himself, has experienced it...possibly more than once. Another thing that seems to point to Blake already being dead is that nearly everyone in the town of Machine stares conspicuously at Blake, as if to say, "Here's a guy who clearly doesn't yet know". However, this may have been merely because of the "clown" suit he was wearing.This is definitely a film to be seen more than once.I just want to know what's behind the question at the end of the closing credits, "whahappan?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth The Wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard/read about this movie and it certainly seemed intriguing. However, with the limited theater release, I was never able to see it nor find it to rent. At long last Netflix finally added this movie to its offering on instant queue. WOW--worth the wait. It grabs you from the first scene and you are made well aware that this is not going to be any ordinary experience.I think my favorite scene is where nobody and blake are riding through the birch forest--its uncanny how all the trees appear to have eyes etched into their bark. At first you think it just an accident, but as the scene progresses you realize that there an intention to it given by the sheer number. If you still have any question as to whether blake is alive or dead at this point in the story, its crystal clear by this scene. Very eery and powerful imagery. Like the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes it is preferable not to travel with a dead man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dead Man' is a vivid, haunting Western which will either infuriate and bore or amaze and dazzle. Its pace is very measured, opening with a lengthy sequence set on a train which shows mild-mannered Cleveland accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) taking a VERY long train journey. He slips in and out of sleep and encounters a cryptically philosophical and very sooty Train Fireman (Crispin Glover) before finally arriving at the frontier town of Machine.Alighting from the train, Blake heads towards his new job as accountant at a foundry. As he is walking apprehensively through town, he sees a man in an alley being fellated by a woman. The man points his gun at Blake, who quickly lowers his gaze and walks on hurriedly. This single shot of simulated oral sex was hugely controversial and almost resulted in the film being banned. Fortunately it was not.Arriving at the town, Blake finds that his position has already been filled. He demands to see the boss, John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum), a fearsome man who embodies the shoot-first-ask-questions-later savagery of the Old West. Dickinson trains a shotgun on the hapless Blake and tells him to get the hell out of his sight. Wisely, Blake hightails it out of there, with the cruel laughter of John Scholfield (John Hurt) - one of the foundry's employees - ringing in his ears.Crestfallen and almost broke, Blake stumbles into the town's salon to drown his sorrows. He meets Thel Russell (Mili Avital) who is eking out a living selling paper flowers. She takes Blake to her bed, where they are discovered by Charlie Dickinson (Gabriel Byrne), Thel's former lover. Charlie takes great exception to Blake's presence and tries to shoot him, but hits Thel instead, who is killed. Charlie shoots again, inflicting a mortal wound upon Blake which will eventually kill him. Blake shoots Charlie dead and goes on the run into the wilderness.For Blake, the hand of fate just keeps dealing him bad cards. Charlie is the son of the shotgun-toting, cigar-chomping John Dickinson, and John - furious at the loss of his beloved son - hires three killers to find and dispatch Blake. These guns for hire are the taciturn Cole Wilson (Lance Henriksen), the loquacious Conway Twill (Michael Wincott), and Johnny 'the Kid' Pickett (Eugene Byrd), and they set out on Blake's trail with murder on their minds.Blake meets a husky Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer) and the two become travelling companions. Blake embarks upon a deeply spiritual and mystical journey with Nobody as his spirit guide. Nobody oversees Blake's transition from the physical world of life, to the spirit world of death.This is a wonderful film with a cast to die for. In addition to all the names already mentioned, there are also appearances by Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thornton, and Alfred Molina. 'Dead Man' is a really unusual Western which benefits greatly from its being shot in black-and-white. Johnny Depp never disappoints... highly recommended.</fullReview>

The simple BGM that sounds throughout is haunting and pleasing at the same time.One of my all time favorites.A reviewer here calls it a beautiful little film. I cannot agree more. Jim Jarmusch is a very intelligent director.Of course the NYT and other critics find it a bore, they do so because they getting paid for it. I don't know why criticism is a profession rather than a disgrace to man.No one has the right to pass judgment except God. Coming back, the acting by Depp n Gary Farmer is very good too.Farmer particularly impressed me with the little smile playing on his face at all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A novel Pilgrim's Progress?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man is independent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's sixth feature film, released in 1995 by Miramax Films. It is a film about death and its meaning for humans; or, maybe, rather a description of the human condition, and reflections on the real meaning of life and death. Somehow Dead Man could be seen as a novel Pilgrim's Progress, trying to strip life of its added meanings, in the light of the concept of death. Some of the dialogues, especially the parts spoken by Nobody, are clear references to works by William Blake, the main character's namesake. Jonathan Rosenbaum defined this film an Acid Western. The combination of black and white film and the rough, haunting score, improvised by Neil Young, render the work sharper and more in tone with the subject matter. The vast and still landscapes are shot superbly, and they render justice to the tradition of earlier Western cinema. Particularly vivid and realistic are the western village and the Native American settlement seen at the end.Regarding the plot, did William Blake actually die when he was first shot? And if so, was the rest of the film just the tale of an imaginary voyage, forged upon the literary tradition including Divina Commedia and Pilgrim's Progress? The character of Nobody, colourfully interpreted by the excellent Gary Farmer, fuels this suspects when, shortly after meeting him, he asks Blake: "Did you kill the white man who killed you?" During the initial train trip 'to hell', the coal-stoker tells Blake about a ship; this will be understood only at the end of the movie. Dickinson Steel works is indeed an infernal place, reminiscent of Lang's Metropolis factory, in a town called Machine (Pink Floyd, anyone?), at the end of the line. What does it stand for? The imposed mental hell man struggles to come to terms with?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watched this when it was first released on video. was on tv a few months ago; i watched it again last night. remembered it as very good - and it is.there is an important point to be made -yes, this is existential, misery, godlessness, existence preceding essence. but it is also absurd. THAT's the reason the characters engage in such slow gunfights; that's the reason the resolution of the chase is only seen from far away. it's ridiculous. why, depp even wears a hat like one of beckett's tramps in 'En attendant godot.' this is common to many jarmusch films; a sort of chaplinesque silent comedy vibe, spelled out here by the black and white.shooting another human being is a fairly stupid thing to do, particularly in a meaningless universe. the word is arbitary.that's why the movie doesn't handle like a pacy thriller. it's the gap - between the surface, classic western setup - and what's actually there; this voyage of covery. that's what jarmusch is playing with. great movie. even with all that irony and genre cross-pollination, it's entertaining, and good.here's a question though - when in the film does depp actually die?</fullReview>

Watch for Gabriel Byrne as Dickenson's son who gets shot when Depp's William Blake beds his girlfriend. Get it on laserdisc if you can. I really hated Neil Young before I saw this flick - went out and bought the soundtrack afterwards."God-damn it you shot me... Sonuvabitch..burns like hellfire!"

		<shortDescription>A slow pensive movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had such a good time watching this movie that I vowed not to waste my time with Hollywood's mindless schlock anymore... I would only watch transcendent, artful, real, vibrant movies, or at least movies which had the potential to be these things (gotta take risks.) What I hate about many of the movies created for mass, commercial consumption (and I could extend this notion more widely to include art, or at least certainly music) is that they are so flush with artificial flavors and sweeteners. We go to see movies in part because they are magical, they are experiences which transcend daily life. But if the creations are so far removed from reality that we cannot recognize real humans and real experience in them, they are unsatisfying in their fakeness._Dead Man_ is a magical movie. But it draws you in. There aren't unnatural super-human heroes: Depp's character is about as lost as they come and the Indian named Nobody, while self-important, is also full of hot air. The best moments in this movie are human moments, human tensions, but not overplayed ones. Blake is hurt and dazed and the Indian with a flourishing speech leads them on another part of their improbable, unwise journey. Blake is hesitant, but too weak to protest effectively. But his nervousness is palpable. Director Jarmusch says he gets some of his best kicks in the quiet moments that come between dialog, and that is very true here.It's funny that the visual aspect of the film is at once shoddy and beautiful. My best example is that the stars are obviously fake... they look like Xmas lights... but they are still wonderful.Neil Young's guitar is put to good use in this film. It is unlike anything I've heard from him before. It is repetetive, but never boring.Despite my earlier assertion that _Dead Man_ is somehow more "real" than the Hollywood biggies, watching this film does entail you to suspend disbelief. You have to be the mood to let yourself be taken in... if you do, you will find yourself travelling through a fantastic and menacing early American landscape.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life, from Birth to Death - as a journey westwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Some are born to sweet delight, some are born to endless night" - these lines of the poet William Blake lead us to the core of this film. Birth, Life, Death - well, especially Death - these constantly reappearing topics are presented by Jim Jarmusch in an innovative mixture. What at first seems to be the renovation of the western genre is really a sort of road-movie: a two-hours-journey into Death, across the border zone of Death. Of course, this has to be a journey westwards, to the place where the light of the sun dissolves at the end of the day. But, and there again we are confronted with William Blake's motto, not for everyone Life presents itself as a journey into Death, many people succeed in suppressing completely the idea of their own mortality. For these Birth represents a departure into the land of "sweet delight". For all the others, however, Life is a permanent confrontation with Death, and each of them experiences it differently. William Blake, the homonymous hero of the film, Death is a nightmarish journey into the West, he is torn away from the supposed security of Eastern Cleveland (his childhood), lured by a apparently safe job as an accountant of an iron factory in a far off dump called Machine, at the westerly terminus of the railway line. Even when he is still on the way, it becomes obvious that Blake doesn't fit into this society of drovers and gunslingers, from whom he differs not only externally by his foppish check suit, but also by the absence of spiritual exchange: William Blake is left alone on his seat in the train, unable to communicate with this strange vicinity. Only in Machine, where he evidently doesn't get the desired post in the factory (which is presented as just another ingredient of the continual nightmare) and is chucked out ferociously, he gets into contact with a fellow creature apparently like-minded: a barmaid, who has just been kicked out of a saloon in a similar manner and suddenly finds herself in the gutter. But the machinery of Death is already working, and the girl's lover appears: an exchange of gun shots can't be avoided. This is the purely accidental beginning of Blake's career as a killer. From this time on he has to live with a bullet beside his heart, and he is found and instructed by Nobody, a paternal Indian with mixed blood. And it is him that tells him about William Blake the poet, a man our hero has never heard of. Maybe it is because of that coincidence of names that Nobody, decides never to leave Blake's side in order to instruct him in marksmanship and metaphysics. Thus Blake turns out to be a killing poet marked by physical decay, who writes his poetry with bullets and blood. Death remains an omnipresent companion, which becomes particularly clear in a scene when Blake discovers a dead fawn of the roedeer in the middle of a crisp and frosty forest and beds down for sleep in foetus style. Birth, Childhood, Life and Death - they are all in agreement and unity. And so it doesn't take long until Nobody has to point out to his disciple that soon it will be all finished, and that Blake will have to return to where he came from. "You mean Cleveland?" - "To where all spirits came from." There is nothing left to do but settle him safely in a canoe. A canoe which is filled with flowers, and which goes westwards, across the great lake, to the place where Night instantly falls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It is preferable not to travel with a dead man." Henri Michaux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It is preferable not to travel with a dead man." Henri Michaux As the opening quote of the movie says Dead Man is about a journey. The movie starts in a train while William Blake (Johnny Depp), after his parents funeral in Cleveland, is traveling to "Machine" town to work as an accountant. After arriving to Machine he finds out that the job is taken by somebody else, and Mr. Dickinson(Robert Mitchum) , the company owner, sends him out of his office. That night Blake meets a flower girl and in an encounter with her ex-lover (later we find out he was the company owner's son) Blake kills the man and runs away with a bullet in his own chest. The next day he has been found by an Indian called "Nobody"(Gary Farmer) and he tells him that he has a bullet near his heart. "Nobody" misunderstands him with the dead poet William Blake, and he feels he has the duty of sending back this spirit to its original place. William Blake (the poet) has a strong influence on the movie, and that is not just a similarity in name. Always the journey to west was considered as a journey toward improvement and development a journey toward new chances and opportunities. But in the start of this movie we realize that this journey to west doesn't have a revenue of improvement and opportunity, at least where machines and industries are concerned. Machine town is a dirty place full of human greed. In this city which is in complete contrast with Blake's poems romantic atmosphere, so he can't find a place for himself in there. Nobody's presence in this movie shows us the contrast between an Indian and an European perception of life. For "Nobody", Blake is dead he even see him as skeleton and wants Blake to meet death, but for Blake it is his life and he is living it. Tobacco has a great role in this movie, for Blake it's smoking -a bad habit- and for "Nobody" it is something necessary for rituals. Despite this contrast we can hear Blake's(of course the poet) works in Nobody's dialogues in the movie. We can see this movie isn't a traditional western, we should look into it from a symbolic point of view, and we should search deep inside of the characters while we hope we can find something psychological or meaningful about their perceptions and thoughts. But the question is how deep we should go? Even deeper than the producers? Beside screenplay the movie hasn't good acts. Most of play look factitious. For example the scene which the girl's ex-lover is shot, although it takes Blake three shots to kill him he doesn't have a normal reaction to the first two shots. Movies besides any goals and duties you can define for them, have an innate duty of entertaining viewers too. They are produced for entertainment. If the entertainment part isn't important for them, they can simply watch a boring documentary about William Blake too. So all the twists, violence, and other things in a movie should also serve the goal of entertaining and attracting the viewer to the movie. Dead Man isn't a successful movie from this point of view. Of course there are people opposed to this view intentionally, or unintentionally just by saying a movie is artistic and good in order to show that they are intellectual. As Mehran Modiri told in one his interviews, a movie which people don't understand is considered artistic nowadays. If you have something to say the art is to say it so simple that everyone can understand. So if you want entertainment and you want to watch a good movie, dead man isn't a good choice for you. But if you want to watch it in order to show that you are an intellectual understanding art or simply you are interested in cinema history that is one of the movies you should watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art, for sure, yet incomplete, depending on its sustained aura</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man (1995)It's not a great thing to say a film requires patience, and as beautiful and "cool" as this one is, it requires patience, or a sense of just waiting and watching, like sitting on a train. But wow, what a beautiful beautiful film, visually and sonically, through the eye of the camera and moving through the stark landscape. Above all the film is a metaphor for all of us floating through the wreckage of life, looking for meaning, getting guidance and getting lost, and staring with wonder at all, that life exists in the first place, and that it can be so, well, awesome. It is awesome, even in the little things. "Dead Man" is filled with large effects, for sure, but also notes those little things, and the final effect is staggering.Johnny Depp as the Easterner named William Blake keeps a steady, brilliantly confused presence with little glances and face twitches, his famous active engagement without being overly hammy. And he's good looking and clean (at first), which is in contrast to the gory, campy, hilarious, mock-profound rest of it. In fact, he's a kind of straight man to the huge ludicrous drama of the rest of it. The cast, in the overview, is an attractive assortment of deliberately unsavory types, all really fun in their own ways (and including some great actors and other famous folk having wonderful time of it, from Robert Mitchum briefly to Billy Bob Thornton a little less briefly). There's an overweight intellectual Indian who is a spiritual and literal guide for the William Blake. And there are three grimy killers forming a lawless posse, and a self-destructive bunch.It's all great fun and great, austere, slightly or very surreal drama, pure Jim Jarmusch. I loved it even as I was a bit itchy for something to happen. Even the vaunted soundtrack, a spare electric distorted guitar by Neil Young, is a one trick pony, and yet, it's totally gorgeous.But more than anything is the beautiful slow pace of the film, all shot in black and white, as it glides through the Western landscape. In truth, this is a modern Western, playing (and playing hard) with archetypes, though very much seen with fresh eyes. It succeeds by playing off a whole bunch of worn and revised tropes, like the simple one of a group of talented trackers following some equally talented but scared prey (as in "Butch Cassidy" and "The Wild Bunch"). It throws things in reverse at times, like having the Indian sage educated in European style schools (where he learns about William Blake the poet). And it plays with clichés such as that simple fact that Native Americans have a unique bond with nature and feeling for the everafter. I remember loving more the fresh and equally patient "Stranger than Paradise," Jarmusch's breakthrough film, and I the echoes of it here (in the way it is filmed) show a director's longer term vision. But Jarmusch is no longer a young independent filmmaker at work, but a director with a legend to uphold, and with a seeming grandiose vision to achieve, complete with big (sort of) budget and big (yes) actors. If you like it after half an hour, you'll love it all, and want to see it many times. It'll get under your skin. But if you find it tedious and pretentious, even if it is funny and not at all pretentious at the same time, you might want to lower the bar for the film and love it as an almost-classic, which is something most films never even come close to.There's nothing like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The brilliantly haunting score by Neil Young really sets the mood for Jim Jarmusch's re-envisioning of the western as a metaphor of death. William Blake(Depp)is a dead man, this is his experience of dying. It is presented to us as a nice personal adventure to find the depth of our souls. If you have ever read "Dante's Inferno" you will find the similarities. The cinematography is gorgeous to look at. It is poetic. Johnny Depp is at his subtle best here, Almost looking unreal. The rest of the cast is great especially Gary Farmer as Nobody, the man guiding William into the afterlife. Crispin Glover's small cameo was creepy but it really set the tone for all of the film. By the way Tobacco represents the ultimate attachment of the soul to the physical realm. Do you have some tobacco?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Jim Jarmusch, despite the fact I really enjoyed in his movie Coffee and Cigarettes, but with Dead Man he's becoming one of my favorite film makers. Dead Man is slow, dark, sometimes disturbing drama about a shy accountant, who gets involved with double murder of a young women and her lover and hunted by three psychopathic bounty hunters. An accountant take shelter in the hills, where he meets a strange Indian named "Nobody". And after that we're witnesses of weird journey on the other side of life or death. The movie is weird, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have some quality. Dead Man is a poetic masterpiece, one of the rare movies, which are excellent mixed with art and poetry. Looking this movie is like reading a sad poem for two hours. Johnny Depp is excellent in his role of a "dead man" and his scenes are very poetic, especially those who shows his soul in contact with nature, but this movie is also great because of very large cast of actors and musicians (Iggy Pop, Alfred Molina, Robert Mitchum, Billy Bob Thorton, Gabriel Bryne etc.). There is also a lot of violence and shooting in this movie, but beware... this is not a western movie , it's a very deep hypnotic drama about meaning of life and death. The journey of Depps character is long and painful to watch, but in the end you'll remember this movie forever. Soundtrack is also very great, guitar solo from Neil Young is something you can't forget. The only thing I was bothered in this movie, was the end of the movie, which was really a bit too long, but that doesn't mean that this movie is a masterpiece. Dead Man is excellent movie, but not advisable for every watcher. Simply beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dead Man Review by Maryam MirhoseiniCast: Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer, Lance Henriksen, Micheal Wincott, Eugene Byrd Director: Jim Jarmusch Writer: Jim Jarmusch Language: English Genre: Drama, Western Release Year:1996 Awards: 2 wins &amp; 5 nominations Color: white and black William Blake(not the famous poet) travels to town of machine in the West from Cleveland to get a promised job as an accountant. When he arrives to the town, he finds that one month ago another person has filled the job. Blake that spent all money after death of his parents to get there, get angry and wants to meet the mill owner (Robert Mitchum)who in his office and talks with a stuffed bear and keeps a portrait of himself in his room. He threat Blake with a gun and advises him to leave the town. That night Blake meets a girl who sells paper flowers and befriends her and is invited to her room. Blake kills her ex-lover who is Charlie Dickinson (Gabriel Byrne) in a self defense; he is Dickinson's son, the mill owner. Then Blake is pursued by Dickinson's men and became a wanted man. Next morning he sees himself beside an Indian, Nobody, (Gary Farmer). Nobody guides Blake to a spiritual journey to where he belongs to. Jarmusch's film, Dead Man, is a film in western genre. But we can say that it is an iconoclasm in this genre. The "Dead Man "does not apply to western stereotypes. West in Dead Man isn't romantic. Probably Jarmusch tries to say that outcomes of industrialization have destroyed nature and moralities in the west.In the film we can also see some points about Indians and white immigrant's treatment with them. One example is the narratives of Nobody about his life- white men move him from his home to several countries- and then in his dialogs with Blake, Nobody says in the station where whites have trade with Indians, they sell blanket which have smallpox that will sicken all Indian villagers. The machine town which black arrives in is a corrupt, mucky and unsightly. It is the first view of the west from Blake's eyes. Some sequences in the film which show direct violence are vexing and disgusting. For example the sequence where Cole Wilson after killing his co-worker eats his hand, or the scene where hired killer Cole Wilson crushes a corpse's head under his boot.On the technical side, Robby Muller has shot the film in black and white. The music of film isn't a usual Western music, but it's certainly effective. Like the film itself, it's liable to be an acquired taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead man is a story of young man who has lost his parents and has left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead man is a production of Miramax Company in 1995 in the United States which won 2 awards. It is released on May 1996 as black white 121-min film .Director and screenwriter of this movie is Jim Jarmusch who won 22 awards for his movies. MPAA rating is R because of depiction of murder and rape scenes. Its genre is Drama/Western. Main cast are: popular andwell-known Hollywood actor, Johnny Depp as William Blake, Gary Farmer as Nobody, and Robert Mitchum as John Dickenson, Lance Henrikson as Cole Wilson and Mili Avital as Thel. Music is done by Neil Young who isone of the best rock/folk guitarists. This story had taken place in the 2ndhalf of the 19th century, in the western frontiers of America.Dead man is a story of young man who has lost his parents and has left Cleveland (his hometown) to get a job as an accountant in town of machine,in Dickenson Company. But he arrives late, and another person has been replaced. Very lonely and hapless, Blake goes to a bar and get familiar with a young woman (Thel) who is apparently a prostitute. He spends the night inher room which is full of paper flowers. Suddenly his former fiancé, who isson of Dickenson, arrives and try to kill Blake but kills Thel and withanother bullet makes a whole in Blake's chest. Now Blake is badlywounded, killed the guy and is running away. Lost in Western territories, he encounters a very strange Native American, named "Nobody". From now on, his physical and spiritual journey starts. Nobody supposes that William Blake is a dead English poet. Against Blake's nature conditions through thisjourney transfers him to a murderer. As "Nobody" is interested in WilliamBlake the English poet, and thinks that is a spirit of Blake, he tries to returnhim to the land of spirit, where Blake can live in everlasting peace. At the end when Blake is going through the river, lying in a canoe and passing his last moments of his life, sees the last scene. Nobody is killed by one of the Dickenson's hunter men. This movie refers to the 19thcentury, which America put westward movements in to practice by killing and exiling Indians from their lands. People who migrated to the west have very abnormal and nasty life with very bad economical condition. In contrast with easterners which Blake is arepresentative of, westerners are so impolite so savage and cruel. That iswhy Blake can not adapt himself with such a society. He is such an urban man who even speaks differently, who wears suit with neat and stylish hair,wearing glasses and interestingly never smoke. Actually he arrives in town of hell rather than town of machine. Next important character is" Nobody"who is an indication that Indians were ignored by whites. He is a type of kind man, with his own believes, who wants to help William Blake take back peace which "Nobody" himself could not gain it in his life the black white scenes represent soulless atmosphere of the era. No communication,no affection and no devotion exist between western inhabitants. . Generally you can feel desolation, uncertainty, lack of spirituality, cruelty andinstability through whole of the film, which I personally think is an exact picture of the society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surely The Most Unconventional Western You'll Ever See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is often argued that the last "traditional western" was Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven in 1992; the final farewell to the genre, as such. Nonetheless, some notable westerns have been released since, an one of those is Dead Man, a spiritual western which ranks among my favourite films. When released in 1995, the film gained a vastly mixed critical verdict and although the film's reputation is constantly improving, many opposing opinions of greatness still exist. Often cited critic Roger Ebert infamously said "Jim Jarmusch is trying to get at something here, and I don't have a clue what it is." Dare I say that Ebert could simply have been oblivious to the film's metaphorical ideas, offering viewing interpretation? Personally, I believe so.Built on existential motifs and experimental film-making procedures, this is a western which relies on its heavy use of symbolism. Covering what is ultimately a man's longing to escape death and the inability to accept one's fate, Dead Man opens with a train ride, which I consider a metaphor for the protagonist's journey towards pre-spiritual enlightenment. Set against a jarring instrumental score performed by Neil Young, the twanging guitar chords burrow beneath the viewer's senses and subconsciously etch a permanently recognisable sound into the viewer's mind. As the title so subtly suggests, the central character (William Blake, played by Johnny Depp) is established as a "dead man" from the opening sequence. The opening sequence is comprised of a tiresome and seemingly endless train journey, whereby nobody speaks and Blake drifts wearily between observance and slumber. During this extended opening, the train's fireman speaks to Blake, describing his destination (the town of Machine) as "hell" and a town where you are "just as likely to find your own grave." On arriving in Machine ?a factory-ridden town of garish mechanisms- Blake realises that the job of which he was given a letter for does not require his services at that present time, since he is supposedly late on arrival. The scenes shot within the town represent a community which is experiencing a steep progression of technological advance; essentially depicting the pollution and greed caused by modern labour in the Western world. Exhausted and disappointed, Blake meets a young woman selling flowers, who is a contrast of beauty in a land fuelled by ugliness and bitter consumerism, but she too seems rather bitter and lifeless. It should be noted that the flowers she sells are made of paper, meaning that although they will never rot, they are fake and inert. Plus, the paper is from the trees, which have been killed for financial and consumerist obligations.Upon meeting this young girl, Blake becomes entranced and sleeps with the woman. Unfortunately, her ex-lover returns the next morning to find them both in bed together; the situation escalates into a clumsy gunfight, whereby Blake gets mortally wounded. Realising that he has to flee the town, he meets a Native American (named Nobody, played by Gary Farmer) who thankfully saves his life. From this moment onwards, Blake becomes a wanted man, embarking on a surrealist mission of self-discovery with his newfound friend. This is used as a means of preparing for death and helps him to acknowledge his foreseeable conclusion upon witnessing the fragility of life.Filmed in black and white, Dead Man is a film which defines visceral and audacious beauty. The black and white photography tones the film in a way which is bleakly mesmerising and places a potent prominence on the protagonist's restless and consistently lingering emotions. I cannot begin to stress how important it is that a viewer recognises that it is up to them to dissect and interpret what is laid bare before them. Pondering many of life's questions through weighty symbolism and a subtle combination of wit and wisdom, Dead Man does what many films cannot and succeeds admirably. This is meditative viewing, the kind of which will become a reoccurring memory during those restless and weary nights. Allow Dead Man the courtesy to question and enlighten you to the splendour of sorrow and the transformation of life to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Just Great!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw for the first time last night "Dead Man" which had been advertised as this weird Western that Johnny Depp was in. At the time of its release, it commanded a bit of a stir but quickly went gently into that good night. Unfortunately, I had not had a chance to see it before it came to cable. Upon my first viewing, I immediately fell in love with it.The story, set in the 19th century, centers around an accountant (Depp, wearing this exceedingly horrible suit!) who receives an offer of employment in this real beat-up town only to arrive a month too late to discover they had given his job to someone else. He demands to see the boss, a positively wooooooooonderful, Robert Mitchum, who also quickly frightens him into leaving well enough alone.He then encounters a myriad of off-beat characters in his quest to survive. Johnny's performance is enhanced by the quirky characters that abound in this story and it is fun trying to figure out who is who. Your typical Western, this certainly is not, but the performances all around make this quite a memorable viewing experience. Additionally, the sound track by Neil Young complements the film perfectly.The film is multi-layered and I can assure you that on each viewing, you will undoubtedly discover some nuance you had missed before.Suffice it to say, it is a story that perfectly captures the "survival of the fittest" theme. There is nothing disappointing about it at all, though I must caution you, you may find yourself at the beginning asking "What on earth is this about?!!" Be patient and you will discover a gem of a movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

She would have commented on it, then she would have gone into the kitchen to wash dishes or clothes, then she would have gone to the computer and played something that would beep occasionally. And that's funny, since she is supposed to be the spiritual one, but was incapable of getting the film.The basis of the movie is a spiritual journey towards death. It is beautifully shot and the most interesting thing I found is that most of the things that are said in the movie become premonitions of the future. The weird characters and great cast do transpose the viewer in this alternate reality that felt really nice to me.At the end of this movie I felt like after watching Down By Law, also a black and white journey film. At the time I didn't know Jarmusch did both. If I think about it, these two movies and Sin City are the only films purposely shot in black and white that didn't annoy me because of it.Anyway, it is hard to bottom line this film. It is a good movie, one that must be watched with quiet friends or alone. I don't think women would get it, but I am uncertain. It's like a film-drug. Just start the movie, watch it, at the end you'll feel like you've just taken peyote :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being mortally wounded around half an hour in, accountant William Blake is in many ways already a 'dead man' at the beginning of the film - during a bizarre train ride (to HELL ! as Crispin Glover's intense Train Fireman explains it) that gets wilder the further it goes west, William Blake reveals that his parents are both dead and that he'd once had a fiancé, but she'd 'changed her mind'. Upon arriving in the rathole town of Machine (where people engaging in oral sex on the streets barely raises an eyebrow)it's further revealed that Blake is penniless after spending the last of his inheritance travelling to this wretched place in hope of taking up a new position as the Dickinson Metals accountant ... the job however, has already been filled. Alone and bereft, a stranger in a strange place, Blake befriends an ex-prostitute who promptly seduces him. The romantic interlude is interrupted when an ex lover of the woman's enters the room and interupts the coitus ... gunplay eventually ensues, the woman and her old flame are killed and Blake is shot in the heart ... he flees on a stolen horse and heads into the forest. William Blake awakes in the forest and discovers an Indian man (actor Gary Farmer) attending to his bullet wound - but the bullet cannot be removed ... Once the Indian man (who goes by the name 'Nobody' in preference to the derisive name those in his village had given him) finds out that the wounded white man he has found goes by the name of 'William Blake', fate intervenes on both mens lives. Nobody believes Blake to be the reincarnation of the famous poet/painter of the same name, whom Nobody feels a special affinity with for reasons which are later revealed ..It becomes apparent that in many ways Nobody is also a 'dead man' - he later tells William Blake that his mixed-blood is not looked upon with 'respect' by his people. Nobody goes on to tell Blake of his capture by white men as a child, men who had caged him and exhibited him around America - Nobody's enslavement had eventually taken him all the way across the ocean to Europe, where he was eventually forced to attend the white man's schools.Upon escaping his captors and making the great journey home to his people, he found himself labelled a liar and a big mouth by his fellow villagers ('he who talks loud, say nothing !') - and he finishes his story by telling William Blake that he is 'alone to wander the Earth' Nobody also explains that during captivity in Europe he had discovered the poetry of William Blake, and that the words had 'spoken to him', inspiring him to escape his imprisonment. Nobody believes that William Blake *the accountant from Cleveland* must now embrace his destiny as a 'killer of white men', and Nobody's people with violence in the same way that the words of William Blake the poet had given Nobody courage and strength ...As William Blake begins to play out the role fate has given him, he seems to become more alive and vital, despite his deteriorating physical state ... Director Jim Jarmusch has given us a poetic, visually stunning film with much subtlety and spirituality - the Western genre is subverted as the 'hero' is drawn into the world of the native American Indian's and in the process becomes a post-civil-war hero for the oppressed Indians : with his Indian guide Nobody helping him realise his destiny, William Blake's sacrifice ultimately serves as a Legend that gives the Indian villagers some hope that they may be able resist/co-exist with the white settlers.superb performances all round (Alfred Molina's cameo is great, Billy Bob Thornton's hilarious ..), an amazing soundtrack almost on par with Ry Cooder's 'Paris, Texas' masterpiece, and above all a thought-provoking and beautifully presented story from masterful director Jarmusch ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Mitchum's Last Movie... Johnny Depp's best???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This haunting, heart pounding, black and white masterpiece has about everything -- Neil Young doing the sound track, Jim Jarmusch directing, Johny Depp and an excellent caste that includes my favorite actor, Robert Mitchum, and a story that is meaningful. I obviously love this film. I put the DVD on sometimes just to hear the soundtrack in the background as I write. The extra's on the DVD of Neil Young sitting in front of the film playing on a screen and writing music for the scene is historic. The way music is used in the film makes it another character, in much the same way that Quinten Tarantino used music in a few of his early films.The use of music always leads to a lot of shots that are free of dialog. We see the lost Johnny Depp become an accidentally legend; his character is named William Blake -- leading a native American pal of his, who was kidnapped by the British and educated a bit and fell in love with the poetry of Blake, to believe that he is the reincarnated poet. The native American says at one point, to paraphrase, "In this life, your poetry is the gun."There is a lot of violence in this film. Like the west really was. This film belongs in the genre of western that deconstructs the old myths of swaggering John Wayne... Take Mitchum's character for instance. He is the big man in town -- the employer who Depp came out into the wilderness to work for, only to discover he has spent his last dime coming to hell only to find the job has already been taken... and he is a madman of sorts. Power mad. Comes out with a shotgun aimed at the snarly bunch of Bounty Hunters that he hires to hunt down Depp, who starts his accidentally killing spree with Mitchum's son. He is a character that would never have existed in the older Mitchum westerns, where the good guys chased the bad guys, instead of this visa-versa world... which is what the wild west was like. In fact, none of these characters would exist in the old westerns. The trappers, Billy Bob Thornton among them, want to rape Depp, one bounty hunter ends up eating the other ones, and there really are no good guys or bad guys... So go watch this movie.</fullReview>

It was the first film by indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch that I had seen (it was something about the cover of the film- Johnny Depp in Indian war-paint in black &amp; white holding a gun- that intrigued me), and the first two times I did and didn't understand what it was 'about'. I read from other comments that it was meant to be taken as a 'spiritual journey', an existentialist trip through 19th century western country. I watched it again recently, and I understood it a little more clearly, if still a little muddled. Although Jarmusch's trademark knack at pacing is evident, and the rhythm of the film is weirdly in sync with Neil Young's lonely, grungy solo electric guitar, its not as strong or moving as in his best work (Mystery Train, Broken Flowers, Down by Law).Still, Johnny Depp gives a very nuanced, controlled performance. It's as interesting, if sometimes in almost out of curiosity, to see Depp in a role like this when he's been at his peak playing eccentrics and crazies (Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas, Pirates, Chocolate Factory). Here he is William Blake (less a running gag in the film than a down-pat comparison to the infamous poet), an accountant who gets turned down in a grimy, bad little Western town in the middle of nowhere. Aftern an altercation, he gets shot and winds up in the hands of a Native named 'Nobody' (direct reference to a Sergio Leone production, among other homages). They then go on a sort of journey as Depp's Blake is on pursuit by a trio of bounty hunters (this brings some of the best parts of the film, and funniest).Somehow in the midst of this heavy film Jarmusch doesn't miss out on some chances for surreal humor- there is one scene that includes Billy Bob Thornton and Iggy Pop as intellectual cannibals who argue over Blake. There is also some unintentional humor in Farmer's performance of 'Nobody', who at times is profound, confusing, absurd, and very mystical in the Native tradition. Towards the last twenty minutes it is mostly just Depp looking woozily on the landscapes and Native tribe sites. It's fascinating in one way, but ponderous in another. It is always worthwhile to see a filmmaker who is putting forth a vision and letting the audience make up their mind about it, leaving things ambiguous as possible. But it's also the kind of film where you really need to be 'in the mood' so to speak to really find total artistic value in it. I'm sure I may watch Dead Man one day and come away with it some great poetic/philosophical extractions (I did on the third viewing, after getting more acclimated to Jarmusch's style and ideas). If you're more of a Depp fan though, it's hit or miss to recommend; the same teenage fan of Pirates may watch Depp in this film and wonder why he even chose the project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When there is nothing going through your head ,thats the time you need to see this movie...... As a plot this movie doesn't have anything to offer, but more than makes it up with a brilliant cinematography and an incredible soundtrack. Johnny shows why he should be given an Oscar as soon as possible, the frequency with which he finds these small films(so called) with off-beat characters is really admirable. Gary Farmer as a crazy Indian does brilliantly well for his role. With a support cast which extends from Mitchum - Henriksen, Molina - Bob Thorton you need worry about acting. No wonder it took a top ten spot in the all time western listing. All in all a very good independent art western......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whosoever that saw this movie must agree that this is truly something else right here. Me, personally think that Mr. Depp is truly one of the best actors out there. He's been doing his thing since the 80's without compromising or not daring to risk his 'status' to play in an ordinary indie flick. Of course I was totally amazed at the storyline in this movie and therefore I can understand why certain simpletons can't appreciate nor understand such a work of art. I can honestly say that this one truly blew me away....FAR away. From beginning to end this movie surprises and never disappoints. That is why this movie is going into my Johnny Depp top 3 list along with his other classics. This movie received the highest praise because it is truly worth nothing less than a 10. Excellent!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Existential western? Huh? I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this movie was bizarre enough to be interesting. All the characters do a fantastic job of pulling off these strange scenes and the philosophical plot. Johnny Depp was terrific in his role as the accountant from Cleveland who finds himself on the run for murder. Don't expect to understand it all, but watch it with a sense of humor. If philosophical outlooks aren't your thing, don't bother. Truly a movie for those who enjoy a completely left-field look at a typically worn-out subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually my girlfriend at that time, Natascha, tricked me into seeing this movie. At a lost afternoon she suggested we use two spare hours and see this cool actionthriller etc. When we had bought the tickets and we sat inside she said : 'It is in black and white' and she laughed at my clear depression.When it started in black and white I wanted almost to run outside and go to one american hack-and-slash-brainless-killing movie but her sweet smile seduced me to stay.And the film was incredible ! The start in the train was amazing. You could feel him being inside the train but outside the environment as well. He just didn't fit inside ?! And you couldn't lay the finger on what it was , it was just the total feeling you got.The whole movie was as weird and touching as this.One thing I have to remark though, for I find it underrated in my fellows' comments is the following :one big praise to NEIL YOUNG ! He played litterally the sound back in the movie. His guitar music was perfectly fitting to the movie, and never ending as such. I was really impressed by this master piece.So to my readers I would like to say :see it and play the music loud !Rogier</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jarmusch's masterpiece. Greatly underrated (but so much is expected).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly feel that "Dead Man" deserves to be in Top 250 (somewhere closer to Top 5 actually) but... not gonna happen, unless the world will suddenly become smarter (and there's very little hope for that).First, it's not really a "western" of course, just like "Four Rooms" isn't really a comedy. No one's fault here, but artistically some movies just don't fit in the genre which technically they belong to. "Dead Man" is one such case.My personal opinion is that it's the best Jaramusch's work and one of the best Depp's performances. And it's as close to poetry as any film ever can be to it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to see Dead Mad and Ghost Dog....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, admittedly, Dead Man is slow. It's not perfect. However, I think it is better if you watch Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai after viewing Dead Man. They seem to be sort of companion pieces in Jarmusch's body of work. *spoiler* Anyone who has seen Dead Man or Ghost Dog is aware that they are about a man's journey into death. In Dead Man, William Blake is traveling toward his own end because he is dying slowly of a bullet wound to the chest. In Ghost Dog, the title character is headed toward his demise because he has long ago accepted that he is already dead. These films aren't about the fact THAT the characters are going to die. These films are about how the characters get there. And, as they are about men who are essentially walking dead, they have a very dreamlike, at times almost psychedelic quality about them. I think that the depth, and the philosophical ideas these films bring to the table make them well worth repeated viewings. Two of my favorite movies. By the way, I fell asleep my first time watching Dead Man too. Ha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There should be a periodical published on when critics are wrong. Dead Man is a film that was long overlooked upon its release. This was partly due to the fact that Miramax did a lousy job at distributing the film, but only a handful of critics like Jonathan Rosenbaum recognized this film as a masterpiece. I saw Dead Man on the first screening of its premiere. After my first viewing, I had various problems with the film. I thought the film seemed too heavy on poetry and symbolism and I also felt that things didn't seem real or authentic enough to be part of a historical period. Other times, I felt the film was confused about its mood. Sometimes it seemed deeply serious and other times it seemed silly and absurd. Not until repeated viewings did I discover how appropriate these observations were to the film. The first line of dialog in the film comes after a long uneventful journey on the train. The train conductor comes in and says to William Blake: "Look out the window. Doesn't this remind you of when you are on the boat..and when you look up at the sky you ask yourself 'why is it that the landscape is moving but the boat is still?'" This line is a key element of the film because it questions the essence of reality. Dead Man is not a film that deals with reality in any conventional sort of way, at least not in the narrative sense and certainly not in our preconception of history. Dead Man is a film that deals with a man's journey through a series of death experiences. Blake's destiny was originally to be an accountant for Dickinson Metalworks in the town of Machine. After some unfortunate events, William Blake is suddenly caught laying in the woods with a bullet next to his heart. A Native American named "Nobody" becomes his new mentor for his ill-fated journey. The film feels fragmented with fades between scenes and a loose narrative structure. At times we feel the clock ticking and other times, we feel unconscious of what just happened. This was my experience anyway, when I first saw the film I remember Nobody telling his life story about traveling East. Something about how a whole city of people could move so quickly and then the rest of the story slipped my mind because it seemed too overwhelming and absurd. The key line to this moment however, was the name given to Nobody:"He Who Speak Loud Say Nothing". Nobody's life story is a reflection of the Allegory of the Cave written by Plato. Someone has traveled to another dimension but once he returns home and talks about his experience, no one believes him. The story told by Nobody also reflects the rise of capitalism and America's shift toward a more homogenized society. Dead Man takes us on a psychedelic journey through Western and Native American culture. We've come to understand through previous Jarmusch films that cultural influence is an inevitable part of life. Dead Man expands on this fact by demonstrating what happens when cultures clash. There is a hierarchal conflict with reality. Part of this is due to politics but it is also due to religious consequences. I've read reviews by critics who seemed puzzled by the reference to the poet and artist William Blake. There is a reflection to the poet's Christian background and his influences with other mystical beliefs. There is a famous poem sited in the film: "some are born to sweet delight, some are born to endless night." As one culture dies, another is born.The film comes full circle when Blake ends on the boat looking up at the moving sky. This is a great film. I can still see this today after repeated viewings and always find something new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is truly fantastic about this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is how everyone who sees it takes something completely different from it. Go ahead, read the comments below, there's parrells to everything from John Ford to Franz Kafka.I'll admit. This is my favorite movie of all time. It's been bumped around quite a bit as the years have passed, up and down my top lists, however this is one film which always stays on top in my mind.I think if you read the negative comments below you can see a lot of people who couldn't look past the surface of the film, and really weren't prepared for a film that challenged them. This may partly be because of the way the film was marketed, it's cast, and expectations Jarmusch fans may have had before Ghost Dog and Dead Man were made. In the end, it is Jarmusch's opus magnus. As we see him turning away from black and white to color, this was his last stand to prove the power of the medium.The story, very bluntly, is a vision quest. Nobody immediately sees death on William's face, and knows that he must prepare him for his end. The rest of the film is the slow plodding preperation for the burial of protaganist. Nobody is his guide, peyote his tool, and death is his goal. A film which presents death from a positive perspective is challenging enough to most audiences. But Jarmusch took it further by telling a story, which if understood and absorbed by the audience, would not only present death in a new light, but CHANGE an audience's perceptions of the inevitibale end.I challenge you to watch this film, sit close to the screen, let it absorb you, let Neil Young's score swim around you. And think of death, think of William Blake's death, but also think of your own death, and how it will come. Only then can you truly appreciate this film as it was intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>noir, set in the ol' west.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in first run. I've seen it about a dozen times since and could see it 100 more times before i could actually filter everything. The film plays as a palindrome, the imagery works both forward and backwards. the opening segment on the train is repeated in the closing segments in the canoe. blake entering the town of machine is mirrored when he enters the indian village. it's impossible for me to glean the meaning of all the symbols (there's a new one every turn of the camera) but it's fun to speculate. the thing that strikes me is how often it is refered to as a western and how little it is called noir. i personally find it to have more in common with the genre of anatomy of a murder &amp; double indemnity than to fist full of dollars/ hang em high. all in all, if you want well thought out poetic images (dialogue &amp; cinematography) this would be a good film for you. the cameos are also pretty cool. I also dig the way he ties dead man to ghost dog. but i can't give that line away</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why Dead Man is a great movie? Let me tell you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not good to call a movie your "favorite". Sooner or later there is another one which will shatter that title and take it over. Notwithstanding, Dead Man has been on top of my very personal list for almost 10 years now. The first time I watched this movie, I could not stop talking about it for hours. Neither the next twenty. Something really vibrated in me with this film, something that flew into my mind from that mixture of wild west metaphysics, comedy and tragedy. Dead Man touched those same places in my soul that only Bunuel's "The Death in This Garden" had touched before.Today I believe that the clue to my love for this movie is the way Jarmusch tells in it a very solid story using the camera to make it into something that is really beautiful. SPOILER WARNING: There are so many underrated scenes in the film, like the one with Blake lying next to a dead baby deer, or the peyote ceremony, but also scenes of absolute fun, like the one with the three pelletiers playing the three stoges with a shotgun. Blake and Nobody gave the world of film one of the most important lessons in friendship, even if it is based on the Lone Ranger and Toro. And then, there is also the ethereal presence of Thel Russell, lovely interpreted by an almost unknown Mili Avital, who seems like she has been doing westerns all her life. SPOILER ENDSDead Man takes you to a world where life and death are almost touching each other in a soft kiss. It is a world that you don't want to leave so soon, so you come back to it as often as you can. It is so unfortunate that Johnny Deep does not put this film on top of his curriculum, and it is also unfortunate that Jarmusch has not been yet recognized as the last true autheur of the American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Good filmmakers make mistakes, because otherwise they wouldn't be taking risks. Jarmusch tries to grow here and misses.For those following the story, Jarmusch created flat irony in film. Actually, its not irony in the original meaning of the word, but according to the new popular meaning. That new meaning broadly applies (in film) to an abstract representation of life that is presented as if it were life itself. Because Jarmusch's abstractions were so flat, his work has been called deadpan, but that's only the appearance of the actor compared to what we expect. Lots of humor can be harvested from this dissonance when the abstractions are well chosen. Hal Hartley does this now, better than Jarmusch ever did.Actually, everyone with a video camera is making `ironic' films these days. And because so many genre films had pre-existing abstraction spaces, irony, camp, parody and `straight.' films now share the same space.'Ghost Dog' is worth watching for how it shifts stances among these. In that case, Jarmusch discovered meta-irony where the irony was not in the distance between what you see and what is real, but between what you see and the `normal' `ironic' perspective. You really must see that film.But along the way, he had this misadventure where he moved toward most of his peers who look to literate perspectives and quote from them rather than past film. Unfortunately, their `irony' is of a different breed, having to do with shifting the position of the narrator rather than reality proper. The merger of the two is not managed well. So we have old Jarmusch with his deadpan magical realism, and we have the `new' Jarmusch with all sorts of metaphor, explicit mysticism, the introduction of reflected poetry, the myth of the West.In the midst of all these unintegrated semantic positions is Johhnny Depp who knows a thing or two about these matters. He wisely chooses to stick closer to the old Jarmusch, wryly watching the rest just like we do. I think of him in this position as `Fitzcarraldo' meets `Butch Cassidy.' He's a lot like Kinski on Fitz on his dangerous voyage into the unknown, but with Beatlesque Sundance acceptance of fate.For myself, I appreciate the risk and don't mind the (substantial) effort of integrating it all after it has left the screen and entered my mind. All that is, except for one piece: that flatulent Neil Young score. I know that many critics zeroed in on that as the best part. I know that Young has his place in erstwhile cowboy rock. I know that for most people hip is hip and so why not assume Young is attuned to Jarmusch. But there is a huge mismatch here between Young's commentary and the various ironies that can only exist without commentary.I guess after he was finished, Jarmusch decided it wasn't working anyway so why not?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

This is only the third film of his I've seen (MYSTERY TRAIN and NIGHT ON EARTH the other two), but it's clear he's on his own planet. Still, despite some patches which don't work, especially Lance Henrikson's character being a cannibal, this does achieve a poetic quality (as it should, since the main character is named William Blake) not unfamiliar to the genre. Of course, it helps to have actors like Depp and Gary Farmer, who takes the "noble savage" stereotype and makes it real.</fullReview>

I love the fact that Steve Buscemi was the 'uncredited' bartender in the town of Machine's bar called the 'Green Door'- which was supposed to be the name of the banned book that Stalin's wife was reading when she was killed (by Stalin's bodyguards). It's little things like these obscure facts that made it wonderful to absorb.Lance Henrikson (from Terminator) as the cannibalistic bounty hunter, the daytime customer getting a blow job from a 'ho' in the side alley and Gary Farmer as the Canadian Indian "Nobody" - make this movie come alive. We get to see his bare arse in the woods too! There is a sense of an epic journey being filmed. The pity is tho that the flower seller who befriends Depp outside the bar is not skanky enough- she's a little too-oo clean &amp; smooth... but it can be forgiven.Dead Man was great for little young me- but maybe you should watch it &amp; see for yourself?</fullReview>

Johnny Depp was brilliant, John Hurt was the best part of the film and the other actors were awful. None of them could decide what dialect to use and the dialect was cringe-worthy throughout. The theme "no one can live as a legend" must have been concocted by an ad man trying to sell this turkey. The best scene was with Johnny Depp and a stuffed fawn but the director did not have the skill to make it poignant. Just awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is the movie reflecting the actual living status of men at that time? Everyone except Thel in the town of machine looked hopeless, indifferent, abnormal, cold. I would doubt it's really this way in real life of that time.Secondly, this movie exposed a lot of shootings. Why did the men don't treat life seriously? Why did they shoot for trivial matters? For example, Charlie was so stupid to shoot Blake. And the reaction of shooting each other did not look realistic. There was no panic in shooting. And when one was shooting another, the other just stood there. Supposedly, the proper and instinctive reaction of the other being shot should be dodging, staying low, or moving aside to avoid being shot. But look at the scene where the shooting between Nobody and Cole, neither Nobody nor Cole dodged or stayed low during the shooting, which did not look real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the earlier 90s Jim Jarmusch had already established himself as a cult film director, who was slowly beginning to get noticed and acclaimed. His past films had received critical acclaim, and had gained cult-followings. Then in 1989 his film Mystery Train went to the Cannes Film Festival and was up for the Palme d'Or. So with this new-found attention Jarmusch made his most ambitious film yet. That film was Dead Man.Dead Man tells the story of William Blake, (played by arguably the best actor of the 90s Johnny Deep, and no, not the poet William Blake, though that will be relevant later.) a man from the earlier 19th century who has left his hometown of Cleveland after his parents died, and uses all of the money he has to travel to the frontier town, Machine, where he was promised a job. When he arrives in the town he learns from the heads of the company (played by John Hurt, and Robert Mitchum.) that his position has already been filled. Disappointed, and depressed Blake heads to the local saloon where he meets a former prostitute called Thel Russell. He then goes home with her and spends the night. The next morning he awakes only to find that her ex-fiancé (named Charlie), who disappeared a while ago, has suddenly arrived back home. Charlie then tries to shoot Blake but hits Thel when she moves in front of him at the last second. Blake then shoots Charlie and desperately runs out of the town, but eventually passes out. When he awakens a Native American (played by Gary Farmer.) is desperately trying to dig the bullet out of him. The Native Americans is called 'he who talks loud, saying nothing, or nobody for short. As it turns out Charlie was the son of Robert Mitchum's character. And Robert Mitchum has now hired bounty hunters to kill William Blake. Everything I've said so far happens within the first half-hour of Dead Man so as you could guess it's going to be a very full film, but then again that goes with the films style. Jim Jarmusch has said that the film is supposed to be a psychedelic western and aside from the electronic guitar soundtrack, (which was mostly improvised by Neil Young.) I don't really get that feel. Don't get me wrong the film itself is very weird, and even has some surrealist moments, but I don't think I would ever use the word 'psychedelic' to describe Dead Man. No Dead Man feels more like your being dragged through the mud as you slowly die of gunshot wound in your stomach. The cinematography is all in black and white, and portrays the western frontier as a disgusting muddy dirty place people go to die. The film does a better job of bringing you down and making you feel like crap, than taking you on any wild trip, not to say that's a bad thing though. Dead Man is often compared to Cormac McCarthy's novel Blood Meridian, and while I have some problems with this comparison, it is more accurate to compare it to Blood Meridian than to call it psychedelic. The problems I have with comparing Dead Man to Blood Meridian are, one it is not nearly as good as that novel. And two, Dead Man's tone doesn't match Blood Meridian's, in the first half of Dead Man, the film feels a lot like a black comedy. There are several moments that are supposed to be comedic, many of which made me laugh at least. Not to mention the general plot of the film is undeniably pretty funny. So in case anyone hasn't read Blood Meridian, let me just say that there are no comedic elements or moments in Blood Meridian. But as the film goes on it slowly becomes darker losing its black comedy element. This tonal shift doesn't really work, that's not to say that it's not executed properly but at the beginning of the film you're enjoying yourself and by the end of the film you feel like crap. It feels so cheap, there's nothing really special or interesting about how it happens or what happens, it just sort of happens. But then again maybe that was the point. Maybe I had just enjoyed the black comedy part so much that it frustrated me to see it go. Who knows maybe I'll enjoy it more on later viewings. Dead Man premiered at the Cannes Film Festival when it was first released, and was even up for the Palme d'Or. But despite this the film received mixed reviews from critics. Some hailed it as a 'postmodern masterpiece,' and others claimed that it was 'boring and unrewarding.' It's status as cult film should go without saying but just in case it does need saying; Dead Man is now considered a cult film. And I think it's cult status is earned. Dead Man is probably the second most imaginative and creative western I've seen. (the first being Alejandro Jodorowsky's El Topo) Even if it's not a flawless masterpiece. 7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that is expertly made by director Jim Jarmusch, Dead Man is slow moving, but never becomes boring thanks to that great direction and a great performance from Johnny Depp. Considered an "acid western", the film stars Depp as an accountant who heads out west for a job and, once there, undergoes a major transformation and becomes a true western gunslinger. The film is also notable for a great performance from Gary Farmer as a Native American who helps Depp. The gentle and sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans living near whites is great and really helps bolster this one. All at once, Dead Man manages to be your typical western, but also manages to be completely unique within that genre, which is a weird place to be and makes this one hard to judge. However, thanks to great dialogue that is used only when needed, great performances from Depp, Farmer, and Michael Wincott, as well terrific direction from Jarmusch, it is tough to look away from Dead Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is so much symbolism and allegory in the picture that it's impossible to comment on it all. Reviewer 'Soul Western' does an excellent job detailing a handful and I recommend reading it.I was struck by Nobody's (Gary Farmer) story of his childhood and capture by white men who paraded him like a zoo animal in a cage. Unwittingly, Nobody marvels at the idea that people from one city would all simultaneously move to the next city before he arrived there so they could see him again. This observation perhaps is meant to convey an apparent condemnation of group-think or herd mentality that settles on a population that has been numbed into acquiescence by popular culture or technology. A movie like "Dead Man" then, invites the viewer to consider ideas outside the parameters of what one might consider normal.The accompaniment of Neil Young's guitar provides a disjointed, fractured framework that's disorienting as much as it is guttural, portending a finality that the picture's journey takes us on. At virtually any point along the way, one might consider that William Blake (Johnny Depp) is already dead to a world that rejected him as soon as he stepped into the town of Machine. Nobody instinctively knows this, reinforced when he observes Blake's face as a skeleton, a symbol used extensively in the story with multiple animal skulls on display in Machine, and again in the walled Indian village just prior to Blake's journey into the beyond.My summary line is taken from a sign in the remote trading post where Blake was accosted by the shopkeeper - "God damn your soul to the fires of hell" he says, recognizing Blake's face from a Wanted Poster. Knowing that there's no turning back now, Blake replies "He already has". The rest of Blake's journey will symbolically take him back to the place from which he came.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie immediately grabs you with it's first scene and keeps that grip all the way thru.There are definite flaws and weaknesses and it is at least a strange way of storytelling.It seems here there is more focus on the journey instead of the destination and the abrupt ending is the perfect example for that.There were a lot of good actors in this and the western settings looked very realistic.It being in black and white gave it something extra and it was all beautiful shot.Annoying was the overall loud soundtrack which got over played in too many scenes.Still a great movie that's close to a classic status.I recommend you at least see it once.Excellent performance by Depp.A strange and weird film.But...I like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favourites.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man is a truly one of a kind film, a film that I have been entranced for over a decade by, and constantly revisit it's haunting beauty, poetic absurdities and stark, gorgeous black and white cinematography (holla to Robby Muller). Johnny Depp basically plays a meek, downtrodden east coast boy mired in a wild, violent and confusing journey through a western outpost town and after a love triangle ends in murder, possibly his own, he embarks on a strange, spiritual walk through a Pacific Northwest netherworld of pine trees, outlaw bounty hunters, and oddball characters, led by a Native named Nobody (the excellent Gary Farmer). Is he dead? Was he even there to begin with? Jarmusch abandons logic for an expressionist approach, and the film ends up as a hypnotic tone poem and visual palette of events that don't really make sense, and may frustrate some. But to those open to its idiosyncratic writing and determined, enigmatic style, oh what a film it is. The cast is absolutely to die for. Depp is incredible in the best performance of his extremely uneven career. The character arc he inhabits here is wonderful, taking a feeble, checkered suited mess of a man and morphing him into a ghostly, predatorial, terrifying wilderness archetypal bandit, a force of nature among the trees and mountains. Haunted eyes, quick draw kill streak, moody contemplation, it really is his finest work. Michael Wincott steals his scenes as a chatty assassin and Lance Henriksen is scary as hell, playing a hired killer who "fucked his parents, then cooked them up and ate them." (Don't ask, just go with the film's demented flow). Gabriel Byrne, Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thornton, Robert Mitchum, Milli Avital, John Hurt and an especially weird Crispin Glover all nail their cameos, and Neil Young's beautiful, melodic, elemental score is the beating heart of the film. Dead Man isn't a traditional film in any sense, and in fact seems to take place in a cliché free, bizarro alternate western dream universe where the rules don't apply, but all the beauty, mysticism and rugged frontier intrigue of the genre still remain. Fine with me. One of my all time favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really sought this out because of Only lovers Left Alive, a wildly entrancing, unique film. This is also unique in the pantheon of western genres. I think the score doesn't fit quite as nicely as it should with the film's content, but it doesn't distract too badly. Johnny Depp does great work here, totally in sync with what Jim intended. It's actually not as minimalist as people like to point out (from what I've read) but you can still see where some people get impatient to a point. It's hypnotizing and it does a fine job of setting up its atmosphere well enough to succeed in its points. Definitely recommended enough, even if not sure how much I really liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death and Circumstance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began viewing Jarmusch films after "Under the Skin" this year, 2014, which very much intrigued me. I've also seen "Permanent Vacation," "Mystery Train" and now "Dead Man." Tempo seems always important, rhythmic, slow. It sometimes feels like characters are sleepwalking and innocence becomes a fragile metamorphosis of condition or circumstance and often wonderful humor as in "Mystery Train" when an Italian woman from Rome has landed in the wrong city and during her layover people prey upon her for money. She is so deadpan as she offers a guy money to just go away but does it with such lightness. Jarmusch's characters have depth and wonderful contrasts as when one of the hired bounty hunters of William Blake in Dead Man comes across two recently killed government hires and comments, "If he keeps killing marshals I might grow to like the bastard." In a world that prefers not to look below the surface, Jarmusch shows us who we really are with a stoicism and pathos where light and dark are truly the horizon where they meet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timid accountant William Blake arrives at the west-end of the world and finds his promise of a new job broken and a short acquaintance with a free-spirited woman turned into a false charge of double-murder. With a bullet in his chest, he's aided by whacked-out Indian Gary Farmer, who believes him to be the earthbound spirit of the same-named poet. Meanwhile, a trio of hired killers, including motor-mouthed Michael Wincott and psychopath (and reputed cannibal!) Lance Henrikson, are soon on his trail.Weird, violent, and often times quite surreal, one doesn't know whether this acid western is supposed to be dead-serious or a put-on, as it's equal parts action/adventure, comedy, and art-house pretentiousness, very much a product of the mid-nineties.Although it's a pinch too long, it's never boring, with an almost always entertaining Depp losing his sanity bit-by-bit with each graphically violent encounter (with gore FX by Steve Johnson!), usually involving flashy guest stars like Billy Bob Thornton (who's Slingblade in turn guest-starred director Jim Jarmusch), Iggy Pop, Jared Harris (as a trio of degenerates), Gabriel Byrne, and Alfred Molina as a racist scripture- quoting trader. Other guest stars include Crispin Glover, John Hurt, and Robert Mitchum, in his final western appearance.The ugliness of it all is beautifully photographed in black and white and set to a quasi-psychedelic score by Neil Young(!), who in turn was the subject of a documentary/concert film from Jarmusch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch, Johnny Depp, Crispin Glover, Iggy Pop and an improvised soundtrack by Neil Young... how can such a film be anything but triumphant? With its compelling storyline, poetical and heartfelt script, this film really delivers. As a western it holds up, but as an existential trip into the meaning of both life and death it really pleases. Not one of the many acting legends in this film (more than I just mentioned) fails to produce to their own highest standards. This film is a gem that has been greatly overlooked - or misunderstood - by mainstream audiences and, in my opinion, is worthy of being in the top 10/20 in IMDb's top 250.</fullReview>

It stars Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer, Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Michael Wincott, Lance Henriksen, and Robert Mitchum (in his final film role). The film, dubbed a "Psychedelic Western" by its director, includes twisted elements of the Western genre. The film is shot entirely in black-and-white. Neil Young composed the guitar seeped soundtrack with portions he improvised while watching the movie footage. Some consider it the ultimate postmodern Western, and related to postmodern literature such as Cormac McCarthy's novel, Blood Meridian ... (Such a twisted movie)</fullReview>

We suffer, we die, we learn and in the mean time we see our own way. May we have a moment to reflect on an other culture to find meaning from our life we had missed from our own isolation of meaning, may we be open to the possibility we know absolutely no thing as it truly is. This film is a glance at how many come in different ways to be what is unknowable and still we can still be unknown. WTF!!!!! I love this film!All star cast, pulling from our history of north American native/white man clashing. full of humor and outrage.

		<fullReview>Film Review Dead Man After a long travel on train, William Blake arrives at the Town of Machine, but before his arriving, the locomotive driver tells him that William is going to his grave. Blake goes to the office to talk about his job as an account but the secretary tells him that they had a new one a month ago, then he ''insists" to visit the boss whose name was Mr. Dickinson, but Mr. Dickinson sends him out of the room with a gun. After some wandering, William goes to a café and meets a girl named Thel who is a whore, Thel takes him to her room in a hotel . some hours later Charley Dickinson who is the son of Mr. Dickinson and Thel's fiancé comes in the room unexpectedly, he sees Thel and William on the bed and after a short talk Charley shoots Thel and kills her and William who is also wounded shoots Charley and escapes with an expensive horse of Dickinson's family status. Charley and Thel are found dead in Dickinson's hotel and William is known as the murderer of both and also robbing the horse. Mr. Dickinson determines a $500 reward for any one who find and brings him alive or dead . And also orders three gunmen to find him and the horse. An Indian finds William lying unconscious, takes him with himself and tries to treat his wound. The Indian whose name as he himself says is Nobody mistakes William with the English poet William Blake. The two continue to escape through the jungle and find out that they are followed by the gunmen. As they go through, they see three men sitting around the fire and Nobody tells William to go to them. there happens a fight between them, and they intend to kill William but Nobody comes and cuts the head of one and shoots another and William shoots one. Picture of William with the announced award around the jungle, makes the youngest and black gun man very angry and the oldest one kills him because he was cursed by him. After a while Nobody leaves William in the jungle sleeping. When William gets up and goes around to look for Nobody, two people find his place and William shoots both of them. On the other hand the older gunman kills the other one in their way and eats his body as he had done it previously with his parents. William continues his way with the horses, trying to find Nobody and finally he does. In their way they find a store in the jungle on which walls there are the pictures of William, they go inside, the man recognizes William and they kill him and a customer coming in. outside the store William is shot by an unknown person and is wounded again .Nobody takes William to a boat on the river, in their way they see an Indian territory burned on the shore. They arrive at another Indian territory and Nobody takes William to the tribe and he himself goes with the boss. William sees human bones around the place and faints from weakness. He wakes up finding himself lying on sand on the beach. Nobody puts him on a boat and pushes the boat to the river and telling William that he was to o to a place where all humans have come from and must return to some day. While Nobody is looking William going on the water and he himself fare welling him on the beach, the last gun man arrives and he and Nobody kill each other. After a while of wandering in the sea, William also dies on the boat. The movie is mostly showing the violent and corrupt context of American culture and society. The violence is seen in people killing each other without no conscience and getting upset or as Nobody says they speak through weapons .the violation is also seen in the genocide of Indians .the corruption is that there is seen no marriage relationships and rape is a usual matter in the society. finally there is seen no laws or moralities in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dead Man, a Passenger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm nobody! Who are you? Are you nobody, too? Then there's a pair of us?don't tell! They'd banish us, you know.How dreary to be somebody! How public, like a frog To tell your name the livelong day To an admiring bog!Emily DickensonDead Man is thematically a movie of conflicts and diversities in the Western and in particular American cultures and societies. Indeed, Dead Man is an appreciable attempt to illustrate a confrontation between spiritual and materialistic orientations in the American society. Although the movie is believed to depict the anarchical situation of the United States in a span around the Civil War, the leading conflicts in the movie are time and again possible to be traced in the whole history of the United States.The movie begins with a vibrant contextualization of the period in which the story takes place. The very initial scenes are giving a portrait of the Western chaotic society. The physical objects and behavioral patterns used in the early senses happening in the train symbolically show the developmental arrangement of the American society after modernity and industrialization. Moving on, the urban society in town of Machine is shown in which there is a tangible disorder. William Black, the protagonist, happens to be a horse of a different color in such a society. From the very beginning, we receive the clue that he is different from the ordinary people in the city. He has initially a phobic view in his contacts with the people both in the train and the city.Of a great significance are the train fragmented scenes whereby the nature and characteristic traits of the people are reflected. At the same time, these scenes give the audience a sense about the personal characteristics of the protagonist. The very initial scene begins with the focus of camera on the wheels of a moving train. It might symbolically represent modern life. Also the close-shut on the moving train components is repeated for several times to grasp the attention on the moving process taking place throughout the movie. In other words, the audience might unconsciously realize that the whole movie is a story about moving from somewhere to another. The protagonist comes from Cleveland where is famous for its noble culture and architecture. He plays cards on his own in the train which indicates being unaccompanied in his voyage. An accountant, ironically he reads a magazine about 'bee culture'. Later, as his name appears to be William Blake, this bee culture reminds a poem by the poet named the same as the protagonist. As we read this excerpt of Proverbs of Hell, composed by Blake, the poet, we find the plot thematically similar to the excerpt. As the train moves, the wearing style of the people changes. At the beginning, people are wearing more formal clothes and by the passage of the time and train, people inside appear to be wearing perfectly unkempt clothes, having aggressive behavior and finally carrying rifles. The traveling road is also focused as the train moves. The outside location which is initially verdurous jungle changes into a desert at the end. All these changes for worse foreshadow the trouble the protagonist is going to face.The first allusive dialogue exchanged in the movie is an attempt to representatively narrate the whole including the end of plot. A colored person comes to the protagonist and starts the conversation with no previous introduction or acquaintance. He asks personal questions to which the protagonist answers. Then the strange person strongly suggests the protagonist not to trust in written words and go back to his hometown. The conversation abruptly ends in a shooting scene in which extreme violence is clearly demonstrated.As people get off the train, they are carrying rifles with them while the protagonist is not. The city, as mentioned before, is shown as place of anarchy and disorder and the people are extremely belligerent in manner which panics the protagonist. The concept of death is in a particular focus in the depiction of the urban structure. For instance, as the protagonist enters the city he sees coffins as well as skeletons and bones hung over the walls. The city lives in a very unpleasant condition: a pig is roaming, a horse is urinating and a man is in an exposed affair with a woman outdoors. As the protagonist enters the workplace he is supposed to work, he is treated in an utterly humiliating manner. The workers and owner of his so-supposed workplace mistreat him and say that they are not going to hire him for he has arrived late. The behavioral approach of the people in the company shows the inhumane view on the mankind in the post-modernization western world. According to this view, human-being is nothing but a tool. In such a setting, human interaction is not based upon ethical principles due to a dramatic shift in the western value system. We realize that the company owner is powerful and respected since he has the capital to hire the people. This rich man does not bother to respect other people. For example, when he enters the room, he talks to a dead bear rather than his staffs sitting in the same room. On the other side, a man of no money is not respected in Machine city, even if he is "human when he talks."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stranger in a beehive.William Blake is the main character of this movie. It is impossible to hear this name, and do not remember the name of the great English poet William Blake. Of course it is not a coincidence. The character in the film is inspiring the poet's life and philosophy.The begging of the movie starts with a journey. It is the journey and movement and being not stable in place which is the dominant theme in the whole movie. An absolutely stranger in a train coming from Cleveland and going to hell. This hell is called the Machine town at the end of the line. There is no morality in this city. The machine is working. All people, including animals are part of this machine. Coffins, skulls, mud and of course guns are the dominant pictures of this gloomy city, when William Blake enters.He is looking for a job, he had been offered. He finds his job unreachable. Someone has already occupied it. There is no place for objection. He finds himself alone in the city, with little money at the bottom of his pocket. He disappointedly meets a beautiful woman and sleeps with her. She has a gun because of a simple answer: it is America. She makes the flower out of paper and hopes to find some perfume for the flowers. These paper flowers are the symbols of artificial world around. In the morning her previous husband finds the lovers rolling in tight. Kills her ex-wife and Blake kills her a second after. The real journey begins?.He flees, wounded, with the stolen horse of the man he killed. On the way an Indian finds him treats him, inspires him, and lead him to the other world both Blake in the movie and the poet are looking for. Going to the other world is death but for Blake is salvation. In his journey there are symbols just as many symbols in Blake poetry and philosophy.Mr. Dickenson hires three killers to find Blake who killed his son. He presumes this search as a hunt and at the second rank finding his true bred horse and at the last reason maybe a revenge. Those killers are ruthless, haven't ever heard of humanity, in search for a boy to kill and take the prize. This deal is a sign of American culture. People eat and kill each other easier than saying A B C.On the way the Indian man reads for him: some are born to sweet delight ? some are born to endless night. This poem is the true meaning of life in America. It is not only the matter of class stratification or race or ethnicity. It is the basic fundamental of American society. One of these bases is absolutely gun. The Indian man says to Blake "your weapon will replace your tongue, you will learn to speak through it" the role of the Indian man is significant. He invites Blake for getting ready for the final step, he teaches Blake to see his inside when he tells Blake "He who talks loud- say nothing" when Blake asks for some food, the Indian says " Quest for vision is a great blessing, to do so, one must go without food and water. All those scared spirit recognize those who fast"Illustration of William Blake as the killer of the Salvatore appears when he finds himself a nod from the long chain of American who speak through their weapons and place none for the spirituality. The role of Jesus Christ also attends in the movie. Its position is as vague as it is in the Blake the poet. Blake in search for salvation goes with the Indian man while Blake knows that Jesus Christ vision is the redskin (the Indian man) vision's greatest enemy.If he had been Antichrist's creeping JesusHe'd have done anything to please us:Gone sneaking into SynagoguesAnd not us'd the Elders &amp; Priests like DogsBut humble as a Lamb or AssObey'd himself to Caiaphas (1)God wants not Man to Humble himselfAt the end phase of the journey the Indian make it clear for the Blake that he should see the sea mirror to go the other world which is salvation. This sea of mirror corresponds to a conversation at the beginning of the movie, where a man talks to Blake in the train and illustrate the life as a journey in a boat where it seems for the traveler stable but the sky, moving. Blake must see himself in the mirror that step by step he understand what it is. He pays for the price of that understanding by his death which is completely obvious for himself and us. He finds the boat and sees the sea mirror and watches the final battle between good and evil at the sea shore.His end will no longer concerns the viewers as the world will no longer concerns him.a friend at Blake coffins said he is going to that Country he had all His life wished to see and expressed Himself Happy, hoping for salvation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film review "the dead man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film review "the dead man" If I was supposed to put my understanding of this movie in one word, it defiantly would be "brutality", if in two words then "brutality" and " indifference" if one can describe it in three words then I would say "brutality ", "Indifference" and "sinful mind". I am sure there have been a lot professional reviews about this movie, but what I can add to, is only the way that I have understood it. As our man "William Blake" goes toward his destination so the scenes out of the train window glasses change from so called civilized world to gradually rural and less civilized one, we alongside the movie sink into a scene of inhuman, indifference and violence. The characteristic of William Blake in this story seems to be a normal civilized gentleman who at the end, changes to a savage killer in a world that laughs at the all human values and crashes the humanity by treating people as if they are either the slave workers, mercenaries, or if not fitted into their system then, someone out of the line who must be hunted down by paid mercenaries. Not only the title of the movie as "Dead Man" chosen by Jim Jarmusch, quite professionally, but also the name of the city as "Machine" or even other names, picked up quite carefully and meaningful, like the name of the Indian as (nobody), likewise the others, that have got impact in letting the audience sink deep into the movie's environment, therefor understand it better. I confess that this film confuse me what to believe at! as what or where the US is? Is the US a sort of the place that this movie describes?, being a violent, brutal and immoral or the image of the US should be some other movies like "good will hunting" or "Charlie Wilson's War" is giving? It is all meaningful that our character has ever even heard of the British poet William Blake, but at the end gets his influence because of the Indian character "nobody" keeps talking about the poet. The movie leads audience to the nature of reality in the US society, although it address the US in the beginning of the huge migration and settlements of that time, but the core of the society still seem to be the same. Although movie goes too far by exaggerating on violent scenes, like the part that the 2 of mercenaries getting killed by the other one and the details of the killing scenes, especially when they were talking about the way that killer had treated his own parents, by emphasizing on him raping his own parents, and cannibalized them, it transfers the treat and fear to the audience.it has a deep meaning, because in nowadays US society the rate of rape and murder is so high that is worrying for a civilized society. The part that William Blake goes to see the factory owner "Dickinson, and the way that Mr. Dickinson treats him, as he is a piece of dirt, the director has professionally target many meanings and philosophical concepts in the movie to leave space for the audience to think and elaborate on the blanks of the movie rather than giving everything to them, so that scene can be compared to the now a days treatment of the capital owners in the society and the way that they treat the lower levels. One of the ambiguities of the story of "dead man" is the question of, who is the dead man. Story of the poet, William Blake, or in the character of Wilma Blake or the son of the Dickinson, the first dead man in the movie. "Nobody" been raised by the British, is educated and knows "William Blake's poetry", is an irony which makes the movie more interesting, that perhaps without that character the movie had become one of those "RAMBO" type, hard action. The mystical relationship of Blake and "nobody" is one of the grate elements, it takes us beyond the simple story of a "man hunt", and deadly, brutal crashes in the film, and it also helps us remember that, many of such actions are still happenings in the US. The director has put some ambiguity on his message, Is he saying that west is corrupt, falling apart, and must be saved by the Indians (spiritual people) that now a days can be, let's say "Muslims" , eastern people" or whom? Is it OK the way that it is, right now? Violence, sexuality, injustice? I found this movie against my own per-judging of the western movies to be "in-humanizing the Indians ", most of the western movies used to say "the white man is superior, who has every right to live in this world and his/her enemies are "barbarians", "inhuman" and "uncivilized" . It was the same story that the "Greeks" used to justify what they did in assaulting Persia and the East in 3rd century BC, by calling the Easterners as "barbarians" and their act " war for freedom", that reminds us of the terminology used by Gorge W Bush and his "War on Terror".Jarmusch's film talks about the trip of Blake and nobody, but all episodes have a philosophical, comedy and tragedy, meaning that gives the audience, a sad feeling, but the movie being in black and white, helps in terms of transferring that certain feeling, the director has paid attention to so many details in the movie, although looks simple, but the decorations and locations pickups all match with each other and the sequence is well planned. I am not a professional critic so I cannot exactly comment on the acts, but even to my unprofessional eye the play of Johnny Deep looks grate alongside of the Farmer's "nobody". even without being a great fan of "western" I liked it ,in spite of harsh violence, but it helps understanding parts of the US history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Although the film is in b&amp;w, it has more figurative color than most movies filmed in color. The spiritual allegory and inevitable storyline provide the map for quite a journey, beginning with a prophetic train fireman. We watch as the naive and gentle Blake slowly transforms as he deals with his fatal wound, becoming dependent on the friendship of a Native American, and unfortunately learning to kill or be killed.So far, I've watched it 3-4 times and will do so several more times I'm sure. With each viewing, I notice more detail and authenticity. I read one review that mentions the annoyance of the pace, particularly the slow gun battles and how a man will stand there waiting to get shot. However, I felt that the man who initially wounded Blake wanted to be shot, since he'd just killed his fiancé. Furthermore, most gun square-offs likely weren't of the fast-drawin' OK corral ilk. Some folks have watched too many typical western dramas. This one takes you somewhere totally different, somewhere you imagine that this is more like it really was...the pace is key to that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the style, the B&amp;W gave me a yearning to see some of the vistas in color. I was always wanting to know what is going to happen next next.The message if there was one, seemed lost. Seemed like a anti gun movie. I'm sure half the shootings were accidental, unintended. Maybe "white men creating and chasing philistines, when all along the philistines are themselves". Maybe a mans inevitable journey to death in a way he least expected.Would have liked to see some more off the Mitchum character. Maybe responses to the further killings, how a city dweeb could become a full on killer. Maybe see him get some comeuppance. A heart attack from shock even.I thought the Indian scenes were done quite well. I knew it was coming but that arrow to the bounty hunter still smacked me. Not enough arrows in this movie. The Neil Young soundtrack is brilliant even if somewhat repetitive. It could have used some expansion with themes for the different characters I think I really would have liked to have seen this on the big screen for both the picture and soundtrack.If you have a TV set up that does 3D conversion. Turn out the lights and put on this movie. Stunning!. Even better if ya have full HiFi.I could easily re-watch this film every couple of years. All though not perfect, a great western "road movie to death"? Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Blake, a young man from Ohio has lost his parents to illness, and heads West to begin anew. A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"...Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom.The Suitor was the son of the factory manager that rejected Blake, who then hires Bounty hunters to bring Blake in, dead or alive. Blake is now a hunted man, critically wounded, and sought by both the Law and hired killers. Blake narrowly escapes, with the unexpected aid of an Indian Shaman without a tribe, who calls himself "Nobody".What follows, is a surreal journey through the American West - Blake, assisted and sometimes harassed by Nobody, continues his journey to (he knows not where), with Nobody as guide and protector. Strange and malevolent encounters with men in the wilderness - all of them Desperadoes at some level - result in an increasing Body Count for Blake. Nobody is firmly convinced that Blake is the same William Blake as the English poet and author - Nobody tells Blake: "Now you are a killer of White Men. Your words will be written in blood".The strangeness of the encounters - the appearance of Benevolent Spirits to Blake in the camp's firelight - and an incredibly melancholy but sweet soundtrack (solo electric guitar, heavily Distorted with Reverb and Tremolo) by Neil Young - all contribute to an atmosphere of Foreboding. Is Blake already dead, and is this all a dream? This question begs the viewer to decide.I will not reveal any more of the story. I really hope that all the readers of these Reviews decide to see this movie for themselves. It is certainly Unique, and contains excellent acting by Gary Farmer, Lance Henrickson, and (darkly humorous) Billy Bob Thornton, to name just a few. Yes, it is a movie that reveals more, with successive viewings, than at first. Heavy use of Foreshadowing, and some Iconic displays (which may not be in harmony with the plot, but seem somehow appropriate anyway), also add to the feeling of Blake's journey.Of note, is the representation of the slaughter of Native Americans and their culture. The Death of their civilization is presented graphically, without words. Words are not necessary. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant in his role as William Blake - an innocent man, totally transformed and Metamorphosed into something else entirely.....but, IMHO, Gary Farmer is the most interesting Character in the movie. He is intelligent, articulate and actually well-educated in the White Man's ways, while still retaining some of the superstitious aspects of his Native culture. His character is the only really Humorous character in the story. He is kind-hearted and jovial by nature, but will kill without hesitation, if the need arises. I would grade this movie a "9" out of "10".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is one of the most talented &amp; influential actors of the Modern-Era. His body of work proves that fact right! Having played some of the most twisted characters, Depp reinvents himself with his outstanding performance as a meek accountant in 'Dead Man'. WOW! 'Dead Man' Synopsis: On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake encounters a strange North American man named Nobody who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world.'Dead Man', as a film, has the power to engross its viewer. Its an interesting film, that is executed sharply by Cult-Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch executes the film with style &amp; a sense of wonderment, which works big time. The Narrative is crisp &amp; even humorous at times. Jarmusch's Screenplay &amp; Direction, both, are very well-done. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is decent. Art Design is proper. Performance-Wise: Its a Johnny Depp Show All The Way! He's simply outstanding as the protagonist. This has to be Depp's finest performance from the mid 1990's. Gary Farmer is efficient. Crispin Glover &amp; John Hurt are okay. Gabriel Byrne is ever-impressive.On the whole, 'Dead Man' is certainly a film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Jarmusch's psychedelic Western that deals with existentialism and spirituality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man presents the bizarre journey of a meek, naive young accountant who, after getting haplessly entangled in a deadly maelstrom, goes through an intellectual and spiritual transformation that changes his life forever. While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms." But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry: be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage): "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow." Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience: one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding. Dead Man is a must watch for anyone who values intelligent cinema that goes beyond the usual doze of entertainment and makes the viewer ruminate on what he saw long after the movie is over.A more detailed review of the movie can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Jim Jarmusch (Down by Law, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers), when I saw this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book I assumed it was some kind of crime based story, but it turned out to be much more interesting than that. Basically accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) from Cleveland, Ohio is coming by train to the company town called Machine with a promised job as a metal works factory bookkeeper, before arriving he was given a warning by a Fireman (Crispin Glover) on the train about the enterprise. When arrives he finds that the position he was offered has been filled, and he is forced away at gunpoint by the ferocious company owner John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum), and with no money, no job and no prospects he can only drown his sorrows. He then meets former prostitute Thel Russell (Mili Avital) who makes her living selling paper flowers, they go to her house to spend the night together, and when her ex-boyfriend Charlie Dickinson (Gabriel Byrne) bursts in a shoot-up ensues, Charlie is killed, and trying to protect him Thel is shot dead as well, and wounded Blake gets away in a stolen pinto. Dickinson is angry that Blake killed Charlie and the wrongly accused killing of Thel, he seems more angry that he stole his horse, so the businessman has hired three legendary frontier killers, Cole Wilson (Lance Henriksen), Conway Twill (Michael Wincott) and Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett (Eugene Byrd) to hunt him down. Blake meanwhile has awoken from fainting in the woods with a large American Indian man calling himself Nobody (Gary Farmer), as he attempts to remove the bullet from his chest, but it is too close to his heart, so he is effectively man walking dead, the bullet may eventually kill him, and learning his full name Nobody believes Blake is a reincarnation of the poet by the same name. The American Indian agrees to help Blake get to safety, but specifically he wants to help him reach the Pacific Ocean where he can be taken to the proper place in the spirit world, so they travel west, and along the way they pass many Wanted posters, each time with the reward money for the capture of Blake being raised. Blake does find himself immersing in the spirit world as the journey goes on, learning of Nobody's past involving being marked by both Native American and White racism, and his abduction from Europe before returning to America, and Nobody meanwhile leaves him to undergo a vision quest. In his quest the former accountant turned Indian like spiritualist kills two U.S. Marshals, experiences visions of natural spirits, grieves for the death of a fawn killed by his hunters, he paints his face with the fawn's blood and continues the journey to the sea, and meanwhile Cole Wilson, the most vicious hunter, has killed his other two hunters, and eaten them to hunt alone. A Trading Post Missionary (Alfred Molina) recognises Blake as the wanted man and attempts to kill him, but after the shootout the hero and Nobody survive, but Blake ends up shot again and his condition rapidly starts to deteriorate, so Nobody takes him down river to a Makah village for a canoe to use for a burial. In the end Blake collapses from his injuries and wakes up in the canoe wearing a Native American funeral dress, Nobody bids his friend a fond farewell before pushing him out to sea, but going out he notices Cole coming up behind Nobody, but too weak he cannot shout as the two kill each other, and silently gazing up at the clouds he passes away. Also starring John Hurt as John Scholfield, Iggy Pop as Salvatore 'Sally' Jenko, Billy Bob Thornton as Big George Drakoulious, Gibby Haynes as Man with Gun in Alley, George Duckworth as Man at End of Street, Richard Boes as Man with Wrench, John North as Mr. Olafsen, Peter Schrum as Drunk, Thomas Bettles as Young Nobody #1 and Daniel Chas Stacy as Young Nobody #2. Depp gives a marvellously majestic and empathising performance as the mundane man turned into someone connecting with nature and unworldly forces, Mitchum with his time on screen does well in what would be his last film role before his sad death, and the other supporting actors like Farmer, Iggy Pop and Henriksen are terrific as well. You could argue this is very similar to the feel of Dances with Wolves, the man becoming like an Indian, obviously the difference being that he is getting away from killers, I can agree with the descriptions of both deadpan and psychedelic, it is definitely both of those, it is not the usual thing you will get in the genre, but it is absolutely a worthwhile western. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dead man is as strange a western as you're likely to see but is in itself a viable measurement of the evolution of American film. It has long been described since release as the ultimate post-modern western but I think it may well serve more of a purpose than that. The film is very nicely shot and the black and white evokes nostalgia toward the American westerns of old whilst the narrative structure, mise en scene and musical score point toward the changing face of American film with influences of European art cinema. The film demands you ask questions of it immediately and Jonny Depp's portrayal of William Blake makes for one of the most undecidedly strange protagonists I've seen in a film whilst ultimately the character of William Blake himself reminds me of James Stuart's Ransom Stoddard from John Fords Classic 'the man who shot Liberty Valance' if he had actually went the full nine yards and shot Liberty Valance. William Blake comes to accept his situation very easily and that's the kind of film this is, you won't enjoy it if you pick at its artistic direction constantly but if you just sit back and come to accept the narrative then you should enjoy it, even if it does tend to get lost within itself toward the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man : An Unforgettable Trip to Demise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man" is not like any western that you've seen before. It's not a glorification of pioneers traveling out west, and it's not a direct indictment of the people's treatment of Indians. Granted, it portrays the Old West as a pretty ugly place, but the movie almost seems to treat it as a parallel universe. Johnny Depp plays William Blake, who gets hired to be an accountant for a metal company in a town called Machine in 1876. When he arrives in town - after using up all his money - he learns from the corporate CEO (Robert Mitchum) that they've hired someone else. With nowhere to go, Blake hooks up with a woman, only to have her hubby walk in on them and kill her and wound him. Blake kills the guy and has to flee, since it turns out that this guy is the corporate CEO's son (and the CEO is more concerned that Blake stole a horse than that his son got murdered). Out in the open, Blake meets up with an Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer), who calls him "stupid white man". That's when the movie really starts to seem metaphysical.I thought that this movie was quite good, although it's definitely not for everyone. All I can say is good filmmakers make mistakes, because otherwise they wouldn't be taking risks. Jarmusch tries to grow here but misses. Still, despite some patches which don't work, especially Lance Henrikson's character being a cannibal, this does achieve a poetic quality (as it should, since the main character is named William Blake) not unfamiliar to the genre. Of course, it helps to have actors like Depp and Gary Farmer, who takes the "noble savage" stereotype and makes it real. The very idea of an American film star Johnny Depp travelling in a steam locomotive to far west is amazing as it allows us to believe that leading players in Hollywood are always willing to contribute to innovative ideas. If you see it and don't love it, I say see it again. I would have gone with 7/10 rating , but I think movie surely has independent cinema feel and must watch for any Johnny Depp fan, So I am going with humble 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is actually a story of a travel. A travel from present to past, from modernity to custom.[5] We can conclude that the train here is a symbol of traveling from industrial parts to the west where Indians live.travel of present society of America to the past of this society.in fact the goal of this film is to show the controversy of two cultures;Americans and Indians.the modern culture o America was formed by ruining Indians culture.culture of Indian is doomed to naught facing Americn industrial revolution.this controvery is showed by two characters Blake and Nobody.Nobody is in traditional attire (which reminds us of culture of local Indians)while William Blake is in his modern stylish suit. Blake gradually turns out to have a different behavior and perceptions confronting industrial controversies and chaffy claims of industrial world.he gets sort of nomad inside and starts killing people since he came to the conclusion that there is a huge violence behind the nice and shiny appearance of modern world and in fact there is no difference between Indian tribes and modern society. Nobody and Dead man share many traits. Nobody belongs to native Americans who abandoned his tribe and started to travel to west and he ended up coming back to his tribe in which nobody accepted him thanks to differences. Nobody is called nobody because he isnot accepted ,he is pendent. pendent between native American culture and modern America and neither of them is accepting him. Eventually Blake resembles to Nobody.whites deprive him of practicing basic rights which is having a job and he finds a shelter in Thel,escaping from cruelty of machine age.and Thel leaves him and it is like Blake needs to escape from/murder his ethnicity (whites) to survive. Such issues about Blake who is symbol of modern America and Nobody who is symbol of native Americans ,are the similarities and join them together to start a travel in which they face many hardships to reach destination. The last shots of the movie shows Blake (industrial society without morality)who will die in no time while the tribe leader(who are symbol of conscience )look at him with compassion . In last and actually in the end of Blake s travel ,Blake turns to be a person accepted neither by modern society nor by traditional society of native Americans gets on a boat moving forward to naught.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man heads out to the wild west -- to become an accountant. He ends up filled with the 'white man's metal' .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been 15 years since I first saw this movie. I've watched it many times since then. I've watched with many different people, and most of them liked it very much. If you like Johnny Depp, you'll recognize a favorite persona: young, earnest, and without a clue -- and surprisingly dangerous.The thing about Jim Jarmusch is he has no particular interest in making Hollywood movies. I think he has influenced lots of more conventional Hollywood types, and today it is very common to see a Jarmusch riff popping up. "American Beauty" certainly comes to mind, but there have been many more. The typical Jarmusch character has no understanding of where they are or why they are there. "Stranger than Paradise", his first generally available movie, sets the tone for these sorts of characters.Why is "Dead Man" a black and white movie? Nine million dollars is not a huge budget, but the days when color killed the budget are long since past. Jarmusch likes striking visual effects. In this movie it surely is all the bones. Think Georgia O'Keefe. Black and white is also an homage to the traditional western, and early movies in general. Many of the background characters, the one without speaking parts, have a certain wildness in their eyes that used to be a staple of the silent era and the thirties, but quickly disappeared after world war 2. Finally, I think the B&amp;W simplified the editing. I think only Depp, Gary Farmer, and Lance Hendricksen were with Jarmusch for every day of shooting.Robbie Muller has made many Jarmusch movies. He is a wonderful camera man with many signature shots. His pans are often supposed to represent the character's gaze, and they always work. You will never know what happens before it happens, and Robbie Muller really makes that work.There is an opening sequence that will probably make or break the movie for you. Depp is on a train heading west. The train never changes; Depp never changes. But his fellow passengers get wilder and wilder. Suddenly Crispin Glover bursts in the car and delivers a weird vision. Part of it is a paradox; you see the shoreline moving, but really it is your boat bobbing up and down. That's pretty much how the train ride works, and how the movie works right through to the end.Never try to guess a meaning or a reference in a Jarmusch movie. For instance, you won't find out why Depp is named Bill Blake until Jarmusch wants you to. Apparently the movie is jam-packed with allusions to Blake's poetry, but you'll probably miss most of them. Maybe Jarmusch is trying to imagine the mind of William Blake; it is clear he is not interpreting Blake's poetic vision.I was glad to find out the 'Indian stuff' is not only based upon true features of the American Indian culture, but that real live American Indians like what Jarmusch does with their culture in this film.Most of the cameos are villains. Villainy gives actors lots of room to create a persona and take it somewhere in a hurry. Billy Bob Thornton and Iggy Pop are super, but so is Alfred Molina and Crispin Glover. And Robert Mitchum is ridiculously good.So it's a pretty great movie, as long as you don't worry too much about what it really is supposed to mean. The stupid white man is interpreted by the crazy Indian to be a re-incarnation of William Blake. Bill Blake probably doesn't even know who he is a namesake of the poet. His death is delayed because the crazy Indian needs it to be that way. Enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm not dead. Am I?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that introduced me to Jim Jarmusch's work. Now, after watching several of his movies I can say that "Dead Man" is right there among his best. This is a good movie in every way, it has an original concept and a good execution, but it also has a few problems: viewers may find it a little slow and sometimes it doesn't have a clear message.The film starts like an ordinary western with accountant William Blake traveling to the town of Machine in order to take up a job. Arriving in Machine, he finds the locals to be hostile towards him and his employer Mr. Dickinson informs him that his job was given to someone else. Out of money and luck, he gets into trouble after he kills Mr. Dickinson's son, Charles, and he finds himself forced to leave town. He is found wounded and unconscious by an Indian named Nobody, who believes that he is the great poet William Blake. From this point on, the film's atmosphere and narrative style somehow dissociate from that of traditional storytelling."Dead Man" is filled with symbolism and there are plenty of situations where things have more than one meaning. What I found interesting is the fact that the director left certain details for the viewer's own interpretation. It is one of those films that require multiple viewings in order for the viewer to fully understand what is going on. The film has a slow pace at times, probably to emphasize on the beautiful black and white cinematography. Jim Jarmusch's movie almost has a surreal feeling to it due to the way it is photographed, the lines exchanged between the characters as well as the actions they undertake.The movie's style is the one that makes it unique, but that may also be its weakness. There are several scenes that are perhaps a bit slow and there are moments when I felt that the director threw in too many symbols. As for the music, while I generally liked Neil Young's score, I thought that it was overused at times and it distracted the viewer from the rest of the film.Leading man Johnny Depp is good here as usual and this is the kind of role that defined his career in the 90's. Even though Depp plays the lead here, it is Gary Farmer's Indian Nobody who acts as the defining character of the movie. It is he who acts as a guide to Blake and prepares him for his journey to the underworld. The film features many big names that make a brief appearance (Robert Mitchum, Gabriel Byrne and John Hurt to mention some), but their characters are developed well enough and fit perfectly into the general atmosphere of the movie."Dead Man" is also an initiation movie, an initiation into death. This is an artsy film, filled with symbols, a film that requires patience from the viewer and its style may not suit every taste. It is one of those movies that need to be watched with an open mind.My rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully twisted western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's "Dead Man" is not your typical western. Filmed entirely in black and white, the film takes on a very mysterious, almost dream-like quality that (along with Neil Young's riveting score) immediately separates it from other films in the genre. Jarmusch also chooses to use fades rather than cuts to move from scene to scene, adding to the impression that the viewer is dreaming.The film has a fantastic cast, most of which make brief but memorable appearances, including: Crispen Glover, John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne, Billy Bob Thornton, and Robert Mitchum. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job at conveying the strangeness of it all and his Native companion, Nobody (played by Gary Farmer), adds to it. Thanks to the performances, the film also employs a very tongue-and-cheek style that works well with the overall tone and adds humor when necessary."Dead Man" is the kind of film where you can't take your eyes off of it because you don't believe it actually got made in the first place. It's very bold in its style and has moments that will make you laugh and moments that will make you cringe and look away. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a different kind of western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another success from Jim Jarmusch. This film is completely different from most westerns, because it does not have the typical heroic sheriff getting the bad guys plot. This is different. It does not glamorize the Old West, instead portraying it as how it really was. It also contains an All-Star cast, music that, until the last 1/4th of the film, is effective and some great performances. Gary Farmer shines as the Indian Nobody who helps Depp after a double murder. The last shot though is very good and is memorable. This should be seen by Jarmusch fans and those who are sick of mundane, clichéd John Wayne westerns.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pat yourselves on the back, William Blake &amp; Jarmusche fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dead Man' has a great cast, plenty of hilarious moments, a bunch of references and symbolism with regards to the actual William Blake, and is a wholly original enterprise. Although the film starts out seemingly with the intent to tell a story in the traditional sense, a third of the way through it becomes some kind of art-house comedy/philosophy film, full of references and symbols which will be boring and meaningless to a lot of people watching it based upon its popular and positive reputation. This is fine, but be forewarned -- there is something of a select audience for the subject matter. The second half of the film has symbols, not literal characters.I found the soundtrack by Neil Young interesting at first, but by the second half of the film, Jarmusche relies on it way too much, and fills the film with empty scenes set to droning, meandering solo guitar chords. The aesthetic of the guitar sound works, but the music becomes very monotonous. Given Jarmusche's symbolic approach to old-west America, interspersed with references to Blake's own poetic reflections on the time, a much better musical choice would have been someone like John Fahey or Leo Kottke -- seasoned, well-known folk musicians long since acquainted with old American steel-string music.Johnny Depp is capable as always, and there is a wonderful supporting cast, including Crispin Glover, whose screen-time is way too short. I liked the first half of the film a great deal, but the second half left me restless and waiting for it to end.6.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Some Are Born to Endless Night" ? William Blake"Your poetry will be written with blood" ? NobodyStrange is the first thing burst into your mind after watching Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man. An eccentric western fabulously filmed in black and white. William Blake (Johnny Depp) is an accountant who is looking for a job in the western job of Machine. When he arrives in Machine he learned that his would- be employer, John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum) has filed the position. Dickinson is the owner of Dickinson Metal Works. He is a man with a gun always stuck in his hands and yelling at a stuffed bear most of the times. Blake, now without job, money and hope, ends up with a former prostitute, named Thel, in bed. Later Thel's Former lover, who happens to be Dickinson's son, came to her house and after some skirmishes, after young Dickinson killed Thel, Blake gun down him and run away. Dickinson hires three Savage bounty hunters to bring Blake, dead or alive, back. Meanwhile Blake befriends an Indian named Nobody. From here to the end, the movie shows us chasing of Blake and Nobody by three bounty hunters. *** The movie is full of the scenes of killing and shooting, still totally different with new violent movies. Jarmusch portrays savagery suffered by Indians in America, but never over-sentimentalized their depiction. Jarmusch's mirror like representation of the town of Machine and where Indians live, unlike his story telling, is full of details. *** At the beginning of the Blake's journey, where he sits in the train, a man asks him where he is going. He answers "town of Machine". "That is the end of the line." replies back the man. Does Jarmusch mean as machines dominates the life of humans, their life come closer to an end? Dead Man is the story of a lost innocence. It shows how a simple man who even does not now how to use a gun, learns how to speak through a gun. That's where bullet replaces tongue, metal replaces humans. *** Robby Muller's black and white cinematography is distinctive. Neil Young's enigmatic score is pleasant and a good companion to the movie. Cast's, specially Depp's, performance is impressive. ***Jarmusch is one of the most notable figures of American independent cinema. Jonathan Rosenbaum, American critic, describes him as a more citizen of the world rather than an ordinary American director. Dead Man is probably his best feature. http://incl-ahmadi.blogspot.com/2008/06/speaking-through-weapon.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spirit-World Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jarmusch takes us on the surreal, unreal journey of accountant come legend William Blake, who is mistaken for the famous English poet by a Red Indian while on the run from the law and bounty hunters. "Nobody" sees it as his solemn duty to guide Blake through his spiritual voyage from green clerk to phenomenal killer of white men.Writer/director Jarmusch defies convention, especially in this genre, yet the movie defies logic by becoming a faxcinating work. The plot easily draws you in with its meandering story and bizarre characters, only losing its grip on the odd occasion.Depp seems a natural for this part, playing first the bewildered, out of his league Cleveland man, and then the entranced, hauntingly focused assassin. Support comes from a plethora of impressive talent (Gary Farmer, John Hurt, Lance Henrikson, Gabriel Byrne, Crispin Glover, Iggy Pop and Robert Mitchum), but this is Depp's pic. Accompanying him throughout is Neil Young's fantastic guitar score, the perfect anthem for this wandering anti-hero.Jarmusch denies the audience a classic ending, but after careful consideration, the finale is the only one fit to close this spirit-world journey. The black and white cinematography was the final masterstroke, giving the perfect contrast to this piece. Not for everyone!Saturday, January 10, 1998 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Blake goes gentle into that good night...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp dismisses Dylan Thomas' plea for a 'rage against the dying light' in Jim Jarmusch's author statement 'Dead Man'. Supported by Gabriel Byrne (in a short but memorable role), John Hurt (ditto) and other cast surprises (among who Iggy Pop and Alfred Molina), Depp manages to drag us into a sinister, yet somehow comforting dreamworld, accompanied by a Native American only known as 'Nobody'. Do not underestimate the value of characters' names in intelligent cinema, a picture may be worth a thousand words but in this case the characters' names are worth books. Many different theories can be derived directly from this curious name, most of whom indicate that the man is not a physical entity. And a lot of arguments support that theory, but it wouldn't be good indie if there wasn't some confusion, contradictions and just plain weirdness. I have not had the pleasure of encountering Jarmush's work before (there goes my intellectual weight), but only based on this, I do not shy away from comparisons to poetic greats such as Terrence Malick or Wim Wenders.All this praise aside, I must remark that it's in no way easy accessible cinema, but a very rewarding hypnotic trip, 'Dead Man' is worth more than one look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't talk much about this movie without giving away spoilers--it grabbed me almost right away, and I hung on through all of it, wondering where it was taking me, hoping against hope for a happy ending (ande I'm still not sure even now if it was or wasn't), and enjoying the sly comedic bits in between. If you don't listen carefully to the dialog of the mountain men, in the background, you'll miss half the humor.Go into this movie without expectations, and you'll be happily surprised, I think.

		<shortDescription>Metaphysical meandering...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a genre, the Western has always had great potential; potential, unfortunately, that has rarely been fully realized. DEAD MAN happens to be one of the exceptions to the foregoing rule. While the film unfolds in a more or less "traditional" manner (the tenderfoot arrives in The West and quickly comes to realize that The West ain't The East), it's the permutations that matter most: what have become over the years accepted, "traditional" tropes, become, here, something probably more akin to what inspired them- sans the legends. These cross-dressing and cannibal cowboys ("Crazy white men," as Depp's traveling companion so often says) ring uncomfortably true. (As anyone familiar with the axploits of "Liver-eatin' Johnson" can attest...) (And the movie made based thereupon- JEREMIAH JOHNSON, with Robert Redford- is no doubt infinitely more palatable, especially for, uh, mass consumption, whitewashed than told true-to-life- as RAVENOUS would later make clear.) DEAD MAN pushes the boundaries, and it does so with a good dose of humor throughout. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to explain, but I love this movie. The first time that I watched it I became a Johnny Depp fan. He has yet to disappoint, the man knows how to perform on film. The movie does a great job of suggesting a spiritual journey. A mild mannered accountant from Cleveland ventures out west and spends the rest of the film dieing. And before he checks out he affects quite a few varied characters along the way. Most of them end up just like him, dieing. Check out Billy Bob Thornton as a salty camper, "by God I'm hit"! It cracks me up every time. And Gary Farmer as Nobody. That is one of my favorite screen characters of all time. He is perfect as the spiritual companion of William Blake. Check this movie out, I think you'll find something about it to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're tired of typical Hollywood Trash and would like a movie with a truly surreal aesthetic, then pick this up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now let me start by pointing out that my score of 10/10 merely refers to the fact that it is my favorite movie, the only one ever to receive such a score from me. This movie is not for everyone. But if you feel like picking up a movie that will take you on a strange, surreal adventure through the fictional account of the (perhaps) alternate life of English poet and painter William Blake then it just might be for you. Without giving too much away, the story on the surface revolves around Johnny Depp's character getting involved in the accidental killing of two people. Someone related to those people puts out a bounty on his dead. And so his journey ensues, a goofy-looking accountant on the run from the law, three bounty hunters and many others along the way. This movie has some action and some humor, but the best part of the movie is the unique characters and the wide range of dialogue that occurs between these characters. There is some really good cinematography and some stunning visuals. To me this is a total package because it offers superb acting, great characters, a realistic approach to an otherwise unrealistic situation, some good action scenes to keep the movie going, the most entertaining and engaging dialogue (easily rivaling Tarantino's films) and two stories: one that sits at the surface, and one that hides beneath the murky waters. I have seen this movie several times now and each time I watch it I learn something new. (for a really good assessment of the movie if you need some clarity after viewing it look through the user comments for a review called soul western by federovsky.) In closing, I happened upon this movie at the MTC and picked it up on a whim. I had never heard of it. To my recollection this was never really a widely screened movie. Now I know why. It is very different from the stuff most people have to expect and even prefer in blockbusters today. But if you already hate that trash and like films that explore more than just CG animations, or you are willing to unlearn what you have learned...then do yourself a favor and pick the movie up as soon as you can. (btw its a western in b&amp;w but it was made in '95)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man-1995: A lyrical, episodic trip into the weird, weird West of Jim Jarmusch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are great directors like Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese and others; then there are mainstream professionals like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg et al; and, of course, auteurs like Terence Malick, David Lynch, the Cohen Brothers and a few more...And then there's Jim Jarmusch.There's nobody quite like Jim Jarmusch. Who can forget Stranger than paradise (1982), Down by Law (1986), Night on Earth (1991) and, most recently (for me), Ghost Dog (1999)? I rate Dead Man as his most lyrical, most poetic ? a metaphor for the river of life that we all undertake against our collective will. As soon as we are born, we begin to die, regardless of what, how, when or why we do what we do. It just happens to some sooner rather than later, and along the way, we learn who we really are.Enter a modern day William Blake (Johnny Depp), who falls afoul of a half-crazed industrialist Out West, John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum, in his last appearance), thus forcing Blake to go the run, after "accidently" killing Dickinson's son, Charlie (Gabriel Byrne). I say "accidently" but it's a little bit more involved than that. Suffice to say that Blake was at the wrong place at the wrong time...That escape by Blake enrages Dickinson, understandably, into enlisting the services of three of the West's worst killers to go after Blake and kill him. In a tongue-in-cheek send-up of the hit-man type, Jarmusch cast Lance Henriksen as Cole Wilson, Michael Wilkinson as Conway Twill and Eugene Byrd as Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett ? three disparate men who are desperate to get Blake and reap a large reward. And they hate each other's guts.And so, the chase starts...Johnny Depp looks bemused most of the time, astounded by all the things that are happening to him and, more importantly, finding out more about himself as he discovers how easy it is to kill, something that he'd never done before coming Out West. As the chase continues, he meets an eccentric Indian called Nobody (Gary Farmer), who sees Blake as a reincarnation of the poet of old ? and thus regards him as already dead. Blake is in turn accosted by a rabid hillbilly threesome (Iggy Pop, Jared Harris and Billy Bob Thornton) whom Blake is forced to kill and, later, must also defend himself against two US marshals who want to kill him also and collect the reward. The irony is that Blake is arguably innocent of the original crime with which he has been accused.Like many people in life, however, Blake reaches a point of departure from his old self: circumstances dictate that he must act in certain ways in order to survive. Only, in this case, it's a complete reversal of his core beliefs in truth, justice and compassion for others. Everything is stark black as white, and not only the actual film: there is no middle ground. Kill or be killed...The soundtrack is simply symphonic ? a sole electric guitar (most of the time) as you've never heard one before: a resounding tour-de-force that can send chills along your spine. The attraction of the film would have been very different without that music; indeed, far less of a movie.The script is powerful and funny at the same time, as only Jarmusch can do; the cast is superb, even the brief appearances of Gabriel Byrne, John Hurt and others; the landscape and forests almost ethereal, dreamlike, deathlike.There are some truly horrific scenes that are not suitable for young people; when you see this film, you'll know them when you see them.For adults, however, if you want to see the West through Jarmusch's eyes, this is for you. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man: A journey into the American Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man (May 1996) Director and Writer: Jim Jarmusch Country: USA Genre: Western/Drama Starring: Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer, Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, Eugene Byrd, Mili Avital, Iggy Pop, Crispin Glover, Billy Bob Thornton, Gabrial Byrne, John Hurt Music: Neil Young MPAA Rating: R Running Time:121 minutes U.S. Box Office: $1,053,518The film 'Dead Man' written and directed by Jim Jarmusch and staring Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer and Crispin Glover was released in May 1996 and distributed by 'Miramax Films' in the United States. The film is in the western genre and is about an accountant called William Blake who travels America's western frontiers during the mid 19th century. Even though the film has some interesting observations about the American way of life in the west during the ninetieth century, it was not well received by audiences and grossed a disappointing $1.05 million which is well below what Hollywood studios are used to.The film starts with Johnny Depp playing William Blake traveling in a train from Cleveland to the Wild West in order to fill out an accountant position at a firm which offered him the position. When he arrives he finds out that the position has already been filled and before he knows it he finds himself in a heap of trouble when he kills the son of the wealthy businessman who sought to hire him. He hastily runs away to the wilderness where he is helped by an Indian who calls himself 'Nobody'. During the remainder of the film Blake and his new Indian friend go through the wilderness of the Wild West hunted by the three ruthless hired assassins. During the course of the journey Blake transforms into the villain everyone perceives him to be by killing 'white people' along his route. Killing for him keeps getting easier so as near the end of the movie he is totally unmoved by the value of human life. This behavior is encouraged by his Indian friend who bizarrely believes that he is the spirit of the famous poet 'William Blake' who has come back to kill the 'white people'.The film which is shot in black and white has some of the same dreamlike like qualities as 'Apocalypse Now' which was made by Francis Ford Capolla about the Vietnam conflict. Jarmusch's film however has a humorous and even sarcastic look at the Wild West to a point where the audience feels the movie is a fantasized story used only to deliver the directors critical opinion on the American way of like in the Wild West. The downside to this is that half way through the film the audience does not care about the characters anymore, knowing the thin humorous story is only an attempt to convey some other important and serious facts.Jarmusch points to the savagery and moral bankruptcy of the Wild West in the 'Dead Man'. In one of the opening scenes the main character walks through the filthy streets of a western city where he sees coffins being made (an indication to the sheer number of people who get killed) and animal skulls being sold for decoration in a dark and depressing environment. People are so pre-occupied with violence and killing that even the main character which did not know how to shoot just a couple of days ago turns into a killer. The only thing people seem to care about in Jarmusch's illustration of the Wild West is tobacco so much that the phrase "Do you have any tobacco?" gets repeated countless of times in the movie. As the movie progresses and William Blake the main character gets closer and closer to death, he gets more lost in his search for his identity and his goals to the extent where near the end of the movie he does not seem to care about anything even dying anymore. One might point that this the directors way of illustrating the emptiness of the American society at the time and also the uncertainty of human existence. The director also takes subtle shots at organized religion throughout the film especially more so in a scene where a very religious salesperson is presented as a zealot and racist. A criticism which can be made to Jarmusch's film is the rather slow pace of the movie. With a runtime of 2 hours, some scenes are slow and even boring to some extent. This could have been fixed with better editing. The music of the film by Neil Young's is a blend of acoustic and electric guitar. It suits the atmosphere of the film pretty well however after a while it gets a bit repetitive and even irritating at times. Credit can be given to the cast for an inspiring performance especially to Johnny Depp who masterfully plays the transformation of the main character in a convincing manner and to Gary Farmer who portrays the mysterious Indian called 'Nobody'. In conclusion the 'Dead Man' written and directed by Jim Jarmusch and staring Johnny Depp is a rather quirky black and white film with some interesting observations about life in 19th century Wild West America. Even though the film is a bit puzzling and slow paced at times it will definitely be worth while for people interested in the history and culture of America. However if you are looking for a movie to watch with your family on a Saturday night with your take out food then this movie is not for you. What this movie is sure to accomplish is thought and discussion and hopefully new insights on the nature and tendencies of 19th century Americans living in the west and even to some extent on the contemporary American culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film. I had seen a lot of movies by Jim Jarmusch before this one, and I certainly didn't think he had it in him to make what may be the last truly great western, but that's what this is. Johnny Depp is a nerdy accountant that slowly becomes a "legendary" outlaw in this hyper-genre film, that also features Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, and in a truly iconic role, Robert Mitchum.The plot is allegorical. The cinemotogrophys is always top-notch. The score, by Neal Young, is both modern, and still western. (It's like a minimalist Ennio Morriconne!) Everything about this movie clicks in to place in a way movies normally don't click in to place...which is what you should expect from a Jim Jarmusch film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie - loved it. From the opening credits (the Dead Man bones breaking apart), the music by Neil Young which really gave it that uneasy - not sure if your awake or dreaming feel, the great cast of characters along with the black and white of the film and the great writing for ALL characters. Put all these things together and you have what I think is some of the finest work by Jarmusch and Depp. Now don't get me wrong, this movie is not for everyone. It may be kind of slow for some people and you really have to pay attention to what everyone is saying to absorb the whole story. But if you like films that make you think and are visually beautiful than you should give this movie a shot, if anything just to say you've seen it.The only thing that I am still puzzled by is what the whole "do you have any tobacco"/"I don't smoke" thing is supposed to mean.

		<fullReview>Definitely not your average Western, although has bursts of tremendous creativity. Presented completely in black and white, the viewer knows there is something different about this film.Soundtrack a real event for Neil Young fans, but others might find the single guitar without vocals a little jarring.One brief scene with promiscuity not central to the plot. Several violent scenes, but only a handful, especially compared to normal fare. Contains the last cinema appearance of Robert Mitchum. Other notable stars behind Johnny Depp, who is deep and innocent. "Nobody" not completely believable as an Indian, but his fascination with William Blake redeems him.All in all, a very creative effort in which viewers will find no middle ground. One either likes Dead Man or does not see the finish. Soundtack is a must for Neil Young fans. A wide range of sounds, some grinding, others floating, add greatly to the scenes or the scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some I have spoken with have disliked this film on the grounds that it has "no point", or that it "goes on forever" without "saying anything". Wrong.This film is a masterpiece. Jarmusch has created a film that all other "indie" (yay for sarcastic quotations... and parenthetical statements!) filmmakers should aspire to. *Next paragraph COULD be a spoiler to somebody, don't know who, but just in case*The film is not simply "a waste of two hours", but is a study of characters in an admittedly fantastical setting. You witness the progression of personality of William Blake (played mysteriously by Johnny Depp) from an uptight, naive young man in a new world to a killer and a famed outlaw. It makes you think about what the proper circumstances can do to even the most unlikely people.There are no bad performances in the film, and several surprisingly good ones (see Iggy Pop). The cinematography is downright... amazing. Black and white landscapes of the west are the backdrop to drastic actions. A similar juxtaposition of beauty and primal behavior is used in Brokeback Mountain the BEST movie of 2005.I have to say though, if you are looking for a film that doesn't require any thought, this ain't your bag.</fullReview>

' What are you looking at man ? ' that guy would have shot his head off if he hadn't looked away while the guy got on with his business. reminded me a little of my native Liverpool UK where it's not to wise to look people in the face as they approach...in summary this must be one of the most underrated movies i have seen. i guess Depp only has one like this in his locker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>although i'm sure there is a good amount of people that have seen it by now, i first saw this movie less than a year after it came out. this has to be one of the best made and most original films i have ever seen. we need to get the word out, this movie should be seen by ANYONE in film-making school for it's technical work, and everyone else for the sheer fact that you wont find a movie like this without it feeling forced. most indie films, especially now, feel like they try to hard to be an "indie" film. johnny depp does a very good job in his role (as always) where this jim jaramusch guy got the ideas for this film, i have no idea. and here's an original concept- the cameos aren't to fill the film with stars, they are actually excellently cast into there roles. i wont go into any detail about the plot, or explain what i think the movie means. instead, see it for yourself, make your own opinions...but i promise this: u will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one thing I dislike about the movie is that anybody can go to any message board and write pointless comments like "the worst movie ever", "this is bad".Where the damn evidences that the movie is bad?! Sean Hooks constructed the whole comment out of word "bad" here, never providing at least one evidence that the movie is actually bad. He "has seen A LOT", so it means that he's virtually the best critic ever and he is the one who has a right word about the movie?Perhaps the problem is that the film is too perfect for some people. I mean how can you like it if you don't understand damn thing about the movie?ps I join everybody who thinks Dead Man is one of the greatest movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey towards death- where a new life begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the way from Cleveland to the end of the railway line town called Machine, William Blake (Johnny Depp) embarks on a journey to the far West for an accountant job which has been offered to him. After a long train ride, he realises that he is one month late and the company has already employed a new accountant. Blake then meets a saloon girl and later, for self-defence, shoots dead her lover (Gabriel Byrne) and himself is also wounded, the woman being gunned down by her lover as well. While escaping, Blake meets a Native American named Nobody (Gary Farmer), an outcast who has been transported from one place to another since boyhood and eventually is shipped to England where he is educated- and for one moment he believes that Blake is the dead English poet of the same name. The dead man happens to be the son of the boss of the company which has turned Blake down, and now he has hired three most notorious killers to find Blake, dead or alive.Now Blake is going through an amazing transformation- an Easterner who turns into the hunted, a serial killer (for self-defence purposes) and an explorer of the dead poet's poetry. Meanwhile, Nobody is about to show Blake a spiritual world, where all spirits dwell.It is an awesome idea to shoot this film in black and white as this adds much more to the ambience. Johnny Depp is just spectacular and so is the rest of the cast. Perhaps this movie should be re-entitled 'Dead Men', since there are several of them. Still, the story focuses on the life (and the eventual death) of William Blake, so maybe it is appropriate to call it 'Dead Man'. This movie is about one man's adventure and a whole new world that awaits him. 'Dead Man' is atmospheric, mysterious and inspiring. This is a journey many would wish to be on. This flick is almost flawless. I remember after seeing it in the cinema, I rushed down to the box office, bought a ticket and rushed back to see it again. Own the video.And the soundtrack is VERY, VERY impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the walk to death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man sees William Blake descend into death, inch by surreal inch in Jarmusch's finest work. The story sees Johnny Depp, as Blake, embark on a journey that is embedded with physical pain in frighteningly real, and at times hilarious scenarios. The setting, the sound, the vivid and authentic characters he encounters during his journey into the black subtly suggest that Blake has been dead for the duration of the film, and this is his journey to the other side. With a cast that includes Depp, Billy Bob Thornton, Crispin Glover, Robert Mitchum, Alfred Molina, and several others, this is one of the best films in the past 30 years; the ensemble cast, brilliant cinematagraphy, epic score, and poetic direction of Jarmusch confirms that film can indeed transcend into the realm of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>death of the dead man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie a few times cos'it's one of my favourite ones. Though it's past a little time since I saw it the last time I can remember one thing. The athmosphere, I adore it, you don't have to seek for deeper meaning cos' the atmosphere is enough. You are floating like on a cloud of dreams. And I thought: that's about death, something mystyc but utterly absorbing. Not scary at all. It's about growing, growing in the deepest parts of the soul which you didn't know that exist. And the end in itself so poetic, beautiful and dreamlike, you loose all the fears.I recommend the film to all lovers of surrealism, art, William Blake, native Americans, Neil Young and Jim Jarmusch. And of course not to forget Johnny. I think this is his gratest role so far. Dead man is a film I could watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a Black Comedy. It is packed with cameo appearances by some of the best actors still living, from Billy Bob Thornton to Robert Mitchum, it is not for the faint of heart or the run of the mill "shoot um up" fan. It is also packed with puns, both literary and social. You will notice that William Blake kills Charles Dickens in the first few minutes of the film. Almost every character is a parody of western cliché characters. Lance Henriksen as Cole Wilson is parodying every gun fighter he has had to play over the years. I would have to say this movie was closer to `Heart of Darkness' or `Apocalypse Now ` than a `spiritual journey' movie. But it is still basically a comedy. If you like it the closest movies I can think of would be 1. `Unforgiven' 2. `Ride Beyond Vengeance' and 3. `The Shooting'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite enjoyed watching this film, although I did have my reservations beforehand. The black and white format added to the creativity of the film, great idea. Just the right touch to set the scene to the right mood and deliver a concept of doom and gloom.Johnny Depp did a fine job in the title role as William Blake a young man wanting to start a new life for himself. He travels hundreds of miles to a strange town (Machine) in the far reaches of the wild west. With no job, money or friend he must think what to do, how will he survive in a town like this. He ends up being accused of murdering a woman and her ex-fiancé (but, it was only in self-defence, that he shot the guy.)Bounty hunters have been hired to hunt William down (dead or alive). William, escapes from the boundaries of the town, wounded, he stops to rest. An outcast Indian (Nobody) finds him....they share a common ground in more ways than one.'Nobody' helps William Blake on his journey to the spirits of the after-life. My memorable quote would have to be..." did you kill the white man who killed you (asked by Nobody) (William's response)I'm not dead. Slow at times, but well worth watching, my vote 7.5....good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very eccentric art western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's "Dead man" was one of those highly praised Johnny Depp classics I had actually never seen until last week when I saw it on a video store and felt I absolutely must rent it. So, finally I saw it and the experience was truly eccentric. "Dead man" is a stylish, absurd, comical and harsh black and white slow-paced "art western". It's an excellent movie but most of all it's weird. Rock legend Neil Young's glorious and powerful guitar gives the story an incredibly strange atmosphere. "Dead man" raises a question what would we do without these refreshingly different kind of a filmmakers like Jim Jarmusch? People who have a very individual and peculiar style no one can't quite imitate. I admit I liked his more recent effort "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai" more than this one but nevertheless "Dead man" was an impressive work. If you haven't seen it, go for it! Iggy Pop's inconceivable supporting role alone is a reason enough to watch "Dead man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film a bit hard to absorb the first time, but if you pay attention to the details, the story is quite clear. The black and white cinematography adds to the effect of a time past, while the guitar music of Neil Young, a legendary guitarist and musician, provide a soundtrack that fits the persona of the times. Johnny Depp does a fine job at portraying the main character, William Blake, who after selling off all his possessions except the contents of his suitcase, has left his home back east. John Dickinson, portrayed by Robert Mitchum, was in need of an accountant, but through delays, he has missed the job.Events lead Blake to meet Nobody, portrayed by Gary Farmer, an Indian who becomes a friend and helps Blake, while mistaking him for William Blake, the poet.Nobody's quest for tobacco is quite comical, and has it's points in the movie.I really enjoyed this flick, and have seen it many times. I will no doubt sit down and watch it again and again.Pick it up if it's in the rack, turn it on if it's on the tube, but you have to see this one. It's destined to be a cult classic, if it's not already. This is one fine piece of work.Thumbs up here!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very bold and uncompromising movie. Filmed in black and white with a doomed ending, eerie symbolism and mysterious messages a-plenty, it is clearly not your average piece of cinema. It is very weird, and almost nonsensical in parts, but I love this movie. I love Johnny Depp's left-of-centre movie choices, and this is certainly that.For some reason, I love the opening scene between Depp and the extremely under-used Crispin Glover. It makes very little sense, but it sets the tone for the rest of the movie perfectly. Glover's delivery of the line "I wouldn't trust no words written on no piece of paper by no Dickinson from the town of Machine' is eerily prophetic and even disturbing.A different western with wonderful performances from the strangest group of actors assembled together in recent memory. Recommended for film buffs that are not afraid to make their own conclusions, and don't need to have everything spoon-fed to them.</fullReview>

The music by Neil Young is haunting and unforgettable (I even bought the soundtrack) and the cinematography is also totally amazing. Jarmusch has surpassed himself this time. The actors are also great, but what did you expect? I've never seen a Jarmusch movie with bad acting. As for the story... it's strange, but great. Sort of a metaphysical/symbolic western. You'll love it, especially if you're a fan of William Blake, like I am. I don't want to reveal too much, just believe me when I tell you it's brilliant.

		<fullReview>We do not know Depp's character other then vague intonations of past love and need for escape. What is obvious is our character's naivity. An effeminate boy from the north seeking employment in the most exaggeratedly violent wild west ever seen.Westerns as well as science fiction use preconcieved settings and situations to make some of the most potent points about what is going on in the present. I can't help feeling that Dead Man spoke very directly to the evils of disillusionment inherent in the nature of the left coast. Intertwining extreme violence and dreaminess with very modern diologue and gay cowboys makes for a potent mixture that faces many a fresh face heading west with high hopes. Depp's character finally realizes the frontier of an indian spirit world lamenting the destruction of a supposed purity and Nobody the reluctant participant in a world somewhere between. We can feel the burden of a lifetime of sorrow as depp floats off. Mullholland Drive is another masterpiece that concerns itself with the evils inherent in the bussiness of illusion and stardom. Its fantastic that hollywood is still making these true masterpeices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Jarmusch's best, in my opinion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this one about four years ago. It was sitting on the "for sale" rack at a video store and I bought it because I saw it had Billy Bob Thornton in it. I really didn't have a clue that it would turn out to be this good. That night I put it in and was instantly abosrbed in the film's hypnotic, opening train ride. That first scene sets the tone for the whole film. Johnny Depp plays a shy accountant who has just lost his parents. He takes a job offer in some dirt-town, out west called "Machine" and spends most of his inheritence on the journey from Cleveland. As the trip progresses, we see that he is getting farther and farther out of his element. The sequence lasts five minutes or so, and by the time the opening credits start to roll, you're in the mood for the rest of the movie. This is largely due to Neil Young's strong guitar score. Without that, I'm sure the movie would've had a much different feel. I'm not going to give away much as far as plot, but this is one of those movies that you would be much better off watching on your own. Don't go into it with a bunch of buddies, at least not on your first viewing. It also needs to be said that this movie will demand multiple viewings. Most people will get it the first time but there is still more to be seen. Before Dead Man, I wasn't too familiar with Jim Jarmusch's other work. All I knew him from was the Frosty Cream Boy in Sling Blade. The guy is a total genius and I went on too track down every one of his movies. If you want a movie that's really going to make you think, pick up anything by this guy. If you like this one, get "Down By Law".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp stars as the wanderer William Blake, who travels to a town far far way, in hope of finding a job. But all he finds is trouble, and soon he´s accused of murder and finds himself hunted by three gunmen, led by the charismatic Lance Henriksen. However, poor Blake gets guided by a mysterious Indian, who has a theory about why Blake actually is there.Jim Jarmuch´s western is certainly one-of-a-kind. It has a lot of black humor and strange situations. But Dead Man is definitely not for all tastes, it´s simply too strange. The pace is mostly slow and the violence is very brutal at times. But if you can put up with that and like these kind of different experiences, this one is for you. Depp shows that he might be the greatest actor of his generation, with a remarkable performance. Lots of familiar faces in smaller roles, like Billy Bob Thornton, John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne and rock star Iggy Pop, to name a few. And the film´s score, by Neil Young, is great and fits the black and white pictures very well.In short, a good but rather slow western, with a poetic kind of feeling to it. * * * ? out of * * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've scanned/read thru the comments on this movie before posting my own. They (the comments/reviews) are too eloquent and sophisticated. First, my perspective. I like westerns. I was up early one morning getting my stuff ready to go out, the tv was one, this came on cable, tv, I had never heard of it, didn't know the director's work. As the beginning played, I didn't know what was happening or really paying attention to anything that might have been significant. But it became more riveting to me, and I ended up being late because I wanted to see it through. This is a pretty good movie. Not everyone's taste though. It's symbolic, slyly amusing, historical and there are details that have to be paid attention to. Speaking of which, I have to comment on the comments by "Air-head", uh, "Air-man", oh, Aiman is it? Well, opinions to all those in existence.But --- "So you keep watching, bored out of your skull. Trying to anticipate a moment when suddenly the movie might surprise you and make sense of the hours of meaningless footage. That perhaps the film-maker is up to something clever and innovative" ---.Huh?!? Well okay, my wife dis-likes westerns and finds them particularly boring too. I can understand that part. But "meaning-less footage"? Well okay, if you're not american, than "old west" based movies might seem meaning-less. But then, life is life all over the globe. And you don't have to be american to glimpse evidense of "ethnic dis-placement", ravaging of natural re-sources and the like.I rate it better than "Josey Wales" and right up there with "Clearcut".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And the music was great, too. Depp portrays the character of a dead man walking. No future, no past that matters and no friendship that can last. We watch him fall into a despair that is as relentless as it is cruel. The soundtrack by Neil Young is as deeply touching as the performances by Depp, Henriksen and Farmer. Superb cinematography and settings follow the character as he finds a surprise behind every tree. His callousness was built by circumstances and it finds him in the end. This is another fine acting job by Depp who seems to take on the odd character, just like Henriksen, who is equally good in this black western. Nobody was the only one who knew what was happening, and he wasn't telling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that this is one of my favorite Johnny Depp movies. Every movie I see him in gives me a new appreciation and perspective of his work.While it is under the category 'Western', I don't think it can be really defined into a single category, it is just amazing.Everything in this movie fit together perfectly, the black and white color, the absolutely amazing music by Neil Young, the editing of scene to scene, and the placid feel of every scene, even if it has violence. Many of the scenes, mostly the ones with the main character, William, have a sort of mist over them that I can't explain, and some of the more artistic scenes just swallow you whole, you get so deep in it. The whole movie is like some ethereal, intangible dream. The way the main character evolves is interesting, very Jeremiah Johnson of sorts. It is so capturing, you can't believe how it ends and the fact that it is over when it does happen, it is simply incredible.It is not a movie for everyone, it has a very underground, indie-type feel that I love. If you have any scope, or any ounce of love for Johnny Depp's astonishing acting ability, you have to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unrecognized masterpeice... One of the best westrens of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I have rented it many times and I enjoy the hell out of it everytime. The film is a masterpiece in every way. The camera work is stunning. Every shot is a picture worth framing on a wall. Johnny Depp is cast perfectly in his role as William Blake ( Yes, like the poet). Gary Farmer was unforgettable as Nobody-- the strange Indian who helps William Blake. The Villians of the film are unique to say the least..... especially for a western This is a quite movie as a whole. The script is great though there isn't a lot of talking for the most part. Neil Diamond fills in the silence with short little guitar pieces. Wacth this movie several times to fully understand it. It is surreal and prophetic thoughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An oddball quest film, a mood piece, a hypnotic meditation on life and death (mostly death), this country's morally questionable, mythologized origins and the conventions of the Western movie genre in general - I was spellbound. It's hysterical to read the clueless, dismissive reviews of mainstream critics like Roger Ebert, USA Today and the Washington Post. (Ebert in particular - he describes Neil Young's perfectly spare, brilliant score as sounding like someone who keeps dropping their guitar. Uh, right. Always keep in mind that this is a man who panned the American comedy classic RAISING ARIZONA. A sense of humor and appreciation of music have never been his strong points.)A lot like ERASERHEAD in the Old West (but warmer and more accessible) it has the qualities of a strangely beautiful, vivid nightmare. Most striking is the way violence is depicted - as sudden, matter of fact, remote and inevitable. I've never seen it shown quite this way ever before. Most memorable is the scene where Johnny Depp (in another effortlessly pitch perfect performance of the sort he always seems to deliver when he avoids Hollywood garbage like NICK OF TIME or THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE) is wounded by some mysterious, out of focus gunman. His Indian friend and guide Nobody (unforgettably played by an actor named Gary Farmer) wanders over, completely nonplussed and remarks "Ah, William Blake, looks like you found some more of white man's metal." Depp's deadpan response is priceless. The comic and dramatic interplay between these two is pure magic.Can't say enough good things about this movie. Existentialism is tough to pull off in film, but the director Jarmusch is like a mechanic tinkering around with the medium, tightening here, loosening there - what he ultimately creates is close to genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So beautiful on earth but only an image of the real thing (the afterlife). DEAD MAN shows a clashing of philosophies: bettering your body for life on Earth, or bettering your soul for the hereafter. The movie is stark because life in 19th century West was hard and violent. The movie is slow because we are seeing through Bill Blake's delirium. We see Bill Blake's life as a passage and the succeeding scenes as ruminations on life. If you were dying, wouldn't you realize senselessness of racism, hate, greed and violence as unimportant and tragic trappings? Thus, Blake's voyage thusts him into the world violent world, weak and feeble. As innocent as the dead fawn he nuzzles against, he is a victim only in the sense that he has foregone the armor of the life he left and it is this past life -- the people, the immorality, the indifference -- that kills him. But Blake's journey is a journey of life, and it is truly Nobody who ensures reaching the final destination. DEAD MAN is a movie that finds death in life -- and life in dying.

		<shortDescription>Unlike any other film I know of...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...in its attempt to wrestle with the most basic metaphors of life and death, of creation and destruction, in a world with no apparent order. Just for ATTEMPTING these things, while staying within the constraints of a perfectly enjoyable narrative film, I think, is commendable in its own regard.But that it succeeeds so well as both a fun and exciting film to watch, AND as a literate and philosophical rumination on: life vs. death, creation vs. destruction, culture vs. culture, purposefulness vs. meaninglessness... well, what can I say?!? This movie is something that I have to rent every now and again just to think about!Despite the heavy literate subtexts stroking my intellect, this movie would be nothing without the great scene-chewing acting from Robert Mitchum and Iggy Pop, the balanced and sensitive star turns by Depp and Farmer, other memorable supporting characters, a host of great one-liners (some of them nabbed from the poet himself!), and a score that will haunt you. It's just such an enjoyable "movie" that I don't want to give any readers the wrong idea, that it's for even one second heavy-handed or dull.And I must confess that I actually don't particularly like the director, Jim Jarmusch's, other works. I can't usually find the sort of moral or philosophical statements (even perverse ones) that, I think, mark great films like "Casablanca," "Vertigo," or even "The Empire Strikes Back." Sure, his movies are very "cool", but they aren't very critical (I recommend the cutting&amp;cool Todd Haynes or Spike Lee for contemporary comparison) and I don't usually feel like they've changed me in any meaningful way. But, obviously, he poured his soul into this one, and I truly believe it paid off. This is one of those great works of art that has managed to change and reaffirm parts of my very faith and understanding of life. Thank you Jim Jarmusch! You go ahead and stay cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated film of the 1990's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, along with virtually all those who I know, never had the chance to view Dead Man in the theaters during it's very brief run (less than 10 days).Jim Jarmusch is arguably the greatest filmmaker of his generation (contemporaries being Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson). And, judging by his track record of films, some of films most phenomenal talent has worked with him, from Tom Waits to Robert Mitchum. There are virtually no 'holes' in the acting talent on this film alone.This doesn't describe the film, of course. And like most films, you have to see it to appreciate it. The movie begins in an almost existential nightmare. By the end of the film, it has reached such an intense state of beauty. You have laughed, been disgusted by gore, thought about your own life, and in general you have a much greater connection to your own mortality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time on t.v. at Christmas. Being an avid Depp fan I grabbed the opportunity to spend a couple of hours in his company - and what a couple of hours it turned out to be. At the end of the movie I felt dazed and strangely ethereal, as if I had ridden alongside William Blake and Nobody on their strange journey to the other side. The black and white photography only added to the sense of doom surrounding the central character. I have watched this movie several times now and each time I feel I am falling deeper into the abyss. Depp as always was superb as Blake, the camera truly loves his beautiful features, seeming all the more delicate and vulnerable in these hostile and threatening surroundings. Blake's journey is wholly believable, He becomes entangled in this downward spiral and one realises that he has been the Deadman of the title from the moment that he alighted from that train at the start of the film. Wonderful cameos from stars too numerous to mention. Probably my favourite Depp movie and it just keeps getting better every time I see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dead Man, Jim Jarmusch's first foray into period filmmaking (and a Western, no less), is a haunting, harrowing journey that demands patience and intelligence from its audience -- criteria that will undoubtedly frustrate and confound the mainstream. Featuring stunning black and white cinematography from the amazing Robby Muller, Dead Man bears the hallmarks of Jarmusch's absurd wit, but also seriously considers our notions of death and the process of dying. So many critics seemed to complain about the film's outwardly lethargic pacing, but I thought Jarmusch made all the right moves in his careful, unhurried, deliberation. The performances are thoroughly superb, with Depp and Farmer the two standouts as the doomed William Blake and his iconoclastic guide Nobody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetry written in blood. A brilliant film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My fiancee hated this movie. Now every time we are out together and talking about movies, she tells people about an incredibly boring movie we saw together. Needless to say, I have a much different opinion about this Jim Jarmusch film.Set in the second half of the nineteenth century, this film stars Johnnie Depp as William Blake, an accountant from Cleveland. Travelling out west to start a new job he arrives to find the job has already been given to another man. Nearly broke he meets an ex-prostitute. A shoot out ensues with her (former?) fiance Charlie, played by Gabriel Byrne, in which she and Charlie are killed, while Blake is wounded.Making his escape, he is pursued by three killers hired by Charlie's father (Robert Mitchum in a great cameo). On the run and wounded, Blake meets up with a wandering indian, Nobody. Nobody was schooled in England and is a great admirer of the poetry of William Blake. Mistaking the two Blakes, Nobody travels with Blake, wondering why he knows so little of his own poetry.The movie is, thus, a chase film. But this is not a simple film, and moves more like Portrait of a Lady than The Fugitive. Oddly poetic, filled with allusions and illusions, it is a haunting story of a soul chased out of this world and into the next. Leaving a trail of dead behind, Blake and Nobody head for the sea. There, Nobody plans to send Blake to the next world in a sea canoe.In one sense, this is a film about how a single event can destroy a man without his knowing it. And about the terrifying consequences that can result. Having killed Charlie, Blake has been destroyed. He is dead, but his body keeps moving. Having no soul, he wanders across the west with Nobody, killing marshalls and settlers as he goes. As Nobody tells him early on, "now your poetry will be written in blood."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reading some various Buddhist blogs and I came across a recommendation for this movie. A very strong recommendation as in favorite-movies-ever-kind of recommendation. Being a big fan of Johnny Depp, I was surprised I'd never heard of it. Filmed in black and white, William Blake (Depp) takes an endless train ride from Cleveland to Machine in the Southwest. Now I am a fairly literal guy. Well for this movie, I did try a bit to figure out what it is about. Everything I suppose is a metaphor for something. Here are my takes: Long train ride - boring Doesn't get the job - plot device Kills the girl's ex-fiancé - plot device On the run with nothing - boring Scene with Iggy Pop and Billy Bob Thornton - WTF? Dies in canoe - Why did I watch this whole thing?So the scenery/photography was pretty awesome. I am a big Neil Young fan, but I ain't looking to buy this soundtrack any time soon. I did like Nobody, Blake's helper along the way to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artsy western with not much to say, but plenty to show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some viewers will find Dead Man to be pretentious. It uses a very complex method to make a very simple statement, which in this context feels false. The movie's scenario tries to demonstrate how ordinary people become killers. The better way to approach Dead Man is to treat it much more literally. It is essentially a man hunt; very raw, very stripped down, and extremely cold. Considering how closely it seems to mimic the french new wave, I'm drawn to recommend this to art critics, not western lovers. Nevertheless, as a western, Dead Man is unlike anything you've probably seen before. It is unconventional, unpredictable and to a certain extent fascinating. Director Jim Jarmusch wants his viewer to look at the people in this movie with confusion and disorientation. Dead Man is a rare case of a movie that finds effectiveness in being distant. It makes the viewer want to focus, to get closer to the material. We sense that Dead Man has something to hide. The problem is that the closer we get, the more we come to realize that Dead Man doesn't really have much to hide. The movie's weakness is that as an art film doesn't have much to say.Bill Blake, alone in the world, is taking the express from Cleveland out west to work as an accountant for a metal works. When he gets there, he discovers that his job has already been taken. That night he gets drunk, and ends up in bed with the fiancée of the bosses son. He kills them both, and escapes on horseback. Blake finds himself a companion, a lone native rider, who mistakes him for the poet William Blake and he guides him through the wilderness, while bounty hunters are on their tail.Jarmusch's style is very minimalist. Sound effects, editing, music, bloodshed, and fancy shots are kept to a minimum. He uses a lot of primitive in camera effects for psychological effects (when necessary), and the end of every scene is indicated by a very traditional fade to black. Indeed the picture feels almost paleolithic in appearance, which is Dead Man's best qualityDead Man is distinctive enough to be worth a peak for an open minded movie goer. It is not quite as enriching a story as it probably thinks it is, but I'm glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No review will be able to tell you why you must see "Dead Man" because any honest review won't be able to make sense. But here's my attempt regardless.A western set in the late 1800s, Johnny Depp plays William Blake. "The William Blake?" asks Nobody, the Native American who takes Blake and us on a spiritual journey. Depp may not be The William Blake, the poet, philosopher and artist, but writer/director Jim Jarmusch must almost be his reincarnate. This film has more metaphors, symbolism and imagery from all of Blake's works than one would even deem possible. It will take you on a journey that will leave you speechless and pondering everything you saw and probably for the rest of your life.If anything you read or hear about "Dead Man" leaves you saying 'Huh. I don't get it?' That means you have to see it. Then afterwards you will understand why, even though you probably won't be able to explain it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What name were you given at birth, stupid white man?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's 'Dead Man (1995)' is certainly one of the oddest Westerns you'll ever see. In the nineteenth century, mild-mannered accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) travels to the dregs of the American West, where he kills a man in self-defence, and flees, wounded, on horseback. With bounty-hunters (including a sinister Lance Henriksen) in silent pursuit, Blake is guided through the wilderness by a talkative Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer). Is it a dream? Is it a hallucination? Is it death? Depp's character is frequently mistaken for the poet William Blake (1757-1827), who is undoubtedly dead by the time of the film's setting. Throughout the film, Blake wanders across the drab monochrome landscape, a ghost devoid of all emotion. Depp, in a remarkable shift from the manic energy of his Hunter S. Thompson or Jack Sparrow, underplays the role to such an extent that he's almost not there.Neil Young's anachronistic electric guitar score, like Depp's performance, is low-key, yet it dominates entire scenes of the film. The soundtrack is dark and melancholy, underscoring, above all else, the hopelessness of Blake's plight. Wonderful supporting actors ? Crispin Glover, Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, John Hurt, Robert Mitchum, Gabriel Byrne, Billy Bob Thornton, Alfred Molina ? wander in and out of sight, almost faceless figures without a past or a future. Blake exists in an American West that has stood still, or perhaps one that encompasses all time periods at once (Jarmusch occasionally references twentieth century culture, and some of the acting seems deliberately modern). Perhaps it's my unfamiliarity with the work of both William Blake and Jim Jarmusch, but, as intriguing as I found the film, I felt as though it never really offered enough on which the viewer could get a grasp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead man is a 1995 black and white western directed by Jim Jarmusch. It stars Johnny Depp as William Blake a young disciplined man seeking a job, and Garry Farmer as Nobody, a well educated Indian, Billy Bob Thornton, Robert Michum and many others.The movie starts with William Blake sitting in a neat suit in a train wagon, nodding off every now and then. Every time he wakes up he sees people retrogress in terms of their appearance and behavior. It seems as though there is a direct relationship between the people inside the train and the scenes outside.Blake looks afraid and sees himself in a situation where there's no hope to what's going to happen outside and to the fellow travelers who throw unfriendly looks at him and his bizarre outfit. Almost to the end of the trip the fireman comes and warns him about where his going. William explains that he's got a letter from Mr. Dickinson which offered him to be the accountant of the Dickinson Metal Works. Along their conversation the viewer gets to know that Blake has lost his parents and his girlfriend in Cleveland. They finally arrive at Machine which is the end of the line and according to the fire man: the hell.He manages to get to the Metal Works, where he finds out that his job has been given to another person two months ago. Desperate and tired he goes to a bar where he meets Thel, a flower maker. Thel is a young prostitute and offers to take Blake home; in the morning Thel's fiancé, Charlie, who happens to be Mr. Dickinson's son as well finds them together. He tries to shoot William but Thel throws herself in front of him and is killed,the bullet passes through her chest and plants in William's. William angered and nervous shoots at Charlie three times and finally his third bullet hits he target. He dresses up and hurriedly jumps out of the window and runs away with a horse stamping on all the paper flowers made by Thel. He fells unconscious and when he wakes up he sees an Indian delving into his chest and trying to get the bullet out. The Indian is named Nobody and from this point of the movie he accompanies William who he thinks is "William Blake" the poet. On the other hand Mr. Dickinson hires three professional murderers to find William and his horse which seems to be of greater importance to him. On their way William is obliged to kill many others and gets severely wounded. Nobody takes him to a village and promises to get him a canoe which would take him to the spiritual world where all spirits come from and should go back to. In the final scene William is put into a decorated canoe and sent into the vast ocean. Noboby waves to him and is shot by the last murderer who killed the other two; he shoots back and they both fall dead. The train of life takes William Blake to the purgatory where he could either stay amongst the sinners and go to hell or promote himself to a position where he can be sent to a better place. He seems to have passed everything including his parents, his girl friend and his fortune in his life and started this trip. The letter seems like a weak explanation for his trip; if it had been the true reason to his trip he should have head for Machine two months before. The city is filled with the atmosphere of death with skeletons all over it; even the factory itself seems futile and dead. The only person in the city who was not to stay in that purgatory and by losing her life to save Blake's proceeded to the next level was Thel. She made flowers from paper which were something not even seen once in that wilderness. When she dies a shooting star fades into the dark sky. She's portrayed once again in the movie when William encounters a deerlet shot on the same place as Thel. William feels so attached to it that he mingles his blood with hers and makes a mark on his forehead. The presence of ancient Greek elements in the movie are seen by the appearance of the fireman in the train as the muses. He forecasts what is going to happen to Blake and even portrays his death scene where he looks at the sky and it seems as though it's the sky which is moving not him. The repetition of the word tobacco must have a connotation; in my view the film illustrated two usages of tobacco. First was by the white men who used it as an addiction, and second by Nobody and Thel. Thel wanted it to get ready for her trip but Nobody wanted it to prepare William for his trip. In addition Nobody's intentional misrecognition of "William Blake" and the fact that he takes away Blake's eyeglasses and sells them all remind us of the attributions related to "William Blake " the poet. William Blake was known as a visionary and a mystic; the same which happens to Blake, he sees trees as eyes watching him. It is also said that "William Blake" was not known until his death, in a scene towards the end of the film Nobody cries out a sentence which brings to mind the same concept. He says now everyone will know William Blake, and William Blake is going to be a legend. The film successfully manages to portrait Indians and their rituals, and the diverse ways of life they tend to choose. And it was one of the rare movies in which a white director was so successful in looking at the reality and violence of the west at that time. There are lots of other elements especially ritual and religious ones in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tame and gentile accountant Billy Blake arrives in a town called Machine, during an act of self defence Billy finds himself on the run as an outlaw. Pursued by a trio of gunslingers and facing up to the reality that his name is now famous, Billy is befriended by a spiritual Indian by the name of Nobody, their journey is sure to be a most enlightening one.If you read any plot summary or synopsis you would be forgiven for thinking that Dead Man is a conventional man on the run Western, but if you note from the outset that it's directed by art favourite Jim Jarmusch, then that should immediately steer you away from any thoughts of the normal. Jarmusch clearly has a fascination with death, it's not so much the clue is in the title type thing, it's evident in this story of one mans soul on it's spiritual journey. Blake is aboard a train at the film's commencement, it's crucial to pay attention to proceedings from the very first frame, come the picture's finale you will be rewarded for not only paying attention, but for being on this hypnotically engrossing journey all the way as well.The technical aspects score very high indeed, Jarmusch clearly has a knack for simmering absorbing stories that are dotted with off kilter stabs of humour. Neil Young scores the piece with jolts of electric twangs that feel like ghosts pervading your most peaceful dreams. Yet above all else on the technical front it's Robby Müller's photography that takes the honours, working in black and white he produces a rich and memorable layer of work, absorb the sequences as Billy arrives in Machine, gorgeous. The cast, led by a typically wonderful off beat performance from Johnny Depp, are super, star names come and go as truly great character actors carry the story thru to it's elegiac conclusion. I must also mention the brilliant sound department, for those with home surround cinema the sound work here really comes to the fore, be it an insect in the background or gun shots resounding in your ears, it's a job well done from that department. This was my first viewing of the picture and I'm highly delighted with how it panned out. I feel sure that further viewings will bring other pleasing rewards, It's the sort of film that I perhaps need a bottle of Jack Daniels with, for myself to go into Jarmusch's world. But for now, with all its allegories to death and souls; and fusions with the poet William Blake, I'll be content with hypnotically cool splendour. 8/10</fullReview>

Jim Jarmusch has put a lot of poetry in his film like in Ghost Dog, but in Dead Man he put poetry in all the film and for me that is wonderful because Jarmusch once want to be a poet (thank god that he became filmmaker because is a master). About the actors, well Johnny Deep is just excellent and also the guy who plays like Nobody (sorry fellas, i don't remember his name), for me the others actors well just great and well, we can see them a lot. The music is another aspect that i love in this film, Neil Young is a great guitar player and in this film we can see that because all the music is composed and performance by Neil Young and of course is beautiful the direction of Jarmsuch. About Jim, well he is one of my favorites directors and i love all his films but i have my own three favorites: 1 Night On Earth 2 Mystery Train 3 Coffe and cigarettes Well it's all i have to say about Jim and his Dead Man, please watch this film and please enjoy it like i did.

		<shortDescription>OMG - this movie is genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "Westerns" go, this is a gallery of all the classic stereotypes indigenous to the wild west movies - except the whole thing feels honest, tragic and authentic. Shown entirely in black-and-white, (with a sepia filter for those who know about BW photography) this movie has a novel atmosphere that the whole classic western genre never actually realised. Hence, the story unfolds convincingly, and feels horribly plausible. Our hero William Blake - played by Johnny Depp - is nothing more than a rock rolling down a mountain slope; the climate he has unwittingly fallen into is hostile, chaotic, brutal, cruel and insane. Yet he prevails as a legend - not only to his allies, but also to his enemies. Not bad for a tartan-clad accountant from Cleveland! PS: readers of William Blake's poetry will revel in this movie as a tribute to this writer's life and work - don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All about a descent into hell brought about by a combination of bad choices and circumstances. Johnny Depp's acting, as usual is superb. Crispin Glover is freaky as usual, and was an excellent choice for the conductor.I didn't like this movie the first time I saw it because I was watching it with a friend. Now that I've had a chance to view it alone, I understand it and see it for the masterpiece that it is.Several scenes in the movie are so surrealistic as to warrant seeming out of place. An example might be the man with the prostitute in the alley, but later when seen in the context of the entire movie the scene suddenly integrates itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You must see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can certainly understand why this is a cult classic! I had a hard time finding this DVD to purchase, and the woman at the video store said it took her 2 years to find it. (I think it's easier now). On with the review ... I rated this movie a ten because I have never seen anything quite like it in my 42 years. You can read the plot for yourself, so I won't elaborate. This production is quite unique. The fact that it is in black and white just adds to its charm.Johnny Depp gives a great performance, but the other leading characters are just as fascinating. This is a drama (and dark comedy at its finest). It happens to be Robert Mitchum's final performance before he passed on too. Here are some of the reasons I like it: 1) Every time you watch it (I've seen it 3 times and counting) you'll see something else that you didn't see before.2) It gives a stark historical view into the late 1880s and how people lived. 3) There were many brilliant comedic moments to lighten the mood of this film noire. 4) We can all relate to Johnny Depp's character, who unwittingly digs himself deeper and deeper into a black hole no matter what he does. 5) The way native culture is depicted seems very authentic compared to standard Hollywood fare.6) The symbolism and imagery throughout are incredible. Those who can't find meaning in this film are probably unfamiliar with analyzing literature. It's easy to miss some of the more subtle touches. 7) Neil Young's stripped down musical score throughout fits well with theme of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately unsatisfying but worth seeing for the acting, script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this film. Some people would probably find the movie very slow-moving, but I liked the pace and the lyrical tone. I was a bit antsy during the opening scenes on the train, but then I started getting into the film, sort of the way you might immerse yourself in a hot bath very gradually. Also, the acting was first-rate.I didn't like the constant fades between scenes; they made the movie very choppy and it started getting on my nerves. I also thought it was unrealistic that Blake, an accountant who said he didn't really know how to use a gun, was all of a sudden a crack shot. The ending wasn't particularly satisfying either.Yet I'd still recommend the movie for the quality of the script, direction and acting. I also confess to loving Johnny Depp; I'd probably watch him read the Yellow Pages. Overall, if you don't mind a film where the journey is more interesting than the destination, you'll like this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dead Man" is not like any western that you've seen before. It's not a glorification of pioneers traveling out west, and it's not a direct indictment of our treatment of the Indians. Granted, it portrays the Old West as a pretty ugly place, but the movie almost seems to treat it as a parallel universe. Johnny Depp plays William Blake, who gets hired to be an accountant for a metal company in a town called Machine in 1876. When he arrives in town - after using up all his money - he learns from the corporate CEO (Robert Mitchum) that they've hired someone else. With nowhere to go, Blake hooks up with a woman, only to have her hubby walk in on them and kill her and wound him. Blake kills the guy and has to flee, since it turns out that this guy is the corporate CEO's son (and the CEO is more concerned that Blake stole a horse than that his son got murdered). Out in the open, Blake meets up with an Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer), who calls him "stupid white man". That's when the movie really starts to seem metaphysical.I thought that this movie was OK, although it's definitely not for everyone. It almost seems to have as its main strength a giant cast: Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne, Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, Billy Bob Thornton, and a whole bunch of other people. You might want to check it out, although mind you, you may find it very strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This obscure black and white gem is easily the best and most mature work from the master of obscure black and white gems, Jim Jarmusch. Not only that, but it is easily the most successful black&amp;white American movie of the 90's and featuring one of the most interesting scores ever by Neil Young. It also features some big names, apart from Johnny Depp, including Robert Mitchum (in his last performance and a great career finish), Gabriel Byrne, John Hurt, Michael Wincott, Lance Henriksen, Crispin Glover and Billy Bob Thornton. Come to think of it, most of the cast ARE well known and respected actors, which is a kind of rarity for an underground black&amp;white film.Still, it's Johnny Depp and his partner Gary Farmer who really carry the movie. Farmer stars as Nobody, an Indian who is a sort of an outcast because he has mixed tribal ancestry. His quotes give the film it's poetic depth, most of them William Blake citations. Depp gives a very deep and personal portrayal here and this may be his greatest performance.Jarmusch clearly peaked here, for his next movie, "Ghost Dog", paled in comparison with this one. This is a darkly humorous and enjoyable movie and everybody should see it just because it is one of a kind. The skull-splitting scene is not for the faint hearted though. I had to close my eyes the second time I watched it, and I don't count myself among the faint hearted ones. A very important work whose value and influence will only show stronger with years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's more than a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi guys. I had seen that film two times. I think it's not enough. Dead man it's very greater than a film that you see and forget it. It's a life, I really love it. It was the best film that I ever seen in my life. When the film starts you go trough a place that you never been there. It's so mazing there. Every part of that film includes many parts of philosophic sentences. Maybe one of the lovely part of that film for me is the time that Nobody speaks to Blake about some words that he couldn't feel it. The pace that Nobody speaks about his mixing blood is also so lovely for me. The music is so magical. It so similar to the film. I hope any one has the main part of Dead man &amp; show it to me. I would be happy to have a chance to see that again. Thanks. bye. ~Mojy~.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe just how B &amp; W should be photographed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinematography "spoilers"...I say "maybe" because, for myself, I uphold Orson Welles (cf. -The Trial-) as the standard, and this does vary somewhat from Orson's style. But it may set a standard in its own right. Slightly in the direction of sepia tone, with stark contrasts existing in nearly every frame between pitch black and shiny white. Indeed, there is pitch-black in pretty much every frame where Johnny Depp's hair is in the frame.What, substantively speaking, does the stark B &amp; W photography do in advancing or complementing narrative? My best guess is that throughout essentially the entirety of the movie, William Blake is wandering through a netherworld, a world where he doesn't quite belong. The town of Machine is (and it's quite literally stated) a gateway to hell, where things just aren't quite right or done in any usual way. On the run with a spiritual accompanist (I won't say "guide," since his "advice" is too opaque, the journey is already determined, and he's more a helper along that journey) through the wilderness, his (pitch black) blood continues to seep; graceful movement brings them through bright-white birch trees (one can't help but think there's a nod to -Andrei Rublev- here), and shades-of-black tree branches form a mesh against an off-white sky (nods to the hallucinations of -Jacob's Ladder-?).Those are just some of the highlights. The cinematography is the standout element here; the scoring is take-or-leave, and the storytelling process seems to be on the thin side.After a third viewing over about as many years, I raised my score from 7 to 8 out of 10 (putting it in the top 7% of about 2,000 movies viewed). Well worth checking out, for the visual experience alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intoxicating and powerful music score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this is a movie but I feel mostly like talking about the music score.In the world of movies there is really only a "few" gems that you can pull apart and say "this will be remembered for".Simply put, the music score in this movie is a masterpiece. If I was teaching "Soundtrack 501" in art school I would spend at least entire class on this one.First this is probably the most haunting musicsrore I have ever heard. I loved many but this is totally different, a class of it's own. You can't compare this with a "Moulin Rouge" that was sublime, it's a musical. In Dead Man I think half of the value of the movie comes from the score.It is not only Neil Young's eclectic way of playing the guitar it is also in the way they have used it along in the movie. The first 5 mins. of the movie not a word is spoken, the train is moving and you already have an idea of what's going on. Suddenly you hear that strange "noise" 1-2 seconds, the first sounds of the guitar and it stops...train keeps moving glimpse of this glimpse of thatYou know you're moving from east to west but you don't know why, then first words comes when the always creepy Glover comes in, then you learn a little more, opps another glimpse of young's guitar. Then a little later comes the intro generic and you get the full taste of the music score. I was on tape and I just had to stop and rewind to look at the whole piece again and from then on I was literally begging to hear that music as the film progessed. That was the trick you see, never overused, always in the right place, always in the right dose and tone, totally intoxicating.Some great actors can carry a film on their shoulders by themsleves, here the music score lift this movie to another level and carries it on its "shoulders". I personally found it that powerful. It think that's the word, it's a subtle, sensitive but powerful music score that fills your brain and soul whitout even whitnessing it at first.I didn't even knew at first it was Neil Young's and I remember telling myself; "but who the heck did that, who's that genius".Yes as you can see i was thrown over by it :-)But what about the movie. I liked it too. It's of course different. Some might not like the pace or simingly "simple" story. Some might even say it was "mono-tone" in both sense as it's filmed in black &amp; white and the plot is really always moving on one level only, but again it was the intention and I believed it was well justified.Johnny Depp doesn't always need to be exuberant and here again every piece of this movie is in harmony with its unity, subtle so unless you're blind you see Depp's character changing one scene after another. Some people might need a "sign" or an obvious "cut" to tell them oh OK he's not the same anymore. Gee of course he's not the same look what just happened here.The change is so slow and subtle that he DOESN'T have to "act it" he just IS it one scene after another.Hollywood produces so much junk "cookie cutter" movie than when things are not told explicitly some get bored.It's a poetic film so if you don't like the genre then you'll probably fall into the category that couldn't stand the pace of the movie. Along with the music score the pace is what makes it good and I don't need and it doesn't have to be (even if I like) "filmed ? la Tarantino" to be "good". Again stills totally in harmony here.You have to look at the totality and what the director is doing. Here it is a film that is totally congruent from start to finish and one heck of a good piece.I never rent movie as I record them when they pass on the many movie channel I have. I am usually not a "keeper" I listen and record over. This one I simply couldn't as I knew I was going to listen to it again, which I did 2 months later and enjoyed it even more. So to the MTV generation yes I'm nuts :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only ever watched one Jim Jarmusch film and that was Ghost Dog and I wasn't so keen as much as I thought I would have been but I still found very intriguing so I looked up on what other Jarmusch films he has directed and the one I came across which stood out to the rest was Dead Man, probably because it's casting of Johnny Depp and Rob Mitchium. I love westerns also and with it being black and white it sounded it very interesting. I went on instinct and actually bought the DVD and as soon as the opening credits started after Crispin Glover's opening scene with Johnny Depp finished I was hooked and at first it was Neil young's haunting soundtrack that grabbed me and kept me going and the more I continued with this film the more it was becoming more poetic and rock n roll. You could say that William Blake's role was written for Depp as he plays the shy and retiring Blake so convincingly. It was nice to see so many cameo's by so many great actors especially Billy Bob Thornton and the great John Hurt. This film has even inspired me to direct my own black and white poetic western in college. It won't be as good but it gives you so many ideas to do so. Watch this and just enjoy it for the masterpiece it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterful film; a most philosophical western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's film "Dead Man" is a haunting masterpiece, a spiritual journey into the unknown and an epic story about one man's attempt to find his way in the lawless wilderness of the Wild West. William Blake (Depp) is an accountant who forsakes everything for a job in the steelmining town ingeniously named "Machine." Things soon go wrong: he doesn't get the job, and somehow murders a man (Gabriel Byrne) after getting into an one-night stand with a lovely flower-maker (Mili Avital). Blake soon becomes a wanted man, and while wandering the forests lost, he is aided by a Native American named "Nobody" (Gary Farmer) who thinks he is actually William Blake, the famous poet and artist.The black-and-white cinematography is brilliant, stark and inspiring: it invokes a mood of unfamiliarity, and echoes old westerns and classic Kurosawa movies. Neil Young's electric guitar soundtrack provides the perfect mood and backdrop for the piece, and his music is simply the most fitting accompaniment to the epic ambience of the film. Featuring some stellar performances from great actors: Johnny Depp, Mili Avital, Gabriel Byrne, Gary Farmer, Billy Bob Thorton, and Alfred Molina, "Dead Man" is a great and classic film, an inspiration to filmmakers, a spiritual meditation, a poetic and philosophic examination of the "Western" form, a study in scene composition, and a movie definitely not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is movie was a joy to watch. In all of its originality and modern subtext, it was the closest thing to a real, old-fashioned western that I've seen in a long while. Jim Jarmusch has never failed me as a director. He has the eyes of a master painter in that he understand how to frame a shot for maximum effect. He is an artist indeed. Johnny Depp is a genius. He is the understated and over-the-top simultaneously. He also masters the art of mixing comedy and tragedy to create transcendent performances. Even Iggy Pop as "Sally" was brilliant in his deliver of bizarre dialogue that was totally believable. The actor who played the character of "Nobody" (forgive me for not remembering his name) was brilliant in that he was able to deliver those potentially cliche Native American witticisms without making me feel like I was watching a Mazola commercial. He had a sense humor and a humanity that made him more than another one the many victims of "the man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you like meaningless disturbing images, distracting guitar solos, pseudo- philosophical phonyness, and if plot is not a priority to you, then this is a must see. otherwise, it is exactly as i summarized it in my title. many people will claim philosophical content and use words like, 'existential' and 'nihilism'. i challenge these assertions. just because something is confusing and has no apparent meaning does not mean that it laden with profundity. such attempts are philosophical short cuts. so many images are thrown around that could mean everything or nothing. here they hope that by hinting at any number of things that the audience will construe a world of possible meanings. well, sure we will, because we haven't been given anything. but this in no way means that the film or piece has any real meaning of its own. unfortunately, the emperor's new clothes analogy is entirely appropriate here as was pointed out by another commentator previously. with regards to existentialism, this movie is quite weak. its only claim is to follow a character through a meaningless world into hell, purgatory, despair or what not. this does, sort of, cover one of existentialism's main tenets- considering the possibility and perhaps giving in to it that all of the world is devoid of meaning.however, where this movie leaves off is where existential tries to go from there. from this point existential philosophers then try to find meaning elsewhere. for many of them, kierkegaard in particular, meaning is found within the individual. looking internally rather than externally. dead man can offer nothing more than the first half of this picture. it is a complaint with out any attempt to reconcile matters. if you are interested in existentialism and don't don't want to try to tackle kierkegaard, heidegger, there are a number of places to go. for a more complete view, try walker percy's "the moviegoer." for sort of an entertaining halfway, maybe gogol's short stories. for nihilism- fathers and sons is the most popular. but back to dead man and speaking of its story itself, there really isn't much of one. the characters are courtesy of the neares cookie cutter and the "nobody" or "noman" character is jarmush's version of jar jar binks. some will say this is intentional and is for a point, but as I've tried to explain above, it is not much of a point. i'm have to rant here because this movie really offended my sensibilities. it is two hours of my life that i will never have back again. it may be "cool", as some people have said, but it is not philosophical or deep. it is disturbing eye candy for people who like that sort of thing.-he who must not be named</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jarmusch delivers yet again, a beautifully written and photographed film about a way-ward traveller in the lawless West. It serves also as a textbook example of film realism, bringing back expressions, idiosyncrasies and ideologies unique to frontier North America. A television pop-up penned this film as existential, but I'm not so sure. Jarmusch's endorsement, I think, lies somewhere between the Christian church he pillories and the possible existential interpretation. A gray area, if you will, appropriate to the nature of one of the finest black and white films I've seen. You'll have to watch 'The Man Who Wasn't There' to find a peer for the 'Dead Man'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film plays like an extended meditation on the observation, due to Arnold Van Gennep and Robert Hertz, that death, as an extreme form of such changes of state in human organisms as baptism, communion, coming of age, or marriage, derives its nature from a social rite of passage rather than a biological transition. With his trademark deadpan approach, Jim Jarmusch treads on the beaten path made familiar from such mystical variations on the theme as Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder and M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense. Nonetheless, his morbidly funny and touching interpretation of an ancient anthropological commonplace is distinguished by its spectacular casting, sharp photography, snappy dialogue, and smoking soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE GREATEST WESTERN OF ALL TIME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch's "Dead Man" can certainly lay claims as one of the greatest films of the 90's, and is, as far as i am concerned, the greatest western of all time. Why? Simply because no other Western, not even "Unforgiven", has so accurately depicted the dirt, disease, outright weirdness, and constant threat of violence in the old west so well. Johnny Depp is superb as William Blake, the eponymous "Dead Man" of the title, as he journeys into the hell-hole of "Machine" for an accountancy job, only to be falsely implicated in the murders of two people, one of whom happens to be the son of the most powerful (and frankly, insane) man in town( a superb Robert Mitchum, in one of his final roles). Blake, who has taken a bullet in the heart and will surely die, flees across the country, leaving an increasing amount of corpses in his wake. Along the way, he befriends a trusty Native American, "Nobody", and the two of them encounter an increasingly strange assortment of stragglers, killers, traders and U.S. Marshalls. Jarmusch masterfully blends the horrifyingly graphic violence with superbly funny characters and dialogue. Of particular note are the three hired killers Mitchum hires to track down Blake and Nobody, which includes the superb Michael Wincott as the cowboy who can't stop talking, and Lance Henriksen as the cannibal cowboy who never talks. Gabriel Byrne, Billy Bob Thornton, John Hurt, Alfred Molina and Iggy Pop(!) all deliver superb cameos, and Robby Muller's beautiful, mysterious black and white photography, wrapped up in Neil Young's terrific soundtrack, make for an essential masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Jarmusch gives an excellent twist to the western in "Dead Man". In personal experience I have not been fond of the western genre, but this is definitely an exception. The entire story depicts William Blake dying of a gunshot wound--something no western will depict--and dramatizes the event for the sake of commenting on the overuse of violence in the western genre. The film takes a tangent from a traditional story by following the victim of one occurrence of violence. Another poignant fact is the attention given to Native Americans. As Native Americans are referred to as savages in most western films, the irony is in the idea that here the white man is the savage, heartlessly killing himself. The layers of meaning in the script and the way concepts are brought full-circle conveys the idea of the circle of life. Also, the attention to historical detail makes this film particularly enjoyable, mainly because it steers clear of most stereotypes. An interesting feeling that is brought to the film is in the style of the scenes--the writing and editing makes them seem like chapters in a novel, or some sort of chronicle. Combined with an uneasy score that wonderfully complements the overall mood, Jarmusch creates a highly engaging depiction of the wild west.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man; the WILD west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man is the story of the differences between the East and the West. You get a hint of this in the long (maybe too long) train scene. The appearance of the people changes from finely dressed ones to gabby untidy ones. And the ugly reality of what the west really is, is thrown into your face when Blake enters the city. The people, streets, looks, workers, head of factory?, everything is different from where Blake comes from. But the film seems to be trying to say that the people in the west can't be blamed for harshness and cruelty, this is the only way of survival. And so we see Blake change from a polite innocent young man (he has to shoot three times at Charlie before eventually killing him) to an expert killer. The white paper flowers being stamped over in the mud seem to indicate that Blake's innocence is destroyed for ever, and that he is will never have a way back. Dead Man is also the story of Indian mysticism. In the beginning of their encounter Blake doesn't understand what Nobody says and does, but gradually starts to get interested. He is left alone by nobody, so he can continue the journey on his own, and start having his own visions. He does see strange things, but that might be because Nobody has taken away his glasses! After finding Nobody again, Blake has more confidence in him, and doesn't question him that much. Another important feature of the film is the way it depicts Indians. Nobody is an educated Indian who is familiar with his own traditions and rituals as well (that's why he's called Nobody, his neither a full Indian nor a full European). He is Blake's guide through his difficult journey, and gets him ready for his death, or trip to the other world. This is the obvious part, but there are other things to be pointed out about him. Nobody either believes in reincarnation, or is stupid enough to believe that his companion is actually the 18th century English poet, saying:" it's so strange that you don't remember any of your poetry".He is helping Blake, but favors his own interests when he has to choose. He simply "trades" Blake's glasses, knowing how much he is in need of them, and I wont believe that he did his because Blake would "see more clearly without them"! Nobody is helping Blake prepare for his important journey to the other world, helping him to purify his soul through fasting and seeing visions, but on the other hand he is the one who leads Blake into more murder; he insists that Blake go to the three homosexuals, he calmly kills the first one of them, and so Blake is forced into his second murder by killing the second one, and this is the last time he is nervous about such an act. Nobody seems satisfied when Blake kills the missioner that had offended him, he seems satisfied whenever Blake kills a "stupid white man". Blake has hopes that Nobody will somehow help him survive, but all he does is to help him die. Well of course all this depends on one's viewpoint as well, and maybe some information about Indian rituals and beliefs is needed to understand things better.Some reviewers have claimed that Jarmucsh hasn't been successful in conveying his message to his audience. I accept this argument, a lot of religious and mystic symbols are mixed up with shocking violence, but one doesn't get what the director is really after in the end. One thing for sure, Blake doesn't choose his fate, everything is pre-determined, he doesn't choose to become a poet who Writes with blood, he only chose to sit in that train, and so the train fireman is able to predict everything, hell, grave, and the boat that takes Blake to his final destination.The movie is about death; the unchangeable fate, and so is in black and white. The music, composed by Billy Boy, the good selection of actors (specially Gary Farmer), and the frequent surprising, violent and shocking scenes manage to keep the movie from becoming dull. Dead Man is a good film if you want to learn about what the west looked like in the 19th century, but it won't be able to convey any special philosophical or religious message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Blake leaves his home in Cleveland for an accounting job in a remote western outpost, but when he gets there he discovers the position has already been filled. He is then unwittingly involved in a double-murder in which he is wounded, and goes on the lam in the wilderness, where he is helped by a Red Indian called Nobody. A wanted and desperate man, death must surely await him ...This is one of Jarmusch's beautiful, haunting, dreamy black-and-white films, featuring his favourite theme of the stranger in a strange land. Whilst never dull, it plays more as a series of vignettes, with Blake gradually crossing over from the land of the living to the land of the dead, and seems heavily influenced by the Native American traditions of preparation for the afterlife (the sequences in the Injun village at the end were shot at the Makah Indian Nation in Washington state, and the film was also made in extraordinarily picturesque locations in Oregon and Arizona). Robby Müller's brilliant photography and Neil Young's jangly guitar score contribute enormously to the opiate atmosphere, with all those fade-to-blacks and lazy minor chords. Given the film's budget, the prestigious cast is a testament to Jarmusch's artistic clout - Depp is excellent as the small, unassuming man literally cast adrift and Farmer provides strong support as Nobody, his spiritual guide. The remaining cast all relish the wackos they are playing; Henriksen as a cannibalistic bounty-hunter, Mitchum as a mad old-timer, Hurt as an overworked clerk, Byrne as a love-spurned Romeo, Pop as a cross-dressing bean-cooker, and Molina as a trader at the end of the world. For me, not quite on a par with Down By Law or Night On Earth, but a great strange movie from one of America's few truly independent filmmakers. A German-Japanese-American co-production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I've seen A LOT. I cannot believe some critics actually liked this dreck (Greil Marcus what the hell is wrong with you?). I enjoyed Stranger Than Paradise and after seeing Coffee and Cigarettes in the theaters recently I figured I'd check out another Jarmusch film and I'd been meaning to see Dead Man for a while. This is one of the most pretentious, boring and ridiculous films ever made. There's maybe a minute and a half of actual quality in a LONG two hours. I never saw Ghost Dog because the trailer simply make it LOOK like one of the worst movies ever made; Dead Man, unfortunately, is one of the worst. Honestly, I rent from Netflix, multiple films a week, I watch movies on cable, I go to the theaters, and I haven't been subjected to anything this pathetically bad in years. I honestly cannot recall the last time I saw a film this bad. Sometimes I see a film and say, OK, it's overrated, I don't know why people think this is such a great film, but with Dead Man, I felt like shutting it off 15 minutes in and I have a lot of patience and am almost never tempted to actually stop watching a film. Hell, I never even post stuff on IMDb, but this was so bad that it motivated me to.Sean Hooks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Dead Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By: Somayeh PashaeeDead man/ This film has been produced in 1995 by the directory of Jim Jarmusch. Who was the writer of the film too. The producer of Dead man was Dimitra Jay Mc Bride, the Editor was Jay Rabinowitz and Music by Neil Young. The reputed characters of the film were Jonny Depp, Gary Farmer, Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, Crispin Glover, John hurt, Michael Wincott, Lance Henriksen, Robert Mitchum, Mili Avital and Gabriel Byrne. The time of the film was 2 hours and the genre of it, was western, dram and fantasy. Dead man was in totally black and white.Plot/ In the first sequence, we face to a boy in a train, by the name of William Blake, who is handsome, neat and orderly person, he is from a Cleveland, Lake Erie, and seeking for a job in the new town, where he is going to there. His profession is accounting, and has a letter form an enterprise in the new town for work, as an accountant, when Blake comes to the town by the name of "Machine" late, looses his chance. So he is ambulating in the town, mean while he familiars with a girl and goes to her home. The day after when the ex-boyfriend of the girl, whose name is "Thel" comes back with a gift in his hand and sees Thel and Blake on the bed, so takes out his gun and kills the girl, on the other hand Blake kills the boy by the name of "Charlie", who is Mr. Dickinson's boy. So this event causes the 3 persons, appointed by Dickinson, follows him. Mean time he becomes familiar with an Indian by the name of "Nobody".Metaphors/ Blake: the feature of inexperienced, polite and handsome boy, who has some dreams in his mind. Train: the moving of train illustrates of entering to a new period of life. The Nature out of Train: the rest traces of underdog Native Americans who were ridden of their home by the cruel white men. Machine: a town of dryness, without spirit, and cold, where nothing is of importance except killing. Nobody: a figure of mystical and spiritual man who does not belong to this world. Rifle: an instrument, which is replaced by the tongue Paper flowers: refers to a place that these flower can not grow there naturally because of the savagery characteristic and sphere of individuals in the town of Machine.The Goal and conclusion/ The principal goal of Dead Man, is to show the symbols of Wild West which are from one hand, lack of the right of protesting and death, on the other hand the poverty and prostitution that the Western American custom, also here, killing has changed to part of the human life, in which the white people have ridden the Indian of their homeland and have tried to make war between races. In this kind of society, welcome to those who don't not belong to Wild West, with death. I think Jarmusch has wanted to image the white men manners in relation to the Indian in the worst way, and vice versa, a desired image of Indians. For example when Nobody always asks Blake: "Do you have tobacco?", in terms of the writing, it is an emblem to points to the special characteristic of Indian, when they like to make a friend for themselves, start by asking this question. In this film violence is showed clearly and in terms of mine, it is the negative point of the film that companies with some how exaggeration. e.g. when Wilson, one of the appointed person by Dickinson for killing Blake, easily eat hand of some body, who had killed his father and mother and eaten them. He plays many violence scenes over the film. Brutality is exhibited heinously in Dead Man. More over the West American hatred to religion shows clearly at the scene when Wilson, pushes his foot on the head of the killed one by the Blake, in way his head burst and says "Looks like a goddamn religious icon". It shows the most detest to religious peoples. In pointing to cruel affair of white people, even Nobody says to Blake, from now you'll write your poetries by blood. Making this film in Black and White is another points that Jarmusch wants to point it, in terms of mine he wanted to say all of the people are equal for God, and what comes to be different among the people of the world are their action, behavior and their believe. In this film, for white men, there is nothing to be important just wild action, killing and individualism. I think, this film overall points to 2 notes: the first one the West American society, which just in seeking to supremacy and hegemony, had killed millions of people around the world in order to prove its power to the world and possesses the world and to be the despot in the world, so for reaching this, does any thing; and the second one, points to those who think America is the end of the world, who in order to going there, resorting to any kinds of actions blindly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shamanistic texts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I go into this movie, Dead Man, the more I understand that its shamanism parallels that of Marechera's short, episodic book, Black Sunlight. Some precise parallels:1. The extremely choppy, episodic nature of the filmic (Jarmusch) and written (Marechera) texts. This speaks to the way the mind sleeps, then wakes up and continues on its narrative. It's the shamanistic movement between the rational daytime awareness and irrational sleep, a dialectic necessary to keep life going. This is faithful to the way we actually experience our lives: by going to sleep and the next day necessarily recreating the original narrative of the path on which we're bound. This pertains to the functions of our deep subjectivity and to natural bodily rhythms.2. The encounters with extreme violence and death as a poignant and mesmerizing aspect of life. Society is changing order and there is violence all around. In Marechera's narrative anti-colonial riots, anarchy and war relentlessly assault the psyche as expressions of violence and resistance.3. To be blind or without normal vision is represented as a different way of seeing more clearly. Lacking vision, one is dependent on the visceral senses. Instinct then predominates, after it has learned how to exert its intrinsic force. In Black Sunlight, Marie's blindness represents a shamanic way of seeing. Death presses in more viscerally, in that it reaches on through the faculty of smell, rather than knowledge or visual perception. In Dead Man, the Indian guide Nobody suggests that his charge would see better without spectacles. This turns out to be true, in that he can use his pistol more effectively without clear vision.4. The episodes show nothing more than several consecutive plunges into a state of greater proximity to death, matched with a greater awareness of the immediacy, strangeness and fragility of life. This polarization of the distinctive elements of life, highlighted the contrasts between life and death, is a key feature of shamanistic doubling.5. One moves from a world of logic and violence to a world of flowing organic unity. In the Jarmusch movie, one moves from a failed attempt to integrate with socially-defined reality in a town called Machine. Since one cannot become part of The Machine, one is compelled to die. In Marechera's novel, Chris joins with other social drop-outs at Devil's End. Jarmusch's protagonist, William Blake, meets his Indian protector, Nobody, only after receiving a bullet close to his heart. Thus, a shamanic wound sets the protagonist apart from the rest of society in each case. He starts to see reality differently, above all historical reality, through his wound.6. In Jarmusch's film, Nobody gives Blake the initiatory drug, Peyote. After this, Blake sees the effects of the colonial war against the Indians all around him, but the violence cannot touch him as he is impermeable. In Black Sunlight, apocalyptic shamanic visions at the climax of the novel. They are later explained, as if denied, by the protagonist, who had become the double of himself, Christian, having taken "Chris' psychiatric drugs".7. Marechera's protagonist is represented early in the book as a court jester, hanging upside down in a chicken-coup due to having offended the Great Chief. This is political satire, but is also a way of depicting the state of the uninitiated soul with his own superego. The author views himself as being condemned to be tortured and the source of this condemnation is political. The refrain of "stupid white man" expresses the political irony of Dead Man.8. In Marechera's novel, the protagonist-author, reunited with himself finally, as one, ends up showing the whiteness of his bones by effectively releasing all the words out of his body through his wrists. Rain pours down as overabundant meaning. Everything is liquefied This is indicative of shamanic ritual in facing death and finding unity with oneself through resignation. In Dead Man, Indians dress up Blake's dying body after he has been shot a second time, so that he can complete his journey on the other side of the mirror image of reality he has entered. This signifies that he can become one with himself again, on the surface of liquid (unconscious) (mental) processes.9. Both texts suggest solutions to political and social problems (colonial domination and machine-like attitudes) by going more deeply into death. This is a means for detachment and shamanistic dissociation, by virtue of which, one sees historical reality more clearly.10. In both texts, transgression of the normal social law is a result of accident, not deliberate. Blake's killing of a member of the Town of Machine (a mechanistic world) is an act of self-defense. In addition, his being framed for the murder of another member of the town gave him an outlaw identity that was incongruous with his inner attitude or intent. Marechera similarly shows how his protagonist becomes a revolutionary despite himself, because he has been driven mad by social norms. Shamanism is thus shown to be a state of primeval (but not historical) innocence, in the face of attributed social and political guilt.</fullReview>

In fact, there are only a few chuckles to be had, but the bizarre factor is ever-present. This film must hold the record for most fades, with one occurring just about every minute of screen time. Young's score consists of about four guitar notes that are repeated ad nauseum. That's the pattern: guitar riff, fade, guitar riff, fade...

		<shortDescription>Review of Dead Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man (Johnny Depp) is going from one place to another by a train run by steam engine. The destination is not specified yet; neither the beginning. The man is well dressed, at least, compared to the other travelers on the train.It seems to be a long journey. The man sometimes sleeps, plays cards alone as the camera periodically cuts to the steam driven metal wheels of the train. The man sometimes looks at the outside terrains which seem to be rapidly changing its style from forest (I guess so) to desert.The foreman of the train comes and talks to him; and we learn that the man is Bill Blake and he is an accountant going from Cleveland to some town of machine of western province for the purpose of joining a job. The foreman seems to be at loss to decipher the reason of the man's journey "to the hell".At the end of the journey the man at last reaches the metal town and starts finding, through the muddy and very western-movie-like-town, the office of the company he is about to join.This opening scene of "Dead Man" (1995) by Jim Jarmusch thus masterfully sums up the idea behind the movie. The train journey depicts whole mankind's journey through the advancement of civilization to a vastly over-industrialized current world. The current metal world is considered by the foreman and in turn Jim Jarmusch as a "hell".In the metal town Bill Blake miraculously survives (or should I say "unfortunately shot by"?) a shot from pistol and the metal bullet enters his body and stays within the body just beside the heart. The bullet has entered so much within that it cannot be cut out by a knife; otherwise the knife would penetrate his heart.In a very ironical dialog a Red Indian (Gary Farmer) asks Bill "Did you kill the white man who killed you?"Bill does not understand the actual meaning and he replied that he is not dead yet.The rest of the movie is actually Bill's journey through the western America.Jarmusch wanted the story to be a wrapped by some genre and he unmistakably chose Western. Situated in 19th century wild wild West, the movie though does not completely surrender to the Western genre. Jarmusch only took some elements of this genre and made this film which is somewhat a parody of Western genre.In his movies Jarmusch mainly deals with cultural clash between American culture and some other cultures. In "Dead Man" this idea as one of the two main themes is present. The Native American culture here clashes with the culture of the "white men". The Red Indian called "Nobody", the constant reference of Tobacco play vital role in this theme.The film was shot in Black &amp; White like many of his movies. It is Jarmusch's most expensive movie as good cinematography was very much necessary. And it duly gives the movie its western look. Johnny Depp as William Blake is good as always.To summarize, Jim Jarmusch's movies are not everyone's cup of tea. "Dead Man" is not an exception. But serious movie-goers will find basketful of foods for thought in his movies. For them "Dead Man" is an ESSENTIAL.</fullReview>

He is guided by an outcast Indian who believes him to be the romantic poet William Blake. As he goes further into his journey he begins to embody the spirit of William Blake and sheds his old ideas and place in the material world.

I suspect the Hollywood establishment poisoned the well. If Warner Brothers had made Dead Man it would have been nominated for Academy Awards.Dead Man is a great epic equal or better than Dances with Wolves. Dances with Wolves cost 26 million &amp; grossed $184 million in US ( 424 million world wide.) The 1980 epic western turkey called Heaven's Gate had a budget of $44 million ( in 1980 dollars) and grossed $3,400,000, destroying the TransAmerica company, a major player at the time.On my shelf Dead Man is a classic, and will go next to "Little Big Man" (1970).</fullReview>

There's some wonderful stuff here, but you have to wade through broadly-brushed, unsubtle corn to get to it. The final canoe exit is really striking, with Neil Young's electric guitar feedback ushering us out. A really memorable moment.But too much of the movie is low quality broad-strokes amateurishly acted and joined to the plot. Here's yet another venal, racist priest, who isn't worth Jarmusch's time or yours (and I'm an atheist!). Ditto for a cameo with a cross-dressing Iggy Pop as the female member of a group of old west kinksters .(See Little Big Man for a more startling, thoughtful toppling of gender roles in the old west.) Iggy is the worst thing in the movie. Billy Bob Thornton fares better. The junky ideas are outclassed by its droller moments. A chubby Indian who (surprise) knows plenty about western culture. It has the classic line, "What name were you given at birth, stupid white man?" Even the last piece of dialogue, "I don't smoke," is a dry gem. The b/w photography is quite nice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEAD MAN Title: Dead Man Date of Release: May 26, 1995 Directed and Written: Jim Jarmusch Genre: Drama, Western Main Characters: Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer, Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott and John Hurt. SUMMARY: William Blake who has received a letter to work as an accountant in a town of Machine begins his journey to that town but as he arrives one month later he can not get his dreams. In the first night of his arrival he meet a beautiful girl and as William get wounded by the girl's ex-fiancé he begins his real journey from ugliness to perfection by the guidance of an Indian who is really the God's angel helping him to become pure in the world of limbo. ANALYSIS: "There is no death, only a change of worlds."SeattleSuquamish chief Historically the story of" Dead Man" took place during the period of west movement, when American settlers tried to remove all the obstacles on a way to west. Event they killed many children, Women and men who were Native Americans in their invasion toward the west lands. Jarmusch in "Dead Man" tends to clear all the images pictured about the savage Indians and civilized whites in Hollywood. William Blake begins his journey by train, the first machine which has been made by man. You may guess that the journey is from everything to nothing but actually this is a road from nothing to everything. Train as a symbol of humane development and access to technology has been used to be a symbol of the world of machine. The cruel and wild world which is able to burn and destroy human beings like the train kiln which tends to burn a man who is filling it with coal. Train carries passengers toward the west where men prefer to kill the symbols of nature not on the back of their horses but from the inside of the train, The sequence of William's arrival to the town by emphasizing on the board of town of machine standing close to the symbol of virgin nature, cactus, is a notable example of the reality in the west and whites invasion. Williams with many dreams enters to the town allover gray, lifeless and dead. Actually the sequence of town imposes wilderness, corruption and immorality. As a result William, a person who has entered to hell instead of paradise, goes to cabaret where we find him alone in medium shot among the crowd. In the first night of his arrival he seeks calmness in the arms of a beautiful girl who is a symbol of beauty and fineness in the world of wilderness. A beautiful girl who shows her kindness by offering her paper flowers and her body to William but so pity that in the marsh whatever the earth be fertile it can only create paper flowers. From that first night William begins his journey to perfection when he gets wounded by the bullet purified and passed through the heart of love. In the next sequence Jarmusch draws a picture of Williams who open his eyes and sees nobody by the use of fade-in technique. Through watching this movie, through each fade-in, we enter to the world of limbo, an interval between death and resurrection among all wildernesses in the world of machine; and with each fade-out we go through the new window to the world of ugliness. Nobody is an angle who has been appointed to guide William on the way to perfection. Nobody believes that to a quest of vision a man must undergo mortification. He takes William's glasses to remind him that he should close his earthly eyes and open his heart to the world of limbo. In the other sequence, nobody asks William to go and meet three gays reading the Holy Book to teach him, that the appearance of actions are not important but the soul of actions."Dead man" is divided into to types of motion: slow motion and fast motion. From the initial sequence to the sequence in which William gets wounded, pictures have a fast motion but afterward we face with a slow motion compatible to the world of death and limbo that prepare William for the final flight."Dead man" visual effects and black and white pictures have been chosen wisely to introduce the world of death and limbo to audiences who have no experience about it. It is obvious that if you be unfamiliar with an entity, you can not imagine it clearly colored with beautiful colors. Jarmusch has used the gray filter to draw a picture of William's journey to the white world of purity.Although many of the critiques believe that the film music is so influential but I think this good music made by Phill Young, can be considered as a weak point. The first reason is excess to the use of music in all of the sequences. As William goes toward perfection, the use of music not only decreases but also continuously increases. For example, in a sequence that William finds a dead deer and sleeps near it on the ground, Young uses the musical instruments instead of the sounds of nature. The other reason is that it would be better if Young used a single melody or the other musical instrument instead of electronic guitar which extremely produces the sound of the savage world of machines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review: Dead Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review of Dead Man Date of Release: May 26, 1995 Director and playwright: Jim Jarmusch Genre: Western Main artists: Johnny Depp (William Blake), Avital (Thel Russell), Gary Farmer (Nobady), Lance Henriksen (Cole Wilson), Michael Wincott (Conway Twill) and John Hurt (John Scholfield).Synopsis:Bill Blake comes in the town of Machine to work in a factory as an accountant; but unfortunately he has come just one month late because of his parents' death and dealing with their funerals and so he losses the job. At the coming night of his arrival in to town, Bill confronts with a hawker girl and being invited to be with her for the night but the girl's former boy friend (son of Machine's Metal Works Company owner) comes and bill obliged to kill him as self-defense and he himself became wounded. He ran away and at morning waking up he meets Nobody who is an English literate Indian; he calls William Blake the Dead Man as he has name of a dead English poet and also carrying a bullet in his chest. They start a journey to escape from their prosecution(ors), on way they face with different surprising and adventures; these events transforms William Blake into a cold blooded man slaughterer just for his survival. It makes a killing-field which their death is its outcome.Setting: Time: the film is set in late 19th century, Place: in extreme western frontier of America.Genre: Western, Drama "It is preferable not to travel with a dead man." Is a quotation from Henri Michaux with which the movie begins, so initially it is obvious that the audiences are going to watch a fully metaphoric movie. William Blake (1757-1827), English poet, painter, and engraver, who created an unusual form of illustrated verse; his poetry, inspired by mystical vision, is among the most original, lyric, and prophetic in the language is name of the main character and Nobody which I think can be a metaphor from American dramatist Arthur Miller's most renowned work, Death of a Salesman (1949) which tells the story of a traveling salesman, Willy Loman, who experiences frustration and failure as he reflects upon his life, in a scene that Charley (Loman's friend)speaks over the salesman's grave start with "Nobody dast blame this man. You don't understand: Willy was a salesman?" is name of the second man. Both are metaphors seeking and fighting for their identities: Blake has lost his kin and hits the road to west in search of a location where he can ignite a new life. Although it's asserted in the finishing scripts that it's a fictional story and no one should be considered as any real character but to a high extend Willy Blake (the dead man) represents the ex-President Andrew Jackson who was a orphan as Billy is and a Dead Man as he had a bullet in his chest too. Technique of Film: Dead Man is projected in black and white, which by itself represents the sorrow mood of the story; furthermore it shows that all main characters in the work are white and good or black and villain, there is no gray main character in the story. In 1995 a black and white film can also considered as a dehabitualization and deconstruction after long time color motion pictures (since 1940 &amp; 50s). Dead Man is full of violence and that's why it got R in rating, it conveys a full sense of bitterness and fright in 19th century America. The music of the film is outstanding; written and performed by Neil Young using an electric guitar, he did solely what the whole blacks and whites did or what had been done in whole black and white. Figures of Play (rather than speech) The train seems to move retroversively which might is intended to takes back the audiences to the willing time in the western territories of 19th century America. Starting in train Billy Blake understood that people in that land "speak dagger" to innocents; but as it's a long time since Shakespeare's Hamlet, they speak and versify in gun. From street to bed and from hate to love all should have gun "because it's America". Industrialization also put more wood on fire of brutality as locomotive engineer did in the starting scenes. Another notion which must be considered is tobacco, a healing herb for Indians which has been changed into a smoking grass for whites. ConclusionDead Man talks and shows nothing but a dead value of humanity. It shows that in modern so-called civilized West even a pinto is more valuable than a man (even a white one). Jarmusch's cinema always shows social problems and issues just as it's observable in his other work like: Stranger Than Paradise (1984), Down by Law (1986), Mystery Train (1989), Night on Earth (1992), Coffee and Cigarettes: Somewhere in California (1993), Year of the Horse (1997) and Butterfly Man (2005).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dead past meeting a Daed future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead ManReviewed By: Fatemeh Azimzadeh Director: Jim Jarmusch Writer: Jim Jarmusch Release Date: May 1996 Country: USA Genre: Western/Drama Starring: Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer Music: Neil YoungA Dead past meeting a Dead future Plot:William Blake, desperate of the past, hopeful to a new start and ambitious to the future, moves westward on a train. He is one month late to achieve the promised accountant job. He gets wounded by the son of his would?be boss, kills him and runs off the town. Soon prize hunters chase him. He and a Native American called Nobody come together to experience quirky affairs before their physical deaths. Both departure and destination ends up to deathSetting: A western frontier of late 19th century, AmericaGenre: Western/DramaMain Characters: Johnny Depp (William Blake), Gary Farmer (Nobody)The techniques: Jarmusch's black and white Dead Man creates senses of doomed and fruitless life in west, despite the beliefs which attracted people to leave everything beyond and move there in 19th century, specifically. The people look more ghostly by the black and white shots as well as the repeated motions of the camera to death suggestive objects like coffins, skulls and animal skins. It all goes with the compatible music and fade-out technique to make the atmosphere spookier. Also, nature is black and white; it seems barren and not bountiful, it is dead as well, even the flowers are not natural. There is no joy of colors to produce energy, eagerness and exhilaration. Symbols and Metaphors: Most of the scenes are symbolic and metaphorical. The names and the words of the characters and also the tone of the story and the film bring William Blake's work to mind, the English poet that was isolated from the society. The railway system is the vessel to nourish the country by people and cargo as well as life styles. People from different groups are on sitting quiet on the train, it seems they do not have something in common to share, but guns and moving westward. Gun talks from the beginning to the end and people understand each other through gun-related words and behaviors; they do not trust each other and are ready to shoot. Each one has his own rules. Gun is the solution. Dickinson trusts the human hunters more than the law, but he decides to benefit from the service of law, too. It seems either he has been a hunter himself or loves hunting. A woman is there with a gun and paper flowers. One paper rose is attached to Blake's coat as long as he wears the suit which, he was proud of it in the beginning, but he puts the suit away as well as his watch; a dead man needs no time. A teenager chasing Blake is not old enough to smoke, but already killed several they say. Machine provides a good name for the town, everything is artificial, hunting and brutality exists. Blake accompanies nobody and that is the time he backs to the nature. Nobody neither belongs to the past nor present.Indians were those who introduced tobacco to the whites, but now he asks for tobacco. The word, tobacco carries a big part of American history on it. At the end he does not die on the land he came to advance on it, but on the sea and under the sky, that is another world.It is an eccentric western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a live dead man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie begins showing William Blake on a train. He is an accountant that has left his homeland (that is Cleveland) to go after a job in the town of Machine in west. John Dickenson, who is the owner of the factory Blake hoped to work in, has filled the vacancy with another accountant because Blake arrives too late. The newly orphaned accountant, William Blake, has spent all he had for his trip to the city and now feels so lonely and helpless as he find out that all his hopes to have better opportunities here, were in vain. With the last money in his pocket he goes to a bar and buys some drink. There he meets Thel, maybe a former prostitute, and accompanies her to her house and decides to spend the night with her. Thel's former fiancé who comes to Thel with a gift shots her in the chest and kills her; the same bullet penetrating Blake's chest. That's when Blake commits the first killing; something so unfit to his innocent and naive looking face. The rest of the film actually is the result of this single action. On his way to escape he meets an Indian, who calls himself Nobody. He believes Blake is dead because of the bullet in his chest close to his heart. Later when he hears the name of the man, he mistakes him for the Poet William Blake. He got familiar with his poems when he was sent to Britain and joined a whites' school. As he loves William Blake's poetry, and as he thinks that this is the spirit of William Blake that he has met, he decides to guide him to the land of spirits where he is in eternal peace. As the two start their journey together, many bounty hunters and 3 professional killers hired by John Dickenson are tracing Blake. In this journey the Na?ve Blake becomes a skilled killer due to circumstances in which he has to defend himself. Nobody who believes a boat is needed for Blake's trip to spirit land goes to an Indian tribe and obtains a rowboat from them. He puts Blake into it and leaves him to the sea. While the boat is distancing from the shore, Cole Wilson, one of the hired killers, the one who killed the other two killers beforehand, finally gets to them and shots Nobody in the back. Before falling down, Nobody also kills Wilson and at the same time it seems that Blake's soul finally leaves his body; The three men dying at the same time.The movie presents America in nearly late 19th century, a period of swift changes in the lives of Americans. The technological advancements and industrial developments, contacts and conflicts with indians, migration from villages to cities and rise of violence in the cities, and a change in people's lifestyle due to new conditions of work and living are among the main features of this period. A time when carrying a gun was a norm, even for a woman like Thel. The black and white cinematography adds the nature of these features to the film in the best way. The break between the episode and the fade-out are just in line with the uncertainty of the time. The film's protagonist, William Blake, also is an excellent manifestation of the era; shaky, uncertain and paradoxical, with possibilities of corruption. A comparison between Blake's appearance and that of the people of Machine, tells a great deal about the differences between the culture of the west and the culture of east. Even the kind of language they use is different sometimes. As a man from the East, he never smokes while people that appear in his way always ask him" if he has any tobacco!" .actually the word "tobacco" is one of the words that is repeated so many times in the film. Another repeated word or better to say phrase is "stupid white man", which is used by Nobody to call Blake. This depicts anther intention of Jarmusch, that of presenting the conflict between whites and indians. One of the strange things about it is that this time it's a white man who is called stupid and not an Indian. Nobody is somehow more knowledgeable that Blake but still as the beautiful metaphor of his name suggests, he is considered nobody in the world of whites. Therefore we are encouraged that in this film the director sides with indians and not whites. He shows the Indian villages that burn in fire thus pity among us. Industry and its developments and the consequent problem form another major concern of Jarmusch. He tries to show how industry ruined the lives of people and how actually it deprived Americans of their colorful lives and turned it into black and white. As Blake is told, in the city of the Machine (again another metaphorical name) the only work is to make coffins, things that are of no use for a live man and that only suit a "dead man". Morality is not saved from all these ruins. As it is implied prostitution and immoralities have spread among people and they feel not ashamed of it. Killing is considered as common and ordinary task, easily done, basically with a gun, a product of technology and industry. So it seems that Jarmusch is ironically criticizing technology and its consequences.The film was made in 1995 when America had recently been engaged in wars abroad (with Somalia, Panama and Iraq). This gives us a clue that may be the film is bringing into concentration the previous consequences of violence and force so that we take good lessons out of it and not to wish them happen again. Besides, the film suggests that Americans should not consider non-Americans as "nobody" anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dead man is a different western movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Jim Jarmusch, Writer: Jim Jarmusch, Date: 10 May 1996 (USA) Genre: drama / western, Awards: two wins and 5 nominations Filming Locations: Applegate River, Oregon, USA, Company: Pandora Filmproduktion Main actors: Johnny Depp (William Blake), Gary farmer (nobody), Crispin Glover (train fireman), Robert Mitchum( john Dickinson), Gabriel Byrne (Charlie Dickinson), Lance Henriksen (Cole Wilson), Michael Wincott (Conway Twill), Eugene Byrd Johnny (The Kid) Pickett. Jim Jarmusch is a leading American filmmaker who began his career in 1980 with PERMANENT VACATION. Before dead man, he directed many films and continuing series of short films. He says the openness of the western form, and its inseparable connection to "America" is the reason that he makes dead man in the form of western film. Dead man is the history of a traveler from Cleveland to western frontier of America in second half of the nineteen century. William Blake (Johnny Deep) a gentleman moves to town of Machine, a small town far in west, where he has been promised a job. In the first moments of his journey he encounters passengers who open fire on herd of Buffalo, all of them carry gun and shoot and kill easily. The only ordinary conversation that Blake experiences during his journey is whit a fireman (Crispin Glover) whom cannot even read. Blake is shocked when he arrives in an exotic, outlaw, uncivilized, dirty and violate city. When he goes to Melta Works, office manager rejects him because of his delay, but, it does not seem that date and guarantee of work is important for them. John Dickinson, the boss, speaks with the language of gun. With no job, no money and no hope in a gun city, he becomes familiar with a girl who seems different from others. They find each other as kinder spirits but the girl is killed by his former lover -Dickinson's son- when she is in bed with Blake. Blake kills the man by girl's gun in self defense. He escapes from town and on the outskirts, he encounters with a strange Native American who called himself "Nobody". He believes that Blake is the dead English poet who died in 1827. He goes to spiritual journey that is inspired by real Blake poems. Noticeably, in a key scene, Nobody asks Blake, "Did you kill the white man who killed you?" Bill answers, "I am not dead".First of all Nobody teaches him "you will learn to use your guns instead of words, your poetry will now be written in blood". Soon he learns to cope with the condition that he had never confronted. Contrary to his personality he becomes a hunter and killer but, he does not completely change to a western American. His eyes are open to humanity. He and Nobody kill all persons who want to trap him; he kills big George Drakulious (Billy Bob Thompson), Salvator Jenko (Iggy Pop), Benmont Tench (Jarred Harris), and some other persons. By the end of the film Blake has traveled far beyond every where, maybe he is traveling toward his death.The film contains a continuing contradiction: the contrast between civilized east and Wild West. Paradox of Blake's spiritual journey in search of his ultimate destiny which changes his personality to a brutal killer, the coarse Native American man who does not believe in any identity for himself but thinks, experiences spiritual journey, believes in poem and has a sense of respect to the poet, Thel (Mili Avital) the girl, who keeps gun in her bed and perfidies to his lover, has pure and sensitive spirit, Conway Twill (Michael Wincott) one of the most skillful killers in the city has a doll and sleeps with that. On the technical side, the black and white filming recalls the primitive atmosphere of nineteen century, it gives the sense of nostalgia and solitude of both Dead Man and Nobody, of all people who live together but live in dread, dread of their own language, language of GUN. On the other hand, during the film, black and white space gives the massage of DEATH, the great mystery which there is no specific color for visualizing it. So, Black and white is another contradiction. Dead Man is composed by Neil Young; the instrumental soundtrack of film which is mostly Electric guitar switches occasionally to pump organ, detuned piano and acoustic guitar. It is a weird soundtrack which is fit to a western film. Totally, it's a different western movie and it's not an easy film to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nightmare of Life in Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Film Review: DEAD MAN Title: Dead Man Date of Release: May 26, 1995 Directed and Written: Jim Jarmusch Genre: Western Main Characters: Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer, Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott and John Hurt.The Nightmare of Life in DeathPlot: William Blake arrives in the town of Machine, in extreme western frontier of America, to work in a factory as an accountant; but he has arrived one month late and he losses the job. In the first night of his arrival in the town, Blake meets a young girl and stays with her for the night but the girl's former fiancé who is the son of Machine's Metal Works Company comes and Blake kills him in self-defense and gets wounded. Next day he wakes up and meets Nobody who is an out cast Indian; he believes that Blake is the dead English poet. They go to a journey to" the other side" and on their way they go through different experiences and adventures which finally lead to their death. The journey transforms William Blake into a cold blooded killer.Setting: the film is set in late 19th century, in extreme western frontier of America.Genre: Western, Drama Main Characters: Johnny Depp (William Blake), Gary Farmer (Nobody), Mili Avital (Thel Russell), Lance Henriksen (Cole Wilson), Michael Wincott (Conway Twill). The Film Opens with a quote from the French surrealist poet Henri Michaux: "It is preferable not to travel with a dead man." , so from the beginning the audience knows that he is watching a highly metaphorical film. The names of the two main characters, William Blake (a long- dead English poet) and Nobody, are metaphorical as well. Both characters are searching and struggling for their identities: Blake has lost his family and takes the road to west in search of a place where he can start a new life. William Blake is a name of an English poet who was isolated from the society for protesting against the hypocrisy of British institutions. Jarmusch said he has used his name because Blake's name reminds him of Native Americans in their mystical visions. Nobody, as his name suggests have no identity and feels no sense of belonging to his native land and is rejected both by Whites and his own people. So, he does not exist and seems to be invisible.Contrary to American's perception about the west as land of opportunity and abundance and western movies that put an emphasis on this false vision, the Dead Man portraits western land as a barren place where anarchic, cruel and primitive white man ruling. The techniques: The whole film is shot in black and white. In an interview Jarmusch said that he had used this technique in order to neutralize the familiarity of the objects and landscape. Also the emotional theme and tone of the story demands it: the story is full of violence and sense of morbidity and barrenness which is in contrast with American's perception about the west. The black and white shooting also reminds the audience the Film Noire of the 1940s an50s.Dead man also uses the fade-out technique which was used in older films to show the division between the scenes. In the film this technique is also used to show a sense of isolation between the different parts of the films and the physical status of the main character William Blake, whose health is deteriorating. The music of the film is written and performed by Neil Young and is played by an electric guitar. The music is said to be played by him spontaneously as he watch the film.Symbols and MetaphorsThe film is full of symbols and metaphors both in scenes and speeches of the characters. As the train moves deeper in the western territories the landscape becomes harsher, and the passengers more uninviting and wild. What Blake sees when he walks in the Machine town for the first time, are all symbols of death: coffins, skulls and skins. There are other symbols and metaphors in the film such as the gun kept under the pillow by Thel, and when Blake asks why she keeps it she answers: "coz this is America." Also the importance of tobacco in western culture is shown when repeatedly almost all characters of the film asks for it .As time passes Blake lose his glasses and watch which shows his separation from his former life and civilization. ConclusionThe dead Man is one of the best western films which try to break the western movies cliché: This west is not land of opportunity, success and fertility but land of fear, brutality and barrenness. One may argue that the film is exaggerated in portraying the dark and ugly side of the American west, but I think the film is unique in that sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The True Image of What happened to Puritans: They all Ended up being William Blakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: The film begins with a scene in which a man called William Blake (Johnny Depp) is on a train to get to the West. He's been promised a position in a factory but when he gets there, he understands that not only his job is taken but also he is left penniless in the town. After spending the night with an ex-prostitute, he kills her ex as a result of defending himself. William Blake then tries to escape from punishment with the help of an Indian named Nobody, but gets killed in the end.Setting: Time: the 2nd half of the 19th century Place: A town called Machine in the West. Social Class: The majority of people in the town of Machine are illiterate, uncivilized hunters and workers, while William Blake used to be an accountant and doesn't fit in the city.Genre: WesternMain Characters: 1. William Blake ? Physical Characteristics: He hasn't got a strong body, showing the fact that he is not a laborer. He is also, in comparison to the other people in the town, peculiarly-dressed. ? Psychological Characteristics: Inflexible, shocked and not adaptable ? Other Characteristics: He is 30ish, and due to the previous place he was living in, he expects to see a rather civilized town with kind people but what he sees is completely different. 2. Nobody? Physical Characteristics: He has got a muscular, strong physique. ? Psychological Characteristics: He is very well-traveled and has gained a sort of calmness which looks very strange to William Blake. He also has got a sacred vision. ? Other Characteristics: When he was a child, he is kidnapped and taken to England where he is educated. He escapes from England by the inspiration he gets from reading the poems of a poet called "William Blake". He mistakenly thinks that his companion is the real William Blake and tells him that he must be dead (by telling him, "You're a dead man, then.") Besides, he is astonished that Blake cannot remember any of his poetry.Vocabulary:The words that are repeatedly used in the film are William Blake, Nobody, dead man, tobacco and gun. William Blake: William Blake (1757-1827) was an English romantic poet who was considered odd even among the other romantic poets. Here you see that William Blake in the film was considered odd by other people. But what this character mostly represents is the ideal thoughts the Pilgrims had when they came to America. They wanted to build "a city upon a hill", a utopia but what their descendants built is a dystopia, a mere scene of slaughter. This idea is well reflected in Nobody's remark to William Blake "Your poetry will now be written with blood."Nobody: The film starts with this sentence: "It is preferable not to travel with a dead man." Now, let's change this sentence to "Nobody likes to travel with a dead man." Makes sense, doesn't it? "Nobody" does like to travel with a dead man (William Blake) because they have one important thing in common: They are outcasts. Blake is trying to get away with murder while Nobody is living alone because his tribe didn't accept him. After escaping from England, he got back to his tribe and told his people about the extraordinary things he saw but nobody believed him and they named him Exaybachay meaning "He who talks loud, saying nothing." But he prefers to be called "Nobody".Dead Man: Dead man can have two meanings: the superficial one is what Nobody told William Blake. Because Blake, the poet, was dead by that time Nobody calls Blake "a dead man". The in-depth meaning is that if you are followed in the USA by anyone, there is clearly no possibility of escape and you are automatically turned into a dead man. Even if you are alive, you cannot live with your true identity. Isn't this situation like being dead in fact?Two other words that are repeated throughout the film are tobacco and gun. If you are an American, you must have both of these. The only person who doesn't have these two is William Blake. However, by the end of the film, both of them are accompanying him. Everybody keeps asking him whether he's got tobacco or not and he simply says that he does not smoke. The response Thel (the ex-prostitute) gives him when he asks why she keeps a gun is really thought-provoking. She honestly says "Because this is America."Conclusion:This English proverb gives a very good image of what this film is about: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." Although the Founding Fathers wanted to do good in the continent, the only thing their descendants are doing by the end of the film is killing. The new generations have forgotten all those high values. They cannot remember any of those ideals just like William Blake cannot remember any of his poetry. What is very moving in the end of the film is the part in which Nobody is preparing Blake's canoe to be sent on water and Blake still cannot believe that he is a dead man. He still thinks he's getting back to Cleveland. There's also another similarity here between Blake the poet and Blake in the film. The former died largely unknown, now if we take this fact into account that both Nobody and that white murderer are killed in the end of the film, it is unknown to the public what happened to William Blake. This is again revealing the fact that nobody exactly knows what happened to the ideals the Puritans had when they came to this continent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Semi-Western Movie that Leaves us on an Endless Sea Toward our Origin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start from the title of movie , "Dead Man" ,which raises dark and bitter feelings in us and somehow clarify viewpoint of the director about the main character (William Blake) ,that can be generalized to all human. William Blake is the person that follows "Nobody" (a name that its SYMBOLIC aspect is dominant) and also is followed by Cole Wilson .We may take these two person (Nobody and Cole Wilson) as the representatives of two opponent powers in the world . So , in this point of view , William Blake is located between these two powers. In a symbolic standpoint ,"Nobody" may considered as the NATURE or the ORIGIN and Cole Wilson is somebody that was sent from proprietor of town of MACHINE. Although Blake has committed murder but still looks like an innocent. Here we face a paradox that engages our attention to the movie. "Dead Man" ended with a tragic and allegorical scene , he is left on a sea while "Nobody" and Cole Wilson kill each other. I think the main point is that , this scene puts us in a situation that we know there is something beyond but we can't understand it exactly. Some people may interpret it in a positive view ,while the other persons consider it in a negative way. This movie also criticizes "Classic Westerns" by disobeying the typical and repetitive "Rules" of this genre (i.e. end of the film ), besides disapproves some religious person and behavior. Although music is influential but in some scenes , it seems that , music is preceding picture and I think this is not a positive point for a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most excellent, and Neil Young to boot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a marvel truly. I just wanted to mention (not sure if anyone else has pointed this out yet) that Neil Young played the soundtrack for Dead Man, and did so whilst watching the movie. Pretty freaking awesome, and the music is perfect for the happenings in the film. I also wanted to comment on the excellent acting by all the actors involved. The scenes with Billy Bob Thornton are righteously hilarious and I can't commend Johnny Depp and "Nobody"s acting enough. Fantastic. I have seen this movie about 20 times now probably and even bought the soundtrack (which was kind of hard to find). I recommend this film to anyone that loves great, strange movies, especially fans of Johnny Depp. Great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "sleeper" you won't sleep through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a surprise is this little-known film. Most "horse operas" are about as much like a real opera as "soap operas," but, as with most rules, there's always an exception -- and here it is! I know that Johnny Depp chooses his roles very carefully (although the criteria sometimes aren't exactly clear), and he must have rejoiced reading this script, which violates just about every convention of "Westerns" and turns a hackneyed genre into genuine art. Off-beat cinematography and pace changes contribute to the surrealistic feel of the film, but it could not have succeeded without the masterful performance of Gary Farmer as Native American "Nobody." He's really the central character, even if not the protagonist. If you're weary of Westerns, or if you like to watch Johnny Depp perform, or if you just want an unexpected treat, put "Dead Man" on your list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Blake poem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies ever made. A black &amp; white modern film noir (my definition: the protagonist falls into a terrifying situation, and the harder he tries to get out of it, the more he gets into it). Extremely original (thank you, Jim Jarmusch, for holding out against Hollywood mediocrity). No gratuitous exaggeration to mess up the noir (as in U-Turn), although there's one funny scene with Iggy Pop that would have been highly unlikely in reality. Since a very good general review already exists here, I won't do one. I mainly want to say that the whole movie is a poem. It would be really depressing if it were your life, but since you can watch it happening to Blake, you can see that the events lead to his release. I can't tell you about the important things in the movie, because you really need to experience them for yourself firsthand. Anyone who writes a spoiler review of this movie should be shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead man takes its time, but it gets there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a modern film noir western, and frankly who isn't, Dead Man will be exactly what you're looking for. Shot lovingly on black &amp; white, this deep and meaningful period drama/comedy/film noir/western/road movie is a slow look at old clichés. This movie like all of Jarmusch's doesn't run up and hit you on the head. If there is something important said quietly, it won't be repeated ad nauseam through the rest of the movie. Cinema can still be a subtle art, and this movie proves it. The photography as always in Jarmusch's films, was exceptional as was Depp's character arc, and if you look closely enough, you can see a bit of that Depp Bravado in there as well. This is not a movie for fans of Pirates of the Caribbean, this is for lovers of independent cinema. When I think of the classic westerns of the modern era, and frankly there aren't many Unforgiven and The Tracker are two, this will surely have to be mentioned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Dead Man' is certainly a very breath-taking journey to understanding how we take our final destination alone and the opening title surely makes the connection with the theme very well. Starting of the film is like snap shots taken from the different perspectives until it reaches its final. totally the ambiance is reflected very successfully with scenes showing sexual abuse, the brutality of people, and violent treadmill capitalist waging slave labour are very effectively. As the spiritual side of the film is obvious to see, at the foundation of US the sour earth policy towards natives may lead us to think more about the humanity, and how much people owe to them. Johnny Depp's play is really very artistic as he certainly reflects the change of a naive accountant into a mature personality and it is very difficult to take your eyes from him as he faints due to agony he bears. Music samples, which you have got the opportunity to listen at the end is fabulous and gives a bitter taste to film, as well the discrete scenes make you like you are a theater audience. Film's environment is very effective, and William's journey in a canon to the infinity is worth to see.</fullReview>

'The Marrage of Heaven and Hell'---is the thinking that fuels a film like this along. Johnny Depp is great---- cameos and one liners that are all strewn together at times but it shapes up to offer a refreshing visual story.There is this attempt to be 'weird' like in a Tim Burton film but, I find some of those elements the most entertaining---Billy Bob Thornton in an argument with Iggy? Nice familiar motif and somehow relaxes the viewer to believing that they are MEANT to be entertained---- Like a tipping of the hat--- 'Well quit talking about it and just do it!

		<shortDescription>Strange Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Congratulations! Your comment is ready for submission. Click Submit below to finish entering your comment. Comment preferences: Name: kennedya-1 Location: United Kingdom Preview: Summary: Strange FilmThis is truly a weird and fascinating film. I started to watch it half heartedly and was about to turn it off after Johnny Depp started doing his "eye thing" in the railway carriage but something (the photography ,the music?) made me compulsively stay with it. It looks as if the director has spent a some considerable time looking at post Civil war plates/photographs and then attempted to replicate on film the monochrome characters, clothing, weather and bleakness he found there. There is also a nice tip of the hat to William Blake's "dark satanic mills" in the factory in Machine made more infernal by Robert Mitchum's "psycho with a cigar" owner. In so far as Dead Man strives to replicate what is contained in the still images we have of the period it would seem to represent a more authentic version of frontier life than most of the genre(although to classify this as merely a genre Western is like describing Reservoir Dogs as just another Heist movie). This is not the Technicolour West of gold and amber sunsets,pastel coloured bandanas and perfectly tanned leather waistcoats colour co-ordinated with the hero's chestnut horse (a la the Duke or Randolph Scott). This is a much darker place where the population seem to bath about once every decade and are all drunk, mad or angry- or,in some cases, all three. The film is the best evocation so far on film of Native American mysticism and spirituality-something that has been tried with only a limited degree of success previously. I am thinking of Little Big Man and Dances with Wolves,to name just two. The fact that Gary Farmer as "Nobody" on initial introduction looks like a hybrid of Benny Hill and Michael Moore actually latterly in the film helps to humanise the character and give him greater depth and eventual kindliness (although he does manage to add to the film's not inconsiderable corpse tally). His fellow "Indians" are not from central casting and their lodges (or are they hogans?)and totems are like those of Canada or the Pacific North West the remnants of which could be seen in The National Geographic photographs of the 1950s. The spiritual dimension is carried off so successfully that in the end (hope I'm not disclosing the plot!) you do believe that William Blake just may be going to a better place where he might even meet his mystical/poetical namesake. A strange, different, mystical, dark but ultimately redemptive film. Thank God(or the Great Spirit) that someone is making stuff this good in a movie age of Special Effects blockbusters and tawdry remakes of 30 year old second rate television series. Finally I do not find the cannibalism totally unbelievable;surely it was not just the 20th century which bred serial killers who liked to casserole their victims!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An acquired taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSIt's not conventional, but the experienced viewer who has acquired a taste for Jarmusch will expect Dead Man to be bizarre, and it doesn't disappoint here. Much of it is not immediately accessible, again as hoped for. Beyond the style of the film, which is most certainly different, I do think the idea of a similarities between some American Indian thought and that of William Blake the poet is the most interesting one offered in this film. It seems we have here an allegory of how white American culture truly consists of lost souls. Our main orphaned character has apparently died already by giving up his soul to work in and for some kind of factory - the purpose of which we need not even know because it is already symbolic of the emptiness of the culture - in a town called Machine. A man on the train carrying our tragic hero asks why the "dead man" is going to hell. We get violence, seemingly casual in terms of the manner it is depicted, and we are informed that the people shooting each other own the guns they are so blithely using on each other "Because this is America." Then there's the scenes of cannibalism that really seem to drive home the point of how base and primitive this new west really is. Other lost souls, at least one even unsure of his own sexual identity, are encountered by a campfire; what else is there to do but shoot each other?Beyond these messages about the worthlessness of the culture upon which the American West was purportedly based, we do get haunting photography and a fine performance by Johnny Depp - he is appropriately bemused and taken aback by all the proceedings, and does give a nuanced performance in the midst of a polemic. So, yes, Dead Man can be seen as a sort of western on acid, as another review title pointed out. When all is said and done, and even beyond the sociocultural simplifications, it really does deserve points for being far from the orbit of usual Hollywood fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Jarmush film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Dead Man, I had never heard of Jim Jarmush, and the first time I saw it, I had rented the video by accident. Since then, I have become an avid fan of Jim's.My take on Jarmush's movies is that the plot does not take precedent over the visual structure of the film. This is highly unusual, but this is, in my opinion, the beauty of J.J.'s films. Coffee and Cigarettes, I believe, was the apex of J.J.'s style, which is why so many people disliked it. People tend to not like extremes. Dead Man, however, came with an engaging plot and amusing characters.Many of the comments on Dead Man talk about how philosophical, psychedelic,and existential it is. It may be, but I prefer not to look too deeply into the filmmaker's psychology or intention and enjoy the film for the beauty, sadness, and hilarity of the moments that it captures.</fullReview>

Neil Young's score perfectly compliments the change in scenery as we head towards the wild west. Crispin Glover's character sets a solid tone. He is a twisted soul who represents the white man out of his element, displaced by native spirits.Unfortunately, Nobody bothered me immensely. He continuously preaches to William Blake; and, at times, comes off as completely over the top.As for the campfire scene starring Billy Bob Jolie and The Stooges, it was wild and intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>our friend Detlef has done a good job of summarizing the movie, so i'll stick to the pros and cons and a few choice details. let me say that this is in my top three movies of all time, and is an absolutely essential movie for any serious movie fan.the acting and cast in this film are fabulous. it has so many well-known and well-respected actors in it that you would think it would be more well known. depp and gary farmer are stellar in their starring roles, and robert mitchum, iggy pop, billy bob thornton and lance henriksen all give excellent supporting performances.this movie is spectacular visually and symbolically, and deals very immediately with what it is to live and to die. in my ever-changing montage of worldviews and concepts of life on this dirty little pebble, this movie and its images stick with me. the oft-mentioned soundtrack by neil young is the perfect glue for it all- and the soundtrack album itself features excellent excerpts, including Johnny Depp's great reading of Plate 14 of Blake's "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" (an amazing work of philosophy that this movie seems to draw a lot of it's ideas from, and a must read for ANYONE.)the only real downside i can think of to this movie is that it moves very slowly. i see this as a good thing; it is methodical, beautiful and enveloping. but you have to be in the mood to watch it, if you understand what i mean. be prepared: Dead Man is more than a movie; it's an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can write about the briliant play of Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer. Like others did before. But one of the most striking things to me was the beautiful sound and music by Neil Young. Sometimes his guitar sounds like a thunder storm, sometimes the absence of his play intensifies the silence. In the end, when William Blake has entered the indian deadcamp you actually seem to here how losing consciousness sounds. Superb. In the same way that the black&amp;white film seems to intensify the the brightness and 'color' of the natural land, does the music provides the conversation with an extra layer. It cuts loose sentences, makes them stand on their own. In thes way it fragmantizes the story. I liked that a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much impressively, Dead Man shows how accidently an individual's identity can be changed, whether positively or negatively, according to his/her society. Throughout the movie, we can see how the hero, William Blake, is changed as he journeys Westwards, even though he doesn't seem conscious of the change. In the beginning he is a mere ordinary person who wants to get a job in a new town but as he is socialized in the new full-of-death society he is spiritually dead and reborn as a man whose life is just like that of the other killers in the society. Even though I saw the movie just once, I found there are many which make me very contemplative about it and human life and think every time I see it, there will be more and more things that will impress me. If you are a 'serious' person, especially about movies as well as life itself, I really recommend this movie to you. The cinematography and music are also fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting parable of the self and supposed spirituality at the end of life. I appreciate the stark tone and sparse dialogue, and the ambitious attempt at symbolism. As a movie, it just doesn't work. You can partially forgive the actors, who don't get much past character sketches because of the way the story is told. Farmer's Indian named Nobody is a well-realized exception.Neil Young's score is absolutely the best thing in this movie. Just one guitar with distortion. Fantastic. The cinematography is excellent also. It's very pretty (mostly) and nice to listen to, but as a movie it doesn't amount to much.The biggest problem here is that the story is just dull. I don't know how else to put it. There are a lot of baroque details along the way that could be thought-provoking if they were connected to the context of the story. But symbolism and metaphor are handled in a heavy-handed way - there's so much subtext that there isn't any room for the text. The scenes are strung together almost as non-sequiturs to create a mood and an idea. The story suffers and the result is disinterest.</fullReview>

Amazing story line of a man dying for most of the movie while taking a ride through the west with Nobody, his fat indian savior. Jarmush's work has some really weird moments (Iggy Pop) and still leaves this deeper meaning then the lightheartedness of the film portrays. What's so interesting about this film is the unique approach to music and the audience the film is focused at. It is is unlike any western that I ever seen. It flips the good and the bad (white men and indians) but keeps the overall theme of the western that you rout for the outlaw. Good flick, worth watching many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I readily and proudly admit to being a card carrying member of the middle america film audience. I firmly believe that if you ever set out consciously to make a work of art, you will fail, but if you set out to craft a solid work, you may very well succeed, Dead Man is such a solid creation.Successfully marrying several dramatic black and white mise-en-scenes lifted lovingly out of the art of Fredrick Remington, Bev Doolittle and CS Russell to the poetry of William Blake, director Jarmasch has created a complex, funny, surreal world that can only exist in the world of film.Containing a brilliant cast and phenomenal black and white photography, this film may be truly the only successful stream of consciousness western. It is as if, besides channeling the western artists mentioned above, Jarmasch channelled the spirits of Dali, Richard Brautigan and Ralph Steadman (who's still alive!) and a little Elizabeth Kubla-Ross(sp).Other aspects that make the film so memorable are the brilliant central casting of Gary Farmer (who has the great line: "Stupid F****ing white man") in a non-traditional and yet non "Dances With Wolves" stereotyped Native American sidekick as well as presence of Pacific Northwest Coastal Indian cultures. In the southwestern centric western film narratives of the past, this is a people largley ignored by Hollywood.Is this film for everyone? Certainly not. But if you desire to take to a chance on something different but haunting, I definately reccomend this film. (3 stars out of 4)</fullReview>

Anything that happens in between, while at times entertaining, has little point or bearing on the eventual outcome. This movie isn't terribly written. It's just a stupid story with no point. The saving grace of this film, earning it 5 instead of 1 or 2, would be the cast.

The title of the film is one. The second is Nobody's question "Did you kill the white man that killed you?". For those of you who are not familiar with the Bardo, it is an intermediate state.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Dead Man (1995)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp didn't adopt that weird hairdo first as Willy Wonka in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. He did that bob-hairdo as William Blake, an accountant in this movie. Directed by Jim Jarmusch, who did Coffee and Cigarettes, and Broken Flowers (starring Bill Murray in a role written for him), this is a black-and-white western tale about one man's extraordinary journey starting from the town of Machine.The introduction is queer, with seemingly endless and repetitive shots of Blake on a train from Cleveland to Machine, interspersed by scenes of the train wheels chugging along. He arrives in a strange town and discovered that the job which was waiting for him, had been filled. Lost, he wanders about town and got a one night stand with a lady.Alas, his life goes downhill from that point on, when the lady's ex-boyfriend arrives and a shootout occurs. Pinned with the blame of a double murder, Blake escapes to the wild west, and got rescued by Nobody, a native Indian, who is equally surprised at how Blake survived having a bullet so close to his heart. And still lodged.Hence an uneasy friendship between the two men is forged as they hold off bounty hunters after Blake (from a bounty of 200 to 2000 dollars), but Blake has to put up with Nobody's mumbo-jumbo and quoting of poetry. Indeed, the words of wisdom spewed is simply hilarious at times, as they just don't make sense.It's shot in black and white, and deliberately slow paced, so this might not appeal to everyone. However, the number of stars in this show will probably raise your interest level, like Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Robert Mitchum, Gabriel Byrne, Lance Henrikson, Michael Wincott, Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thorton, Alfred Molina and Steve Buscemi.But what's beautiful about the film is the awesome soundtrack from the rocksy/folksy guitars riffs of Neil Young. Which without, the movie would just not work. It's pretty violent in some of the shootouts, but nothing is made too outrageous. Keep your ears peeled at the dialogues and conversations too.So if you're a fan of Depp, why not give this movie a watch?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some comments on this movie about how unreal it is but I think it's only unreal if you aren't aware of the real world. The west had psychotic criminals in it, it was great for them because so much of the land was not subject to prying eyes. People who have not realized how nasty the real world is and was will see everything outside their reality as 'unreal', 'surreal' or symbolic. It amuses me.The movie is extremely real, the way the characters don't react that much is........Realistic! Who reacts to things the way people do in most normal movies? Yea it's drama but not real drama-trumped up. Movies are usually full of overreactions and transparent pretensions, while simultaneously leaving out the 'unbelievable' or greatly unsettling realities. This movie captures reality and reality itself is full of multidimensional meaning-symbols are only symbols because of what they represent, these aren't symbols, they are the originals on which symbols are based.Also I think there is an intelligence threshold thats pretty high for this film, either you're too dumb to get it or too locked in your current culturally based thought to get it, or you're not. The people who are too dumb to get it hate it (waves at boo from the UK). Everyone else either loves it or at least realizes it's a great film.Everything besides this has been (very well) said by other reviewers. Enjoy and I agree you should watch it twice and make sure you're in the mood to carefully and thoroughly watch without interruption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few months ago I watched the film, Ghost Dog, by this same director. I was interested to see some of his early work to see if I could find the progression to what led him to create the Forest Whitacre samurai story. Sadly, this was not found with Dead Man. What I did discover, and my wife commented on this as well, was a film directed and written by a man that thinks that he is a genius in the works of William Blake, the poet. We all remember these types of people from college. You know, the ones that sat in the back of the classroom wearing all black that read the works of Blake for fun and while getting high on a Friday night. Well, that guy sitting in the back of my class was Jim Jarmusch, and he proceeded to take his late night "hallucinations" and created the film Dead Man. This film was horrible. I don't use that word lightly, but this film ranks as one of the worst of 1995. While this film is on the top ten of most critics for that year, I would have to credit this to a lack of independent films in the mainstream market. 1995 was the year when independent films were just starting to become more mainstream. Audiences were not yet fully developed in films where actors would work for the art they were doing instead of the paycheck they were going to receive. So, I can only assume, that by today's standards this film would just be passed off as a "normal" film that was poorly written and horribly acted. BUT, in 1995, this film was praised as new and innovated because mainstream independent films had yet to be fully developed. This is the only reason that I can think for the popularity behind this film. The acting was horrible and the direction was choppy. Apparently, Jarmusch knew he could capture critics in his web by releasing a "new-age" story based in the Wild West. He also thought that he could use actors notorious for doing low-budget films (not yet called independent films) to create the story that he wanted. Unfortunately, what he got was a hodge-podge of different acting styles that just didn't seem to work in this film. The use of "fade to black" made me wish that he had used the song from the Rolling Stones to even further his point. This was also one of those films where Jarmusch knew he didn't have a very wordy script, so he included so many "staring off into space" scenes that were to symbolize life and complexities of nature. It didn't work for me in this film. I felt it was just more of filler than anything else. Also, I don't think that Neil Young's guitar was the best choice of music to bring me into the time (or era) that this film was based. I felt like I was, again, sitting in a dorm room one late night with a stoner who loved the poetry of William Blake and the music of Neil Young. In other words, had the entire pace of the film been quickened, perhaps Jarmusch's voyage into the depths of doom and despair may have been more effective. I would like to end with a quote from a critic about the film Dead Man. If you understand this, then I think you will really like this movie. If you do not, then you can join me in the front of the class smoking my candy cigarette."Enter the town of Machine, and you'll be processed as well. Just watch out for snags along the trail - they make the journey a bit annoying, and certainly longer than what is warranted by the reaches of the attention span...or simply the principles of artistic efficiency."What?

		<shortDescription>A Jim Jarmusch version of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 'Night on Earth' I had thought that Jim Jarmusch had lost a little of the sheen that made his movies so enjoyable. 'Night on Earth' sort of felt like he was treading the same waters of 'Mystery Train' but then he makes 'Dead Man' and blows me away. This is probably my favorite Jarmusch movie, maybe 'Stranger Than Paradise', occasionally 'Down By Law', and even sometimes 'Mystery Train', but usually I have the greatest affection for this take on the wild west. For the second time in his career, Jarmusch takes on genre moviemaking. The first being 'Down By Law' which was his version of a prison-break picture. 'Dead Man' is his version of a western and it's really a ton of fun. In my opinion, this movie is a Jim Jarmusch version of an action-packed Jerry Bruckheimer summer blockbuster. You've got a hot star in the lead in Johnny Depp, an old Hollywood veteran as the top bad guy in Robert Mitchum, a hammy and fun performance by Lance Henriksen as Mitchum's insaniac bounty hunter henchman, plenty of star cameos, a rock star composed soundtrack, lots of guns and violence, plenty of humor to go along with that violence, and even a few throwaway one-liners. It's the perfect recipe for a summer hit. I can make a million comparisons between this movie and 'The Rock', 'Con Air' and 'Armageddon'. Of course with every comparison, Jarmusch has a slightly askewed take on typical Bruckheimer conventions. That's what makes this movie so much fun. In the future, I hope Jim Jarmusch plays around with more genres. 'Ghost Dog' was a gangster/hitman movie. Wouldn't a Jim Jarmusch sci-fi be an absolutely amazing idea? I pray for it every night. Jim Jarmusch takes on David Cronenberg. He could call it, 'Stranger Than Parasites'. I'd try to be first in line for that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The journey IS the destination (with a few spoilers along the way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with a long prologue featuring a rather uncomfortable, easily spooked Depp; he appears to be someone who's never been away from home and, indeed, we learn that he just lost his parents and his best girl. He uses his savings to finance a long journey by train from Cleveland to the small, rural town of Machine, where he hopes to make a new start as an accountant. But one of his supposed employers just mocks him, while another aims a gun at him. Depp, disillusioned, finds himself using his very last penny to drink away his sorrow. A charming, sweet flower lady invites him to her home, where they're surprised by the girl's angry ex-lover. Guns are fired, blood is shed and all three are riddled with bullets, with Depp, although mortally wounded, being the only one coming out of the ordeal in one piece. But he's an outlaw now, a gunslinger with a price tag on his forehead.I saw this on video and after a few minutes, even before the opening credits, I'd already taken a severe liking to this motion picture.Robby Muller's photography and lighting; Jarmusch' mise en scene; the editing: all these elements are most likely to attract any filmbuff's attention. Unfortunately, the thin and somewhat meandering story was a bit of a let down. And because Jarmusch's constant use of fading (a simple, but very nice effect, which emphasizes beginnings and endings and resembles the opening or closing of your eyes), Dead Man is chopped into a few dozen short films, easily identifiable as great, good, or...well, not-so-good.But make no mistake, there are some rather wonderful sequences to be found in this film. The first half hour is top notch. Obviously, some people complain about the pace, but it is nice to experience the atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed Depp's arrival in Machine; the confrontation with his supposed employers; and the sweet moments between Depp and Tehl, the flower girl. After that, the film is occasionally beautiful as, I for one, didn't really care for the scenes with the bounty-hunters; the scenes with the deranged hillbillies, and I have mixed feelings about Crispin Glover's ominous cameo appearance. And I'm not a great fan of the film's humor, especially the running gag involving the tobacco was annoying.I wasn't able to see this film in one sitting (I actually had something of a social life a few months ago) but that was fine by me as this isn't exactly the cinematic equivalent of a page-turner (perhaps it is the cinematic equivalent of a glass of your finest, most expensive wine: nipping is a must; chuck-a-lugging a most definite no-no). I admired the film's style, but I found myself caring significantly less about where all of this was going. The last twenty minutes had me glued to the screen again. What it was all about? For my money, the journey IS the destination, and I liked the trip, despite the fact that this was a rather bumpy ride. I admired the view but was annoyed by some of my fellow travelers, so to speak.One of the things I liked best about Dead Man is the fact that it starts with a psychical journey (by train) and slowly, the film itself becomes a journey of the soul. Depp's nerdish character (a real square, mrs. Mia Wallace would deduct in the blink of an eye), had his trip mapped out and everything, but reluctantly had to adjust to the constant changes along the way, and, to his own surprise, found himself perfectly capable of doing so.O yes, I loooved Neil Young's score.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man has that surreal quality that pulls you in to its world, much like other atmospheric movies like Blade Runner, it exists in a world all its own. And it is filled with quirky, unusual characters. Johnny Depp is appropriate for the role of William Blake, a greenhorn from Cleveland who comes out west to fill an accounting position he believes is reserved for him. The train ride in the beginning sets the tone of the movie, which is a journey from civilization to the chaos that awaits him. With each sequence in that opening scene, the train ride becomes more surreal, as the passengers become more and more untamed. When he gets to the end-of-the-line, he discovers that his job has been filled, and in a nightmarish chain of events, he finds himself on the run for murder, with a bullet in him. He is found by an Indian named Nobody, who believes he is the poet William Blake. He becomes his guide in an hallucinating journey towards death. The ending of the movie can be seen as puzzling or unresolved, but it's not so much the conclusion as the point, but in the journey itself. Not everyone will get this movie, because it remains surreal throughout the journey, but it is filled with an enjoyable collection of characters, with lots of cameos by many good actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have come to bury this dead man, and not to praise it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man's atmospheric soundtrack and 'western noir' look try to drug the audience into critical insensibility by a carefully contrived 'hipness' - but there is not a shred of substance beneath the style. The only real content in this alluring but clumsy mess is vulgar, doltish sendup of the same Western movie cliches it otherwise blindly embraces.Worse still, it's insufferably pretentious. For example, Nobody taking Blake for the famous poet. Here Jarmusch flatters a lazy audience content to admire their own sophistication in getting the 'in-joke' and consequently don't care that he is incapable of developing this gimmick into a worthwhile idea. Its main function appears to be to allow Blake to ask an assailant 'Do you know my poetry?' before blowing him away. I could easily believe the whole film was constructed around this glibly marketable sound-byte.Dead Man is shot so full of holes that viewers can fill as they please - wishful thinking might suggest that carelessness was intended, that Nobody was magically transforming Blake for mystical reasons, that Blake was already a 'dead man' and his journey a dream or a purgatory. None of this tallies with the publicity interviews. Dead Man isn't a deliberately non-naturalistic exploration of the violence and illogicalities of civilisation - it is merely violent and illogical itself - a reflection of rather than a comment on our cultural poverty.Maybe I've missed the point entirely - perhaps it was never meant to achieve anything beyond looking 'cool'. Dead Man might be dead on arrival, but it's left a good looking corpse, and that's good enough for a lot of people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting idea but unfortunately not fully realized. Refreshing black-and-white photography. Nice sardonic touches. Has its moments -- but not all moments equally good. Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket.I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The long awaited reviewing of a movie I've often trashed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm only somewhat happy to say that it's nowhere near as bad as I remembered it ? I rated it a dismal 2/10 after just one viewing. Since I first saw it, probably around a decade ago, I've educated myself in both Westerns and Jarmusch, and I can judge it better being more familiar with its referents. My judgment now: still not very good. To be fair, I can't say that I'm the biggest Jarmusch fan. I've seen most of his movies now, and the only one that works for me on any large level is his most recent, Broken Flowers. That film just blows me away. Other than that, I did like Mystery Train. All of the other films I've seen of his, which include Coffee and Cigarettes, Down by Law, Stranger Than Paradise and Dead Man itself, work for me up to a point. After that point, they just bug me. My specific complaint about Dead Man is that it seems to want to be profound, or at least people think it is (the lead comment on IMDb right now begins: "A profoundly spiritual film speaking to our true human nature in a world of illusion"), but it also wants to be a goofy / weird comedy. That goofiness is fun at times, but definitely kills any apparent profundity. And, dammit, how can anyone take it the least bit seriously with that damn fat Indian? I hate the character of Nobody, and hate Gary Farmer's performance. If it weren't for him, I think I'd like the film. I like a lot about it. First and foremost, the cinematography is outstanding. I also love the quirky costume design. And the supporting performances are fun. I personally don't think Jarmusch is trying to be profound at all. I think the goofiness was more of his intention. In that case, it would have been better if it had been trimmed a bit. This is his longest film, I think, and, even besides Nobody, it overstays its welcome. While I don't hate it anymore, this is certainly my least favorite of Jarmusch's films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Read this comment only if you've already seen the film.A recent Jim Jarmusch interview shed some interesting light on this production. He labeled his film a "black and white, psychedelic western" and mentioned a fight with studio bosses, when Jarmusch wouldn't accept the creative input of test audiences. Perhaps the test audience didn't like caustic existentialism, preferring the mild pathos of something like "Cast-Away".-A marshal dies with his head resting on top of a fan of splayed sticks, resembling a halo from religious paintings. Cole comes along and malignantly stomps on it after noticing the religious imagery. Immediate gore ensues, along with a more disturbing thought. I think Jarmusch implied that those "saints" that religious people consider holy were once just regular people who take on a divinity in the imagery and mythology we use to represent them.-At the end of the film, when Nobody seeks to send the dying Blake to heaven, the ceremony goes horribly wrong. Nobody kills and is killed by the pursuing Cole Wilson; a helpless Blake can only lay in his sea-canoe and watch. The scene is psychedelic but nowhere near spiritual. I don't think Jarmusch thought his protagonist was going anywhere at all.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not here to bash this film or the actors in it, but i will tell you exactly what i took away from this movie.First off Neil young was hired to play electric guitar through out this movie? WHY? It was severely annoying having to hear the same 3 chords that my 12 year old nephew could play easily through the whole movie. it did not convey any kind of dread with me it was just annoying.The scenes were just kinda silly, William Blake (johnny depp) did not act like anyone on the run. He had no money a revolver with 5 shots in it. When some marshals show up he kills them and doesn't even bother to search the bodies for anything useful. He comes upon a deer that has been shot in the neck i'm assuming for him to eat because the Indians were following him, he cuddles up next to it and takes a nap instead of eating it even though they clearly make a point to show that he is starving in a earlier scene. At one point they are in a general store they kill the keeper but only take some tobacco? Why not load up on ammo and maybe just maybe do something about the fact he is shot again. They could have stopped the bleeding easily and the fact they know they are being followed and left the other canoes intact. Why not destroy them so that wasn't a possibility? So that either means the main characters are severely stupid or the filmmaker has no idea what a regular person would do in these situations The scene with Billy Bob Thorton and Iggy pop dressed in drag was completely hysterical I laughed loud at that, Johnny Depp is one of my all time favorite actors, and the way the director wanted him to play the part he did a excellent job.That said i really didn't like this movie that much, i wanted to because i seen all the good reviews here but it just didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well maybe I'm just a Philistine but I certainly have to dissent from all the rave reviews this film has gotten. It happens I like my westerns traditional, John Ford, Howard Hawks, Delmar Daves, Burt Kennedy, those guys make westerns. Jim Jarmusch makes weird.So does Johnny Depp who I salute for having the artistic courage to play an incredible variety of roles. I love what he did in Edward Scissorhands, Nick of Time, and in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. But he came up short in playing William Blake, the guy who is not the famous English poet.This William Blake travels west spending every dime he has on a promise of a job keeping books for a metal works company owned by Robert Mitchum. When he arrives late, he's told the job is filled. He casually drifts into a relationship with a woman and wouldn't you know it, she's the gal pal of Gabriel Byrne, Mitchum's son. Byrne comes in guns blazing and catches Depp and his woman en flagrato. He shoots the woman and Depp shoots him in self defense.No matter, Mitchum's the big he bull of the area and a bounty goes on Depp's head. In the words of that immortal 20th Century philosopher Joe Louis, he can run but he can't hide. Not even with the help of a new found Indian friend in Gary Farmer.A lot of reviewers extracted meaning from obscure things in this film which wanders rather aimlessly with Depp's fugitive status. I extracted nothing, but boredom.But Dead Man might be your cup of tea, it certainly isn't mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolutely Brilliant Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more times I see Dead Man and the more I think about all of its powerful subtleties the more I love it. It is rare to find a movie with so much depth. Many people, after the first viewing, will walk away confused for this is not a typical brainless Hollywood movie. You do not see this film and then, as soon as it's over with, forget about it. Dead Man is the kind of movie that you see a second or third time and discuss with others. There is so much to think about and discuss on so many different levels. It deals with everything from Native American beliefs and traditions concerning shamans and tobacco to the technological progression of mankind and its effect on the natural world to the fundamental concepts of life and death to the meaning and morality of violence. It deals with death as a concept with different views of it influenced by cultural relativity. As an American I have a certain world-view that is relative to the life that I lead and the society that I live in but this movie offers a glimpse into an alternate perspective where death is just another part of life. It is believed to not necessarily be the end, which is represented by the tradition of sending the dead or dying person in a boat with food and supplies; as if it is the beginning of a new journey.Neil Young's score paired with the film style of high contrast black and white serve to further enhance the tale. They both add to the rugged and strange atmosphere.Dead Man as a whole is an entirely striking experience that leaves the viewer full of philosophical questions. Any William Blake or Dante educated viewer will be impressed with the way allusions and even direct quotes are slipped so casually and fittingly into the film.Anybody with an open and inquisitive mind will walk away from this film very impressed. It is such a relief to see a film that seems to think unlike most mainstream movies (though I would hardly call this film mainstream) these days with their predictable plot lines and mindless moral points. Any movie that makes me think as much as this one did is sure to have done something right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when it comes to the art house scene, America provides slim pickings. and by art house i don't mean independent/IFC sponsored films, i mean more in spirit, as in compared to bergman, tarkovsky, etc. movies which are not so much concerned with actual events/stories plotted to timelines as the exploration of the spiritual and mystical aspects of the human existence. movies where logic is abandoned and dreams are encouraged. dead man is one of the few American movies to fit in this genre. the story concerns a young man who moves to north west America to take up a new job. however, he does not get the job and soon gets into trouble, which puts him on the run in the countryside. there he meets native Americans and has various encounters/adventures. the story as such is nebulous, the main points it makes are in spirit. as such it does not even try to make a point, you just feel it, like blood beating through your veins. johnny depp, for a marquee actor, gives a very good performance. the supporting cast is also very good as is the camera work/visuals. the soundtrack is very unusual and while arresting can be annoying at times. as an American i am proud to recommend this artistic gem of world class quality. geocities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, first off, Deltef (from Germany) seemed to sum up the movie well (a little too well since he gives some spoiler details but it really doesn't take much away from the film). A friend marveled at how this film is poetic in a way most films aren't. There really isn't much of a plot, just a man in unfamiliar surroundings, put in a situation much unlike his current life (from accountant to killer is quite a jump) and how he copes (or doesn't cope for that matter). The entire film is in black-and-white and even looks like a relic of the 19th century. The Indian Nobody offers some humor and many philosophical meditations on life itself (mostly in the context of William Blake's poetry....again making the film itself a kind of celluoid poem). There's some additional comic relief in the many assorted cameos throughout the film (Iggy Pop, Crispin Glover, Billy Bob Thornton, etc). In my opinion, The one aspect of the film that ties it all together has to be Neil Young's soundtrack work. His haunting, rustic, distorted guitar (with no other accompaniment) provides an eerie background to a man's eventual demise. Not the most exciting or driven film I've seen, but it has beauty on its own terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing" AKA something similar like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The referred quote in the title of this review on "Dead Man" comes from Nobody the Indian character played by Gary Farmer, a smart and experienced man who helps William Blake (do not confuse with the poet) the character played by Johnny Depp to run off a group of marshals on his chase, after the murder of a man (Gabriel Byrne), and accused of the murder of this man's fiancée (Mili Avital). The already mentioned quote says much about the film in a strange way, since this is a work that doesn't say anything new, or almost anything at all, but it has a silent and mysterious appeal to many audiences and for some odd reason I enjoyed it a lot, despite its emptiness.Good points favorable to "Dead Man": a good ensemble casting with names like Depp, Byrne, Iggy Pop, Robert Mithcum, Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, Alfred Molina, Jared Harris, Billy Bob Thornton, Crispin Glover and others, but most of them appear in small parts, and of course a great performance from Gary Farmer, who shadows Depp's character for the most part. Another great thing is the cinematography by Robby Müller, creating an European look to an American story set in 1800's.On the downer side comes a annoying and repetitive soundtrack composed by Neil Young, which seems out of place in some moments, very distractive. The film doesn't know how to hold its audience for too long; and there isn't much of a purpose neither a statement in the sense of telling something important. You can try and try again to find a meaning to it but there's none. Perhaps it's just a tribute to western directed by Jim Jarmusch (he made better things than this one, but still a good watchable film). The only thing that sounded like a meaning for this film comes of Depp's character, all he was trying to do is working out his own salvation, but instead he only got condemnation by killing several characters in the story. But the Indian helped him to save his life and perhaps even his soul.There's some absurd, being the most incredible the fact of Depp, a injured character, badly wounded, that happens to travel from distances, running away from villains, walking calmly and feeling just a little pain. It's not a brutal western but it has its great amount of violence (often portrayed by Lance Henriksen's mean character, including a scene where steps on a dead guy's head, that spills lots of blood and bones). As someone says in "Dead Man": there's the ones who are born for joy, and other ones for endless nights, sadness. Which one was the audience while watching this film? 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cinematography, mediocre plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first Jarmusch film, Dead Man, is a re-visionist western about wandering writer William Blake who, as well as being mistaken for the poet of the same name, becomes hunted by assassins ordered to avenge the death of an industrialists daughter. The first thing that struck me about Dead Man was its cinematography. The tonal blend of dark shades and dazzling whites make for some stunning photography, lending itself wonderfully to the dreamlike state of the scenes in the film. The shimmering hue of the black and white combines well with the short cuts that repeatedly fade to black in a style reminiscent of silent film. This technique works well in Dead Man as it helps develop the disjointed and ethereal mood of the film, adhering to the premise that Depp's character is slowly dying, a theme lying at the heart of this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty decent Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dead Man" stands out from most modern day Westerns because it does not try to glamorize the old American West. It pretty much tells it like it was and presents things from the point of view of someone who (like the audience) is used to more civilized surroundings.Johnny Depp looks and acts convincingly in the part of a "tenderfoot" who has ended up a nightmarish situation and has turned to violence as a means of survival. However, as we soon find out, he is only prolonging the inevitable.The other characters are also very good with some excellent performances all round.I like it because it does not glorify the era like "Young Guns", "Tomestone", "Ned Kelly" and other such pictures. It also makes it's point about the US Government's systematic slaughter of it's natives without getting on it's soap box like "The Last Samurai" and "Dances With Wolves".Bad points for me were - 1) it became pretentious and overlong towards the end and - 2) there was always a feeling that I was watching "Pulp Fiction" set in the old West. The opening sequence (dialogue heavy and titles to follow were straight out of Tarentino) and the red-neck rapists in the woods were either a big nod towards QT or maybe it was just me.Very enjoyable, but just because it's by a cool, art-house director does not make it the best Western ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie parallels life beautifully, almost too beautifully... It takes a rather inane situation, as most of us live in our day-to-day lives, and tries desperately to suffuse it with meaning. Life has become too concrete, but we want to believe it's bottomless, so we stomp and stomp on the pavement hoping it will shatter under the weight of our frustration. It is almost a role-reversal in existential terms; it's usually about finding meaning in a meaningless world. The way people are reacting to this superficial film is trying to instill a sense of ethereal candor because they can't get over the fact that quoting Blake throughout and calling someone Nobody is not an essay on the meaning of life. So much so that all this kind of approach does is abandon the concept of nonverbal significance in life and focus on concrete words and moments... Now, it is easy to dismiss this kind of comment as someone who didn't understand the film... people become irritated because they are insecure about their own opinions, and feel that validation is needed for their own little psychic survival.. if someone told me I was green and had 4 heads, I'd laugh at them because it's completely untrue according to my notion of reality... if I take them seriously, it's because I'm second-guessing my own opinion. I realize I didn't comment much on the movie itself, but that's only because it was a wretched waste of time to watch.</fullReview>

It plays like a Jerry Lewis throwaway film that is plodding and unfunny where I assume humor is supposed to be. Nobody is played laughably by Gary Farmer. This film has some decent actors doing there best with bad material. I guess it's nice to have friends in the business Jim.

		<fullReview>Wish I'd Read the Comments/Summaries First...because if I had I might've liked the movie better. I was never sure if this was a very corny comedy or a really bad melodrama. (It's difficult to tell!) At any rate, I lost interest right around where creepy Crispin came in, but managed to stubbornly bore(d) through the rest of it. Not sure if that was a good idea.What a waste of Gary Farmer!! Actually what a waste of a hilariously gathered group of actors--some of my favorites ever: Lance Henriksen, Gary F., Johnny Depp, John Hurt, Alfred Molina--even Mr. Robert Mitchum! My recommendation: Fast-forward this puppy, the missing frames make it feel all the more like a cheesy 1900's silent film (especially the "Indians" scenes). After all, isn't that what Jarmusch was trying for? (Actually, whatever he was trying for, I don't think it got there. For instance, he went too long with dead close-ups on Depp's face and then brushed through the "million buffaloes slaughtered" without a backward glance. Dramatic Neil Young guitar twangs would make me jump and question whether I had just missed some dramatic moment in an unchanging camera shot that had been staring at trees for 82 seconds.)Too bad. It was a promising idea. What a waste!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excuse me but 17,956 IMDb votes, 5,556 of them being 10's, for a film that was a box office and DVD failure strikes me as studio-fed corruption of this website. I have no clue how IMDb can prevent such input and still allow regular moviegoers to rate their films.JOHNNY DEPP can be interesting to watch even in a bad movie, and that's why I chose this for my Blockbuster free rental. In this so-called story, DEPP arrives in an Arizona frontier town expecting a job as an accountant. When he finds out from Robert Mitchum (herein a certified raving lunatic) there is no job, he soon rescues a pretty girl who's been tossed into a mud puddle. Love sparks; but then the girl is shot by her ex-fiancé, as Depp returns fire. He'll be pursued by 3 bounty hunters, therein the plot setup.DEPP soon meets an Indian named Nobody, who teaches DEPP many things; but none of them is that when escaping bounty hunters it's better to gallop than just stroll along at a slow-ride. One thing leads to another and we'll get a transvestite scene, a homosexual scene, a few murders, a cannibal scene (roast arm and hand), a bare-butt fat guy scene, and a canoe paddling scene --- all of this moving along at a snail's crawl and is in no way Daring! Mysterious! Exciting! On the contrary, Jim Jarmusch has created a film of willful and unparalleled stupidity --- not giving away the plot --- but moving from one stupid scene to another without a trace of intelligent film-making.As the characters mosey along for 7 or 8 days at maybe 5 mph, they eventually end up in western Canada (British Columbia) -- the land of many lakes and totem poles --- which, as we all know, is in the north end of Arizona.The film supposedly has a Sizzling Soundtrack by Neil Young. In fact, it's the kind of humdrum random guitar strumming used in most born-to-be-awful westerns. The good part is that according to the box the film is 121 minutes, but in fact it ends after 1 hour 51 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Apocalypse Now" of the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics really took a beating on "Dead Man" when it came out. I remember not hearing much about the film until just recently, and I looked up some critics' reviews and was surprised to see some exceedingly positive, and others unbelievably low, filled with venemous hatred for the film.After seeing the film, I can understand why. You either love it or hate it; "get it" or "don't get it." I think I got it. Or, at least, I appreciated it. Yes, it does get quite long at times. Yes, it's pretentious. A bit _too_ pretentious at times, maybe. But it's still a very unique, interesting twist on the western motion picture formula with solid direction, excellent performances and a killer soundtrack by Neil Young. (It's eerie and fits the mood and tone of the movie perfectly.) The story follows a man named William Blake (Johnny Depp) who, at the turn of the 20th century, ventures by train to a deserted town in search of a stable job. When he arrives, he finds out the position has already been fulfilled, and he is left helpless, eventually falling into the arms of a local prostitute. Later that night, her boyfriend (Gabriel Byrne) returns home, finds them in bed together, and shoots them both, killing the woman and injuring Blake. Blake returns fire, kills the man, and flees into the night, waking up in the arms of an Indian who nurses him back to health.Meanwhile the man's father (the late Robert Mitchum in his final screen performance) sends a group of hired killers (led by Lance Henriksen) after Blake, who is mistakenly assumed by the Indian to be the famous poet of the same name.Jim Jarmusch's western twist instantly reminded me of "Apocalypse Now," not just through its theatrical style and scope but also because of its critical reaction. If you'll recall, "Apocalypse Now" received very mixed review upon its initial release, and was condemned for being pretentious and overly-artsy -- just like "Dead Man." And like "Dead Man," each year it seemingly gains new loyal fans who have boosted it into the realm of masterpiece. Now the critics love "Apocalypse Now." It makes me wonder what they'll think of "Dead Man" in thirty years.There are some flaws, though. As I pointed out before, Jarmush does act a bit pretentious behind the camera sometimes. Although as a film buff I enjoyed the opening sequence, it does go on too long, and doesn't make much sense. It's sort of bizarre for the sake of being bizarre at times. (And this method continues throughout the entire picture.) The huge cast is filled with eye-popping cameos (just like "Apocalypse") and this is both for better and for worse.Johnny Depp is excellent in the lead role. The movie takes on a hallucinogenic quality so everything is rather distorted, including his performance. It's distant and watered, his behavior rippling. Depp nails it.The political correctness of the film is something "Apocalypse" avoided -- for example the black gunslinger. Just from a historical perspective, it would never have been. Also, they didn't wear braided hair back then. Some of the "modernized" elements of the film were a bit unwelcomed, ruining the historical aspect. (And I'm not just referencing ethnicity, I'm referencing modernizing elements of the story in general, and the time period.) Overall I do think this film is quite misunderstood by a majority of regular filmgoers, and the critics bagged on it too heavily when it first came out. But evidently, judging from its impressive standing on IMDb, some people have "got it" and the movie is at least creating some sort of effect after all these years. I just liked it because it's a unique film, and I respect that in any movie made nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pretentious film from a great filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a handful of Jarmusch's films and this one is clearly his worst. A meandering, senseless narrative accompanied by some first rate actors. Jarmusch has always been one to put his characters first but this time he goes too far--the story suffers for it. It's as if Jarmusch thought of some really interesting characters then had to bind them altogether with an afterthought plot.Also, I'm amazed at how people heap praise upon the look of the film. Let's make no mistake about it: Jarmusch knows how to handle the camera. However, this film is plain ugly. There is no rhyme or reason as to why it has the high-contrast look. Mr. Jarmusch apparently lacked a vision for his film and threw on the tired art-house film high contrast b&amp;w look to make pseudo-sophisticates think: "Wow, the cinematography is beautiful."Before getting into Jarmusch's films I was told by others to start with Dead Man to break into his world. I'm glad I didn't otherwise I would never have bothered to check out his other superior films. If a reader of this review wants to know where to begin, start with "Ghost Dog" which is a more accessible and infinitely superior film.</fullReview>

It gets annoying after a while.As I watched this odd movie, it appeared to be an extremely low budget film with a surprisingly really good cast (Johnny Depp, Robert Mitchum, Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thornton, John Hurt and Gabriel Byrne) who must have donated their time to do this flick. I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, but even Johnny in this couldn't hold my interest for too long. The Indian was so strange, and so white, with a voice that sounded like Rush Limbaugh....for a moment, I wondered.....could it be? Nah.

		<fullReview>The conception of the movie was quite interesting and the visuals were intriguing. Unfortunately about 1/3 of the movie was extremely annoying. The culprit: overly long artistic shots overlaid with 70's era electric guitar. There were way way too many such shots, and by the end my ears almost hurt from the overuse of the electric guitar and the lack of anything else, except the brief patches of dialog and occasional gunshot.Overall the movie had the feeling of someone trying to recreate a silent movie or early talkie, only with edgier and sharper visuals. The problem I have is that for almost 90% of the movie a slide show would have been as effective, or more effective. Movies move.Anyway, the net result is an arthouse movie trying too hard to be an arthouse movie. Maybe if you are into such movies you will enjoy it, but the average viewer will probably not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubt what so ever that Jim Jarmush is a very talented writer and filmmaker. There's also no one in the world who doubts about the fact that Johnny Depp is one of the greatest actors alive and thé best actor of his generation. No one should even doubt about the fact this whole cast is awesome. Lance Henriksen ( I'm very pleased to see he gets some praising outside his B-movie roles ) , Michael Wincott ( probably the actor with the best voice out there ), Billy Bob Thornton, Robert Mitchum, Alfred Molina and a bunch of other great names. All of these are pro elements I would say. But yet, Dead Man disappointed me a little. I don't know, maybe my expectations towards it were a bit high but that was normal I thought. Also, I can't really find out what was wrong with it in my opinion. The story is very good but there were a little troubles to stay focused the whole time. I never actually received good feeling with the main character. I doubt this is Johnny Depps fault, I don't think the script allows the viewer to have good contact and feeling with the leading characters. But I guess that was what I missed a little. There isn't much action but that isn't necessary. The dialogues are a bit too long from time to time but they contain great moments as well. The wisdom the Indian gives us is from a high quality. William Blake arrives in a small town called Machine. He was promised a job there as a book-keeper. By the time he arrives, the job is already taken by someone else and Bill is alone again. He walks home a girl and spends the night with her. In the morning they get a visit from the ex-fiancé of the girl and he and the girl die. William runs away but doesn't know the man was the son of the very important Mr. Dickinson. He's the owner of the metal industry and he sends a couple of the most feared assassins on their way to find William. In the meantime, William found help and guidance from an Indian named ...Nobody Dead Man is a good choice when you're in the mood for an evening of quality film. The filming in black and white certainly gives the right atmosphere to tell the story. But still, I wouldn't say it's one of the greatest movies out there. Above average, certainly...but definitely not a must-see ! Recommended for the cast and the original story. If you want to relax and not worry about anything..rent something else. My humble opinion on Dead Man = 7/10</fullReview>

This movie is nothing more than an overrated, pretentious pile of steaming camel excrement from the dreary, foul realms of Hell.The first quarter of this movie had me intrigued. There was a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere about it. But after that, it's just Johnny Depp and his racist Indian friend walking around in what-seems-to-be a forest (so much for a Western!) for the rest of the movie. The acting all around is so pathetic, especially by Depp. It almost seems as if he's barely even trying. It's just him wandering about speaking a few lines, then moving on. Of course, I'm not sure if he's to blame here, but overall, it's bad. The music is the WORST I've ever heard in a movie. EVER. It's just a distorted guitar motif on and off for the entire film - THE ENTIRE FILM!This movie being in black and white is nothing clever. Not like the pretentious hack Jim Jarmusch (director) would like to believe it is. It makes the entire film seem more uninspired and soulless. A useless strategy for a useless film. I can barely go on with this review like I could barely go on with the movie. Anyways, I'd like to point out that this is barely to be considered a Western film. If it is, then it gives the entire genre a bad name. The fact that I took time to write a review for this bloated piece of garbage is as generous as I could be. It's pretentious, boring, and an overall waste of time. If you watch this, then that'll be 120 minutes you will never retrieve. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not entirely satisfactory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An art-house flick disguised as a Western, and rather drably executed. Depp stars as an accountant from back East headed West to start a new life. In the process, he crosses paths with the wrong people and becomes the West's most notorious outlaw, with a $2,000 bounty on his head. The irony of this is played out in several wobbly shootouts, where no one except Depp seems to be able to properly hit their target. And he isn't exactly a crack shot, just a lucky one. In this, he also has some considerable help from a goofy, poetry-spouting redskin (Gary Farmer) who saves his life and then becomes his sidekick, a sarcastic and rather fat Tonto. This being an art-house flick, it is shot in stark black and white and contains several surreal scenes as Depp frequently fades in and out of consciousness after being shot not once but twice. In fact, he faints more often than all of the characters combined in Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. It all comes to nothing in the end, and can hardly be called one of Depp's better efforts. For those, see EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, DON JUAN DE MARCO, CRY BABY, DONNIE BRASCO, FROM HELL, SLEEPY HOLLOW, CHOCOLAT and PIRATES. Lots of familiar faces pop in and out of this one, to little avail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thought I might contribute again to this website to console that small enthusiastic voice in my head telling me my opinion on Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man actually matters, and can affect your lives in some trivial cinematic way.Dead Man is bigger than a cult film. More people like it, and most will assure you that it is in some way assertive and profound. I disagree, on the basis of the film itself and on the director's entire career. It is not every day when you find a director like Jarmusch who is arrogant enough to advocate and support his own mediocre works as if they were untouchable segments from the I Ching, and he seems to do it with a great strain of confidence that strangely does not seem to confuse him. It would confuse me if I were confident about the value of movies like Dead Man and Coffee and Cigarettes if I had made them. I would most likely wonder why I would not be putting my head down in black awkwardness and shame at having created an object the thinness of which would be inevitably discovered by somebody more authentic than me. But Jarmusch takes his own mutterings for revelations, even when, as in Dead Man, they are the most complacent. They are satisfied with their achievements, assuming that they are apotheoses rather than blocks, and do not have any meaning behind them as a result of it. Take, for instance, an exceptional and endlessly ambitious movie like Amelie. The director, fortunately, cannot stop himself from producing and creating. He is never satisfied, and always sees potential even in the most accomplished reels. We are impressed by something in the film, an intricate human moment, and would be grateful for its own impressive value alone, but are then taken over the edge by another quality that has been placed on top of it, a consequence of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's endless generosity and prolific creativity. Dead Man does not advocate such productivity. It is content with its own vacuous minimalisms and empty signs, a quality that is, I think, derivative of the director's ego. We seem to stagnate only when we have time to brood over ourselves and our reputations, and Jarmusch seems to me to have had much of this kind of time between shots. The auteur makes a profession out of listening to himself. Jarmusch just happens to be stuck in his own personal monotone.</fullReview>

I think the main point to this film is that it was good to see Johnny Depp do some major soul searching like he did after he discovered that the job that he wanted was taken by someone else. He travelled all that way by train only to find out that the person who was supposed to interview him wasn't even there to start. As a result, someone else had to tell him that the position he sought was already filled.However........ anyways.............. this is why I gave this film a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, overrated Lynch-wannabe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first Jarmusch film, and a good reason to not bother with any others; Dead Man was absolutely terrible. If Jarmusch was aiming for the feel of a Lynch-imitating student film, he succeeded, but he certainly failed to make something watchable. With one of Johnny Depp's dullest performances, an almost non-existent story, and a plot so simultaneously senseless and boring as to make your head swim, one gets the feeling that Jarmusch has "cred" only because so few have actually watched this dreck. In the interest of brevity, I'll mention the terrible direction (characters and scenes are thrown willy-nilly in front of the camera, with no real consideration; the constant fades quickly grow annoying) and the even-worse writing (no doubt responsible for Depp's poor performance), both of which are attributable to Jarmusch alone, only in passing.Basically? Don't bother with it. You'll find the occasional adequate scene, but never anything of true quality; nothing that even approaches the regard with which Jarmusch is held. You'll also find a whole lot of bad. I gave it a 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not getting it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The emperor has no clothes. What is everyone talking about in these great reviews? I can certainly enjoy a film out of the ordinary (pacing, b/w, editing, etc.) -- but this? It's clumsy. Stilted. And certainly not believable in any sense. I strongly suspected something was amiss in the first five minutes when the train ride west was belabored and cut awkwardly to the point of eliciting laughter. Being different doesn't automatically equal being good. I wouldn't normally write to disparage someone's work -- but this film needs some balance in the reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadman could have been an excellent movie. The major and possibly the only flaw in the entire movie was the casting of the role of 'Nobody'. Why couldn't Gary Farmer have lost 50 lbs before he starred opposite Johnny Depp... he was way too much overweight to be a begging, exhiled native American. That made all scenes including him unbelievable. It's a good movie but it could have been excellent.Johnny Depp as always played his role most excellently, even though he had fewer lines than any other movie i've seen him in. I hate it when movies have huge potential to be a classic and ruin it by not carefully casting the roles. And that's my 2 cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As dead as the title suggests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard of the rave reviews of this film, and being such an avid fan of Depp, i really wanted to watch this movie. But after seeing it i was appalled to watch a movie with no sense. From the lack of a strong plot, to the fact that this movie seem to be going no where -just steering its way blindly - this movie is a total big incoherent art which has no element of entertainment whatsoever. I don't know why the producers even bothered producing this total crap which is also very boring and slow moving. Plot is the core of any movie, and this movie just has none of that. Some viewers crack their heads thinking this movie has a subtle meaning to it, drawing every possible connection of the hollowness of this movie and making it seem brilliant. Unfortunately, in truth, this movie has no brilliance or centrepiece of a message. Seriously, if this movie is so brilliant, how come people have different opinions about it. Shouldn't it be transpired with just one opinion? The only thing that made this movie marginally watchable, is the versatility exhibited conspicuously by the great Johnny Depp and for the guitar soundtrack which could be heard intermittently. Everything else is a total waste of time to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I voted this movie with a 2/10 because I did not like it. I saw Ghost Dog as well and I did not like. It seems that I don't like Jim Jarmusch movies (but Coffee and Cigarettes - I loved this one). The thing is I don't know why - I really don't. Jim Jarmusch tries o show "reality" of the hunters and people in the wild wild wild west, and he does a real good job in showing the circumstances of the time. And it is one of the few movies that evaluate the tradition and life of Native Americans. But I don't get the purpose of the movie or the message. It could be that there is no message at all, but I really don't know. This movie confused me big time and I don't know if I like that or hate it - well at first I hated it but now I kind of wonder, because there are not many movies out there that keep me thinking. I will watch the movie again at some point. my suggestion: don't read anything about the plot or don't look for info - just watch it and see how you like it.So longChristoph</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't enjoy this at all. Technically very atmospheric, but as Johnny Depp descended towards death I felt exactly the same. I was struggling to keep my eyes open for the last third of the movie just as he was.I'm not being sarcastic now when I say that the closing scene of the film was both a release for me and for him.A must see for students of cinema....And a big "avoid" for everybody else.Just a note in case you were unaware, the movie is Black and White.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He survived all those who were behind him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film tried to be an original western, it tried, but I am not sure that it succeeded. The plot is somewhat repeated, it reminds a bit "The bounty killer" (1965) of Spencer Gordon and acted by Dan Duryea. In both westerns a peaceful man becomes a killer. Here the killer is a poet coming from Cleveland, who is accused of killing a man and a woman. He is saved by an Indian, then he is running away from all those who want to kill him and to be rewarded. The merit is that here the low ethics of the western environment is well shown, and human beings are more human that those you see in John Ford or Henry Hathaway's westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could your voters give this so many stars? It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I am a rabid Johnny Depp fan. If I had seen it in a theatre, I would have walked out I rented the video and did a lot of fast forwarding. Still love Johnny however.</fullReview>
