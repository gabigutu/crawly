		<shortDescription>Enormous emotional impact.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the saddest movie I've seen in years, maybe in my entire life. People who say it's comedy are dead wrong. It's a realistic, brutally true example of a failed life, and it's so tragic.Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt, an insurance salesman, whose life crashes down on him when he retires. Nicholson, someone I've loved ever since I first saw him, gives his best performance since "One flew over the cuckoos nest". He's so subtle, so sad, so hollow. You don't doubt for a second that he is Schmidt. He has let his body age for the role, which makes him even more real.Alexander Payne's direction is flawless. Everyone, simply everyone, does a great job portraying the various characters, from the hotshot newly educated young man who takes Schmidt's job, to the embarrassing buddy of Schmidt's daughter's fiancé.This is a must-see movie. Even if you hate Jack in all his other movies, you will love him in this one. Don't expect a "hilarious comedy", though. This is a thoughtful movie and not "Anger Management".10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Nicolson and I thought his work in this film was as good as any I have seen him do in any of his previous films. My accolades must begin with the writers for creating such a beautiful novel and script-a perfect canvas for the many fine actors in this film upon which they wove their considerable magic. There were no killings, no car chases, no violence of any kind-I'm surprised that Hollywood distributed it.Such a slice of life-American life with it's many warts-warts that the Americans probably don't even recognize: Winnebagos like moving palaces, freeway monuments to genocide, business that consumes it's workers only to dump them unceremoniously, too much of everything that amounts to emptiness, etc., etc. The novel by Begley, upon which the film was based, illustrated this consumer emptiness brilliantly by the inclusion of the bookends to the film, the sponsorship of the Tanzanian child by Schmidt. The child's material emptiness was contrasted with Schmidt's emotional emptiness in a way America does not recognize much less watch on the screen.The last part of the movie dealing with the marriage of Schmidt's daughter to a man who came from a diametrically opposite "new age" family was an unstated acknowledgment by his daughter that she wanted nothing of her father's values-she wanted a complete break and she was going to marry the break.A fascinating, complex movie and I'm sorry I didn't see it much earlier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simply beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dubious when my 65 year old father picked this DVD up from the shelf at Blockbuster. "Great choice dad!", secretly wondering why I let him pick 2 films out of the 3 in the special offer they had going. You see, my father has a penchant for Woody Allen and anybody who has a rather dry sense of humour, this includes Nicholson.We sat down tonight, and the first thing that hit me was the way that the film was shot. It is shot using rather blue and green hues, so the film is rather subdued. Secondly, the music stands out. Instead of using a typical 'boohoo' orchestra, the film uses beautiful wandering piano and marimba sounds. The characters, I could easily relate to. Helen, the faithful wife who is excited about getting to spend a new chapter of her life with her husband. The husband, who obeys his wife but secretly resents it. A sudden change which causes a rethink in everything he has done up until that point.At first, this appeared to be a comedy, but it was soon revealed to be a beautifully poignant film. Throughout, it questions mortality, what you can achieve in life, and how to cope with loss, or change. I don't think I have ever cried as much in 2 hours as I did during this film, and yet at the same time laughed so hard that my sides were splitting.I would thoroughly recommend anybody to watch this film. It will stay with you for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The poetry of deceit and loneliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film must be watched very carefully. If you're not paying enough attention to it, you would miss it (some did). It's in the frames, the atmosphere, the tiny details, the situations, the acting, everything. But it's not that obvious, unless you enter that world. Simple story? Sure. Life is simple. So is great art. All in all, "About Schmidt" is a really great film. Bitter humor, all-pervading lie, the infinite sadness of loneliness and failure, sincere egoism, everyday dullness, desperate and quiet hope - this is life, and in a non-blatant, nor melodramatic manner. But you're going to weep (and smile) at the ending (I did!). And one more question: is The Mulholland Man the greatest actor ever or not?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Jack Nicholson's best and certainly to be remembered as one of the best films of the first decade of the 21st century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson was robbed of another deserving Oscar for his portrayal of the lead character in this movie. This movie was very funny, but in a very dry, painfully realistic manner, like hitting your funny bone.Nicholson plays a man, who upon retiring, loses his wife of many years. His daughter who lives in another state and who he isn't very close to informs him that she's about to marry. He goes out to meet the future son-in-law and his family who turn out to be basically one rung up the ladder above trailer trash. Dermot Mulroney turns in another excellent performance this time as the dim witted fiancé. Why he's not more respected in the industry I'll never know. Hope Davis is perfect in this role as the daughter who somehow always gets the short stick in life. Kathy Bates as an abrasive, obnoxious mother of the groom is something to see. She deserved her Oscar nomination as well. The movie is an extremely stark, gray, black humor piece that is frighteningly true to life. Pushed a few more degrees in another direction and it could have been just one long root canal, but the director, Alexander Payne, walked just this side of that fine line between comedy and tragedy. Will most assuredly be one of the best movies of the fist decade of the new century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific film, featuring one of Nicholson's best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson stars as a Warren Schmidt, a man who suffers several crises at once. First he goes into retirement, then his wife dies, and finally his daughter marries a no-hoper. Forced to abandon his usual comfortable routine, Schmidt goes on a personal journey of discovery and tries to make some sense of his life.The beauty of About Schmidt is how well developed and interesting the characters are. They feel like real people struggling with real situations, which is a surprisingly difficult trick to pull off. This success can be attributed to the strength of the script and most importantly to the uniformly superb acting.This film provides a showcase for Nicholson to display his talent, and he doesn't disappoint, delivering a superb and multi-layered turn, which is a world away from the smirking characters he often plays. He allows his face to droop, and adopts a world-weary expression, as Schmidt continually finds himself at the mercy of events.One of Schmidt's first decisions when he determines to get out of the rut he finds himself in is to sponsor an African child. This doesn't have much to do with the rest of the plot, but provides an outlet for Schmidt's innermost thoughts, and is a brilliant and original way of allowing the audience inside the head of the central character.About Schmidt succeeds in tackling the subject of old age, a topic not often addressed in mainstream Hollywood fare, and for that it should be applauded. This is a terrific film, which features Nicholson at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding. Plain and simple.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is the story of a man left with the curious task of trying to find meaning in his life at age 66. Most people by this age would have hopefully figured out how and why they make a difference on this Earth, but Warren Schmidt suddenly realizes he is insignificant after all these years.Schmidt is played to perfection by Jack Nicholson. This is not the Jack Nicholson we have all grown up watching in films like Easy Rider and The Shining. This Jack Nicholson is subdued, almost lifeless at times, like the character he portrays. You keep waiting for him to explode or break out like Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but it just isn't right for the character. He's too old, and weak by his own admission. He finds himself on a quest to make a difference in life before its over. And the film takes him for a leisurely ride.About Schmidt is directed by Alexander Payne. He's a man apparently on a quest of his own to put our great(?) state of Nebraska on the map of the film-making world. After some obligatory shots of downtown Omaha, we see Schmidt sitting in his office on his last day of work before retirement from the Woodman insurance company. He sits alone and quietly waits until the last seconds of the work day tick off and he's then presumably a free man. However, once the clock strikes five, nothing special happens! In most films, we might expect bells to go off, or music to start playing as the character joyfully begins his new life. Not here. Schmidt has no grand plans for the rest of his life, and that fact is punctuated by this dreary scene.We then see Schmidt at a ho-hum retirement dinner at Johnny's Cafe, then he gets started on his ho-hum retirement. It appears the only thing he plans to do is go traveling with his wife in their giant camper which ends up as Schmidt's primary mode of transportation the rest of the film. Only there's one thing Schmidt didn't count on. His wife drops dead one day while he's out getting a Blizzard at the DQ. (It appears they shot that scene at the one over in Millard.) After his wife is in the ground, Schmidt goes through some difficult days. He really misses his wife. She seemed to completely take care of his every need as well as run his life in the process. He appears on the brink of despair at her passing until he finds evidence of an adulterous relationship with his best friend!!! After throwing out all of her belongings, he sets off on a sight-seeing tour of our great(?) state before planning to attend his daughter's wedding in Denver.In one particularly touching scene, he pronounces forgiveness for his wife's affair and resolves to do one important thing before he leaves this earth. And that thing will be to break up his daughter's wedding. She is planning to marry a simpleton who sells water beds for a living and comes from an odd, new-age family of losers. Schmidt drives out to Denver on a mission, feeling as strong and focused as ever.Once in Dever however, things don't go according to plans. His daughter really loves this loser, and won't hear of leaving him. Her love for this guy is as impossible for Schmidt to imagine as his contempt for her new family is for her to imagine. Schmidt and his daughter couldn't be any further apart. Kathy Bates is typically outstanding as the over-bearing mother of the man his daughter is marrying. Be forewarned though: Bates DOES in fact get naked in a scene, and it would be wise to cover your eyes lest you turn to stone! Her family is annoying and you can just tell their house smells like her feet which she has out in plain view once Schmidt first arrives there.Schmidt isn't having any luck stopping the wedding and it looks like he'll have one last chance to make his point. At the reception, after a ghastly toast by the best man, it's Schmidt's turn to make a speech. And once again you think, "Here it comes! Here's where he'll go off and tell everyone what he thinks about them in one big comic rant!" But no, it doesn't happen. That's just not something his character is capable of. He can merely swallow his pride and say the only good things he can think of. Most of the wedding party seems to buy it, but you can tell by the look on his daughter's face that she knows it's all b/s. Schmidt is in fact too weak to break up the wedding. Witness the despair on his face as he stands at the urinal after giving the speech. He missed what he feels was his last chance to make a difference in this world.Now Schmidt has nothing left to do but go home to die. Only in the film's last frame to we see any redemption to this tragic man's life. And a very touching moment it is. I was in tears, and that doesn't happen too often when I watch a film.This film is worth all ten stars. This Alexander Payne appears to be for real. We already knew Jack was!! ps: Did anyone else notice the symbolism with the cows? First at the retirement dinner with his picture up next to two prize cows. Then the cattle truck being washed off near his wife's funeral. Then as he's driving down the highway in a big truck just like they are. Then at the wedding reception as the beef is being sliced while he's in obvious pain about how things have gone.Food for thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forrest Gump Meets the Conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is Forrest Gump through the lens of Sartre or Camus. Warren Schmidt has a handicap, but it's the same handicap most of the people standing on line at seven p.m. at your local Wendy's have. The real star (or anti-star) of About Schmidt is the mediocre architectural landscape of America. Every room or box Warren Schmidt enters in this movie is as devoid of caring and vitality as he is: the retirement banquet room, Warren's house, the tire store, the hired wedding reception room. Schmidt's director and production designer take care to place us in the same life-draining, cheap structures we inhabit and deal with everyday. No prettifying. This is the drab landscape of Fargo revisited, but without the irony. The steady doses of violence in Fargo allowed you an escape route. But there's nothing ironical about a wasted life and a 66 year old widower spinning his wheels in the same rut, now partnerless and foundering. The combination of Jack, this story and these settings is effective and compelling. The result would be, I think, inevitable. The tone and attitude is not consistently managed, even by Nicholsen, whose worn-out, mannered schtick pops up occasionally. Yet the final effect is impossible to fend off: mundane American hell with droll comedic diversion. We experience a downfall as poignant as the smell of bacon cooking in Denny's at eight a.m.Like Forrest Gump, the film depends on extensive voice over narration, V.O'd by Nicholsen as letters to Schmidt's newly adopted six year old Tanzanian foster child. Through these ridiculous sharings of sextagenarian angst with an African boy, we register Schmidt's internal grievances - thoughts we would never know about otherwise without his commentary. The slow dragging score drains vitality from each transition, as if cinematic momentum would be antithetical to the point of the tale. Back and forth we rock from a single minor chord to a second one, getting nowhere. The mood, the landscape, the buildings, the people say it all: Schmidt's on the road, but he might as well be sitting home in his lay-z-boy. The cushy bucket seat of a 35 foot Winnebago makes a good substitute.Casting Jack Nicholson may have been the only way this story could have come to the screen. I've racked my brain to think of one other actor who could have pulled Schmidt off. Tony Hopkins? Not with the same comedic finesse. Gene Hackman reprising his role in Coppola's The Conversation or doing his Tennenbaum hamming? Don't think so. Only Jack has the mix. He does some hilarious bits in this, but overall the mood is somber, glum, inert. Can this be how that other famous Warren from Nebransas - Mr. Buffet - lives?I was confused, amused, depressed and wierdly disoriented by About Schmidt as I left the theater. I commented that it wasn't a film I'd go see again. Thinking about it a day later, I'd hold to that IF it meant returning to the theater and paying. BUT - were I to run across About Schmidt on cable, I doubt I could tear myself away from it any more than I could from a crack up at the Indy 500. And I think that chance encounter might happen more than once, maybe for years. After all, this is the America I know and mark time in myself. A recommended film going experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Is A Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course we would hope that is not the case but watching a movie like this certainly puts the idea of life into question. This is a funny movie but looking back its probably not quite the kind of jokes you appreciate laughing at.In the lead role as Warren Schmidt is none other then Jack Nicholson, with an already astute résumé, only further strengthens his long career with his subtle and charming performance. The charm never wears off with the audience as Schmidt's morals and interest for the most part stay in place in his heart and mind. Unfortunately in the tale of Schmidt in the film not only does his charm wear off but he is seen as a liability by those who he thought of as his loved ones. His life takes this crash when he retires from his career and an insurance agent. Soon after he realizes he may have wasted his entire life away. The downward spiral of his life and his sense of purpose hangs on the thread of a boy he has never even met.As subtle as Nicholson's performance is, so is the writing. It is quietly very witty which almost inconspicuously gives off a whole lot of cynicism. Along with Alexander Payne writing the screenplay he directed the film as well. The movie is certainly not all style and why should it be when that could possibly be the only thing that could really hurt this film. The film is about humanity in a raw and complex way, sometimes the best method of showing this is through simplicity to the point where you are almost certain there is something else that lies behind the curtain of it all.There is no doubt I would recommend this film but don't expect a pure comedy. Instead try and take a fresh and real look at the entire movie and the events that take place. Depending on who you are, you may find certain points of this movie to be either sorrowful and dejected or slightly uplifting and optimistic. Just don't make a heartless joke of it, because none of us want to think of our life as that; a joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Cinema Art - A "Must See" Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent a day watching "About Schmidt", with Jack Nicholson... and then the evening rambling through reviews, since my wife's perception of the ending differed somewhat from mine....Conflict can often lead to enlightenment and discovery, but not so in the case of Warren Schmidt. In his case it leads to a life of complacency, denial, delusion, and passive-aggressive behaviors... and eventually, to a meaningless life of servitude devoid of passion or purpose.Since my wife and I are around the same age as the character, and we ponder the same issues of our lives, the film had more significance to us. I found the work to be a cinema-graphic piece of art laced with symbolism and dark humor (at best). I likened it to previous movies like "Death of a Salesman", "The Apartment", "The Swimmer" (Burt Lancaster), or a short filmed called "The Bridge".As a cautionary tale (or social comment) on the "American Way" of life, the messages it conveys are slightly exaggerated, but nevertheless there to be debated. We are talking about identity, achievement, interpersonal relationships, and the "average IQ".In the end, I believe this film will become one that is studied in future classrooms, and it was brave of Nicholson to participate in such a character study and a work intended primarily for writers, actors, and directors. If laughter is "the sound we make when we are surprised (or shocked) by the truth", then the amount of humor you find in this film may be directly related to your own level of naivety or denial. After all, laughter can often be just another defense mechanism, right?Some movies are straightforward, some are magical, some are mystical, and then, some are symbolic. This movie falls into the last category. The use of time, space, cognitive dissonance, and Irony abound in this work and challenge us to look, think, and feel.Notes: we would have cut or altered the "Percodan scene" at the rehearsal (as overdone), also note- the cattle at the funeral who later appear on the freeway, inside jokes about Des Moines and Denver, Randall's "Certificate of Attendance", the look on Jeannie's face at the end of Warren's speech at the Wedding Reception, the use of "overstatement", details of wall decorations, and Warren's obvious attraction to the trite, idealistic, delusional, and superficial.If you are a thinking, feeling, serious movie-lover, you should SEE this film once, and then STUDY it the 2nd time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great note on appreciating what you have while still have it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an inspiring story. It teaches me so much about what is important in life. Jack Nicholson, with a great performance as Warren R. Schmidt is an example of an American middle class after retiring. For many years he has worked as an actuary at a big insurance company. After retiring, Jack at home, while watching television, he decides to sponsor a six years old boy (Ndugu) from Tanzania. Sending a check of US$ 22,00 every month, he is also required to write a letter to the boy. In the process of writing these letters, he vents out to the boy about his life frustrations, his lost dreams and the dilemma he is in. He is married for forty-two years with his wife Helen (June Squibb) and he has a daughter living in Denver, Jeannie Schmidt (Hope Davis) who will marry a looser pretty soon. He misses his daughter. A few days after his retirement, his wife dies, and Jack realizes how important the wife was in his life now even though he never appreciated her. The director of the movie, Alexander Payne takes the audiences with Jack on a trip in a trailer to visit specific places in America. He mainly makes Jack visit the places where he has been before physically but at the same time Jack was revisiting his own life inside. In this trip he realizes what really matters in life - friendship, family and sharing- then why it is important to appreciate them whenever you have a chance.In 'Citizen Kane' (1941), the director Orson Welles portrays the same idea when creating Mr. Kane. The movie is more than the story of a tycoon's rise and fall; it is an account of what is ultimately important in a person's life. Even though Kane attains riches and prestige, he is far from happy. He ends with two failed marriages and few friends. At his dying bed, all he has left is his reminiscences - and something called "Rosebud." In 'About Schmidt' the director Alexander Payne uses voiceover to convey Jack's thoughts and memories throughout the movie. To be specific it is when Jack is writing a letter to the boy he sponsors - (Ndugu), at the same time Payne is informing the audience about Jack's regrets and pain concerning his wife and daughter while the movie is still rolling on. I think this is a great technique.I believe this has been a great adventure and wake up call to many Americans as to what is important in life and why we should cherish every moment of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a masterpiece. It even shows that Nicholson is able to act unusually. We are used to him as grinning a man with pointed irony and sarcasm. But in the role of Warren Schmidt he did not use this specific talent just to entertain us but to open our mind for the possibly deep emptiness of people who call somewhere in their life and recognize that they aren't as rich as they are supposed to be. Schmidt tries to convince the audience that a full life should be the goal instead of just living without being aware of the own role. This can give a very positive motivation for every age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a Beautiful Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply loved this film!, it's great how Jack Nicholson performed this role, he isn't just brilliant, he is absolutely outstanding!, watching Nicholson i couldn't resist the comparison with his other performances, and i'm sure that he is maybe the most versatile actor in Hollywood, he live the character life and actually became that person, he is maybe the best Hollywood actor of all times!; i compare this Nicholson acting, with Tom Hanks - Cast Away; is a challenge for an actor to be totally the soul of a film, almost a monologue where 90% if not 100% of the film focuses on the main actor; only the true masters in the profession can do this with glory; and that's what Nicholson did here!. The story is touching and gave me the feeling of how wonderful live is, live is a ride that is so beautiful, that is a shame to start to live it just after retirement; Schimdt loves his life, his way of living; but he is sad, he knows that is a little bit late for living!, and his forces are drawn totally through the movie, until the film ends, brilliant and touching way to shake us all, and to push us to live our real lives, not the working lives!. The companies go and go with or without ourselves, but our live depends of what we do with it!. The Ndugu friend plays as a spectator the main supporting role in the film, Ndugu gives life to Schmidt and his true character and feelings; Ndugu discovers Schimdt, and uncover his sad ending of his life. Is remarkable how Nicholson and Payne manages to show a common normal retirement life as something captivating and beautiful as a film!. This film is totally a masterpiece, and something i need to have in my collection. Simply Great! ABOUT THE MOVIE: Nicholson plays here the role of Warren Schmidt, a man that trough his sixties faces the retirement, and enters to a new life, in this personal change he start to feel the emptiness of his life, he has missed the true way of living and now he has to handle this fact; his relationship with his wife Helen (June Squibb) turns boring and their plans in this time resume to traveling in a modern van that they bought! His wife suddenly die and he faces loneliness and a daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) that has always disagreed with him, he love her but she's already far from him, living a totally different live, and about to marry with a man that Warren don't approve: Randall (Dermot Mulroney), who lives as a salesman of water-beds, he writes letters to Ndugu, a child in Tanzania who he support economically with a foundation, in those letters he describes all his feelings day by day. He then decides to travel in his van and go to visit his daughter some days before wedding, his daughter don't want him to visit her so he makes a long journey where he visit a lot of places, people, he bring some memories and finally he arrive to the place where the family of his daughter lives and meet the particular Randall's mother Roberta (Kathy Bates great acting!). He then faces the wedding of his Jeannie and Randall and in the way he see his own life going away in emptiness.10/10! for this beautiful combined work of Payne and Nicholson!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to recommend About Schmidt to anyone, without actually knowing that person. Not only does the story seem unconventionally uneventful to most of modern audiences, but it also moves with an unhurried patience that will let many viewers shift in their seats. It really depends on whether one can develop an interest to the film and its subject matter, which shows a retired man suddenly facing the void and meaninglessness of his existence. About Schmidt moves slowly, but it moves with grace. The film's success is deeply in debt to Jack Nicholson, subordinating his personality to the character of Warren Schmidt. It must have been difficult for somebody like Nicholson to display the role's required lack of passion without letting Schmidt lose his human touch. Yet, his portrayal is excellent in its understatement, and his numerable supporting actors do not disappoint either. Fans of Nicholson will be assured in their belief, that their favourite is not only one of the best, but also one of the most versatile actors still working today. Apart from the acting, director Alexander Payne's film is also well crafted. The somewhat saddened mood is only enhanced by documentary-like shots, constantly making us aware that what we witness is really an everyday-tragedy. The script shows intelligence, and although it contains many subtleties, most of them will not go unnoticed with attentive viewers. Even though About Schmidt is billed as a comedy, it really is a drama. Many of the humorous situations are more tragic than funny, and truly hilarious moments are rare occurrences. I've often wondered whether the title of About Schmidt has been chosen with any clear intent. The German surname Schmidt equals Smith in English and is one of the most common. So about Schmidt could actually mean "About Everybody". Everybody can wake up one day and discover that everything he or she has devoted himself to, amounts to nothing. It's a frequent social phenomenon, that people suddenly wise up that their lives are almost over, without ever having fully lived them. Maybe that's how all the sea cruises and world tours of old pensioners can be accounted for. Like Schmidt, they are all making a desperate effort to catch up on a time that's long done and over with.The film does not exactly give answers and, like in reality, does not end with any true revelations to escape all bleakness. But there is something it often likes to apply, namely the self explanatory power of irony. Like one time during the film, when Warren Schmidt decides to adopt a six-year old African foster child by mail. A cheque of twenty-two dollars, which he dutifully provides on a monthly basis, assures that little Ndugu can go to school, gets sheltered, fed and clothed. Yet, in one of his letters Warren writes to him: "What difference has my life made to anyone? None that I can think of. None...at all!" Well, think again, Mr. Schmidt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the DVD box, "hilarious" "a very funny movie". This was not the film I watched, I don't know what mentality these reviewers have, but certainly not the same as mine. I found this to be a wonderful film about a man who retires and whose plans are scuppered when his wife dies suddenly. His journey of self discovery and his concern over the marriage of his daughter to someone totally unsuitable. It shows that no matter how unremarkable life can be at times, this itself is remarkable. Nicholson's performance is stunning, as is Kathy Bates, and Dermot Mulroney as the future son in law is a joy to watch. I must make a special mention about the cinematography (James Glennon) which is as stunning as it is simple, just pay attention to it when you watch the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Americana in a Can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schmidt is a typical, white, middled-aged American, and, though somewhat happily married and recently retired from a successful career, has yet to experience a truly fulfilling life. He is in fact, "a sad, sad man," to quote a line from the film.And this is the film's premise: The American dream, when realized, can have little to do with happiness. Schmidt has yet to achieve contentment, even after years of hard work and dedication. Eventually he will stumble upon it through his tears, but not before he takes us for a hysterical ride in his RV(a clichéd symbol of middle-class success), westward to Denver and his future in-laws; with short stops at cynicism, loneliness, and desperation, and finally home again to Omaha, meaning, and newly realized contentment. The acting, writing, and music in this film, are each by themselves, worth possessing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, haunting reflection on a modern lifestyle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just reading the other comments and I saw the amount that say the movie was boring, that it didn't go anywhere and that it had no storyline. Basically, I think a few subtleties flew over some peoples' heads and a lot of people have been too taken by Hollywood stories with needless plot twists every 5 minutes.I found that the best part of the movie was actually the fact that the character of Schmidt doesn't actually change and that despite a few major "revelations" about his life and decisions that he appears to be set on, he still seems to weak to achieve what he wants in life. This is what i think pulled the storyline out of mediocrity-there's too many stories about people who realize their life is going nowhere then make some huge change to it, this one is about a realistic man for whom the furthest he can go to make a difference is a simple $22 check to an African orphan every month accompanied by a letter, containing his most intimate thoughts, that the kid can't even read. In essence, the letter captures the complete insignificance of his thoughts and how little impact he can have on anyone's life.Overall, there is some good dark comedy, but If you want to laugh for a couple of hours, this isn't for you. If you want fast-paced action and needless plot twists, go and watch something else. This movie is just a simple and eloquently told tale of a man who's life has no significance to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" is a quirky, offbeat comedy about a man and his journey to find meaning to his life. Its name is true; "About Schmidt" is about...well...a man named Schmidt.Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is your average Joe. Or, in this case, your average Warren. He lives a normal life. He has just retired at the age of sixty-seven, and he now stays at home with his wife, who Schmidt states he is growing tired of. He's tired of having to do everything his wife, Helen, tells him to do. He's tired of her cutting him off when he's talking. He's tired of the way she sits down. He's tired of the way she pulls out the keys to the car before they're even out the door. And he's tired of having to sit down when he goes to the bathroom.In a letter to Ntugu (his new "adopted" sponsor child), Warren spills his beans about life. That same day he comes home from mailing a letter to Ntugu, to find his wife, dead on the floor. We learn later that she died from a blood clot in her brain.Left on his own, Warren realizes how good his wife was, and how much he misses her. But then he finds out that twenty-five to thirty years ago she had an affair with an old friend of his, and in one of the most subtley funny moments in the film, dumps off her old belongings at a donation center.Warren, still missing his wife but truly bitter at what she did, eventually decides to go visit his daughter in the south, and packs up the 35-foot-long Winnebago with everything he needs. His daughter, who is about to be married to a complete loser, has different ideas, and tells Warren once he is on the road that it would be best if they stick to the plan and he comes down two days before the wedding. Left with about a week before the wedding, Warren takes a road trip back down memory lane. He visits his old childhood home - which is now a tire store. "This is where the bedroom would've been," he tells a clerk, who looks on in awe. After that, Warren one way or another ends up eating dinner with a couple from the RV park he's staying in. When the husband goes out to get more beer, the woman says that she sees a sad, sad man in Warren. Afraid and angry. Once Warren arrives for the wedding, he realizes that his daughter is happy with the man she is about to marry, no matter how much of a loser he is. And in a scene that could have been played for laughs but wasn't (which is good in this case, making deep characters instead of flimsy ones), Warren makes a toast to his daughter and her new husband.And then Warren goes home. It's the end of the movie already. Not much has happened, and Warren tells Ntugu that his life has no point. His life has no meaning. Why go on? But then he gets a letter, and in the sense of "It's a Wonderful Life," Warren sees the meaning in his life."About Schmidt" isn't for everyone. People that cannot tolerate slow-moving films should not see this. Those that cannot appreciate characters that are deep, but yet still funny, should not see this movie. If people want a Jack Nicholson movie played just for laughs, with your average characters, I recommend "Anger Management." But if you want a classic example of fine storytelling, see "About Schmidt."The characters are funny, but not outrageous. They are not there to make us laugh. They are there to preach something, much like in "It's a Wonderful Life." But they do make us laugh, in the little quirks of life. Things we all do. The first forty minutes of this movie is an absolute hoot, and those forty minutes are probably funnier than any movie you'll see this year. But not outwardly funny; like I said, this isn't an Adam Sandler movie. This is a realistic movie with realistic characters doing real things that are funny. It's a self-parody for all the viewers. The little quirks all the different characters have will either a) remind you of someone you know, or b) remind you of yourself. Jack Nicholson is an absolute stand-out in this movie. I can't see anyone else playing him quite as well as Nicholson. And I must admit that I've never been a real fan of Jack, either. But when he is on screen in this film, we see a sad, lonely, angry and afraid old man who is wondering through life, living each day, but not for any apparent reason.Alexander Payne has crafted a wonderful life-parody/drama here. I didn't expect this much from "About Schmidt," but I sure did get more than I bargained for. And in this case, what I didn't bargain for was better than what I did.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very surprised not to like this film as I am usually easily pleased when you put Jack Nicholson in front of the camera. This is supposed to be a compelling story about a mans journey after losing his wife (she dies not goes missing in the supermarket) but I somehow missed the story. I saw a man who was unhappy retiring, his wife dies he's not sure if he's sad about that or not and generally bumbles about on the build up to his daughters marriage and then the film stops. The box also claims the film to be hilarious now this I have to disagree with totally... I chuckled briefly three times in the movie and this does not constitute as funny in my book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Schmidt is 66 years old and he's retiring. He had a great job and now some young guy is trying to fill his shoes and he is going home to just relax and live the retired persons life. What does one do after working for so many years and having a good routine going for themselves and then being told to stop, go home, do nothing, be bored. Warren has a nagging wife, who he loves, but the nagging and boredom of his life has made it hard to take. Eventually his boredom find him watching a commercial about the poor unfortunate children in Africa on the Childreach program. He becomes a participant and becomes the donating foster parent of a kid in Africa named Ndugu. He has no one to talk to and not much to do with his life and Ndugu becomes his way of venting and getting it all out of his system. He opens up and talks about what he is feeling to the child.Warrens wife dies and he heads out to Colorado to try to talk his daughter Jennie out of getting married to her "ninkempoop" fiancé. He hops in his RV and heads across country for a wild adventure before going to watch his only child be wed. He stays with the in laws and finds life is no better when you try to run from it.The story has many adventures and many truths and just when you think you're no longer of importance or no longer worth the life you hold, you may find that you do matter of a great deal to someone and be very important to them.I LOVE THIS MOVIE! this makes maybe my 6th time watching it and it is pure perfection to me. The story is so sad and I cry almost all the way through it, and the beautiful thing is when I am not crying I am laughing hysterically. From the subtle face Jack makes to the dinner table scene complete with a lazy Susan and a box of milk bones to Kathy Bates naked hot tub dip to the crazy vows and silly songs at the wedding, this movie is perfect.Directing is great and has so many beautiful scenes, the music is absolutely dead on with the moods and the little touches of brilliance that you see on camera throughout are superb. The sets were so real and appropriate as well, especially with Roberta's house. Acting was perhaps the best I have seen in years Jack Nicholson did his best work right here and got many awards and much appreciation for it. Kathy Bates did her best here too, I never thought she could top that of Misery but she did here, such wonderful actors, everyone on this film was just amazing.I can recommend it very proudly as one of my very favorite films, its a tear jerker, but it is extremely laugh out loud funny...10 perfect stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Ndugu: I watched a very good film today called "About Schmidt". I must say that it's one of the most original comedies of all time. Now, you may ask why am I saying this. Well, there are certain aspects that I found that made this film successful. Of course there's the superb performance of our dear old friend Jack Nicholson (I think it's one of his greatest roles along "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The Shining"). Secondly, we have the good pace and rhythm that Alexander Payne gives to the movie. Then we have an extraordinary screenplay based on a great book. What else can yo ask from a film? I hope that, when you grow up, after having survived all those problems of the African nations, you'll know how to appreciate movies like this, and I hope this film maintains as a landmark on cinematic history. Sincerely yours, David Mu?oz, your fan. P.S. My rating: ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could you depress me a little more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is clearly the most overrated movie of the year, and has the most misleading ad campaign of the year. The ads make it look like a light-hearted romp, when really it is dark and depressing, interspersed with a few mildly humorous (yet oddly sad) moments. In the movie, Schmidt is a man who just retired to realize his whole life has meant nothing. So he makes a few feeble attempts to change that but learns that he can't. He is sad, depressed, and worthless at the start, and sad, depressed, and worthless at the end. And that is the problem with this movie -- it doesn't GO anywhere. It's like watching depressed friends discuss their problems for two straight hours as they forget that you are there. To be fair, the performances are amazing, and the dialogue is very real, but it just sits there, like a slow day of flipping channels. If you want to be depressed by a good movie, see Leaving Las Vegas, or even The Man Who Wasn't There. This one has nothing to say -- just a blank demonstration of how depressed good actors can make you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and bordering on depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premise of my critique: My wife and I go to the movies primarily for entertainment and secondarily to learn something. About Schmidt provides neither.Almost everything that could go wrong for a guy (Schmidt) after he retires is depicted in detail through long (very long) scenes of no action: boring.We all know that Jack and Kathy are going to give good performances- that is a given. But what a waste of talent to dwell on these aspects of life. I hope that none of this happens to me when I retire.Yes, yes. Jack Nicholson gives a superb performance, but this alone does not a good movie make, and neither does a nude Kathy Bates. (Oh yes, you read correctly.)The is no real humor - the audience has to supply the laughter, and you can feel the strain everyone goes through trying to find something (anything) at which to laugh. For example, they show some guy (just an unknown neighbor) taking out or throwing a bag of garbage, and some people laugh. Why, what is funny?Nicholson 'adopts' a poor kid in a foreign country, and this becomes an important part of the movie. Both my wife and I thought (hoped) that eventually this would provide some real humor, but it does not. Instead, they portray this as real; that is, that Mr. Schmidt's contribution makes it possible to actually 'adopt' a child. And there is even a letter from some 'sister' (nun) writing about the 'adopted child'. BUNK! I can tell you that from personal experience. Most of those child-adoption programs are scams!There may have been two or three funny scenes throughout the movie, but overall, it was one of the most boring movies we have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie because anyone can relate to what Jack Nicholson's character goes through. No matter what your age, we all go through periods in our lives where we experience the same type of distress and sorrow and so this movie made me realize something that I already knew but it was basically confirmed. Age is just a number which tells us how long we have been on this earth. It is not an indication of how much knowledge we have or if we are superior or inferior to others. We should not be defined by our ages whether you are considered to be "older", "old", "younger", and/or "young". Tragically, this is not something that the average person may see when viewing this film, they may just see it as a film about an"old guy who goes through life's ups and downs"!!!!</fullReview>

There is conflict and the tale of a man facing three major life changes... all at once. Jack Nicholson plays the main character masterfully. At times, he is so pathetic, you can't help but laugh. But you also feel for him too. It is one character I think most people can feel close to.The movie has a great and emotional ending.

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Nicholson films, with an emotional touch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film a few nights ago, and have seen Nicholson in quite a few amazing films. I think this also has an amazing story with some great performances. This comment does have a few spoilers too.Nicholson (Schmidt)plays a 66 year old man and knows that he has aged for a while now. After old wife suddenly dies, he is a lonesome guy traveling to see his daughter getting married by a man that he does not care for. He doesn't want this wedding to happen, but at his old age, he probably doesn't any choice.But before Schmidt's wife he sees a program on TV about saving poor native Americans. So donates money after he just quit from his job in Omaha, and writes back to the child every so often. But as he's traveling to see his daughter, he stops in a few places and looks at towns once again in Nebraska, and camps for few nights.After the wedding of his daughter and the 'waterbeds and more' man, he travels back home and doesn't want to think about the wedding. So finally at the end, he receives mail back from the child. Someone else wrote for him because I think he was sick. The person mentions that the child drew him a picture.Now this is the tearjerker moment, it shows a colored picture of the child and Schmidt holding hands. Not too often did I see an old Nicholson cry in such a uplifting way. But man did I love this film! I cried along with Jack, and he knows maybe now that he is an old man and the picture somehow broke him up. But it was a very well made film. Some parts were supposed to be funny in a way when his first letter writes about his wife to child in a angry tone. Also when goes to the restroom, he doesn't use his hands, and doesn't even face the toilet. I mean some of those scenes were a bit different for a film like this.But overall it deserves a high rating, and I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Warren Schmidt is about to experience a bittersweet slice of life. Newly retired, he and his wife Helen have big plans to see America - but an unexpected twist changes everything. Now, Schmidt is determined to stop his daughter's wedding to an underachieving waterbed salesman. From meeting the groom's eccentric parents to sponsoring a Tanzanian foster child, Schmidt sets off on his mission? and gets lost along the road to self-discovery," according to the DVD sleeve. New Line Cinema is alive and well.This film, by director Alexander Payne writing with Jim Taylor is a mostly successful comedy-drama, but the satire gets a little lost.The "Best Actor" Oscar-nominated performance by Jack Nicholson carries the drama, with the hilarious-in-a-hot-tub "Best Supporting Actress" turn by Kathy Bates (as Roberta Hertzel) stealing away with the comedy. This is helped by the smaller part given Ms. Bates being so perfectly written, and Nicholson's obvious "have at it" attitude. As Nicholson's daughter, Hope Davis is puzzling but effective; she must have been a mama's girl. As Bates' son, fiancé Dermot Mulroney is a chip off the old block.******* About Schmidt (5/22/02) Alexander Payne ~ Jack Nicholson, Kathy Bates, Hope Davis, Dermot Mulroney</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Schmidt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is a man who's always wanted to accomplish more in life, but now he finds himself retiring from a dead end job having made no difference in the world around him. One day, on a whim, Warren calls Childreach and "adopts" an African orphan named Ndugu, who Warren uses as a sounding board to let out his feelings concerning what he feels is his wasted life. Shortly after his retirement, Warren's wife, Helen (June Squibb), dies reminding Warren of just how much he needed her. On his way to his daughter, Jeannie's (Hope Davis) wedding Warren takes a soul searching road trip in his RV before trying to convince his daughter to not marry the waterbed salesman (Dermot Mulroney) she's currently engaged to.Before winning the adapted screen writing Oscar for his wine country dramedy, Sideways, and after his nomination for the excellent Election, Alexandar Payne co-wrote and directed this underrated dramedy with his oft-writing partner Jim Taylor. Overshadowed by a notorious nude scene by Kathy Bates in the late second act of the movie, it's often forgotten that Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates were both nominated for Oscars and Jack Nicholson won a Golden Globe for best performance by an actor in a drama (to which Nicholson said during his acceptance speech, "I'm a little surprised, I thought we had made a comedy"). First picking up this movie I can't really say that I knew what to expect going in, but that's also part of what made me pick up this movie in the first place.What I got, for all the fuss about Kathy Bates, was a poignant character study about a very ordinary man in his 60's. I'm sure a lot of people don't feel the same way, after all some of Warren's actions are deplorable, but he's a very human character. He's an ordinary man who wants to be extraordinary about him, and so inside he pines to make a difference in the world. The movie does a great job, as well as Nicholson playing the role to a tee, of showing a man that even at his happiest carries around the weight of never having accomplished anything in his life to be proud of as he also confronts his own mortality. In the end the movie reminds us that we don't have to do big great things to make a difference in the world, though, even small gestures can make the world around us a better place.While in the end the overall message of the movie can be considered slightly corny, I still have to say that I recommend this movie. At times it's quite funny, and the acting is phenomenal. Even with a corny message, which does not overbear the plot or tone of the movie, sometimes we do need to be reminded of these things at times. Give it a try, if you like Payne's other films like Sideways and Election you'll probably enjoy this, and it's also one of Nicholson's best later career performances.4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made a big old guy like me tear up! The way the story unfolded made you feel as if Jack was trying to make a statement about his film career. I don't know if it went unnoticed but he did do his usual thing and this time acted his pants off. I was captivated with great expectation as he meandered through his new world. I love the character development even with the unseen boy (you get it once you've watched it). Kathy Bates really exposed her true self in this movie and Jack out did himself. It seems that he has reached a place in his professional career where quality and story telling has rebounded to be most important to him. I watched this movie by myself but had to show it again to my wife as she wondered what made me cry. She also wiped her eyes. Hollywood can sometimes allow a movie like this to slip through amidst all the fluff it produces. I highly recommend this film for people who love great stories. It's about time Jack got back to this kind of picture. This move is about life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expertly delivered character piece offers seldom glanced perspectives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thoughtful, very well made dramady about growing old and rediscovering yourself is one of the most poignant, engaging and hip movies to center around senior citizens I have ever seen. In what may have been his last true character acting to date, Jack Nicholson dazzles and depresses in equal measure as laconic everyman Schmidt. His wonderful performance, paired with the extremely talented director Alexander Payne, ensures a heavy dose of quality resides in nearly every frame of this oddly warm geriatric odyssey.Hardly witnessing any real down-time, Payne reels in viewers from the very beginning with a hilariously brilliant introduction which eventually becomes even more resonant once a dramatic back story begins to take hold. The excellent pacing throughout effortlessly merges comedic and dramatic appeal, only feeling as seamless as it does due to the great talent involved. Everything feels calibrated to near pitch-perfect levels here, justified even in it's absurd coincidences and questionable motives. Narration, which is usually shoved into films so thoughtlessly, feels appropriate here as Schmidt pours his repressed heart and soul out to an African orphan in completely over-the-top, but endearing letters. His road trip may reek of conceptual cliché, though Payne captures it exactly in a way to render the sentiment fresh though Schmidt's eyes. Even the somewhat manipulative script manages to soar through any coincidental mishaps by ushering in the frail soul of this character to filter out any semi-generic plot points.A humble triumph of high order for both star and director, About Schmidt seems to be even more accomplished then Payne's next film, the critical darling Sideways. It is an ambitious, though never over-bearing foray into the study of a man who has neared the end of his life, elegantly laying out many of the uncomfortable pleasantries that go with it. For an outstanding dedication to brining the fictional reality of this 66 year old man to the screen, this is well worth seeing, and is one of the more impressive, substantial American films on the subject of old age in modern years.</fullReview>

I am just fascinated somehow - but let's return to the topic. Ther movie shows an ordinary and average life of one man - better to say the second or just the very last part of his life. After you loose all you used to like or used to take as something usual you are going to see the world in other color. You see that one man means a lot for himself but not a damn for the others - including your family. You start to understand what the life is about - what was wrong in your life and what was the biggest goal you achieved. You start to understand that small ordinary habits and everyday experience is all what left and you have. And finally after staying alone and thinking about the life you may find that the least important thing you have done is finally the most important and everything else doesn't matter.So in the end &gt; good story with good acting of our star JAck and nice views of US people and life. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OUR rehearsals for retirement....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is part of these unique actors who are not afraid of playing demeaning parts.While most of his peers in their sixties/seventies are still playing heroes ,see what he does.He has almost never played the brilliant-lawyer-with-good-prospects.Two examples :"one flew over the cuckoo's nest" and the overlooked "Ironweed" which almost nobody knows and which paired him with an equally extraordinary Meryl Streep."About Schmidt" is a very good film,cause it succeeds in blending comedy and drama.And this drama involves US ,cause like Schmidt we are all potentially retired people .We are afraid of losing our job for good (the scene when Nicholson returns to his office is revealing),we are afraid to live with a partner getting old (who's THAT old woman living in my house?) ,we try to enlighten our children for fear they might go astray (and the daughter's family-in-law has nothing to recommend them)... and most of all,we are afraid of this: when you reach 65,you take stock of your life and you realize it's an unfulfilled one.Then you live in the past conditional.That's why the little African boy is so important;although we never see him ,he's a character in the story: a confident ,and finally,when Nicholson begins to cry,the one thing he can be proud of.The letters he writes to his foster child provides the movie with an unusually inventive use of the voice over.There are numerous memorable scenes:my favorite is Nicholson's speech during the wedding meal:his attitude is in direct contrast to the praises he says to everyone ,particularly to his daughter's mother-in-law ( Kathy Bates is sensational).Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Schmidt deals with the many problems and uncertainties dawning particularly when the burden of growing old spreads its weight. Add to that solitude and rejection and the elements for a reflective and touching drama, whilst not distancing themselves from an ordinary reality, are sure ingredients for a gem in the 'indipendent budget' niche.Although the main character, as said, is nothing but an ordinary guy, the subtlety, control and communicative effectiveness with which Nicholson embodies his character are a first.The actor is known for having forged roles as the stubborn and self-made, shrewd man with an obvious taste for peril, to the downright psychopathic maniacal individual with the devilish eyebrow. But the frailty and 'want-of-love' in Warren Schmidt cannot do anything but open up the heart of the strictest and most cynical viewer, portraying a myriad of emotions with one single glance or old-age crease.Overall not to be missed, the comical moments are not lacking and in my eye, a new, better understanding Nicholson emerging.'Dear Ndougu', you will certainly love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Schmidt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a 2002 American comedy-drama film. The film is directed by Alexander Payne, who is known for his high-quality scripts and who won two and was nominated for five Oscars in this category. It stars Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates, who both won Oscars for their performance in this film. This film is about Warren Schmidt, who decided after the retirement to set out for a trip to his daughters' marriage.This film is one of my favorites. It has lots of strengths. First of all, Alexander Payne is good as a director and a screenwriter, he is especially good at making so called slow in pace movies. Then comes, of course, the brilliant performance of Jack Nicholson who managed to get the feel of his part, he is perfect in the role of an old, arrogant chap. Furthermore, the work of the cameraman is also worth- mentioning because there is a bunch of nice shots of breathtaking views of the countryside of Omaha and Iowa. And the last, but definitely not the least strength of the film is its content. It has so many important subjects brought up. For example, it scoffs at the superficiality of the people's relationship, words and actions, it was well shown during the retirement party of the main character ? it is said that gifts and the party itself do not matter. And it is devotion of your life to something meaningful that is really important. And Mr. Schmidt saw that his lifework was pointless, so he decided to change his life, but, of course, old age is not the best time to start new things. Loneliness is another problem of this movie. Warren Schmidt after the death of his wife is staying alone in his house, because his daughter is living in Iowa and preparing for the wedding with the guy, whom Schmidt really hates. The film helps me to understand that everyone is lonely, in his thoughts, wishes and fears. Each of us has to walk his way, and the people that surround us are only like bumps on the life road, some of them are bigger than others, so they have more influence on our trip, but they can only change our direction a little bit, and we are still the ones who choose places of destination. Payne also invokes us not only to appreciate what you have while you still have it, but to remember the history and respect our ancestors. So the film is very versatile, it shows the problems of old people, the theme of loneliness, sadness because of anger and irritation, egoism, relationship between relatives, pursuit for some significance of your life and things that make anyone's other life different. I guess soul-searching is the thing that connects both parts of the screen during the film, because it is impossible not to search for the answers that the main character is trying to find. The humor of the film is constructed with the help of its content and actions of characters, not with the help of jokes. The film is like a knitting needle which penetrates deep into your heart and mind causing a slight pain. I hope that more people will open for themselves this pure, measured and moving drama with the elements of adventure and satire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the 4th or 5th time I'm watching this brilliant movie. Just fantastic.Excellent writing, direction and acting by the entire cast without exception (especially Nicholson and Bates).The score is brilliant and without it the movie would have been something completely different."About Schmidt" and "Sideways" are Payne's masterpieces.What especially amazing in this movie is how effectively, brilliantly and quickly it switches between heavy drama and comedy.Yes, yes, I cried at the last scene - like always.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There some familiar ingredients here. Another dark comedy-drama from Alexander Payne with a Nebraska setting. Jack Nicholson being less Jack and daring to be more of the kind of character he played in The King of Marvin Gardens. Whereas in that film he played a depressed radio host telling stories to the listener, here we have Schmidt telling stories to a sponsored child in an orphanage in Africa.Schmidt has newly retired from a lifetime of working in the insurance industry. His replacement a young hotshot has no time for him, he secretly is irritated by his wife and she by him after we find out when she suddenly dies that she had an affair.They planned to have a road trip after they retired and he is now on his own, travelling to his daughter's wedding. Her daughter resents him, her husband to be is a jerk, excellently portrayed by Dermot Mulroney.The film is a character study, a man failed to be interesting, worked to provide for his wife and family and realising that he will soon be forgotten. He is empty, sad and even resentful inside when he realises his wife never understood him and he never really understood her. His daughter cannot see that the husband although very nice is a bit of a jerk with get rich quick schemes.The film starts slowly, gets absorbing but despite the emotional pay off at the end, I did find it less than enthralling. I do find Payne's films rather heavy going and although well acted, pacing makes it off kilter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick around: the last 10 sec is one of the greatest moments in cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always floored by a powerful ending, particularly one without words. Japanese films are known for it, my faves being "The Summer of Kikujiru" (2000), "Sway" (2006) and the Kurosawa masterpiece "To Live" (1952). It takes a bold filmmaker to end without words, and if successful, the impact on the audience is staggering. Without ruining anything, I'll just tell you that "About Schmidt" pulls a real ace out of its sleeve in the final moments, unexpected yet perfect, and the delivery by Jack Nicholson is one of those moments that asserts how nobody but Jack could have pulled it off.Well, maybe Christopher Walken, but that goes without saying.Other reviewers have reacted to this film with everything from hysterical laughter to utter despair. While I didn't experience either of the two, I came away with a feeling of total satisfaction, like I just learned something profound and eye-opening. "About Schmidt" is an underdog story but with a message unlike any I've seen in a while. If you focus on the underdog part of the story, then yes, you might think this is a sad film. But if you dig under the surface, you may find it beautifully inspiring. In that respect, it's like many of the classic underdog stories that leave audiences either dancing or despondent. It's entirely up to you.This is a slow-paced film, so if you're looking for something breezy and snappy, you won't find it here. The comedy is extremely subtle, so there aren't many LOL moments. But like a good satire, characters and situations are so bizarre and inappropriate that you can't resist a few chuckles. The pacing and delivery reminded me of the subdued Adam Sandler character in "Punch Drunk Love" or the equally low-key Tom Hanks in "Joe Vs the Volcano", two surreal comedies I highly recommend. Jack Nicholson, I realize now, is a great deadpan comedian, owing largely to his slightly sinister presence even when he's playing a harmless old man.His role as retiree Warren Schmidt is definitely one of his tamer performances. But egads, the ending brings it all together with a powerful message we all should remember. I highly recommend this film to people of all ages, particularly those who often ask themselves, as the character Warren Schmidt does: "What in the world is better because of me?" Watch the movie, and it may help you answer that cosmic question for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Gives One Career Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a comedy-drama film directed by Alexander Payne and it stars Jack Nicholson in the title role together with Hope Davis,Dermot Mulroney and Kathy Bates. The main narrative of the film follows Schmidt as he retires from his pedestrian job, followed by the death of his wife for whom he has lost affection. He goes on a road trip in order to attend the wedding of his only daughter to a man and into a family he does not particularly like. Events compel him to reflect on his life with a sense of futility that lasts until the final moments of the film.It is very loosely based on the novel of the same title by Louis Begley. Warren Schmidt has settled into a dormant life. He has an unfulfilled marriage to Helen and conspires to spend as much time away from her as possible. His daughter Jeannie is engaged to Randall Hertzel, a man Schmidt believes is entirely unworthy of his daughter. When Helen unexpectedly dies, Warren is adrift until he discovers old love letters sent to his wife from his best friend. This inspires Warren to make a valiant effort to stop his daughter's wedding. His plans start to go awry when he meets Randall's extroverted mother, Roberta.In this character study, Nicholson gives one of the best performances of his career as he provides us a cuttingly funny, moving portrayal of a man searching for meaning in his unremarkable, unmemorable life.Also,it was a great movie on a touching and human story about a man who comes to the realisation that his life is nothing more than a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that means a god-damn thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Schmidt has just retired from his insurance job, where he worked as an actuary for decades in Omaha, Nebraska. He has now begun the life of retirement, where days seem even more mundane than the days when you were working. As Warren wanders on the path of uncertainty for the first few days of his retirement, he becomes bored and has the looming feeling of dreary uselessness following him everywhere he goes.He then sees an advertisement on TV for an organization that allows one to donate money to a child suffering in a third world country. We usually find those commercials on the most unlikely of channels, and they usually cause an abrupt tonal change in the commercial line-up. He decides to donate money and learns his monthly donations are helping a little Tanzanian boy named Ndugu Umbo. It is when he writes long, rambling letters to Ndugu that we learn more about the man who is Warren Schmidt. The first fifteen minutes of the film invite very little dialog in.Warren lives with his wife Helen Schmidt (June Squibb), who he is beginning to loathe. He hates the way she smells, the way she interrupts him; you get the idea. He starts to look at his life in a very heartbreaking sense. It would appear that he has done nothing he feels he should be proud of. He once imagined himself on the cover of many magazines, running a successful business, and being recognized as a man of supreme honor and confidence.And then... family happened. That seems to be the justification for many who don't succeed. It's a vital excuse. Warren settled down, became less ambitious, had a daughter (Hope Davis), and has now become more and more isolated in the game of emotions and life. But after his wife dies in the blink of an eye, he becomes a more uncaring soul, one with little motivation to do anything; including shop for food.He eventually decides to take his new Winnebago on a road trip to try and stop his daughter from marrying an underachieving waterbed salesman, who is played by the unfortunately unrecognized Dermot Mulroney, in his umpteenth film role. He manages to connect with some townfolk along the way, and attempts to find some real value in life and pursues something many of us are afraid to do.Jack Nicholson leaps into the role of Warren Schmidt, reminding us why he is one of the greatest screen actors of all time. When he is on screen with Kathy Bates is when truly great material comes forth. His isolation is cold, his attempts at connection are pragmatically awkward, as they should be, and his way of coming to terms with his life and himself are bitterly raw. This is a heartbreaking and heartwarming parable that comes gift-wrapped as the retelling of how many seniors decide to life the remaining years of their life; unmotivated and unmoved. At what point do we stop seeking adventure and joy and just settle for redundancy? Writer/director Alexander Payne has yet to make a bad film. He is incredibly capable of illustrating characters, providing them with situations, and never drawing them outside the lines of realism. He also never fears to get his audiences' emotions going, by painting scenes that simply tug at the heart strings. He is one of Hollywood's most mature directors. Certainly one that more people need to give the time of day.Warren Schmidt doesn't seek closure as much as he seeks just meaning and something of an impact, which is why I was personally so entranced by the picture. In a time where characters are motivated by petty things like greed and egotism, here is a perfectly stable character who just wants to die knowing that he will be somewhat remembered and not disregarded or disposed as soon as he hits the casket. It's safe to say that this is a film that means a god-damn thing.Starring: Jack Nicholson, June Squibb, Hope Davis, Dermot Mulroney, and Kathy Bates. Directed by: Alexander Payne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Sideways but worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not know what to expect. I had previously seen two Alexander Payne's movies: Sideways, which I really enjoyed, and The Descendants, which sucked really bad. Overall, About Schmidt stands between the two, not as enjoyable than Sideways, but far much than The Descendants. Great acting for Jack Nicholson, who plays the role of a recently retired and widower who wants to reconnect with his estranged daughter before she gets married. As in Sideways, a road trip gives the protagonist the occasion to think about his life, past and present. Good supporting cast also. I on a personal note really enjoyed the performance of Hope Davis, who play's Nicholson daughter, and Dermot Mulroney, who plays her husband. Although it is listed on IMDb as a comedy and a drama, do not expect to many laughs. Fairly good movie overall, but a little too long and that's why I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten years on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So its been ten years since this movie came out. I watched it back then and loved it, but moved on to other fare. Now, with Blockbuster going out of business, I picked up this DVD for two bucks, and popped it in for another view. Then I watched it again. And again. Each time I think about the ending I shed a tear. Who on EARTH beat out Jack Nicholson for best actor that year? I rank his performance in the top ten acting jobs of all time. And who is Johnathon Payne, who can give us this movie and the movie "Election" too, which is another movie I can watch over and over. (But then to disappoint with "Sideways"?) ...I realize this review is not very analytical, but I will end it with one observation: Of course, Schmidt, at the end of the movie, concludes that his life has been a failure, and that, when he dies, and those who knew him die, it will be like he never existed; that his life has not changed anyone or changed anything for the better. But then, after he sees the picture that little Ngudu drew for him, a picture of the two of them holding hands, he realizes that he HAS made a difference to someone, and his life does have meaning. Note that when he first views the picture, his image in it has a Mona Lisa-like half smile. Then, while he weeps, he looks at it again, and sees that his image is smiling fully. If the "goof" wasn't intentional, it should have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a tale of an old man, who's life sucks. Nobody cares about him, nobody need him. He is greatly disappointed in who his daughter is going to marry, and tries to be controlling, which is not a necessarily a good quality, but the viewer still feels sympathy for this poor old soul. The only person Schmidt is able to confide in is the child in Africa he is sponsoring. It is in his letters that he can express what he is really feeling.Jack Nicholson has one of his best performances ever, and that's saying something, considering his fantastic career. It isn't all depressing scene after depressing scene, because if a movie is too sad, it isn't enjoyable. There is plenty of humor, dark or otherwise, along the way to lighten the mood.It's in an emotional journey from beginning to end and is one the most human movies ever.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminded Me of "Henderson the Rain King"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne has quietly and steadily assembled one of the most impressive oeuvres of any movie director working today."About Schmidt" stars Jack Nicholson as a successful businessman who discovers how little his "success" means when he finds himself a retired widower. He takes off across country in an RV on one of those voyages of self discovery that can be awfully tedious to watch another person go through. But it's not tedious here, mostly because of Nicholson's sparkling comic performance and the nearly perfect writing and directing, which finely balance humor and pathos, frequently eliciting laughs, occasionally wringing tears, but never descending into cheap sentimentality.One of the funniest and most touching plot threads involves a little African boy whom Nicholson befriends as a pen pal in an attempt to do something meaningful. In the film's last scene, he receives a letter back from the little boy, and it's one of the most devastating (but in a good way) endings to a movie I've ever seen.And by the way, does anyone else think that this movie and the book it was based on may have been inspired by Saul Bellow's "Henderson the Rain King." I see many parallels to that story.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the most real of just about any film out there today. Jack Nicholson is almost unrecognizable, and never falls into his clichéd characteristics that so often ruin his films for me. I love that they cast ordinary looking characters and kept them ordinary. I lived in that part of the country for about 10 years and really chuckled at some of the characteristics that are so typical of that region. For example...Randall saying 'I'm stoked' to Warren and also, 'how's it hanging?' Even his horrific mullet. Jeannie is right at home with them, despite her father's misgivings.The scenes with Kathy Bates are so brilliant. There is the smallest reference to her character in Misery when she asks Warren if he has anything in the bedpan for her. Everyone makes such a big deal about her brief nudity, but it is so fitting and real. I get so irritated at people saying 'eew' or the one comment that said 'cover your eyes'. Get over it. Kathy Bates is a typical, middle aged woman and that is what most of them really look like. I applaud her bravery. She plays Robert with such realism.These types of character study films are such a relief from the shock-em up, non stop action tripe that we are dealt with such frequency. This is a quiet, slice of real life. Warren could be a member of any of our families. I challenge anyone to keep a dry eye when Warren is smearing his late wife's face cream on his face and weeping, or going through her clothes and holding her shoes.There are just so many beautiful, real scenes in this movie. Rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Schmidt is retired. He's not very happy with it - spending more time with his distant wife is definitely not something he's looking for. As if it was enough his only daughter is getting married with Randall. And Randall is nothing like son-in-low should look like - according to Schmidt...This could be classic beginning of marriage comedy, but it isn't. Instead we get slowly developing tale of getting old, and dealing with it, story of dealing with loneliness, uselessness and lack of perspectives. But don't be frightened. There's also great deal of intelligent humor and wonderful Jack Nicholson with his outstanding performance as Schmidt.This movie is so wonderfully balanced between drama (and this parts are really dramatic) and comedy (and this time are bitter but funny) that it's true rarity.

		<fullReview>I giggle when I read embittered reviews that drone on about a film being "depressing." Point well taken, yet mission accomplished. Every movie is not supposed to be lighthearted with whimsical, pleasant characters that make us feel warm and fuzzy.The Catch 22 for some filmmakers is their characters often can't win; they're either too real or "too" real for many.About Schmidt...Warren Schmidt has such contempt for his son-in-law and forbids his daughter to marry him because he sees his own underachieving traits in Randall and does not want Jeannie marrying her loser of a father. The stark similarities between Randall's trade school certificate and Schmidt's pat on the back retirement dinner are screaming to be acknowledged.The hot tub scene with Kathy Bates had me laughing so hard I had tears streaming down my face. Schmidt's reaction to her come-on was right on time and priceless. I would have given this movie a 10, but Kathy Bates' performance seemed a tad exaggerated; a forced Earth Mother archetype of sorts.After "About Schmidt" and "Sideways," I can only wonder what the next Alexander Payne mid-to-late life crisis havin'-American male on a road trip-to enlightenment gem will be next. Good job with this one, though.</fullReview>

He was in charge a insurance company, but now he is retiring. Suddenly he finds he is useless and tries his best to find meaning in his now empty life. Then his wife dies he finds a new freedom which he is completely unable to cope with.The result is a cross country trip to see his daughter marrying a southern redneck.Alexander Payne is a genius at finding the story in the ordinary. But it is mostly window dressing and the story lacks any real substance, with little new being said before. Mostly it is the stuff of TV sitcoms put on the big screen.If you are a middle class tosser looking for meaning in your life and having really read anything except the business section of the newspaper in 10 years you might see or learn something new in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would have been an innocuous film had anyone save Jack Nicholson starred in it. Schmidt is an ordinary man in an ordinary world who had just retired from a job that he once thought was somewhat special. So begins the journey of self-realization. He takes a trip in the motor home he had bought only because his wife had insisted upon him buying it. He becomes a foster father "to save a starving child" after watching a Sally Struthers-like infomercial, and it is through his letters to this child whom he had never met that becomes the vehicle for the plot. Schmidt has a daughter who is getting married, but his daughter has little interest in him per se. Nevertheless, Schmidt does what he can in order to provide fatherly advice and guidance, not to mention helping her out financially. This movie is built upon subtleties that not only relate to men approaching the autumn years of life, but to all males in general; at least, I would hope so. Although pretty much a rather low-keyed movie, the final scene bears a poignancy that causes me to give this film 5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 8 or 10 worst things I have ever seen in nearly 50 years of going to the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first online review. I registered with imdb to write it because I am sick and tired of seeing people gush over About Schmidt, which is easily one of the 8 or 10 worst things I have ever seen in nearly 50 years of going to the movies.What do I know about Warren Schmidt?He considers his wife of many years a stranger. Indeed, after the initial shock of her death, he seems glad to be rid of her. He didn't like her much anyway, but apparently the main reason for his relief is that he can now realize a lifelong ambition to live in a state of slovenliness that would not be tolerated in most university fraternity houses, much less in the homes of grown men.He loves his only child as "daddy's little girl", but seems not to have even noticed that she has grown into a young woman and, for better or worse, embarked on a life of her own. She is a stranger, too, since Schmidt makes no attempt to know her.He rejects his only remaining friend from the job over an affair the friend had 25 years before with Mrs. Schmidt, about whom, as noted above, he cared nothing anyway. At least this scene let me know Schmidt has a pulse. Before, he reminded me of the joke about an accountant who became an actuary because accounting was too much excitement.For all his actuarial knowledge of other people's futures, he has given no thought to his own future and seems unaware that one might even plan for a future, beyond financial planning. An excellent title for this film would have been The Man Who Wasn't There, if someone else had not already used it.It is a hallmark of good fiction that the author makes the reader or viewer care about the characters and hope things turn out well or badly for them, according to what they deserve. I cannot even imagine why anyone would care whether Warren Schmidt spends the next 20 years communing with other shrieking losers in RV parks, or, alternately, drives his motor home into the Missouri River and sinks out of the world forever. He doesn't seem to deserve any fate because he doesn't seem to be anyone. What is it About Schmidt that I was supposed to bring home from the theater? I have no idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Schmidt (2002): Dir: Alexander Payne / Cast: Jack Nicholson, Kathy Bates, Hope Davis, Dermot Mulroney, June Squibb: Another masterpiece by director Alexander Payne who previously made Election. One could say that it isn't so much about Schmidt as it is about what he isn't. Warren Schmidt is retiring and realizes that he has accomplished nothing. He settles down with a resourceful wife and an RV but eventually he sponsors a child in Africa through a TV ad at $22 monthly plus a letter. After his wife dies his daughter announces her engagement to a man he doesn't approve of. On his way to her wedding he visits places from years gone by before meeting the dysfunctional future son-in-laws. Jack Nicholson balances humour and emotion as Schmidt who searches for connection and reason. Kathy Bates is hilarious as a future in-law who makes a surprise appearance in a hot tub. Hope Davis plays Schmidt's daughter with reason and understanding. Dermot Mulruney plays her fiancé whose good intentions misfire. June Squibb plays Schmidt's wife briefly in the opening scenes. She steals her scenes until her sudden passing. This becomes director Payne's second great success and he continues with themes of regret and the ability to propel forward in life. In this film we are asked to make the best of what time we have and less time for regret. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a great character drama and it has some popular themes of overcoming grief, bonding with loved ones, and how to make new friends. This film works thanks to some great directing and some powerful performances especially by lead actor Jack Nicholson. Alexander Payne is a very good director and he knows how to bring out the best in his actors. He's very good at making these sort of dramas and this film is no exception.Payne's film is about an old guy named Schmidt who has just retired. After a tragic moment in his life, he decides to take a road trip to see his daughter marry a man that he has negative feelings for.This film is very well-acted. If you thought Jack Nicholson could never deliver a performance as he did back in his prime, you'd be wrong. He is utterly fantastic here. The supporting cast is strong too and in particular I feel like Kathy Bates did a wonderful job.Overall, this is a great, emotional drama that studies many different types of characters and their personas. This film will make you laugh and it will make you cry. Surprisingly, this film ended up a bit funnier than I thought it would. But this is a very good film! I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch About Schmidt over and over again and i don't know exactly why, but I've never get tired of it. It's a simple, yet amazing movie about an old man that loses his wife and have to deal with loneliness and the marriage of his only daughter, which for him is also the loss of the only person left in his family.In essence, About Schmidt is a comedy, though, with a somber tone sometimes, and a little bit of melancholy, built perfectly with the use of the soundtrack, the minimalistic kind of Erik Satie piano throughout most of the movie.Now, if you pay close attention, it's not just a comedy. This movie is about how the lives of other people have impact on your own, for good or bad, and how we can pursue happiness on the simplest things, because we focus so much on the things that we think are important, on problems that we think are so big, and these things just really stay in the way of what really matters. The ending scene is the heartbreaking conclusion that Schimidt finds out after so much time and effort trying to hold on to things that he could let go before, and the realization of how little his problems and concerns are, because with a little money and the cathartic letters that he always send to Ndugu completely changed the life of another human being, and that Schmidt life wasn't completely worthless as he thought on his way back home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning Jack Nicholson's character is fronting a series of changes in his life. He's retiring, he's wife's no longer living and he's only daughter is about to get married with a man, who he hates from root of his heart. This sets a triumph of events, what a good drama/comedy is all about.It is this hidden gem that I have discovered to be the strongest act from Jack Nicholson. While most parts of the movie were hilarious as a movie can get, it lefts a viewer in awe how emotional and sad the story is - when summed up together. Even after my third view I was all in tears, which doesn't happen too often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of Jack Nicholson's best roles. He plays a newly retired actuary for an insurance company:on top of that, his wife has just died, he had just agreed to sponsor a child in Africa, and his estranged daughter is getting married to someone he doesn't approve of. He takes a road journey to hook up with her. This was also a superb, introspective drama about finding out about yourself. The scenes with Kathy Bates and the family were the best. I loved Bates's and Hope Davis's roles. Nicholson was a great character in the movie, and I thought the part about his sponsoring a child was a nice touch. The opening retirement party was a great opening.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"About Schmidt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***** I was unsure about "About Schmidt." The spiritual journey of a retiree struggling to find solace and meaning in his life was not a premise I thought would be particularly compelling. But seeing as the film had had good reviews and had Jack Nicholson in the lead role, I thought I'd give it a try. I am extremely glad that I did not pass on the opportunity to see this movie.There are many so-called comedy-dramas out there that will get it completely wrong. Either they overload on the drama, so that the comedy gets smothered, or they overload on the comedy and thusly make the drama seem forced and farcical, making it difficult for the viewer to take the action seriously."About Schmidt" gets the balance about right. I laughed and cried in equal measure. It tickled your funny bone and tugged at your heartstrings. I believe that screenwriters Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor are to thank for this. Their works very often blend comedy and drama, 99% of the time with satisfying results. "About Schmidt" is no exception.But putting Payne and Taylor aside, the film does owe a lot of its humour and pathos to Jack Nicholson, who delivers one of the finest performances of the modern era of filmmaking in the role of Warren R. Schmidt.Nicholson carries the film and it wouldn't have been half as good without him headlining the cast. His evocation of Warren Schmidt is a nuanced portrayal that is undoubtedly powerful. Every line that Nicholson delivers he delivers in his usual sharp-witted style, but with an undercurrent of sadness that you feel in every bone of your body. You weep for Warren Schmidt.The supporting cast are not as strong as Nicholson. I found most of the characters to be one-dimensional, though I will concede that Kathy Bates stands out as Roberta, mother of the man Nicholson's daughter is about to marry.Other than that, the supporting cast are good but slightly bland. Nicholson and Bates, however, rise above.A genuinely funny, genuinely touching film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life as the sum total of choices that could have been avoided ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a revision from a politician's statement that perfectly describes Jack Nicholson's state of mind in "About Schmidt", while he contemplates all his achievements.The film opens in a Midwest town like so many other towns, in a building, like so many other buildings. A man is sitting in an emptied room and in one of the most depressingly suspenseful moments, he stares at the clock, beholding the last seconds of his job. We're in Omaha, Nebraska, in the Woodmen of the World insurance company, and Warren Schmidt, 66 years old, is retiring.The clock hits five but time doesn't stop for all that, the tickling goes on while he just gets up, turns off the lights and leaves the room. In the same anticlimactic spirit, he's enduring with a severe patience the retirement dinner and the hypocritical speech from the new actuary who just moved up with wife and child, but ultimately, he comes back home, it's a rainy night, his wife Helen talks with Jeannie, their soon-to-be married daughter and that's that: Warren has just ceased to be the 'star of the day'. He wakes up in the morning, Helen made him a surprise with a breakfast in their new Winnebago adventurer, but just like Warren, we're wondering: what next?"About Schmidt" opens with contemplative moments, and the editing spare on ellipses allows us to witness Warren's existential dead end, which could be ours. We all want to have good jobs, to run successful lives, with minimum of wealth, to raise a family, but what when all of these dreams are fulfilled? Like Warren, the risk is to take them for granted until retirement comes as a shock therapy, finally hitting with a bolt of lucidity. Warren realizes how much he's estranged to his wife, how some habits of her became unbearable, and much more than this, how dull and boring his life is. He dreamed of being one of these admired leaders, but could he even lead his own life? A visit to his ex-office reveals how useless he became, the new actuary doesn't have time, and his belongings are sent to the garbage collector. Warren is already history.It's just as if "About Schmidt" was emphasizing Ferris Buller's wise words: "Life moves pretty fast. You don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." What exactly did Warren miss? Probably the point of life, the purpose of everything he built his dreams and ambitions on, he didn't live, but let himself embarked in an illusion of comfort, as if he was baking the very pie that was thrown at his face. A light of hope though, comes with an advertisement for a foster program for Children in Africa, Warren sponsors a little African boy named N'Dugu, sending him money and letters where he can finally express his thoughts and vent his anger. The letters work as great plot devices because they give Warren a sort of reason to exist, by being helpful, and enlighten us on his most intimate feelings without a cliché voice-over.Yet the real turning point comes with the sudden death of Helen, from a blood clot in the brain. Warren's routine is finally broken, for better or for worse but Alexander Payne's tone is so delightfully cynical we suspect this death would be a 'blessing', maybe not for Warren but for us viewers who'll finally see him 'in action'. After all, Helen was less depicted as the loving wife than the stranger who asked him to sit while urinating. And after weeks of depression, when he discovers that Helen cheated on him with his best friend, the sight of Warren standing up to urinate is our relief. We know something has changed, and are eager to follow Warren in his road trip through the Midwest aboard the Adventurer. Many Jack Nicholson's films invited us to a conscience-examining road-trip like "Easy Rider", "Five Easy Pieces" or "The Last Detail". If Warren doesn't exactly know what he's pursuing, he knows what he's escaping from, a bit like American pioneers, to which some visited historical places paid tribute. He tries to give a meaning to his life, to be useful for the only person who still counts. Some hilarious moments during the funeral showed how Warren was reluctant to the idea of Jeannie marrying Randall, a water-bed salesman from Denver, the kind who tries to recycle his pyramid scheme learning, an authentic schmuck played by Dermot Mulroney, and his family doesn't improve the picture, although it's highlighted by a wonderful breakthrough performance by Kathy Bates, as Randall's free-spirited, sexual and sensual mother.Warren Schmidt's arc is an evolution from a lethargic/passive to a hilarious/active character, the film avoids those clichés, because as active as he was, he finally had to compromise with the idea of the wedding, give a warm speech to people he personally despised and get back home at the end, after all, he's not a pioneer. It's about a man trying to look at the right side of life, if not the bright, giving it a direction that would help him to end his life the best way. It all comes to an end, so let's live what's left to the fullest. It's a mix of hope and sadness, a cocktail of pessimism and optimism. Either I'm happy because I ONLY have 10 years to live or because I STILL have 10 years to live. It's a whole mindset to build and that the last letter finally gives the first bricks, and Warren's happiness is absolutely communicative.Nicholson dilutes his usual character in this witty and meaningful comedy-drama, written and directed by Alexander Payne, without the usual magnetism but with a unique capability to communicate his inner feelings, as in the unforgettable last shot. Nicholson delivers one of his best performances, and if it ever was last to be Oscar-nominated, there couldn't have been a better one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies give answers others more questions. But sometimes comes along a movie/story that goes beyond just questions and or answers. There is also this state of consciousness where neither the questions matter or its answers.The way the life of Warren Schmidt's has been portrayed is simply amazing and every bit true about all of us as well. If we were to compress our entire life into a few seconds one would see that there are only a few moments of joy and happiness. The rest is littered and scribbled to black with solitude, even on a busy crossing. The movie only goes to show that it takes 60+ years to realize that. But the director has done well by not taking that route completely and sprinkled it with humor to keep our attention, otherwise most of the audience would sub-consciously reject the very idea of solitude. It is scary. Every second spent seeing the movie is a well spent second. If you are feeling down and gloomy please don't feel sad you are not alone the whole planet is feeling the same at some point in time or another, no matter how masterfully they seem to be hiding it.The movie comes highly recommended. Please rent this movie and reflect upon it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great performance by Jack Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schimdt was a nice dramady with mind blowing performance by Jack Nicholson who vehemently carried the film on his shoulder. Warren Schimdt has retired from his job where he served the company for 20 years. He looks back at his life and recollects the memories as to what he really wanted to be and what he eventually became now. To start afresh, he begins to do social charity and adopts an orphan in Africa. Sooner his wife dies , he decides to go on an adventurous road trip where he meets different people and understand more about life. Alexendar Payne , who has given us Sideways , has always focused on relationships. His movies are always so chilled out and entertaining with realistic characters. About Schimdt is about life of a 65 year old who have dreamt to make it big in life but never dares to take risk. The good part of the film is it simplicity and yet so attentive. Hats off to Payne for making it entertaining with the character which you easily relate to. The screenplay is grasping along with a very good storyline. The dialogues are catchy. The cinematography is eye-catching. Background score is superb. Coming to the performances , it is Jack Nicholson show all the way. The Oscar nominated actor once again proves his versatility. He makes his acting so easy going that it is unbelievable of the roles he does in all his films. He completely goes into the character of Warren Schimdt and gives his best to T. Kathy Bates is effective in small role This flick is perfect for Sunday eve if you want to relax and enjoy the movie yet so entertaining of the movie with beautiful message and of course stupendous performance by Jack Nicholson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got mixed feelings about "About Schmidt". There's a part of me that liked it, and a part of me that didn't.At times, the film's pacing is a little slow for my taste, but Nicholson makes it bearable. I don't know how much I would've liked this movie had a different actor been cast in the lead.The film had a quirky sense of humor, which was quite funny in certain parts, particularly; in scenes where Nicholson is writing his sponsor child, Ndugu. But, in general, there are quite a few humorous scenes scattered throughout the movie.My only real critique is I think the movie could've been a little shorter than it was, but I'm not going to gripe too much.If you like Nicholson, you'll like this movie. That's pretty much all the more you need to really know. Conversely, if you're not a big Nicholson fan, the quiet script may not be enough to keep you interested in what's going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not typical Nicholson, still a drama that proves friendship, connection, and self discovery is important.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson typically doesn't take on the roles of characters like Warren Schmidt very often, mostly Jack can best be remembered as a villain or a ladies man, and clearly Warren Schmidt is a man in need of love and friends. Still Jack Nicholson(in my opinion the best actor ever)pulls off the role of Warren Schmidt in top form(Oscar nominated). And director Alexander Payne is one who always makes touching emotional beautiful dramas of love, family, and friendship. And this picture "About Schmidt" clearly sends out the theme and messages of connection, friendship, and self discovery.Jack is Warren Schmidt a newly retired insurance salesman who is about to see how life can roll and the journey begins all new. Warren and wife Helen had big plans to see America yet as many know in life things happen unexpected and Warren sees a change that's forever. Now alone Warren is determined to stop his daughter Jeannie's(Hope Davis)wedding to a slacker type bed salesman Randall Hertzel(Dermot Mulroney). Along the way on the journey from Nebraska to Denver, Warren sees new roads and a new path while visiting old historical sites. The meeting of Randall's mom Roberta(Kathy Bates in fine form)was a unique and funny meeting, and all along this journey of connection and meeting people Warren is sponsoring a Tanzanian foster child. This journey is clearly a road of self discovery.Overall "About Schmidt" is a film in fine form it's a touching emotional drama that proves friendship and love is important, and it shows that a journey leads to self discovery proving that you never get to old to discover and it's okay to look at the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be honest I wasn't sure what to expect with this film as it centres round quite emotional themes, but with Jack Nicholson as the star I decided to take the chance.The story involves a recently-retired insurance worker who loses his wife of 42 years shortly thereafter and is unhappy with his daughter's choice of fiancée. So in a way the story is patterned on cross-roads meaning of life type theme.Jack Nicholson plays the lead beautifully and is uncharacteristically "quieter" in the role as Warren Schmidt. Despite the film's slow start the film begins to pace up when the character Schmidt, after watching an children's charity advert sponsors a young 6-year-old boy from Tazania called Ndugu Umbo. In a slightly comic turn, Schmidt begins to write letters to Ndugu with give narration to parts of the film's story.The brilliant Kathy Bates comes in later in the film as the mother of the fiancée and brings a more comic feel.The film as a whole after watching it in its entirety left an emotional mark, especially with the touching ending.I would recommend to this film to anybody and it's one of the best I've watched but expect a roller-coaster of emotions in what at first appears to be a comedy but soon becomes more like a revealing character study with a comic undertone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Schmidt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw About Schmidt. It was a good movie. One of Jack Nicholson's best performances. In this quirky movie Jack plays a recently retired man named Warren Schmidt. Schmidt does not not get along with his wife and also has conflicts with his daughter over her fiancé, whom Schmidt disproves of. Schmidt tries to persuade his daughter to rethink her life, but it is no use, she has already made up her mind to marry the guy. Schmidt soon feels estranged from his family because he finds it hard to communicate to them. He begins to feel dejected. He decides to go on a road trip to revisit the places he used to know. During the road trip, he reminisces about his past, and comes to terms with himself. That is About Schmidt in a nutshell. About Schmidt gets a little sad in sections, but its not a total downer, it is very funny in spots. It is also a touching movie. I would definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Schmidt is about a lonely guy without a heart and without almost anything. Jack Nicholson is great as Warren. Because we all know he can play those roles well. The rude roles. Well, lets face it, Jack Nicholson can play anybody he wants to play and could do it well, because he's awesome. If it's The Joker or Frank Costello, he can play anybody. About Schmidt is from director Alexander Payne who directed the fantastic Sideways and Election. I really appreciated About Schmidt because it was funny, depressing, and surprising. Now I say surprising because you see Kathy Bates naked. Now I know what you're thinking... yes it's frightening. To me, I think this is Alexander Payne's funniest and best film yet. I would've said deepest, but Sideways is as deep as a film can get. Or just about as deep as a film can get. I just think that Nicholson does such a good job as Warren and About Schmidt is a very real film. Kind of like with What just happened, but this film kicks that film's ass. About Schmidt is a fantastic comedy that I really, surprisingly liked. Though Jack Nicholson is in it, I never really wanted to see it. But I was pleasantly surprised.The Plot: Warren Schmidt, 66, has just retired. His life falls apart when his wife dies. When his wife dies, he wants his daughter to take care of him. He also tries to break up the wedding between his daughter and her boyfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Master Brings It Home...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, that master of acting, truly proved his versatility as an actor and cemented himself (in my opinion) as one of the finest actors to ever grace the screen with About Schmidt. We've loved Jack for years in all his really Jack-ish roles, playing the crazy, the hilarious, etc. But here we find him in a territory I've never before seen from him. In a role so vulnerable you can literally feel it, he delivers some of the most subtle and personal and moving work of his prestigious career.Warren Schmidt is retiring. His daughter is getting married to a man who doesn't approve of. He and his wife can hardly relate to each other anymore. And with his retirement he has to face it all up front for the first time in a long time. And he doesn't much like what he sees. Through letters written to the impulse Tanzanian child Warren is sponsoring, we get a glimpse into what is going through the mind of a man faced with a life he isn't pleased with. But Warren isn't without hope. Rather than giving up, he gathers himself together and sets off on a mission to save his daughter (and maybe himself)- But is he too late? About Schmidt is a light-hearted film dealing with some very heavy issues indeed. It's a slow-moving, contemplative piece of work, and one that will keep you mulling for some time afterward. The character of Schmidt is a truly tragic; As he faces the close of his life he must also face that he's done nothing with it. He finds himself so very alone, a victim of never really going through with what his heart tells him to, limited by fear. Through the simplest of things Schmidt begins to see his life for what it really is, and this is where the movie excels.The part is played to simple perfection by Mr. Nicholson; I defy you not to be moved by his journey. Hope Davis and Dermot Mulroney offer support as Schmidt's daughter and fiancé, and Kathy Bates even shows up as an hilarious and bizarrely unique mother-of-the-groom. No one can steal the spotlight away from Nicholson, though, as he really grounds the movie and makes it work as well as it does. Truly this is the work of a master, in a performance that really hits home.Flaws? Well, it's a little too slow and a tad uneven in it's tone. It's definitely funny the first time through, and leads up to an undeniably heartbreaking final scene so memorable it's hard not to think about it the entire second time through. It's a movie that everyone should take the time to see. Can you learn a lesson from Schmidt? Do you see yourself in him? These are hard questions to ask, but as the movie brings us to that heartbreak and acceptance, it also leads us to a place of simple, beautiful hope that brings the entire film to a near-perfect close.

		<fullReview>This film is brilliant and the fact that it's not in the top best does surprise me. About Schmidt is one of those masterpieces that shock you with their simplicity and beauty. A biting story about life, about hope...and about irrevocable losses. And some gains. A movie you can watch whenever, wherever and always feel touched. You don't cry, sigh or laugh hysterically, you just think. And that's the best thing a movie can offer you. Jack Nicholson is Oscar worthy for this part and Kathy Bates is just deliciously funny when she's naked with him (and achieves not to make it just stupid and sexual). My favorite scene has to be his wedding speech. Oh and the argument with the daughter over the cheap casket. Brilliant, just brilliant. Bottom line: A movie you need to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poignant Examination of Loneliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poignant examination of loneliness, I also found this to be Alexander Payne's funniest film to date. His editing technique reminds me of Wes Anderson, with less irony and self- consciousness. Warren was an especially interesting character, as he subtly reveals his less appealing side throughout the course of the film. Nicholson's performance really brings out even the most minute aspects of Warren's character, from his fear of what the future holds, to his desperation for human interaction.All of the characters ring true, as they each develop in a very complete and satisfying manner. Randall turns out to be genuinely sincere and thoughtful, despite a physical appearance that suggests otherwise. Jeannie's anxiety, and her troubled relationship with Warren don't feel forced, but rather add an interesting dimension to the film's plot.Payne, as always, gets the most out of his actors, and gives the film an appropriately small-town, low-budget feel. His handling of the film's humor is superb, as he makes it flow within the film instead of stopping and forcing the audience to acknowledge it.The ending deserves special mention, as Payne avoids unnecessary epilouges, leaving the plot open while ending on an emotionally satisfying note. This is so rare in film, as most screenwriters strive to tie up every loose end in the story, often at the audiences' expense.The film though, does sag at times in the second act, and I wish more time had been spent developing the relationship between Helen and Warren, but overall, it is an emotionally satisfying experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something about Schmidt ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came away from this movie feeling it was well-made but could have been better than it was. I don't know if I'll have a chance to read the novel, but I'd like to see if it provides a few clues about why Warren Schmidt turned out the way he is.I also wonder if the animal imagery in the film was mentioned or expanded upon in the book. The prize-winning cows portrayed next to the picture of Warren at his retirement dinner, the chicken being prepared for dinner pounded with a knife by Helen, cattle being transported, perhaps to slaughter, their eyes meeting Warren's as he drives past on the highway, the close-up of the giant roast beef at the reception -- and a deleted scene with Helen and Ray &amp; wife tearing into prime ribs at a restaurant while Warren sits, again unable to eat. Are these statements about the American diet and treatment of animals, or an analogy: Warren feeling as if he is trapped, led to slaughter and devoured by life? Another scene in the movie, at the RV camp, when the husband camper says he just lit some matches to explain why Warren smells smoke, is perhaps explained in the book since it doesn't make much sense.Both the film and most comments describe Warren as someone who missed out on life. True, but why? He is alienated from everyone and everything, even from himself.Jack Nicholson conveys this from the opening scene. He watches the clock, but without emotion; he appears to be in a trance. At his retirement dinner, he hardly touches his food and instead of connecting emotionally with his wife, friends and people he has worked with for years, he slips out to the bar for a drink. Why is he like this? What was his upbringing like? Perhaps the film is saying it's common in Middle America to be like this, yet his friend Ray and others don't appear anywhere as disconnected and unhappy.Is Schmidt's sponsoring of an African child a gimmick in the film? Or does it tell us something about him? It seems he is looking for meaning in his life, after retiring from a job what was his life for so many years. To his credit, he tries to do something different. That alone causes me to disagree with the premise that he is a complete loser and failure. If he decided to just sit at home and drink, it would be something else. But picking up the phone to begin sponsorship is a hint that there might be more to Schmidt.He begins to write letters to the child, Ndugu, but not in a fatherly way, not telling him things about American children or explaining his life while asking questions about Ndugu's life, or anything that the boy could possibly understand or relate to in any way; instead he pours out his own frustrations about being replaced at work and how bored and annoyed he has become with his wife. The completely inappropriate letters become a personal journal, revealing thoughts -- mostly mundane -- that he has never expressed to others or himself. And yet, even in the letters he isn't honest, but puts on the same rather phony, polite face as he does with the people in his life.There is one point when he almost does relate to someone, the woman at the RV camp who tells him that she sees his sadness and loneliness as something much deeper than mourning his wife's death. She sees his repressed anger, someone depressed. Schmidt could have talked about his feelings and life. He does say if only his wife had understood him things might have been different, but that's all we get. Instead he reacts on a sexual level to the woman -- that is all he is capable of, he is slightly inebriated, but he still can't connect emotionally or intellectually.It becomes Warren Schmidt's mission to stop his daughter Jeanie from marrying her questionable fiancé, Randall, a not-very-bright water-bed salesman who has tried to get Warren involved in a "get rich quick" investment scheme. But Jeanie loves Randall, he treats her fine, and they seem happy together. This is another way in which Schmidt is unable to connect. He doesn't understand that there is no way he can stop the wedding and that he shouldn't try -- it's Jeanie's life. He's too late, as Jeanie tells him -- he never cared before and they obviously had no relationship.Schmidt returns home, feeling defeated, calling himself a failure, but he has learned something inwardly. It might seem like cowardice that he didn't stop the marriage, but in not pushing for that and instead making the most agreeable wedding reception speech that he was possibly capable of making, he is letting his daughter live her own life, make her own mistakes. He's humbled by this, and I think it is what makes him vulnerable to the emotions he feels when he sees the simple painting by the child..I would like to think that this begins the new chapter in his life. I think he began this process when he forgave Helen for cheating on him and tried to call Ray to make amends. No, he didn't get to leave a message, but maybe he will try again and have a closer relationship with Ray. Maybe he will get involved with others or somehow play a larger role in Ndugu's life. He might not ever have a good relationship with his daughter or become part of the family the way Randall's mother invites him to do. But he can still find meaning in his life and make a difference to someone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accurate portrayal of the less attractive aspects of life in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the most accurate portrayal of the less attractive aspects of life in America that, in my opinion, has ever been screened. The man who has devoted his entire life to his work and can't get over the shock of retirement; the wife who looks after him but makes him obey her strict rules; the discovery of the wife's love affair with his best friend; the banality of the retirement dinner; the headstrong daughter who insists on marrying a totally unsuitable wimp; the crudeness of the wimp's family, just to mention some of the all-too-common and negative aspects of American life, interpreted in this film by a splendid cast headed by Jack Nicholson and ably directed by Alexander Payne. Don't look for anything edifying in this film but it is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"About Schmidt" is excellent and warm movie about life of one ordinary man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is 60 year old man who lost his wife and actually tries to find meaning in his life. He realizes that now only family that he's got is his daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis). In order to get to Jeannie, Warren must travel from Omaha to Denver. In Denver his daughter is about to get married. She wants to marrie Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney). Warren never liked Randall but he's her daughter's choice. So Warren also must meet Randall's family, on top with Randall's mother Roberta Hertzel (Kathy Bates)."About Schmidt" is excellent movie from director Alexander Payne ("Sideways"). Payne created character of Warren Schmidt according to novel of Louis Begley. Warren is deeply unhappy man. He was unhappy when he was married because all his days were same. After he retired he soon lost his wife. He wasn't welcome at his former job and after death of his wife he became even more lonelier then he was. Warren realized what his wife meant to him because he had a person he could be with. Now all that was gone and he must establish contact with his daughter who's getting married to a man who he dislike. But very important thing is Randall's family. Warren thinks they are weird and they are but he needs someone just to be with. Warren wants to feel useful in his life. He wants to be remembered of something when he dies. That's why Warren becomes foster father to poor boy Ndugu. Warren writes Ndugu almost every day and he sends him money so boy could educate himself. Warren didn't cried when his wife died, he didn't cried when he's daughter got married but he did cried when little Ndugu send him his picture. Only that little thing, that picture could move Warren, could make him cry. Cause only little things in life are important.This movie really touched me. I watched it when it came out but I was too young to understand it. Yesterday I watched it again and I realized that this is great movie. Story is brilliant, just like acting. Jack Nicholson did his job highly professional. This is one of his greatest roles (nomination for Oscar). People in Academy obviously recognized Nicholson's effort in making Warren Schmidt so human and so natural. Nicholson doesn't act this role just to make another movie (like he did with some movies) and that's the reason why he's so long at the top. He changed the way he acted and people can recognize that. Jack, you are brilliant actor. Kathy Bates is also great actress and she has great monologue scene when Nicholson is lying in bed and she's giving him soup. That scene reminds me on her movie when she's keeping James Caan in bed ("Misery"). She was also nominated for Oscar in this movie.So we've got: one excellent director, two excellent actors and a great story in a movie that is not to be missed. One of my personal favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: (DVD) About Schmidt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Retirement can be a scary thing. I suppose it's about 40 years before I hit retirement age (given that it's a moving target on the increase), but I do confess at times I think about it, a time where I presumably have the opportunity to do whatever I please - travel, read, and of course watch more movies at discounted ticket prices, and so on, but whether or not I will have the strength and energy to do so will be a different story, and more importantly, whether my retirement funds will be sufficient to support a lifestyle I choose.Anyway I was surprised with About Schmidt. At first glance I thought it was going to be a mundane movie, but it had plenty of heart, and many moments of contemplation which actually made me ponder deeper about those sunset times. Jack Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt, a Vice President of an insurance company who retires at the start of the story. Naturally it takes much getting used to, and with time on his hands, he thinks about the legacy, or the lack thereof, in which he is leaving behind.From not being appreciated by the younger generation taking over his office, to trying to patch ties with his estranged daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) who's about to get married to a blue collared "loser" Randall (Dermot Mulroney, note that I put that word in quotations, because I thought I'd become fast friends with people like that, those who are genuinely earnest), much against his wishes, here's a portrait of an extremely sad, lonely man trying to take stock of his life, where little routine things suddenly become significant.The first half of the movie set the scene, before the second half takes us on a road trip of sorts, much like Broken Flowers or even Elizabethtown, during which Schmidt exhibits more of his insecurities and fear. Jack Nicholson did a superb job as usual fleshing out the character of Warren, with the cinematography being tip top in bringing out the detachment he experiences with his environment. You can feel his pain and wanting to belong, holding dear to treasures of his heart, especially his daughter. And to borrow these lines from his earlier movie, Jack's Warren Schmidt personifies "I'm only laughing on the outside, my smile is just skin deep. but if you look inside I'm really crying, you might join me for a weep!" to a T.Based on a novel by Louis Begley and directed by Alexander Payne (who brought us another road trip movie Sideways), one of the highlights of the movie is Warren's communication with an African child he adopted long distance. Through his letters, it becomes clear the issues he's grappling with, and some of the white lies he tells, which mirrors the way he lives his life. And I must say as much as movie endings are important, About Schmidt has one of the simplest, but most powerful message it brings out, and that is while we worry about the legacy we live behind in the world for generations to come, sometimes it's not necessary that it must be something monumental. The simplest gesture, straight from the heart, is all there is to make a difference, and stamp your mark.With an excellent waltz like theme for Warren Schmidt, and that shot of Encyclopedia Brown (nostalgia! I read that as a kid!), I'd recommend About Schmidt anytime should anyone ask which recent Jack Nicolson movies one should watch. Be warned though, the Code 3 DVD is censored, especially those bits with Kathy Bates (I suspect for, erm, nudity).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly funny, thoughtful and compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is widely known across Hollywood as being one of the most charismatic and immediately distinctive actors to cross a movie screen. He is also known for almost never branching out from his usual trend of playing himself (to admittably great effect) on screen - the man may be a fabulous actor, but almost never plays anyone other than Jack. So it is understandably unnerving to see Nicholson appear in a movie which seemed tailor-made for him, but strip himself of all elements noticeably Jack, and instead emerge with a quiet, unassuming and haunting portrayal of a repressed, beaten down old man - in no way loud and flashy, and bereft of a trademarked shark grin. From Nicholson's first scene in the movie until the very last, the moments in which the audience realises they are watching one of the most iconic actors in film history are remarkably near non-existent, so deeply does he inhabit the character of Warren Schmidt. And although it is shocking to see Nicholson disappear so fully behind a character, an incredibly rare appearance, it is unlikely such a spectacle would have come to pass were it not for the genius of writer and director Alexander Payne. Payne crafts a beautifully sparse film, which may seem an odd description, yet few films succeed so noticeably in making much out of nothing. Payne's brilliant screenplay often has long silent interludes, giving headway to the terrific cinematography, and the film's subject matter may seem frustratingly brief, but both traits are absolutely right given the film's tone and especially its lead character. This is a movie about a man who has coasted through life getting surprisingly little out of it, and the film seems to echo this theme of sparse subject matter, but is presented in a delightfully introspective manner (most of Schmidt's inner thought processes are explained through his inappropriately detailed letters to a foster child in Africa, a brilliant touch). Payne deserves accolades galore for putting together such a funny, yet thoughtful and very realistic of an aging man striving to find purpose in life. Suffice to say that Nicholson is without question the highlight of the show, giving one of his strongest performances to date (which is saying a lot); his quiet, withdrawn and emotionally distant Schmidt striving to call a halt to his daughter's upcoming wedding is a sight to see indeed. But Nicholson's wonderful beach of persona is backed up very capably by the film's supporting cast - Kathy Bates gives a powerful performance as the abrasive mother of the groom, though there can be little doubt that the sight of her naked is one few will look forward to. Hope Davis believably portrays Schmidt's distant daughter; though she may come across as irritating, frantic and obnoxious, it only shows how well she captured the essence of her character. Dermot Mulroney also gives a memorable performance as the uncouth groom Schmidt grows so distasteful of. In the end, About Schmidt proves to be a comical, yet quietly thoughtful take on life as seen by an aging man trying to find his place in it. Though the film lags near the middle, and is actually a lot more interesting and engaging before Schmidt begins his cross-country road trip, Nicholson's shockingly different yet touching portrayal of a repressive elderly man is a tour-de-force worthy of every bit of praise it garnered, and enough to carry the film through whatever weaker or slower sections which arise periodically. Alexander Payne should be commended for putting together such an unassuming yet brilliant film. Just don't go in to About Schmidt expecting a straight out comedy, or typical Jack Nicholson performance - the film boasts neither - though it has many funny moments and Nicholson gives one of his strongest performances in decades, About Schmidt is really in a league of its own, and should be enjoyed as such.-8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Platitudes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Schmidt has retired from being an actuary at Woodmen's in Omaha, NE. He is an "ordinary guy". He is a boring, square fellow. After he retires, he looks forward to some leisure time. Then, comes the platitudes (phony remarks from people about his retirement and his contributions). At his retirement party, his colleague talks about what a rich man he is for having a happy family life and for doing something real in life. His replacement is a younger man with a new family. His replacement says to Warren Schmidt, come over and visit. I have some questions that you can help me with. A week later, Mr. Schmidt visits his old office. All he gets from his replacement is phony, insincere platitudes. When Mr. Schmidt offers to go over some complicated actuary calculations, his replacement tells him that "a business degree at Drake should be worth something". So, Mr. Schmidt returns home to his wife. His wife dies a few days later. At the funeral, people offer platitudes. He goes to his daughter's wedding. He hates his future son-in-law, but has to offer platitudes. He can't really tell him how he really feels at the wedding reception. This movie is very deep. Mr. Schmidt finds himself lonely, and nobody needs him anymore. They have their lives that don't involve him. He discovers that he really never loved his deceased wife of 42 years. He feels that his life has been a big waste. His only glimmer of hope is the letters that he has been sending with a check to a boy in Africa (for a charity cause he sees on television). Even this in the end is a disappointment. The movie sounds depressing, but actually it wasn't. It was funny and satiric. Kathy Bates is hilarious as an obnoxious divorcée who tries to land him, but he is repulsed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definition of the Q.P.I.D. (Quirky Prententious Indie Dramedy)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'About Schmidt' is an example of a quintessential type of film which I term the Q.P.I.D. (short for 'Quirky Pretentious Indie Dramedy'). The Q.P.I.D. usually has a sad-sack protagonist who on the surface doesn't like himself. He must undergo a journey of self-discovery before he finds his 'true nature'. We can only understand the self-discovery in terms of the sad-sack protagonist's relationship to the antagonists in the movie?who usually are a class of people who are beneath his station. The 'self-discovery' will always reflect the unconscious double-edged (both pretentious and contemptuous) message of the film's writer/director (in this case, Alexander Payne) which is revealed in the form of 1) an epiphany, where the sad sack has reclaimed a long-lost kindly nature as well as 2) the retention of a feeling of smug superiority.Our sad sack protagonist in question is Warren Schmidt, a Nebraska actuary who has just retired after many years of service for a drab insurance company. From the opening shots, the Midwest itself is depicted as a drab, dull and routine place to live one's life. Schmidt represents the typical Midwesterner who is cut off from his emotions. His wife is not only matronly looking but thoroughly unappealing (the closeup on her armpit and backside as Warren narrates his litany of the things he doesn't like about her sets the tone of contempt the viewer is supposed to feel about the characters Warren is pitted against throughout the film).Soon we're introduced to a whole host of quirky unlikeable losers. There's phony Gary, Warren's replacement at the insurance company, who promised to keep in touch with Warren at his retirement party but is fast to get away from him when Warren shows up at the office looking for company. And what about Ray, Warren's supposed best friend? It turns out that Warren discovers a treasure trove of old letters detailing his affair with Warren's wife many years in the past.The family members are even worse. Randall, the water bed salesman and Warren's son-in-law has no guilt feelings about trying to suck Warren into participating in a pyramid scheme while he's in a period of mourning over the recent death of his wife. And Warren's daughter, Jeannie, has fallen for the seedy Randall and will not listen to her father as he tries to convince her that her fiancé is a low-life. Randall's mother, Roberta, thinks nothing of trying to seduce Warren while they're in a hot tub together. Are there any sympathetic characters in this movie?There's a framing device in 'About Schmidt' where Warren signs up as the sponsor of a young boy from Tanzania through one of those 'adopt-a-foreign-child' agencies. Warren's 'letters' to 'Ndugu', the Tanzanian child (who we never meet) are wholly inappropriate and reflect his inability to connect with other people. Nonetheless, Jack Nicholson's dry narration of his communications with the boy end up being the only truly amusing aspect of the film.Following the sudden death of his wife (perhaps one of the few honest and realistic scenes in the movie), Warren basically starts to decompensate; without his wife, his house becomes a mess and he ends up looking like a homeless bum. Egoless Warren's slide into 'despair' is supposed to be funny?Payne wants us to laugh at him (not with him). Soon Warren narcissisticly decides to drive out to visit his daughter in Denver in his 35 foot Winnebago (motorized trailer) but she rebuffs him.Warren then drives around the Midwest in his journey of self-discovery. Before having his epiphany where he can 'forgive' his wife, Warren makes an ugly pass at a woman inside a trailer in a trailer park. Somehow Warren comes to realize that the pass was 'uncool' and now he sits underneath the stars and realizes that maybe his wife wasn't so bad after all. Warren suddenly has become a bit sensitive?he has feelings of shame! But Warren's transformation rings hollow?the film's scenarist cannot disguise his own feelings of contempt for his characters (the wife was depicted as so unlikeable, how can we have feelings of sympathy for her?).Has Warren really become a kinder and nobler human being at the end or has he simply learned to be more tactful? During the wedding toast, Warren does display a new found set of social skills. He tactfully toasts the bride and groom (as well as the groom's family) without displaying his true feelings (it's obvious that he's still contemptuous of the dysfunctional family as we see him run into the bathroom, almost ready to throw up!).Schmidt reflects Writer/Director Payne's own voice. It's a pretentious voice that seeks undeserved accolades. On the one hand, he wants us to applaud Schmidt's self-discovery?but at the same time Schmidt remains smugly condescending to those all around him. There's one exception however?his bond with the Tanzanian child who he's never met. For the child, Schmidt is able to muster a few tears as well as a smile. The dull insurance actuary wasn't dull (and wasn't such a sad sack) after all. Schmidt (Payne) belongs to a class of the chosen few who are alive?who can feel. The Everyman rises above his conformist milieu?he's got a heart but also prides himself on setting himself above the neurotic losers?the lowlifes who are unable to express emotions.The Q.P.I.D. can never display the honesty of its convictions. The film's scenarist unconsciously creates an entire class of straw men who he easily is able to shoot down. The hero's transformation into a sensitive soul is always unearned and undeserved--at its core, there is only contempt and a smug sense of self-satisfaction!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schmidt Just Doesn't Come Together Well...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the good: The casting, acting, editing, score, photography, and general premise of the story are very good in this film. I actually thought that, overall, it was very well put together.That said, the screenplay and dialogue are disappointing. As mentioned above, the concept is good. However, the pieces just don't fit together in a way to bring the film together. This is not the fault of the actors, but rather the editors, director, and/or writers. There is just a lack of flow that comes through in the film. It feels thin. It is watchable, no doubt, but not the kind of film you feel bad about pausing to go get a snack or answer the phone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson really is a great actor. I believe I have stated that before. His performances in "One flew over the cuckoos nest" and even "Anger Management" have been superb. And he gives another excellent one here that saved the film. He was the only reason I actually watched it. Jack Nicholson here plays "Walter Schmidt" an unhappy, ageing man who has just retired from his job. He is irritated- mostly by his wife, that is- but because he realises he doesn't really have that much to do. So he writes to his pen-pal. Then, "disaster" strikes... And so ensues a long and, quite frankly, "tedious" journey around America in his little Caravan. Along the way he bumps into some fellow campers and has a little chat with his boss... The main problem here was that I didn't laugh enough. I enjoyed the movie, but my enjoyment was weighed down by the fact that this was supposed to be a "hilarious" film. It wasn't; in fact, it tended to be quite dull. It had its points, however; a tear-jerking ending revealed, in the films best scene (whilst writing to his pen-pal) does his life have a meaning? That, along with a great performance from Nicholson, saved the film from being a dull, unfunny "coming-of-age" story. **/ out of ***** (2 and a half out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At sixty five, Nicholson turns in his fourth best performance in his career: A++</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(possible spoilers)Jack Nicholson is truly one of America's best actors from the 20th century, and in the new milennium he was in the quite under-rated The Pledge last year, and now in About Schmidt, and proves that he is still one of the greatest treats to look for in the film system. His work in Alexander Payne's third film and second adaptation is deserved enough for a fourth Oscar, which could make him (rightfully so) the first male to win three best actor Oscar. While I know the Academy Awards in the long run might not account for that much (ie giving best picture in 98 to Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan), it would solidify him as an icon.Nicholson is Schmidt here, and every scene has him included, which is the most crucial part of this first person tale, as we get it all from his perspective; this is an unconventional approach by Payne, as that he could've told the story from the daughter's perspective as a woman forced to cope with the loss of her mother and the pressures of marriage, but instead he goes the best route and tells it completely from Warren Schmidt's perspective. Warren is 66, an Omaha, Nebraska Insurance Salesman retiring at the start of the picture, who can't forsee much of a life ahead, and after the death of his wife, he sees even less- this prompts him to drive his newly purchased winnebago along a few stops to try and figure out what his life has meant before his daughter's marriage. Nicholson is one of those actors who can reveal subtle and not so subtle details about the character right in the eyes, the legendary eyebrows, and face in general, and that alone makes Warren a lonely, sad and searching character, but we also get a greater sense of his inner self as he writes personal letter to a child he is sponsoring in Africa. These scenes when we hear is written narration are the most crucial as they show funnny and sorrowful details that we might not entirely get from Nicholson's complection. This is a strong move from the actor and director/co-writer.Another smart move is making the supporting cast as convincing as the lead, which is comprised mostly of Jeannie (Hope Davis), Warren's daughter, her soon-to-be (Dermot Mulrooney, in full mullet), and his family, which inparticular showcases Kathy Bates as the mother, a true eccentric from the mid-west. We can see, in full humor of course, Warren's added distaste and resentment, and this adds another level to Nicholson's performance. About Schmidt brings Mr. Shark-grin his 4th best performance behind Cuckoo's Nest, Easy Rider, and The Shining, and is a fantastic reminder of the Jack from the early 70's in general, in spirit and self. And when the last scene with the retiree is revealed, it is well earned, because there is never a moment when Nicholson hasn't acted totally honest to the character of Warren, and the goal is achieved. One of the very best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard working Jack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not the best picture of 2002, by any means. In recent movies, Jack Nicholson has been criticized for always playing himself. In "About Schmidt," he plays himself playing an old buster (Warren Schmidt) -- you can actually see Nicholson working at trying to be a character instead of an actor. Schmidt retires from a lackluster mid-management insurance job only to find himself questioning the meaning of his empty life -- a life that quickly becomes emptier with the death of his wife. He embarks on a cross-plains journey to try to talk his daughter out of marrying a loser water-bed salesman, but he has been emotionally out-of-touch with the daughter (and everyone else) for so long that his doubts and concerns are meaningless -- to the daughter, and, ultimately, to the audience. There are some funny bits -- the waterbed scene made me chuckle, and Schmidt's letters to his African foster child Ndugu are fatuously self-absorbed and amusing. But basically the audience is watching an uninteresting retiree who, at the end of the movie, hasn't really grown or even changed a bit. And I'm already mildly offended and greatly bored by toilet scenes in movies, major star or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this really contains spoilers or not, but better to be sure.I can't add much to the excellent comments already written. I fully agree with the writer who said that movies don't HAVE to be happy or positive to be "good." The point of this movie isn't to cheer you up. It's to show you how bleak life really can be, and give you a chance to think about what you can do to prevent yourself from becoming Warren. (Because believe me, you don't want to be Warren.) And in that mission, the movie succeeds brilliantly.I have a question for the viewers who (1) sell insurance as a career, (2) live in Denver, or (3) have semi-dysfunctional families like these: When you watch this movie, do you get that much of it is aimed right at you?? (Or people like you?) And it's not complimentary. If you're an aging hippie who lives in Denver - this portrayal of what you are like is dead-on. The "spiritual" ceremonies and churches with no true religious basis, the overdone drippy wedding singers and never-cut hair, and the 70's-throwback lifestyle... do you get how absurd it really looks to most of the rest of us? Kathy Bates deserved an Oscar for absolutely nailing the role of the middle-aged hemp-weaving left-wing mother who breast-fed her unremarkable son into absolute uselessness.(I loved the "awards" in his childhood / young adult room: "Participant" ribbons; certificate for "attendance" at a trade school. FRAMED!) If you're one of those people who insists that everyone who shows up is a "winner" and that no one should be denied the blue ribbon, do you see how ridiculous it appears to the rest of us? If you're one of those ubiquitous retirees with an RV, did you get it? Weaving aimlessly across the U.S. in 35-foot missiles of death, with failing eyesight and slower reflexes, uncaring how inconvenienced the rest of us on the roads are? Trying to make up for lost time by visiting the giant arch over an interstate? Or the world's biggest ball of string, wherever that is? And what if you actually work as a Woodman? Doesn't this movie make you want to go drive your car off a cliff? Most of us DON'T live up to our own expectations of ourselves, and that's normal. We can't all be Neil Armstrong. (For those of you under 30: Neil was an astronaut.) But there are certainly varying degrees of failure, and it's worth a look at this movie to get a glimpse of the kind of failure you want to avoid. You don't want to be Warren!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this film does a good job of capturing interesting people living their lives, it's entire story/plot leaves me feeling depressed. The movie has no purpose save the implicit message "life sucks and then you die". I enjoy movies that offer insight, wisdom and inspiration for living---this movie is the exact opposite.The humor would be enjoyable if one could somehow tear themselves from the overwhelming gloom of the story. I cannot understand why this movie got such high ratings---do people like seeing others live this way? Is there any virtue in living poorly and never turning one's self around? Is there any virtue in seeing others live this way? Is that an interesting story?</fullReview>

I found Jacks' acting much better than the story line required. I waited quite a while to rent the dvd and I am glad that I didn't have to pay even my senior rate to see it in the local movie. The main problem with the ending was that it wasn't close enough to the beginning. I am sorry Jack.

		<fullReview>After waiting weeks to see this movie and receiving both positive and negative remarks from friends, I was anticipating an entertaining and realistic view of: retirement, family and loss of a spouse. However, what we saw was again 2+ hours of self-indulgence by Jack Nicholson. From the first minutes of total discontent and blaming his wife for apparently all his personal short-comings and unfulfilled dreams, to his 180 degree turn to being so totally overwhelmed by his losses, it only got more boring and distasteful. Do you actually know of anyone who would write such dribble to a 6 yr. old African orphan? or who would whizz all over his own bathroom, even if he didn't mind living like a total slob? Sorry, but think it was total drivel and may have appealed to Jack as just another way to thumb his nose to an easily duped public. Also, based on some of the comments, what made his bod any more attractive than Kathy Bates? Give me a break...nothing attractive about seeing him either in or out of his BVDs!</fullReview>

So I should have liked this film. But I didn't. It sucked big time. This must be one of the slowest, most depressing films I have ever seen. I can't understand why Nicholson would want to put himself on the line like this or for that matter why anyone would bother to film such a weak story. Sure there are some amusing moments and characters that at some stage we can all relate to but it's not really enough. Jack's acting was straight out of the Roger Moore book of eyebrow twitching; not what I expected but I suppose range extending non-the less. Still I'd rather see him lose his temper any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry for the title but it was the only title I could think of without using expletives.Where to start, I think the Genre on IMDB About Schmidt is classed as a Comedy/Drama. The closest Genre classification I would think of would have to be horror as I am still having nightmares brought on by the full frontal short of the character played by Kathy Bates.The film itself took a while to get going and, in my opinion, never really did. It could have been filmed in black and white, not for any other reason apart from the fact that everything about this film was Grey. The characters didn't have any depth and the light brushing over all the issues they had left me feeling empty.I refer to another review which was more in-depth that mine is going to be as I am still trying to make up for the two pointless hours I spent watching this film; "People that cannot tolerate slow-moving films should not see this", I must say I agree.It's a case for Horses for Courses really, some people might really enjoy it, like the Oscar judges (what's that all about?) but I warned my colleagues about the film and one of them unwittingly rented it.

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson reins it in and the results are...boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never been a fan of Alexander Payne's "Election", there was a smugness to its tone that kept me from becoming involved. Now he takes on midwestern quirky middle class America in "About Schmidt" and he really ought to be ashamed of himself. Making fun of people for not being as smart as Alex Payne would be fine if he did it in a remotely interesting or funny way. But he is so condescending to the poor people under his microscope that it's difficult to watch. I have to admit I went out to the bar (at the Arclight Cinema in Hollywood) and SLOOOOWLY nursed a Manhatten, hoping that at least Kathy Bates would be on the screen by the time I came back. Alas no, Winnebago meandering, more unbearable Nicholson playing "small".From the very first moments of the movie, Payne lets us know we're in "fantasyland" some strange fake netherworld where a man on the last day of work would actually sit in his office, alone, and watch the clock tick down the last moments. I couldn't come up with any context in the actual world where this would happen unless Schmidt were mentally challenged. Also, to show us the second hand crawling slowly around the clock, not only was dull (gee, I wonder if I can guess what's gonna happen next, wow, the minute hand is going by the nine, will it hit the ten? It did! What's next, the ELEVEN? Oh my God!)it set up a tone of predictability that lasted throughout the movie. Just like I knew automatically that the second hand would eventually reach the twelve, I knew automatically every dreary condescending moment afterwards.Kathy Bates briefly brought some life into the movie. And the design of her house (the art, the color scheme, the candles around the hot tub) showed some detail and gave the impression a real person lived there. But her "character" (I use the term loosely), like all the others in this movie, wasn't given any dignity and eventually she was shown to be a loud, vulgar rube who showed up at the wedding if her son in some ridiculous Minnie Pearl outfit instead of something more realistic.The real trouble with the film lies with Nicholson who just isn't very good. This year we've had Adam Sandler being praised just because he wasn't playing over the top. Is whispering really acting? Besides, Nicholson manages to make underplaying a mannered unwatchable affair. This one goes right to the top of my years worst list. It'll probably win the Oscar. It seems that every year there's a movie so awfully, so painfully obvious and fraudulent that it automatically wins best picture. Last year it was "A Beautiful Mind" and the year before it was "American Beauty". Oh well. Just because a million people like something doesn't make it good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is labelled as part comedy, part drama--with the movie mostly falling under the latter. Sure there are sporadic humorous moments and some dark jokes, but the movie is more of an examination into the wasted life of a retiree. Luckily, the movie does everything perfectly. Everything I love about the movies is here and done just right. But it is the fact that the movie hits me at a gut level that I love this so much.In one of his ten (maybe even five) best roles ever, the legendary Jack Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt who just retired from a boring insurance company in Omaha, Nebraska. His position was never very high, which made his life even more boring. Then one day, just because he was bored, he decided to sponsor a child in a third-world country. To make matters worse, he learns about his daughter's marriage to a guy he hates and his wife unexpectedly dies. So he decides to get out and do something with his life, starting off with stopping the wedding. You guessed it, it is about the adventure, not the outcome.When the movie starts, the weather is darkly overcast, Warren's office looks blank, and he is just staring at the clock. The weather and landscape play a huge role in this as it is pretty much a character. Inside his house is almost as colourless as his office, minus some of his wife's things. When we first see their rv, the sun is shining. The rest of the time in Omaha is dark and colourless. When Warren takes the rv on a road trip, the sun is always shining and we get to see nice land in the country. Another thing I liked was the use of angles and distance. Obliques angles are used for very serious situations and whatnot. This movie may be subtle in this department, but they are more noticeable here than usual, so I give them props.But, of course, the characters and acting are what make this the great movie it is. Warren meets a wide array of quirky characters all played well and tied brilliantly with the story. And since this is a character study about Warren Schmidt, we get to learn so much about how most people's lives may end up in the future. Warren is returned and has done absolutely nothing to show for. I don't want to give anything away, but Warren does find something that will make you melt inside.The movie is sad, funny, depressing, thoughtful, provocative, exciting, and relaxing, all placed perfectly in a truly wonderful film that touches the heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of journeys and acceptance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those kinda movies where the helmer makes each and every one of us identify with the plight of the protagonist (in spite of his, you know, Nicholson-level quirks), but the ones surrounding that person end up doing every possible stupid act to aggravate the protagonist (and us in the bargain: case in point, Hope Davis' choice/s), putting us more firmly in that corner. In the hands of a lesser helmer, this could've turned out to be a hell of a frustrating experience, but we're in Alexander Payne's hands and he's given us Sideways, The descendants, Nebraska (which also has June Squibb). His genre is the road-trip low-key drama, and I, for one, don't mind if he keeps making movies in the same genre all through - he completely owns it now, esp. after his latest entry in the same - Nebraska (the setting for this particular endeavor as well). Bear in mind that this came before all of his filmography, esp. the one the put him on the map - Sideways.The cliché-ed use of a specific kind of narrative device, to let us know what our protagonist actually thinks, is unnecessary here, since the helmer ensures that all of us are on the same page about what's right and what's not, but the payoff it gives at the end makes sense for it to be used as it is.The pitch-perfect notes by Rolfe Kent (and what a filmography he has, in terms of scoring) had some very familiar strains (piano pieces by Erik Satie, rendered by Aldo Ciccolini here) that I have definitely heard in another movie (that came much later, and was scored excellently by Andrea Guerra, 'The pursuit of Happiness'). Both these movies would make a good double-bill, and the main themes would be the common bond, along with the journey made by the main protagonists.All in all, a worthwhile entry in Jack Nicholson's filmography, and one worth revisiting every few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant film about the definition of success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt follows Warren R. Schmidt (Jack Nicholson), a veteran actuary of the Woodmen of the World insurance company in Omaha, Nebraska. Schmidt is a polite, measured man surrounded by people who are commonly quite the opposite.There are flashes of his broad, mischievous smile and roguish charm, but Nicholson reels in his iconic charisma, he effortlessly becomes the respectable, disconcerted Middle American and is as magnetic and watchable as usual.The film begins in a desolate office as Schmidt stares at a clock that adorns a bare, grey wall as the final minute of his interminable career ticks by. He then enters something of a catatonic state, his blank expression displaying ambiguous yet decidedly dissatisfied emotions. He attends his retirement dinner, witnessing overlong, self-indulgent speeches from colleagues both old and new. He also drops by his old office to speak with his replacement who was so very charming at the dinner yet so indifferent afterwards. Throughout these scenes Schmidt retains his composure, reserving any judgement on his rapidly changing life.As he sits at home unsure what to do with himself, he watches an advert appealing for the viewer to sponsor an African child. He does so, and is soon funding and corresponding with a 6-year-old Tanzanian boy named Ndugu; it is his first letter to Ndugu that provides the first big laugh in the film. As he puts pen to paper, Schmidt boils over and rants about his cocky upstart of a replacement, his daughter's fiancée, his failure to achieve 'semi- importance', his wife's annoying habits and his somewhat emasculating subservience to her.Soon after this letter, his wife passes away. Schmidt then begins to reflect on every aspect of his life, even wondering if his wife was the soul mate she was supposed to be.The film is about the nature of success. Schmidt's definition of success is leaving an impression during one's existence, making a difference. He doesn't aspire to be Henry Ford or Walt Disney, he draws the line far below that level of success, however he wants to be 'semi-important' at least.What exactly does Schmidt mean by 'semi-important'? By striving for something that he hasn't precisely defined he has set himself up for disappointment. The only way in which most people make a profound difference is by continuing their lineage, creating new people and a myriad of new experiences - I think that is entirely honourable. The main objective isn't to shake the system up but to enjoy yourself. Personally, I think Schmidt has been a success; his hard graft will provide for generations to come, as long as his self-absorbed, high maintenance daughter isn't foolish. His life's greatest flaw was his wife, he had no connection with her, they were on very different wavelengths. He could have divorced her, but that would have most likely had negative effects on his daughter; he arguably did the righteous, selfless thing by sticking with her.Some feel the ending is bathetic, which is understandable. I thought Schmidt was being too hard on himself, but it seems he filled a very personal void in the film's final moments, so that has to be a good thing.I have written about these characters as if I know them, which is testament to the existential resonance of About Schmidt. 77%</fullReview>

The story of this film more than makes up for it. The film is quite sad, and you can't help but feel sorry for the grumpy old man Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson).Jack Nicholson was perfect for this role. After being so used to him playing the villain, I was always expecting him to suddenly snap and get scary.Kathy Bates also provides a fantastic performance as the wacky and strange mother of the groom (I could've done without her nude scene though).This film is completely not what I was expecting, but perhaps what it was is better.

		<fullReview>Following my latest addiction to watching Jack Nicholson's filmography, I decided to watch "About Schimdt", (in my country it's translated as "Schimdt's Confessions", i guess that says a lot about the movie). The movie is officially classified as a hybrid between comedy and drama, and I believe it's well placed in those genres. The tone of the movie is mostly dramatic, but not heavy, the soundtrack is great (especially the protagonist's main "theme"), but it has its humorous moments, also. The plot summary is very interesting: Warren Schmidt is a recently retired man, well in his sixties. We start the story just as he is being discharged from the company in which he's worked all of his life, and he's rather shocked and disappointed at how disposable his fellow co-workers assume him to be. He's also married (not so happily), and has been, to the same woman, for 42 years. They have a daughter who lives in other state and seems to be always trying to get rid of them. There's an ongoing myth that, for people who retire, life is only just starting, because now they're finally able to seize all of the fruitful and tiresome decades of hard work. This myth is highly supported by industries who profit over these people's money, because, as they're no longer contributors nor productive, they have to be useful somehow! "About Schmidt" comes to question that whole idea revolving the third age and happiness, fulfillment, looking back at the past, and what you're supposed to do with it...especially when what you look at is not quite a pretty picture. And what we come to look at is a great work of reflection on all of those questions, something we don't see in movies so often. I'm one biased to say so, but Jack Nicholson is beyond greatness in this role, as usual. Schmidt goes in, what we could call, a revolutionary journey (both externally and internally), in order to come to terms with his life, or whatever that might be. The feeling of emptiness is highlighted throughout the film, but to me, some of the best moments of it involve the relationship Schmidt creates with the most unlikely person we could've ever thought of. Following an impulse to be altruistic, he adopts a boy in Africa, to whom he constantly donates money, and afterwards, starts sending letters (only because it was demanded of him). In my opinion, through that supposedly distant and unusual relationship, he was able to elaborate some of his anxieties. The very last scene left me speechless, as Schmidt was emotionally moved by the first letter and drawing he received from his "adopted" friend. It seems that, for the first time in a long time, he realizes that he does have a place in the world (even though it is so small) , despite what everyone else keeps telling him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great and touching work about life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is without a doubt one of the best films that came out in 2002, mostly because it does something that few films can, I mean, some even try, but few really reach the supreme objective of filmmaking, that is to make the viewer enter totally in the story. Alexander Payne really does a great job here. The film may look without any appeal at first sight, probably because it's about the life of an old man dealing with the true( and what I mean by true is really the truth)situations that inevitably happens in the life of the "old people" in general, or at least, I hope that the majority of "old people" pass through some of these. It shows the life how it is. Isn't that wonderful? Well, at least I thought so. I just found so beautiful the approach this film had with the main character, and how perfectly made is the development. The first thing that came to mind when it ended was to watch it again. Obviously, by my rating, I don't consider it to be a perfect film, it has his flaws, and I thought that it was very forced at times, an example would be the last scene, that in my opinion, was just forcing an overly emotional situation that really wasn't happening, and it didn't work, at least not for me. Now, talking about the other aspects, I thought that the cinematography, the sound and the direction weren't at all great, but the story and the acting by Jack really worked well. It's in fact, one of his greatest performances so far. I did think that he was more convincing here than in his highly acclaimed work One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a film that I personally loved, but in my opinion, his acting was very good on there, but not to the point of being considered his best, despite being his award-winner performance. Well, I think I am changing a bit the subject already, so that means that there is not that much to talk about anyways, not about this film. The only thing that is left to say is: Watch that film, because it's great. Its funny when it's needed to be funny, the acting is great, it enter in details about the character and you really gets involved with him through the story, and it's also a touching film when it needs to. Forced at times, but it not ruins the overall viewing experience, by any means. So, watch it. 8.4/10</fullReview>

It drags on, a lot of scenes are not that interesting, the culminating point being the marriage and the stay at the in-laws for whom you just don't care for whatsoever.The director/writer had something interesting in his hands but he didn't go to the bottom of things and didn't fully exploit the themes he chose to address.

The movie touches on the themes of loneliness and disgust. How even after 42 big years of marriage one can be unsatisfied, and goes to correct it when its too late.For all the Nicholson fans its a must watch.. He is adorable as always.Another minor theme touched here is about the relationship with your daughter and how important is it to get respect from her and to be there with her from day 1, and not when you are all alone and need a companion.Other than this , one big theme touched is how a person gets connected by someone with whom he can talk his heart out, no matter how dis related this other person is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a true gem of a movie warranting repeated viewings (though even once is a nice reward).Nicholson gives a truly "grown up" performance, and one of his best performances of any year. His Schmidt is a character instantly recognizable ? a weary Everyman who ponders unknowingly and unpretentiously about life's greater meaning and its relevance to who we are. His searches lead him to tackle things each to "give" meaning to what he feels is his uselessness to the world at large. I believe this is something each of us (or most of us, hopefully) can identify with: the starving orphan "over there" who reaches out to us from the T.V. via the has-beens of Hollywood; a road trip of epic proportions, etc.Schmidt's "Pain and Prejudice" becomes our own and the entire film is an exultant deceptively reluctant paean to life itself. Alternately hilarious and heartbreaking About Schmidt is one of the most beautiful films I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" is a very good but also frustrating film. While I score it an 8, this is mostly for Jack Nicholson's acting--as for the plot, it left me feeling a tad unsatisfied. I understand that, in many ways, this was the point of the film--a vague sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction that hit a man soon after his retirement. I also know that existential crises are hard sells for a movie--most folks just want to be happy and entertained--not think about death and the meaning of life. Plus, the very slow and somber style will no doubt make this a hard sell to many folks.Jack Nicholson plays Schmidt--a man as much unlike Nicholson's other characters as you can get. In fact, because of his usual brash and odd persona, seeing him play normal was tough--as I kept expecting him to snap and become a cauldron of pent up emotion. However, Warren Schmidt was a very nice guy--one who NEVER allows his darker side to come forth. And, if you are waiting and waiting for this to happen, you will be disappointed. This Nicholson role is much more like Mr. Rogers than the guy he played in "Five Easy Pieces"! The film begins with Schmidt retiring from a modestly successful career in the insurance business. Now that he's home with his wife, he is feeling a vague sense of loss and confusion. Who is he? What does he see in his wife? What about his daughter and his relationship to her? All these confused feelings come out using the plot device of a boy in Africa that he is sponsoring. You see, the sponsors are told they can write letters to these children--and Schmidt finds himself pouring out EVERYTHING to this 6 year-old stranger! It's a strange but very effective plot point. Soon after he begins writing these letters, the unthinkable happens--his wife unexpectedly dies--sending him on an even more deep crisis of who he is and the meaning of life. And, to get answers, he embarks on a strange and SLOW journey across the country to see his daughter for her wedding.None of the stuff that happens in this film is earth-shattering or amazing. But, it is like real life--with, for once, Nicholson being married to a woman his age who is NOT a model but a real person. And, like real people, the Schmidt character doesn't have all the answers or any great wisdom. Along the way, the film is occasionally funny but mostly sad. Be sure to have LOTS of Kleenex nearby--you'll need it. But I do recommend you see it simply to marvel at the acting of Nicholson, as he shows a greater range and depth than you'd ever expect. Seeing him cry and emote was refreshing. However, DON'T watch this film if you are struggling with depression! It might just push you over the edge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting study of the human personality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never cared for Jack Nicholson as an actor. Maybe it is because so many of the roles he plays are so similar. "About Schmidt" is a welcome departure from the roles Nicholson has been typecast. The title character lacks a lot of social graces and isn't the type of person I would want to get to know as a friend. This makes the movie all the more real. Not every "hero" of every film is the ideal specimen. Mr. Schmidt faces three major life-changing crisis all within a short period of time. In fact, most of the characters in this movie are dysfunctional. I would classify this movie as a "black comedy". It's not a "laugh-out-loud" kind of film. But, "About Schmidt" is interesting from the opening right up to the final scene. I didn't give it a ten. I save that rating for instant classics, like "On Golden Pond", "A Christmas Story", "Psycho", "Gone With the Wind", etc. Movies that can stand up to repeated viewings, and then again some. But, "Schmidt" is interesting, funny in its own way, and it will make you think and reflect. It's definitely not "family viewing", but a quality, mature movie for adults to view and savor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant yet misogynistic overtones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson's character resembles both a child and someone almost dead inside an aging body. However, as a woman, it was noticeable to me and offensive that all the women were harsh toward the men. Even the daughter looked at her father as a money source even though he was trying very hard to connect. Also, there seemed no point in Kathy Bates (54 years old at the time and not exactly a beauty queen in her heyday) getting fully naked other then (according to the reviews here and Jack Nicholson's character's reaction) to add a crude laugh factor. Still, it's a poignant film that shines light on meaninglessness and wastefulness of people's lives. I don't know how anyone can resist shedding a tear or getting a quivering lip at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thought- and emotion-provoking film. The ending is more like a revelation to Schmidt, of not just the difference he made to someone but also, more emotively, of the fact that someone somewhere loved him, and valued him after all. Valued him enough to draw a picture featuring him.I thought the funniest moment in the film was when he was so easily moved by that stranger woman's psycho-analysis of him (Schmidt) that he buried his face in her neck and soon was trying to kiss her! In my view, vying for the "most powerful moment" are (i) that scene when he calls Jeannie from a public phone on his way to her house and she tells him quite matter-of-factly to turn back. Whew! (ii) that family dinner at the Randalls when he sees the chaos in the other family and in his mind was probably weighing it against the emptiness in his own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" (2002) This is one of the greatest movies I saw in my life. It talks about the vanity of life, but it gives us insight that we can find the meaning in the small things. Ndugu's drawing and the friendship of the six-year-old Tanzanian kid helps Warren Schmidt find the meaning of life. The final scene reminds me both of Ecclesiastes 4:9 ("two are better off than one") and Jesus' parables of the mustard seed. Maybe the things that we think they are important are vain/meaningless, but God may ask us to open our eyes wide and see the small things.I became a fan of Payne. After I watched About Schmidt and Election, I thought that he knows what life is like.</fullReview>

From that point on, every frame of this self-indulgent flick is less than entertaining, all those close-ups and winkings and blinkings. And the formulaic approach to a script, forget "plot," is as endearing as one more exercise in Gollywood gleanings of box office unworthiness. Sorry, folks, I prefer the Nicholson of Heeerrreee's, Johnny. and earlier essays than this auperannuated expression of senior angst. Well, he WAS better than usual as "Eugene O'Neill" in "Reds."

		<fullReview>About Schmidt is the bleak account of the unhappy life of an ordinary citizen. This doesn't sound great, does it? But I loved every bit of it. I loved the acting (Nicholson in the performance of his life), the bitter humor, the dialog. But what I loved most was the mastery, with which it exposes the emptiness of a life ruled solely by convention, stripping it of all pretenses and excuses. What is left is the naked ruin of a meaningless life. If you just want to relax and be entertained, then this is not the film for you. You may be forced to ask yourself if your life is leading in the right direction. This is one of the very few movies that have the potential to make you change your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"About Schmidt" Skewers Modern American Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched this movie about four times, I've been loathe to comment on it because my assessment keeps changing, but having read some of the other remarks (most of which are off the mark, in my view), I decided to say a few words about it. The first time I saw "About Schmidt," I thought, what the hell does Jack Nicholson know about a man like this? Can you see him with a woman like Helen? Absolutely not. Schmidt is the antithesis of Nicholson, which is why his performance is so good. He plays a guy who has sublimated all his natural drives and feelings to fit in with all the Northern European conformists in the conservative bastion of Omaha, Nebraska. If you've never lived in the Midwest, let alone in Nebraska, you might not fully appreciate the setting. The first shot in the movie shows blandoid Omaha the way it really is. Creativity does not go over big there, except on Christmas, when the lighting displays all over town are very impressive. Otherwise, it's strictly dullsville. In the late nineties, when we were there, there seemed to be an inordinate number of gays, police chases, and gang shootings for such a thoroughly boring city, where they have all these big box stores that sell exactly the same merchandise from store to store. The countryside is not pretty; the nicest country in the area is right where the city is built, so all of it is going to be developed. I could go on and on about Omaha, which experiences about two weeks out of the year where it isn't either extremely cold or extremely hot, but I think you get the picture. It's saving grace is that there is an interesting diversity of birds, insects, and amphibians in the region. Too bad the human beings all look exactly the same.So Schmidt is this conformist monkey who just retired from an insurance company. Don't get me started on the insurance industry, that bunch of megalomaniacs who are well on their way to bleeding the entire country dry "just to be safe." He is completely pussy-whipped, doing almost everything his wife decrees, even sitting down to pee so he won't splatter on the rim just because she insists upon it. It's pathetic. When she suddenly drops dead, he is at loose ends and doesn't even know how to feed himself, let alone how to keep their big house clean. It's more than mere depression, one suspects. He actually IS helpless without her telling him what to do. The one ray of hope in his life is his snap decision to sponsor a poor child in Africa, the correspondence between himself and the child (through his actual caretakers in Africa) being the single vein of truth in all the phoniness of his life. His daughter, about to marry a complete jerk out in Denver, has a few things to say to pop when he attempts to stop her from "making a terrible mistake." She's as willful as her mother and a very interesting character when she gets her dander up. I especially liked the part after the funeral where she objects to the fact that her father had bought her mother "the cheapest casket" he could find.The movie takes us to Denver for the wedding and we meet Schmidt's in-laws, a quirky bunch, to be sure. They are led by Kathy Bates, another "strong woman" right out of "Misery" who has all but castrated her well-meaning ex-husband, whom she continues to bully even though he has remarried a pleasant oriental woman. These characterizations ought to make an impression on all the "post-feminist," hardboiled American women out there, most of whom think they know what's best and that their spineless, stupid spouses are only fit for taking orders, but you know it will take much more than a good movie to make that one sink in. In the end, Schmidt realizes what a fool he's been, even though there's nothing he can do about it. As the movie wraps, the caretaker of his foster child expresses sincere appreciation for what he is doing for the boy and the child sends him a picture he's drawn that shows them smiling and holding hands. Schmidt breaks down in tears. Finally, someone seems to appreciate him, even if it is a child he has never met. We wonder what will happen next in Schmidt's dreary life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius. Funny and sad at once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt takes on a rather daunting subject. As we near the end of our lives, and reflect on all that has happened, what was the point? Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances as Warren R. Schmidt. An average man, from an average mid-western town, who's just retired. He's faced with a lot of questions about his life. After spending his entire career working a dull, office job it seems his work was largely unimportant and unappreciated. The opening scene of Schmidt watching the clock slowly tick toward quitting time on his last day is one of the most clever in movie history.The sudden death of his wife increases his doubts. Did he really love her? Or did he simply spend his life with her because she was always there? Always ready to cook him a meal, clean his clothes, etc... His reaction to his wife's death is strangely stoic.He also has to deal with his daughter, who's decided to marry a loser. Her prospective husband seems harmless enough, but he's also an unmotivated buffoon. Schmidt feels this guy is not good enough for his daughter. He sees his daughter has having more opportunities, more chances to still make a difference with her life. In a way, he wants her to avoid the mistakes he feels he's made. While he formulates many elaborate plans to stop the wedding, he's honestly not the kind of guy to do anything dramatic. That's the nature of Schmidt. He's a man who's played it safe and kept to the status-quo his entire life.The movie is all about Schmidt reaching a catharsis. He has to accept that this is his life and move forward. In order to do this, he has to find some sort of meaning, some sort of philosophical way to deal with his feelings of wasted time. He has to learn to find joy in simple things and be a little more spontaneous. About Schmidt is a wonderful, intensely personal character study; the understated humor is unforgettable. The pacing is slow and methodical, just like Schmidt himself. Some might see the film as dull, but for the viewer with an eye for subtlety, it's pure genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About life, loneliness and an awesome Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson (Easy Rider) stars in an Oscar nominated role as Warren R. Schmidt, a man who feels alone as he retires. His wife controls his life and his daughter is getting married to a man he hates.Nicholson has delivered numerous roles which have landed him with an Oscar nomination, and this nomination was extremely deserved with a beautiful portrayal of a man who has come to the end of his job and is in a state of loneliness and the way Nicholson portrays this concept is far from his usual evil and enthusiastic performances in The Shining and Chinatown. We are seeing a different side of the 3 time Oscar winner in Alexander Payne's comedy drama and you wouldn't even believe it was Nicholson come the end of the film, and in a personal opinion, I find this to be my favourite performance by the talented actor.His performance leads the way in a sentimental journey about loneliness and self discovery. And the writing by Payne is great to convey the sense of loneliness, especially through the use of Ndugu, a child in the Childcare programme who Schmidt talks to through writing letters and donating money to, and the final scene of the film had me in tears, and not many modern films do that to me.Extremely well directed with some great short scenes portraying realism and drama convey the genre. I didn't find it particularly hilarious, more putting a smile on your face and chuckle-some, especially the water-bed scene.Nicholson gets great support from the brilliant Kathy Bates (Misery) who is very funny in her role as the quirky Roberta.Though it took a while to get into, I couldn't fault the drama on anything else, with sensational performances, writing, direction and scenery all executed brilliantly by everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Simple and the Profound,as it occurs to Warren Schmidt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been re-watching this movie. I caught this in the theater when it came out about five-and-a-half years ago and loved it,so I decided to buy this when the Hollywood Video had it in their "Clearance bin" of VHS tapes. I wanted to get another look,just to see if my initial reaction could match how I see it now. I think it did.Actually,it may've matched and,in some ways,exceeded it. After seeing it five years ago,I had to be reminded or remind myself that Jack Nicholson's long career of mostly playing mercurial bad-asses(and sometimes just plain evil mofos!)was reason enough to find his portrayal of a sixty-something retiree who is basically a simple,practical and kind man who has to "re-learn" life after his wife dies and as his daughter prepares to marry a doofy,sub-average mattress salesman. He decides to take a leisurely ride through Nebraska(his home),KAnsas and Colorado,making revelations both modest and profound along the way.Nicholson adds this very fine performance to his gallery of unique,well-crafted roles,and gets plenty of good support from Hope DAvis(as his semi-estranged daughter),Dermont Mulroney(I got newfound respect for him as the ponytail/mullet wearing fiancé),Howard Hessman(as the whipped ex-husband of the mother of the groom)and KAthy BAtes(as said mother,a jovial but crass and uncomfortably close woman who isn't afraid to "share" with Warren). I saw this film as much for director Alexander Payne as for Nicholson,as he had shown in previous work("Citizen Ruth"."Election")and in ensuing("Sideways") that he is 1)a very keen observer of human behavior as funny,sad and everything in-between and 2)he is based in my part of the country,and even though he does a fair amount of work in LA and NY,he still bases himself and films up in Nebraska(as he did with much of this film). The people that are shown in this film look,sound and act much like the people I see around Kansas,Iowa,Missouri as well,and it feels like sort of homey,real comfort.For once,a major film that was made somewhere that I COULD have a real tactile connection or understanding,rather than a strictly screen understanding.Re-evaluation of his values,feelings and self(As portrayed through a plot device,cleverly deigned,of Schmidt's writing letters to his adopted "Save the Children"-style foster child)is difficult,painful,embarrassing and frustrating for anybody,particularly somebody so set in his ways as Nicholson's Schmidt,but the journey is not without reward. The beauty of this film is the quiet realization of that,as well as just simply appreciating a movie that is clearly a unique creature unto itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About empathy, and it's absence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's films take sideways glances at life; this one is appositely named, for Jack Nicholson (cast against type as an emotionally repressed individual) plays Warren Schmidt, a recently retired insurance executive whose failing is, quite simply, that everything in his life is about himself. He has no capacity for empathy: caught up in his own sense of personal grievance, he's utterly unable to open his heart; when caught out by this inability, this only increases his sense of justified self-pity. Nicholson plays Schmidt physically as a upright man (his stiff neck in fact becoming part of the plot), but I found it hard to relate to the story: it's not quite satirical, Schmidt is hardly sympathetic but then neither are the others in the movie; this might not matter if it was subtler, but it's not. I think Payne's best movie to date remains his first, 'Election'; his others have been less spiky, but perhaps no deeper. Whch is not to say that there aren't things in 'About Schmidt' to make you laugh or wince: I enjoyed it, but I also felt like I was waiting for that extra kick that never came.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thinking Persons Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film focuses on a man in his 60's who upon his retirement realises how empty and meaningless his life has become. His wife irritates him, he never sees his daughter and his company have replaced him with a 20 something whizz kid. He sees an advert on the Television and decides to sponsor a young African boy called Ndugu. As well as sending cheques to the boy he also sends him letters telling him all about his life and his failed hopes and dreams.Jack Nicholson reminds us in this film of why he has been one of the top actors in Hollywood for so many years.His portrayal of Warren Schmidt, a man facing his own mortality, is extremely realistic and we can all relate to his fear that he has failed to achieve anything in life. Kathy Bates is a great comedic actress and her portrayal of Roberta Hertzel, the mother of Schmidt's future son in law, lightens the mood in some of the films darker moments.Good supporting cast in Hope Davis and Dermot Mulroney as Schmidt's daughter and future son in law.The ending is a little anti-climatic but very poignant as Schmidt realises that maybe he has made a difference to at least one persons life. This is a funny film but it is much deeper than the average romantic comedy that comes out of Hollywood these days. This will make you laugh but it should also strike a more serious chord with most people who will at some point in their lives be able to relate to Schmidt's worries that he has not achieved anything or made any difference to the world.</fullReview>

The self-realization in the coda is worthy of mention. Especially when one feels like watching a slow, thought provoking movie. Somehow, I found myself reminded of David Cronenberg's The Straight Story. Possibly because of a similar slow-paced and introspective approach of the characters. I'd definitely recommend this for all ages. Frankly the line limit is pointless. Agreed, the content should be monitored.

It's a story of discovery and they state of a man's mind when in retirement - like a child almost!

		<shortDescription>Payne's circle of life trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I view Payne's pictures, the more I see them as a kind of Requiem, or Elegy, for humanity in the setting of Nebraska and the young and old who populate Omaha.Payne's first 3 films are perhaps valentines to his birthplace. I went back to review Citizen Ruth and About Schmitt, and found myself amazed in the subtle execution of loss and despair in the stories and characters. Alexander Payne has a good thing going in his work.In Citizen Ruth, Election and About Schmidt we perhaps have a trilogy that arcs through the life cycle of a human being..Citizen Ruth...conception, birth and childhood.Ruth seems to embody all three...physically and emotionally (pregnant, but child-like in mind and action). The subtle sub-plots involving the child of "Life Savers" Norm and Gail Stoney (played by Sebastian Anzaldo III) is possibly the saddest depiction of a loss of innocence I have ever seen in a film, worthy of Stanley Kubrick (who filmed a similar theme in the first half of Full Metal Jacket). When Ruth hits the child, suddenly the wind is also knocked out of the film. The illusion of "choice" in the conception and birth process of mortal existence is all over this film.Election...youth and the middle aged...The youth struggle to grow up and the middle aged reach for a happiness lost in youth. I think Reese Witherspoon's character, Tracy Flick, goes through a steep learning curve, a process of change and understanding that benefits her and helps her come to terms with her loneliness, however damaged she may still be. She actually comes out better than the other characters IMO. Mr. McCallister, in contrast, spirals out of control...his inner creepy crawlies, hidden in the dark corners of a classroom for years, are suddenly brought out by the searing light of Tracy Flick.About Schmidt...old age and death.Regrets and redemption by proxy (the best gifts can be given and received in ways that we can never imagine...without us even knowing about it). Death is seen quite early in the film...and the bell tolls for Warren's life(as the clock strikes 5pm to announce Warren's retirement). While Warren is going through crisis and he desperately tries to "make a difference" by saving his daughter from marrying a loser, a 6 year old child in Africa is deeply affected by Warren's $22 a month donation. Warren is redeemed? I think Warren is redeemed after his Wedding reception speech earlier...it is also his burial...his last will and testament. The 6 year child's drawing is a sign that the "circle of life" will begin again...brand spanking' new.These films are so amazing I feel as if I'm participating in each. Great cinema.</fullReview>

I've just been flicking through all the votes/reviews I've done and noticed I haven't done anything for this... and I've done it for films WELL worse! - hahaha.I really enjoyed this film and it has made me think about my retirement probably more than any other film I've seen! Nicholson's character finally retires from his job and finds himself at a loss for things to do. One thing leads to another and he ends up doing a sort of road-trip across America to attend his daughter's wedding. He is not entirely overjoyed with his daughters choice of partner... but he comes to realize that there's more to life than meets the eye.A great film well-worth watching...7/10 Dave</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what the hell is 'lit some matches' about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Warren visits the motor-home of the lovely couple in the caravan park thing, the guy takes his jacket and puts it in a cupboard. Warren says 'oh, is something burning?' and the guy says 'No, I just lit some matches'. What does this mean? Is it some kind of American dialogue a Brit like me wouldn't understand? Did he actually light some matches and I just missed it? I'm surprised no-one else has asked this question actually. I'm completely lost. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Jack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would have Warren Schmidt felt that his life made a difference had he been married to another woman or chosen another career, starting his own business, for instance? Or if his daughter had decided to marry another man, not that cheerful buffoon? Or no matter what, 66 is a sad age when one realizes that there is no way to turn the time back and change your past? Or you can try hard to prevent your children from taking the wrong choices because you can see so clearly and you love them and wish them all the best ? but they will make their own mistakes, they will not learn from yours? These questions kept coming to my mind when I saw the film and Jack Nicholson's performance. The actor who is as far from his character's quiet desperation, hidden anger, sadness and confusion as it goes, was able to capture all these characteristics flawlessly. As much as I tried I could not see in the lonely ordinary man on the screen, the Jack of "Witches of Eastwick" or Jack who was dating Laura Flynn Boyle at the time. I saw the man who has realized that his life was almost over, that it was empty and lonely, and that not much of it left at all...9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad but true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised at the number of reviewers who hated "About Schmidt". I thought that "About Schmidt" was a great movie because it told a very believable story of a retired man who has to face some unpleasant truths as he gets older. He pays a price for not preparing.Warren Schmidt portrays a familiar story. He had a middle class white-collar job that provided enough money for a nice house and a big RV (although half was paid by his wife as his uptight daughter reminds him).His over dependence on his wife, his polite non-welcome back at his old job, his strained relationship with his only child: these are very real possibilities for us in modern life.Many reviewers really disliked the prospective son-in-law and his family. But guess what. When your kids marry, they usually don't give you a veto. At least the son-in-law is genuinely friendly to Schmidt and he and the daughter seem to love each other. Kathy Bates and her tribe are louder, poorer, more touchy-feely than Schmidt. But they also are genuinely friendly to Schmidt when he does show up, after being blown off by his daughter when he wants to arrive in Denver early to help plan the wedding. Howard Hessman did a great job as the father of the groom. So many issues between him and Kathy Bates. Sound familiar?Kathy Bates naked is a very typical depiction of the 50 something American woman. The truth hurts here. Jack Nicholson is a little paunchy himself in this film. We may be overweight but we are still here and guess what, we have sexual feelings even as we age.I really did like this movie because it made me think. I will be 65 in ten years. My 15 year old daughter will be about the right age to marry by then. Will she pick a long haired, friendly but underachieving guy? Parents can see problems down the road that their kids can't with choices in careers, marriages, spending etc. But children still make their own way as this movie reminds us.The glimpses of the daughter growing up (bath time, violin recital, horseback lessons) are extremely familiar to me. The fact that once she is grown up, there is a wide gulf between them, is a cautionary tale for all of us. The message of this movie to me is "make an effort now". Make plans before you are 65 so that you have something to do (paid or unpaid) after you retire. You need to stay close to kids and friends. Apparently Schmidt only had one friend in Omaha, the man who had an old affair with Mrs Schmidt. His mistake.Stay in touch with people or you will end up as Warren Schmidt, pouring out his heart in letters to someone who can't read them. That is a very powerful message. I liked this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and analytical film if somewhat slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being labelled a comedy by many, "About Schmidt" is not a comedy. It is a tragic chronicle of the old age, a sharp desolate reflection of a society that abandons the elderly when they can no longer serve our society. It is about loneliness,unemployment and unlawfulness all told with in the tone of a tragicomedy and a brilliant Jack Nicholson performance. That some moments in the story are awfully slow certainly hurts the film.After many good years of service, Warren Schmidt retires. Retiring brings to mind some very attractive ideas but what Schmidt does not know is that he will become discarded by society, be regarded next to useless. Retirement will mean the beginning of another routine, one that has been advertised as the happiest of our existence: the one of a dedicated man resting after a life of service.The death of his wife and the inevitable and imminent marriage of his daughter with a guy he does not approve of only strengthens his condition of futile citizen. Schmidt becomes a lonely bachelor but worst of all, he realizes that everything he constructed in his life does not have, in a genuine way, the value he thought they had. Discovering an old romance between his wife and his best friend is not exactly the kind of thing that helps. But when it seems that there is not escape for him, the script introduces a touching element that substantially changes the pulse of the film: Ndugu Umbo, an African child that Schmidt will take care of as a father figure, contributing with 22 dollars and a letter each month in which he confesses to the small boy his small everyday tragedy. In another brilliant move by the screenplay, we never actually get to see this boy because he is simply a symbol of Schmidt's journey to regaining a sense of purpose he should never have lost.The film had the mark of a good road movie but without the adventurous spirit. Removing the character from his home and launching him to the road serves directer Alexander Payne to emphasize Schmidt's loneliness; the lifeless, dry lands can be reflected in his spirit. There is an obvious connection with Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" which was also about a man who on a journey to receiving a honary degree, attempted to reevaluate his life. The major thematic difference is that here, there is no man defeated by time but one, enormously humane who does not want to retain his steps but proceed some more. And in an optimistic message the film tells us it doesn't matter if society leaves us by the side: there will always be a motive that will unite us to life and let us participate in a human experience. Here it is a kid from Tanzania who restores the purpose of life to Schmidt.When once asked what he likes his actors to deliver in a film Payne responded saying: "I like my actors to be the mirror reflecting the spectator's shame." With great fashion he achieves it. This is an entertaining and analytical film filled with details that it is impossible not to see yourself reflected in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would have to be my all-time favorite film. Jack Nicholson is at his best in this film as he becomes Schmidt. Unlike his other films, this one shows us how he can express the inner emotions of everyday life. I enjoy watching all of the characters as they are superbly acted. Each time this film is viewed, I am delighted to catch a funny line or look that I missed previously. Schmidt captivates our attention as he goes through many emotional situations that we can all identify with. I also like the way the film is narrated by Jack Nicholson as he is so good at emphasizing the emotions of Schmidt. You will fall in love with the character and enjoy watching him come to terms with his role in life. But, have tissues handy as this one will bring tears to your eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banality made into art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Warren Schmidt is 65 or 66. He is sitting in his office at Woodman Insurance in Omaha, Nebraska (that would be Mutual of Omaha, one imagines) waiting for the second hand and the minute hand to go straight up signaling that it is exactly five o'clock and he can go home. He is precise about this. It is also his last day at work. He is retiring. There is a retirement party. It is incredibly banal: the little speeches of appreciation about his loyalty and how much he did for the company, the lame jokes, the wooden chicken, etc. It's so bad that at one point Schmidt has to slip out for a vodka.And now he is into the sheer terror of retirement itself. He is having trouble figuring out what to do with himself. Being around his wife all the time irritates him. Not having something worthwhile to do bores him. He grumbles. He flicks the remote on the TV. He sees an ad to be a foster parent of a child in Tanzania. Twenty-two bucks. And then his wife of 42 years drops dead. The even more banal funeral. Now he really doesn't know what to do with himself. He lets the house go to ruin: trash all over the place. He doesn't shave. He doesn't get out of his bathrobe. His only daughter is marrying a guy he considers a nincompoop. He writes letters to his six-year-old foster child telling him about his circumstances, but with the rose-colored glasses on. He has nobody to talk to.Jack Nicholson stars as Schmidt and gives a very fine performance. He is still obviously Jack Nicholson, one of the great stars of our time, but he is also Schmidt and he portrays this hollow man as though he is filled with angry, repressed bile. Nicholson has the theatrical ability to overact without seeming to overact, to huff and puff and make hurt faces that seem so natural and in keeping with his character that we watch transfixed. Nicholson somehow makes this most commonplace man and his most ordinary life fascinating.What I was wondering as I watched was, how does this play in Peoria? (BYW, that's Peoria Illinois, which serves however reluctantly as the psychological and politically-correct heart of America--or at least it has since John Ehrlichman of the Nixon administration first used the term in 1970.) Will Peorians be offended? With the stifling banality of Schmidt's life be seen as satire and criticism of the American way of life, the usual blue state effete snobbery inflicted on the heartland citizens of the red states? Or will heartlanders see no satire, no sarcasm, and instead imagine that Schmidt is the embodiment of all that is right and proper (with a few understandable human peccadillos to round out his character)? So I checked out some reader reviews. I couldn't find any reviewers that were offended. The ones who didn't like the movie said they were just bored to tears, or actually bored to anger. They wasted their time and money on this movie! Well, that doesn't mean much. Any movie without a constant stream of titillation is bound to bore some people.But the movie is sad. Schmidt is a sad character. He calls himself a failure and asks if he has made any difference in anybody's life and he concludes that he hasn't. He is an empty shell of a man whose relationships with other people were invariably shallow including that with his daughter about whom he hasn't a clue.Yet the movie is funny. Most of the humor comes from how perfectly director Alexander Payne got the insipid banalities of our culture and mentality: The knickknacks that Schmidt leaves on the roof of the Winnebago. The roadside museums with their self-important histories. The bromides and platitudes from the groom-to-be (Dermot Mulroney) and his Ponzi scheme dream of wealth. Schmidt's stupidity in mistaking a younger woman's pity for sexual desire. His stupefying inability to have the slightest clue about anybody but himself.The supporting cast was very good, particularly Kathy Bates as Roberta the groom's earth mother with libido who fills the screen with her...uh, unmistakable presence, scaring Schmidt all the way back to Omaha. And Hope Davis is excellent as the daughter who no longer has any patience with her father's selfish obtuseness. The scene in which she tells him off in no uncertain terms is one of the best movie putdowns I've seen in years.But see this for Alexander Payne whose directorial credits include Election (1999) and Sideways (2004). It is no coincidence that he was born in Omaha, Nebraska.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film about life, Nicholson saves it from being mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paynes character study of a newly retired middle age man(Nicholson) who becomes a widower and goes through a semi crisis. This film works because of its acting, the story is pretty simple, and the direction is well suited. I found it a bit stretchy and boring at times, also didn't exactly think the nudity with kathy bates helped much (definetely not eye candy!). I liked bates here though, almost matching her work from misery, but Nicholson was the most solid, absolutely fascinating in the lead role. If the lead role was played by a solid but not as amazing actor who wouldn't fit the role such as a Michael Douglas or even Tom Hanks, it would not have worked. I thought Hope davis and dermot mulroney were also decent in their roles as oddball newlyweds. Payne's film is not terribly original, however is good and worth a look by all means. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious acting of Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren schmidt is an bad-humoured grumpy man who lives his last days in the world, and he found himself, in one day, without work and without wife. Later he discover that his wife had an adventure. This makes him to think about his life(because all the thing he thought as sure have disappeared): how has it been and what can he do now. This is a really good road-movie where the main (and almost only) character finds himself trying to find the sense of his life. Dry and touching, it arrives to the very inside of you and makes you to think about your life and your future. The acting of Nicholson is superb, as is the directing of Mr.Coen. Unfortunately, the acting of the rest of the cast is not so good, as the jokes that are into the movie to make it lighter to see. Despite that, the movie has some good moments, as all the letters that Warren writes to Ndugu, which serves as a personal psychoanalyst (being a six year-old African, and of course the little time he passes with his son-in-law family, totally differento to him, in behaviour, which bring us the better moments of Nicholson's acting. A beautiful and touching drama, with a superb acting of Jack Nicholson.</fullReview>

The RV is parked at the gas island behind him, and a wide expanse surrounds it. His daughter tells him she doesn't want him there, not yet. Now he's left without his wife, his job, his daughter, leaving him abandoned on the road. I love this particular moment for it's (probably unintentional) kinship it shares with the final scene of 'Five Easy Pieces' - only this time it's Jack, not a young woman, who's been abandoned.

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In psychology an ambiguous stimulus is something that there is no clear cut way to interpret. You have to make sense of it yourself using your pre-existing knowledge, point of view or prejudice. The deadpan expression of Schmidt and director Payne's wonderfully subtle storytelling does just this - leaves the making-sense-part to the viewer. What can we learn from Schmidt? Did he do the right thing?I guess a lot of people see About Schmidt as a slow paced movie about a boring old man doing questionable things. I wouldn't disagree. However, as most movies tend be stories with a moral about a sympathetic person's journey of some sort, Schmidt's failures and mundane boring life is refreshing, just because that's closer to the kind lives most people lead. But that is not to say that most people's lives are pointless. If you pay close attention you might make some sense out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawless Character Study Driven by a Flawless Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Executed impeccably by co-writer/director Alexander Payne (Election, Sideways), actors Jack Nicholson, Dermot Mulroney, Hope Davis, and Kathy Bates, ABOUT SCHMIDT is a flawless portrayal of someone in everyone's life.I saw this movie when it was in theaters. I had a quiet night to myself, I was feeling pensive, and I went to see that film. Jack Nicholson's character Warren Schmidt, not only portrays a man lost at such an old age, but an individual who is in all our lives... at least in someway.When I left that film, I couldn't help but be reminded of my grandfather, who had done a similar self-discovery journey when the movie was released. His idiosyncrasies, his humor, and his simple and delicate emotion was raw, poignant, and executed with grace. Schmidt reminded my friend of his Uncle. He scared my other friend into not wanting to be that way at that age. In some way shape or form, if you pay attention to the subtle messages, the movie will have an affect on you personally.10/10! This movie is one of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Alexander Payne!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I see the dismaying comments about this movie, I really feel sorry for Alexander Payne. You may not like his movie but you cannot say it is badly made or it's crap... But again, some people do not like some masterpieces (it's also a matter of taste). Objectively speaking, Payne did a terrific camera and directing work, the acting of Nicholson is obviously OUTSTANDING as usual. The soundtrack is tastefully chosen (Erik Satie's gnossiennes are altogether mysterious, meditative and sad). The whole thing is extremely refined and makes me think that part of American audience really missed the point...I had a better opinion of American people, please guys, do not disappoint me! Try to appreciate something else than stupid blockbusters brimming with violence or shallow and cheesy love stories with the expandable and lame "actors" of the day... So, the argument could only be done about the screenplay which some (too many) did not like or thought it was boring. To me, it was very profound and realistic. Spend your entire life behind a desk in a gloomy office, trapped between four walls, doing something pointless: your life goes by, you worked like a dog and finally when retirement comes you discover altogether: -that you do not know any longer how to occupy yourself and you know only one thing: doing your stupid job, -that the passion you had once for your wife has vanished and she seems quite a stranger to you in many ways, -that you completely failed being close to your only child and there's a complete misunderstanding between you, -and finally, when your wife dies, that you're extremely lonely and that life may be vain...unless you find a little orphan on the other side of the world with whom you'll share a little bit of friendship. I think this represents a lot of common fears from all of us and it is particularly well exploited in this movie. Not everybody has got the chance of doing the job of his/her dreams, not everybody succeeds in his/her family life...so quit movies with the brainless bimbos (male and female)of the month, stop listening to Britney Spears, and have a look at Payne, Angelopoulos, Schlondorff, Bergman, Wenders, Truffaud, and listen to Brahms or anything with substance.</fullReview>

OK, it happens that I am in the doldrums of middle age myself, and I must believe that is a big part of why this movie hit me like a bolt of lightning. I happened to tune in to it one night on cable, and I could not take my eyes off the screen for the next hour and a half (or whatever it was). Watching this movie was for me an intensely personal experience. I found myself saying, "Jack Nicholson is portraying my life." I mean down to the guts. I would not call this a comedy. Or even a comedy/drama. It has some great comic relief, but that's about it. It would be interesting for you young men out there to watch this now, and then re-watch it when you're approaching 50.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that I gave the total once over. I wasn't totally too impressed with Mr. Nicholson's last movie (the highly overrated 'As Good As It Gets' (or the movie he did after this one, the truly awful 'Something's Gotta Give')) so when the opportunity arose to watch 'About Schmidt' I did so somewhat grudgingly.This is one of the funniest, and one of the most touching movies I've seen in years.Where can I start? The story is about a recently retired and a recent widower, played amazingly by Jack Nicholson who decides that since he's got gallons of time on his hands now, he'll just go to Denver now, a couple of days early, for his daughter's wedding. His daughter is not too crazy about the idea, and convinces him to delay his arrival. Rather than going back home, Schmidt decides to travel around the country to reflect on his life (partially through a somewhat hilarious correspondence to a foster child named Ngugu) and also meeting (and somewhat terrifying people) along the way before he finally arrives in Denver, and who better to greet him but his daughter's future Mother-In-Law, and who else could play that part but the marvelous Kathy Bates? One of the most appealing parts of this movie, besides the story, which is WONDERFUL, is the somewhat offbeat kilter casting. Aside from Nicholson and Bates, I didn't recognize a single soul in this movie. (I actually did a what the? When I found out that it was Dermot Mulroney playing Jack Nicholson's totally goofy red-neck future son-in law). The more I think of it, it makes the journey Schmidt take strange for us as well, as we're faced with actors we're not familiar with (most of the actors are localized actors from the regions where the movie takes place).The ending of this is so devastating. You just GET it, it's painful, and it's so wonderful in it's simplicity.What a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad and marvelous little gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only recently I had the chance to watch "About Schmidt" on cable. A few days ago, I watched it again on DVD and, I'm sure, I'm going to watch it several more times in the future. I think this is one of the best movies in recent years. A sad and marvelous little gem which, surprisingly, comes from a "Hollywood factory". The central idea of this movie somehow brought to my mind "American Beauty", which however is quite different in its development and conclusions. Why did I like it so much? Among other reasons, most certainly because I could relate to it. As a matter of fact, (almost) all should. It could be renamed "About Ordinary Humans". This movie is about "sense of approaching death and facing defeat" (...soon I'll be dead and...no one will remember that I ever lived and feel that I'm missing....) and consequently, "a tardier search of the meaning of life" (the sponsoring of the little Tanzanian boy). We may not like the idea, but we all have a big chance to face that (perhaps some of us already did...). If you think this is not going to happen to you, one of the three: you are still too young, or you are quite an exceptional human being or...you are in for a big surprise! The movie best assets: a strong script, a fine and sensitive direction (both by outstanding Alexander Payne), deeply structured characters but, most of all, a wonderful acting performance by the leading actor and the whole supporting cast. Jack Nickolson, as usual, steals the movie delivering a surprisingly subdued performance (compared to what he had accustomed us in previous movies: this time only a few smiles, no grins, no moving eyebrows...). He does a nice little character study and nails the Warren part with a gutsy performance, reaffirming himself as a wonderful actor. His performance should have been rewarded with an "Oscar for Best Actor". I truly think, in this case, he got robbed...again. A little example: the opening scene shows us Jack/Warren sitting at his clean desk in his almost empty office, staring at the wall-clock waiting to strike 5:00 o'clock, which will mean the end of his professional career and the beginning of a new life. His face looks emotionless, almost like cut in stone but still, you can feel the hurricane of contrasting emotions ravaging his heart. Even better: when he leaves the office, after having paid a totally useless visit to his successor, he spots all his important work papers, representing a lifetime of work, nicely boxed and stacked-up against a garage wall but... dangerously close to the garbage bin. His face expression shows it all but, without a twitch of a nerve. Not many actors can do that. Kathy Bates, in spite of having very limited screen-time, is simply a riot as Roberta, the horny divorcée, mother of the groom and undisputed head of a dysfunctional family. She never goes "over the top" (it would have been easy in that part) instead, she is so real that you can...almost smell her! Her scene with Jack/Warren in the Jacuzzi is priceless. Hope Davis as Jeannie, the mousy and "past prime-time" Warren's daughter, is terrific in her part and proves she can act with her guts. Marriage is her last chance and she is not going to miss it. She is bitter, angry and close to a nervous break-down, but determined to get her little share of happiness at any costs. Dermot Mulroney (quite underrated young actor which should get more and better opportunities), is great as Randall, the dorky water-bed salesman, full of good intentions, but hopelessly "breast-fed into a complete looser" by his own mother. This honest and heartfelt movie is not supposed to "make the audience feel good", so I highly recommend it only to the ones who...don't mind. I rate it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

However, I have just spent a very disturbing day or so reading the novel by Louis Begley, and the only resemblancee the storyline of the movie has to the novel, are that the character "Albert" Schmidt - not Warren as in the movie - has just lost his wife of many years, his daughter is planning to marry, not the weird character in the movie but an associate in the firm from which Albert has just retired, and that's about all. Director's licence is one thing when movies are being made, but surely some semblance of what the author portrayed deserves some attention.I wonder how many of your commentators have read the excellent novel. It is a shame that this distortion has now affected my views on what is a superlative movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, GO JACK :D (semi spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you really go wrong with Jack Nicholson? Well, they did it in `Anger Management' but that is another story? I have always loved Jack Nicholson as an actor and in `About Schmidt' he proves to me that he deserves my attention. Because he is an amazing actor and he steals absolutely every scene that he is in. This movie is in the drama genre, but it is also a feel good movie. Jack plays a guy that retires from his job. After his wife suddenly dies, he really doesn't know what he will do. It seems like his life doesn't have meaning anymore. Therefore, he starts up his motor home and starts driving around. I think he basically needs something to do, because then he doesn't have to sit around thinking about his late wife or his work. This is a beautiful movie and a sweet story about an average guy. If you like Jack, you will love this movie. I know I did. I rate this movie 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, Despite The Sad Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another smashing performance from Jack Nicholson. He plays Warren Schmidt, a retired insurance worker and a very successful man. But really, Warren is a sad and lonely man. When he wife dies suddenly, he takes to the road in his 35ft trailer exploring his roots and re-entering his past. Hope Davis plays his daughter Jeanie in the movie and a very good actress she is too. When I first watched this movie I thought of it as the sort of film that you'd watch once or twice maybe a year, something like that. But I have watched it quite a bit over the last few weeks. It's a positive film about real people, and people whom we can all relate to. It also carries a very positive message about life, love and relationships. Look out for Kathy Bates as Jeanie's fiancé's sex crazed mom. **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>June Squibb gives the kind of sublime performance we get to see about once every 50 years. Without the absolute unspoken clarity of the couple's relationship being established, Jack Nicholson's brilliantly controlled performance would have been hollow. Much like watching him act with Diane Keaton, you can almost tell in his relaxed brilliance that he senses that Squibb's performance is going to bring his to a new level (giving Jack Nicholson complete credit for working as hard as any actor ever did.)Squibb's is among the best acting I've ever seen. Ellen Burstyn could have pulled it off...Shirley MacLaine...Jessica Lange...Diane Keaton... Only the most skillful actress could have recognized and offered the restraint required to make the role work.Please can we see more of this woman??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like Jack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to see movies about ordinary people. Americans churn out loads of footage but so little of it shows us what ordinary America might be like.It's reassuring, from time to time, to know that there are some ordinary folks over there portrayed as other than murderers, bigots, drug crazed degenerates, patriotic heros, impossibly rich, vacant, beautiful people. America should know the way they depict themselves in movies is generally not very informative, until a genuinely eccentric film like About Schmidt manages to somehow manages to pop up above the parapet.Of course it just doesn't "pop up", the only reason we get to see it on general release is because Jack Nicholson's in it. If he hadn't been then, let's face it, the film would have been just another reasonably decent "made for TV" movie.Jack is magnificent. The guy has a big star presence which used to be based primarily on his smile and wicked eyebrows. The guy has an extraordinary talent for recognising his own physical attributes and applying them to the job in hand. His aging tired eyes now become his strength. We look to his eyes to understand every scene. He is a conductor of a movie if ever there was one. A genuine big actor re-affirms himself as a big star.A very genuine film as well. I loved it. Mind you, I'm over 55 so I may be biased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Kathy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An OK movie, entertaining in its black-humoresque way--but what made it worth watching, for me, was the astonishing performance by Kathy Bates. I've known people exactly like this character, and I'll bet so has she, and her portrayal was so right-on-the-money it couldn't be better. Wow. The movie only gets a vote of "six" but her contribution deserves "ten."I never know whether to be annoyed or not that Jack Nicholson always seems basically to play...himself. My feeling is that he never actually inhabits a role. Unquestionably he's a fine actor, but I never expect any surprises from a movie starring Mr. Nicholson, and I haven't been surprised yet. I dunno...Apart from Ms. Bates's extraordinary performance, what I enjoyed most in this film was the text, and especially the conclusion, of the first letter to Schmidt's foster child. Tasteless and priceless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just caught this by accident on cable, and I liked it very much. I never stop dead in my tracks to stay with anything I see on TV, but this had me hooked from start to finish. I think ABOUT SCHMIDT features what may be one of Jack's best performances, and he played a very deep character who didn't appear to be at all like himself in real life. I was drawn to Nicholson's Schmidt and the loneliness he was forced to deal with under his unfortunate circumstances. I myself am married and wouldn't know where to turn if I should ever be forced to start all over again, should anything ever happen to my wife. I think it helps to enjoy this film if you're 40 or older and can identify more closely with Schmidt.Some unkind things have been said about Kathy Bates' brief nude shot, but I respect her for doing it. It's refreshing (if not overtly stimulating) to see a real person take her clothes off in movies for a change.Where the movie falls short of perfection for me is that it veers off into typical "annoying son-in-law and comical family" territory; I was much more in tune with Nicholson's travels and trying to find his place in his new world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love this terrific little drama. "About Schmidt" definitely has to be the finest Jack Nicholson movie of the decade. So simple, so ingenious. So tragic, so funny. It touches so deeply you can practically feel your whole body tremble. It's filled with colorful performances and outstanding characters. Being a huge Nicholson fan I was extremely pleased to see Jack in a sympathetic role like this for a change. His acting is amazing. Just look at the way he very carefully uses his eyes or the movements of his forehead and mouth. His face tells millions of tiny stories about the sweet, sad and lonely man Warren Schmidt.I'm sure even people who doesn't normally care about Nicholson that much can't say he's overacting in some way. I also must point out that the ending is simply startling because during the movie he constantly looks like he's going to break down and cry but he's just holding something back. This is so utterly emotional way to finally end the movie it leaves the audience speechless. When you look at "About Schmidt" it's almost impossible to imagine that this actually is the same crazy fellow who played psychopath in "The Shining" or the devil himself in "The Witches of Eastwick".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack is still at the top of his game. Somehow, despite his wealth and fame, he is able to credibly portray the role of a misunderstood common man without derision or caricature. But Jack has been here before. In "As Good As It Gets," he was this man, as he was recently in "The Crossing Guard," to a greater or lesser degree. Jack makes this film work on all levels. Kathy Bates also adds her typically excellent work, and the script is both funny and poignant in a slow, understated way. All in all, this is a great film well worth seeing, but if you're expecting to see Jack stretch out and occupy a new role worthy of an Oscar nomination, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet, funny and heart-felt film, but I did find the ending a little disappointing (MAJOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) has just retired from his job as acting vice president for an insurance company. Upon his retirement Warren spends time with his wife of 42 years Helen Schmidt (June Squibb), but Warren's main concern is trying to improve relations with his estranged daughter Jeannie Schmidt (Hope Davis). However, when Helen dies Warren decides to venture to Denver to see his daughter before her wedding and makes some life discoveries along the way.About Schmidt is certainly a sweet and generally well-intentioned film. The relationship between Warren &amp; Helen was both funny and warm and they were both believable as a couple who had been married for 42 years. When watching this you could see that they both had their practical uses which sort of completed the other (Helen had the homely skills and basically waited on Warren hand and foot whereas Warren provided her with financial security in his well-paid job in the insurance industry). I always felt there was some love there, but felt that their marriage existed for so long out of practicality more than anything else.When Helen dies, this is really where Warren's journey begins and it falls back on the old cliché of 'only being able to appreciate someone when they've gone'. The house ends up a mess, Warren goes out shopping and only buys frozen food &amp; convenience food. This aspect of the film provided many humorous moments such as Warren finally being able to stand up to take a pee (Helen had told him to sit down to pee when she was alive). It's also evident that Warren has become used to people making his decisions for him and has allowed himself to be treated like a child. Although all these things do make him quite endearing as a character, part of me just wanted to shake Warren and tell him to get a grip.Warren is clearly someone who is generally unable to express himself and isn't great at showing emotions. Warren sponsors a child in this film and I got the impression that this child was like his sounding board - someone he didn't know too well who he could release all his frustrations and anxieties upon. It's good because not only is it nice to see that Warren is a generous individual, but it also provides us with lots of insight to him as a person. Very clever.Another strong aspect to this film is in the scenes where Warren meets Randall's family and when looking at them it's fairly obvious that they aren't too dissimilar to his own family. Randall's mother (played by the wonderful Kathy Bates) is very much the matriarch of the family and is domineering, condescending and dismissive to her ex-husband and talks over him (exactly the same way that Helen did with Warren). I think this was a major contributory factor for Warren not wanting Jeannie to marry Randall - maybe he was worried about her turning out like Randall's mother or like Helen. The other more obvious issue Warren had with Randall is that he perhaps wouldn't be able to offer her much in the way of financial security (as he did with Helen). I liked this aspect of the narrative as it did give me lots to think about and was quite interesting if it's looked upon as a character study.The big problem I had with this was with the ending and when watching a film that purports to take the view on a life-journey you've got to feel as though something has been achieved. At the start Warren was weak-willed and not able to express himself, he then improves in this respect and even tells his daughter that he doesn't want her to marry Randall. However, at the wedding reception, Warren is given the perfect opportunity to vent his frustrations but decides not to articulate his feelings, lets them elope and then regrets it afterwards. I have to admit to feeling a little cheated by this and it almost made everything else prior to this scene seem rather pointless. I'm aware that this is based on a book and having not read it I can't say whether the book ends in the same way, but if I had read the book and it still ended like this then I'd still feel cheated. Whatever happened here the ending would have been slightly downbeat (for someone) so why not make a more believable downbeat ending and not cheat your audience?About Schmidt is a very sweet, funny, insightful, moving and heart-felt film. However, the ending virtually killed it for me and whilst I still enjoyed the film the ending made me slightly angry and definitely weakened my overall impression of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow but well directed movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a bit slow moving but it well directed, as Alexander Payne alway does, filming with no flip-flopping scenes around the way David Lynch likes to do. Nicholson portrays a retired man, soon his wife dies, and he does not know what to do with himself, then finds out that his daughter is about to marry what he thinks is a no-good hippie. Of course, with Payne, his movies are usually based around Omaha. Schmidt drives his motor home to Denver to try to stop the wedding. As he writes to a homeless boy, his real thoughts are on paper, such as...where did all the wrinkles come from? Who is this old woman sleeping in my bed? The last few years has gone by like a blur..Well, I am 81 and have thoughts the same way. It was really a sentimental trip in movie land. Since it was not a very exciting movie, I couldn't give it more than a 5, and only "Citizen Ruth" deserves a "10".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Schmidt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Payne's 'About Schmidt' is a difficult film to describe. In places it was boring, it was amusing, it was hilarious and it was moving but nonetheless the viewer is concerned about Schmidt and wanders along with him as he tries to figure out himself while travelling across America. Payne gives us some nice glimpses of cross-country America. The story is told through Schmidt's point of view but the movie itself isn't merely about a whiny old man. It explores his lost opportunities but also his actions or lack of it. Such as, his loyalty to his wife (who even had an affair with his friend, unbeknownst to him) and in later life, he actually resents her. He probably wasn't the best example of a father to his own daughter and in a moment of despair tries to, quite unsuccessfully, prevent her daughter from marrying GGG. At this point of life he thinks about making a difference to the world only to conclude later that it's too late...but that's not the end of the story. I have never thought of Jack Nicholson as the best of actors because I find him quite repetitive. However, he totally owns 'About Schmidt'. He is quite restrained here and does not use his usual on screen attitude and gestures that he's so famous for. In a supporting role, Kathy Bates is vivacious and hilarious. She's pretty much the reverse of Schmidt's personality. 'About Schmidt' may not match up to Payne's following film 'Sideways', but it remains a worthy watch for Payne's treatment of the subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curb Schmidt's Enthusiasm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like a much deeper, longer, more richly performed episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm." The film's "Larry David," Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson), is an aging, confined, picky father and husband stuck in an "imperfect world," forever branding him miserable. In an act of either boredom, concern, salvation, or all of the above, Schmidt starts to write letters to one of those poor African children seen on TV. Suddenly, tragedy strikes the sour geezer when his daughter announces her engagement to an innocent but brainless yokel and his wife shockingly buys a ridiculously large and extravagant RV, only to kick the bucket shortly after, making the new purchase Schmidt's responsibility. Afterwards is when this comedy takes flight as the road trip film it mostly is, grinding our poor hero and his enormous vehicle through events of accidentally acting upon instincts of loneliness, the effects of foreign drug use at the most inappropriate time, and of course, a nude Kathy Bates. What keeps the film from being titled About George Costanza is a light at the end of this stretched out, squirm-inducing tunnel: the realization of easy acceptance and the enjoyment one can earn from it, even after a long, hard life. My favorite scene is the finale, an uplifting tearjerker when Schmidt reads a longly-waited-for and finally received letter from his pen pal Ndugu, not because Schmidt finally escaped feeling like a failure but because of the purity and understanding of the boy. Nicholson successfully and beautifully inherits a fresh new on screen persona with Schmidt, and Alexander Payne (Sideways) proves once again what a patient and perfectly delicate director he can be. Unfortunately for this film, I am a die-hard fan of "Curb" and still believe that socially painful comedy is best in small doses, with no end of the storm or golden skies anywhere. Love the grumpy protagonist or love to hate him - if he achieves pure, guilt-free happiness, it is a buzzkill to the comedy, a betrayal to the established mood, and an unneeded spelling-out of a moral the majority of the audience already knew... Excellent effort in experimentation, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholson is very good, and in an unusual role for him. But the film moves very slowly (which may have been intentional), and is quite depressing. The film's message is a good one, but it shouldn't take over two hours to deliver, nor should it depress the viewer.Also, the summary of the film talks about Nicholson's character (Schmidt) trying to fix his daughter's life. There is very little of that. The film is really about a man who retires right at the beginning of the film, and only then starts examining his life.Basically, the film is two hours of watching a 66 or 67 year old man come to grips with his life. Even the dialogue is embarrassing, if not downright depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson is "Schmidt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about despair and the meaning of life. It is about trying to figure out the reason for living and to gain a measure of peach knowing that your life has actually made a difference to others. Jack Nicholson's performance is superb; it may be the best performance in his career. He succeeds in conveying the main character's pathos as he struggles to come to terms with the anger that has been repressed for decades. The movie shows to what lengths people will go to avoid dealing with the truth about themselves, which is a source of pain. In this movie the main character, hit with two major life changing events, has to confront the reality of his own existence. Having lived in an emotional cocoon for decades, the process of emerging is fraught with danger. For the first time in his life he has to deal with people forthrightly, without any props, and it is emotionally taxing. Finally, the movie asks the audience to answer this question: what is the value of your life?What is one to do when they believe that their life has been one big zero? This is the theme of this movie. A man is searching for something, but what? He is a traveler without a compass, wandering aimlessly, escaping from the nothingness of his existence but with no place to go. This is not a happy movie; it's about loneliness combined with insight that leads to awareness, but what to do with this knowledge, that is the question. The main character, Schmidt, is traveling through life and his journey is not a happy one. It's full of obstacles that rob him of whatever little happiness he experiences. The people who befriend him are social misfits. His daughter is a shrill. His son-in-law is a buffoon. That's life. And Schmidt? He is a dud, a dullard, an educated man with no sense, an insurance man who made no plans for himself. He's angry, marginalized, rejected, and for good reason: he has the emotional sensitivity of a rock. Okay, retirement can be rough, but with Schmidt it becomes a struggle for survival. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance as the wandering Schmidt. He captures the essence of the character. Nicholson is Schmidt.This movie is about a retiree named Schmidt who has lived in an emotional shell all of his life, and after all of the props, his job, his marriage, and his home, that made up his cocoon, disappear, he is left alone, now on his own, to fend for himself in the big, scary world to which Schmidt has no emotional connection. The only thing Schmidt has left is a mobile home to which he beats a hasty retreat when things become too rough, too depressing or too confusing for him. Only when Schmidt's driving his mobile home does he feel a measure of security and sense of self. Schmidt is like a lost little child who doesn't know where to go or what to do, and whose life is so devoid of warmth and who is so strongly convinced of his own worthlessness that his only fulfilling relationship is that of being a foster-father to a young African girl with whom he communicates by mail. For Schmidt, everything he has ever done has been a waste of time, a fraud and heaped in futility. Jack Nicholson is excellent in this movie. He projects a deadpan, flat expression along with droll speech that conveys the emotional shallowness of the character. He was perfect for this role. Jack Nicholson is "Schmidt."</fullReview>

I couldn't have chosen an actor more suitable for the role of Warren Schmidt than Nicholson. I loved Kathy Bates as well. She was quite funny from time to time. I've seen other Payne-movies as well.

It's honest and realistic, it's funny and tragic at the same time. It's a movie that makes you think about life, about making a difference. It's about the meaning of life, the meaning of your life in particular.I loved this movie. Jack Nicholson still has it. After several decades in the acting business, he's still standing and delivering. I really look forward seeing more of Payne's work as well. It's these kind of movies I love the most. Movie's like "About Schmidt" and "Sideways" who aren't afraid to tell a story about life, the way it is and not the way it should be. See this movie. I can't think of any reason not to see it.

		<fullReview>This film was a pleasant surprise to me in all ways. Never before have I seen such a subtle performance from Jack Nicholson, and never would I have expected it to work so well. The film has a slow pace; a depressive and introverted perspective of the world from a man who feels his life has had no meaning...no purpose...and that nothing he has ever done has made a difference in the world.I saw this film not sure what to expect. I was a big fan of Alexander Payne's previous film "Election," and I expected something similar in fashion. To my surprise, "About Schmidt," was completely unlike the former, with quiet characters who speak volumes about themselves without realizing it. The camera (as I remember) was static in most of the shots...the music was somber, and gentle,...attributes which pay off tremendously when Schmidt encounters Kathy Bates' outspoken and sometimes profane character.The narrative is forwarded cleverly by passages from Schmidt's letters to his sponsored African child, Ndugu. Through these letters, Schmidt reveals his contemptuous attitude toward retirement, his wife, the man who took over his job after his early retirement, and most importantly toward his daughter's 'nincompoop' fiancé.The plot takes shape after Schmidt's wife dies of a heart attack. He goes on a soul-searching journey in his RV throughout the midwest... re-tracing moments in his life and occasionally getting himself into mischievous predicaments. Soon after he realizes how futile his life has been, and after seeing what he believes to be a sign (a shooting star) from his wife's spirit, he sets out to break up his daughter's marriage.I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this film. It is witty, well written, and superbly acted. (The fact that Kathy Bates lost an Oscar for best supporting actress to Catherine Zeta Jones in 'Chicago,' is a crime) I don't know how much the average American moviegoer would appreciate its gentle humor and tenderness, but if you open up to the film...it is quite moving. The final five minutes of the film are particularly moving...one of two instances where I was moved to tears during a film. An unconventional ending to say the least, but very powerful and appropriate. I give the film my highest recommendation to anyone with the patience to enjoy a critique of life and aging in American culture.</fullReview>

In short, the movie makes you forget you are watching a movie, which makes it fine artwork. But then, if you know the director/writer also created the superb film "Sideways", this may not surprise you.I gave this film a 10 because it scores high on every important count---script, acting, directing, camera work, sound---without drawing attention to any of those elements.

It is a slow film, and I understand it may not hold the attention of an audience who are used to the thrills and spills that Hollywood churn out weekly. However, if you're prepared to sit back, watch and listen, then you will become drawn into the mind of Warren Schmidt, and share his experiences and emotions. By the end of the movie you will feel as if he is a very dear friend!

		<fullReview>I find myself wondering why this movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Director Alexander Payne (from the wonderful Election) had a good story to work with and somehow managed to get Jack Nicholson himself to do the title-role.Nicholson is great (as you would expect) as Warren Schmidt, a retired insurance guy. He ponders what life has brought to him (and what he gave back), as his wife suddenly dies and his only daughter is about to marry some jackass. He's alone and cynical, leave it to Nicholson to do it just the right way!Another thing the movie has going is the way the feelings and thoughts of Schmidt are told to the viewer. Instead of going for a 'normal' voice-over we hear Schmidt reading his letters to Ndugu, his foster child. Nice little angle there.The movie starts out funny and ends really touching, but in the middle are some pieces hardly interesting, as it turns out to be a bit of a road movie, without an interesting supporting cast. It just leaves you with the feeling: could've been so much better.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read a critique which implied you weren't that bright if you didn't like this film, I recall the fairy tale about the emperors new clothes. You know the one. The emperor walks around naked and everyone says he looks great because they've been told only a fool would not be able to see his clothes.This is a film the critics will probably love. As for me, I spent the entire movie waiting, in vain, for something to happen. My wife fell asleep.The summary on the back of the dvd cover struggled to describe what happens.A great performance from Nicholson as the irritating - "We know someone just like him" - Schmidt. Also from Kathy Bates as the scary-in-law.This looks like the screenplay was taken from a play.A touching ending but it didn't come soon enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*About Shmidt*About Shmidt is the story of Warren Shmidt, a 66-year old retired employee of an insurrance agency. After a sudden tragic accident he sets out to stop his daughter's wedding to someone he doesn't think worthy. Shmidt is a sad, lonely man. As much as I wanted to like About Shmidt, I just didn't. I heard so many good things about it, but I myself didn't enjoy anything except for Nicholson's wonderful performance. I thought About Shmidt was going to be a comedy or even a dark comedy, but it was just depressing. I can handle a depressing movie like American Beauty or Life is Beautiful, but this was just terrible. Like I said, Jack Nicholson was very convincing. He gave Shmidt little traits and really deserves praise for his performance. The scenes that featured Kathy Bates were all good, she stole the show. She was the only comedic relief in the whole movie and it was really, really needed.*4/10*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An introspective film that explores the vanity of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(warning: minor spoiler within) I found this to be an honest film... revealing in its approach at displaying the inner, hidden thoughts that we all have at life's oddities as they appear from our unique perspective. All in all I could not help but be reminded of the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes, a book that might just as easily been named "Solomon's midlife crisis", wherein Solomon laments the meaninglessness of life. For Solomon the conclusion was that without God, nothing makes sense. For Schmidt, the end scene reveals his minor sense of accomplishment in finally making a difference in someones life (the African boy). I very much enjoyed Jack Nicholson's portrayal of this character. I believe that he was truly able to express the hidden thoughts of this empty man. The nudity was not at all necessary in this film as we clearly understood the eccentricities of Kathy Bates character (Roberta Hertzel) but I guess that present day's movie culture feels that some sort of nude scene must be included in order to complete the film (go figure). Otherwise, a good film but not for those whose only motive for watching movies is sensory titillation. This movie requires patience to enjoy and the ability to be somewhat introspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensitive Dark Comedy but not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a portrait of a man who retires and finds - all too late - that his life has no meaning. This is a comedy but a dark comedy that deals with very real and relevant issues, if you're an adult. If you're 14-24 chances are you'll probably feel that the deliberate, measured pacing - which works so brilliantly - is too slow and that "not enough happens". Untrue, but it's easy to see how some viewers accustomed to formula pacing are turned off.Nicholson turns out an excellent, restrained performance and reminds us that he is in full command of his powers as an actor.The theme is the search for meaning in one's life. Schmidt looks back on his life and comes up practically empty handed. Following his journey leaves one with a sense of sadness, even despair. Alexander Payne keeps the storytelling minimalist and restrained and almost never flinches. The tension is palpable as we're reminded of people we know who are sufferring in much the same way as Schmidt.Payne is a shrewd filmmaker who writes and directs with an assured hand, much like Todd Solondz, another terrific talent, though less bleak than Solondz in his outlook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just couldn't get excited about "Schmidt". Sorry, Jack..it's not your fault! It's the plot, or rather lack of plot. There's just no story-line...it kind of meanders along, taking the viewer for a ride, which is fine if it's a pretty ride, which "About Schmidt" definitely does NOT. Set in the US Mid-West (?) the scenery is uniformly dull and grey, the sun only peeking out in one scene. The acting..well, hey, this is JACK we're talking about, and he's superb with a really, really BORING role. Kathy Bates steals the show however, her few scenes are the highlight of the entire two hours. Her full-frontal is inspiring. (Way to go, girl!) Anyhow, lest my comments become as boring as the film, can I just say that this is NOT the film to watch when you're feeling suicidal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor pacing and miscast Nicholson undermines interesting premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations of Alexander Payne's About Schmidt were high, anticipating an 'Election' for the 50 and better generation. However, I was sorely disappointed. The general premise of the film is an interesting one: a wage slave retires and looks back on his life, finding it without meaning. He goes in search of meaning on a road trip through his past with comic and serious consequences.The biggest problem with the execution of the film is that Nicholson is completely miscast in the central role. Critics have bored on about how he kept all his trademark mannerisms in check and how wonderful this was, but I disagree. If you want someone to embody a character who appears dead to the outside world and betrays little emotion, then try and find a contemporary Robert Mitchum. Don't ask the cleverest, most charismatic and mischievous actor of the last thirty years to act against type. The resultant performance appears more self-indulgent and mannered than a lot of those classic Nicholson performances ('As Good as it Gets', 'The Witches of Eastwick') often referenced as evidence of his lack of discipline and control. A recent viewing of 'Carnal Knowledge' confirmed what I've always thought - I'd rather watch Jack being Jack in some dated rubbish than almost anything else.The second problem is the pacing of the film. The first half is stately and cleverly presented but as soon as Warren Schmidt hits the road in his Adventurer, the film falls apart. The 'road trip' section is poorly written and unimaginative and the final half hour around the daughter's wedding should be a feast of comic cameos, but never develops beyond the outline of plot and character. If I want to see grotesque stereotypes parodied in a heavy-handed way, I'll watch a Farrelly brothers comedy, and the family dinner scene in particular is a mess of lazy writing and uneven tone. The production design in Omaha was beautifully realized, but once that big truck hits the road it is as if the filmmakers (and Nicholson) have lost interest.A clue to the problems Payne and his editors must have faced is given on the DVD, where there are some lovely extra/extended scenes from the early part of the film. On his commentary Payne admits that one wonderful scene of Sunday night dinner for the Schmidts and their friends didn't get in because of the running time of the first half.In summary, this is worth seeing as a curiosity, but given the talent of those involved it should have been much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To sum-up: About Schmidt is a melancholic film depiction of the senior retirement "after-life" so to speak. Jack Nicholson plays a very lost old man in a world that seems to either move too fast or not fast enough for him (depending on how he may feel that day.) In my opinion the acting is as expected, dynamic and very accurate as far as what you would expect in situations like these but time and time again throughout the entire duration of the film I found myself just feeling sorry for the main character caught-up in all of these slowly announced endeavors.Pro's &amp; con's:+ Like I said, great acting all-around+ There was terrific scenary within every moment of the movie- It moves so slow that it feels like it's longer than it really is- I found such a display of emotional confusion and disarray as this to really be nothing more than a sad, sad story that basically makes you feel let-down</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unpleasant experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having greatly enjoyed "Election", i was eagerly anticipating Payne's next movie, "About Schmidt", but i was in for a disappointment. The film delivers its message, namely that its protagonist has wasted his life, in the first ten minutes, and then drags on, mercilessly and purposelessly, for another two hours, creating one awkward scene after another. There are some moments of saving grace - letters to the African kid and Kathy Bates' performance are among them, but those are few and far between (Bates, i believe, delivers one of the shortest Oscar-nominated performances in history). Most of the other scene are just painful to watch. Don't get me wrong - the movie is not badly made, it achieves its goal (a portrait of a complete non-entity), and Nicholson's performance is quite remarkable - after a lifetime of playing more or less himself, he, for once, manages a complete metamorphosis. But, regardless of its moral or philosophical value, it makes a very dull viewing.</fullReview>

But he has this emptiness in his life, he is sad, he needs someone to love, and all the time he never really cared. Then his wife passes away, he is all alone. and the rest of the film deals with his soul searching and finally he finds that he hasn't really made any difference in anybody's life, his wife didn't love him, his daughter marries to a punk, it was all mistake, he feels so useless. but then the kid in africa sends him a painting and a letter and thats the moment he cries, finally he made a difference in that kids life.

		<fullReview>I took this off the shelf thinking there was a degree of humour in it - but that's not the case. Yes, there are a few witty moments, but at heart this is a very emotional tragedy.The character of Schmidt is going through a period in his life that many of us younger folks don't even have a concept of - the loss of a career, a wife, friends and a daughter. The pain of the situation comes through in almost every scene and shot. I was certainly close to tears because of it's poignancy.Some comments say this is boring and superficial. I disagree. The pacing and mood of the whole film is very consistent, and very natural. Jack Nicholson's performance has high points, and he is very convincing as Schmidt, but he also lapses into pulling a funny faces when the script calls for him to feel disconnected from those around him. The cast as a whole is very good, although the comedy mullet worn by his future son-in-law is a bit tacky.Certainly a film to think and feel about, but not "light entertainment".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Early on in this well acted, well scripted, well produced movie I made a prediction:The beginning is going to be slow and subtle. We accept that. Crucially, at some point in the remaining 90 minutes or so, the narrative drive is going to have to pick up, or this movie is going to fall into the same trap as so many other 'sensitive' films, and out-subtle itself.Unfortunately that's exactly what happened. All the great characterisations, good acting, nice script and nuanced meanings in the world can't save this film from its own sluggishness.Frankly, it's a dull movie, and worst of all, nothing is resolved. Nicholson starts the movie incomplete and lost, and at the end he seems to have learned and accomplished nothing.I can't say it's a bad movie, but it's dreary, depressing, and despite the best efforts of Kathy Bates and Nicholson, I found it as empty an experience as Schmidt apparently finds his whole existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointed is what first came to mind as soon as the credits rolled. I expected so much more due to all the fuss about this picture beforehand. And what do you really get in the end?? Yes, a wonderful chance for Mr. Jack Nicholson to shine and show is true colors as a professional actor. There is no denying his talent and charm. The man is a genius. His facial features alone in this movie are amazing. The plot and pace of this movie on the other hand leave much to be desired.It meanders along (and no i'm not just some action hero buff here; i love slow movies esp. in the arthouse sense but this is ridiculously bland) and really moves nowhere. Many cliches (a shooting star while seeking an answer?? come on!) abound. The characters are very appealing especially on the other family's side in which Warren (Jack's character) must come to accept as his in-laws yet the movie doesn't ever truly explore that side of the equation.Meant to be a "thinking-person's" movie it just comes across as plain trite trash that's overlong and way too full of itself. It does have its moments (some of them very funny and under the radar) but it falls short on too many other levels for the great acting and small touches of brilliant humor to pull it through to make it a good movie for 2 hours.Oh yeah and the fact that you see Kathy Bates get nekkid is just too much to handle (automatic point deduction as I had to down 2 beers immediately following such a sight) 5*/10*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, except that I looked forward to seeing it after having heard it praised on numerous occasions, and was severely disappointed. This film just would not take off, however hard it tried. Perhaps it is just as well, one dreads to think where it might have been off to if it had gotten off the ground. One reviewer described Louis Begley's book, on which the screenplay is based, as an ?intelligent, sympathetic portrait of an increasingly self-aware man in pursuit of unvarnished emotional truth'. If that is what the director aimed for, it was lost on me. Would an intelligent man ?celebrate' his new-found freedom from a nagging wife by peeing all over the bathroom? Would an intelligent assistant vice-president of a large insurance company buy so much fast food that his oversized camper bursts at the seams? Would a former company executive grab the first woman who shows some sympathy for his plight and force a kiss on her? Let me turn this around, why does a director feel he has to resort to such cliches as a man neglecting his house and himself just to show us he has become unhinged by his retirement, the death of his wife and the realization that no one (except little Ngudu) needs him any more, not even the daughter he has neglected for so many years. Do we really need more than two hours of preparation for the ?unvarnished emotional truth' in the form of one of the schmaltziest endings I have seen in recent years? Why didn't the director aim a little higher? Why didn't he try to equal (or better) Bergman's Wild Strawberries? What a shame about all the missed opportunities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a real wonder, and a nice choice by Jack Nicholson. Middle-aged VP suddenly becomes a widower and decides to find a purpose for his existence. It's a road movie, a good one, but--as per the genre--it doesn't really have an important agenda (and may feel rambling to some). Nicely attuned, well-directed piece with small, throwaway bits of comedy that actually convey quite a deal of truth. I felt the movie went to extremes for the sake of a cheap laugh only twice (in the trailer park scene with the neighbors and with Kathy Bates in the hot-tub), but Nicholson's purposefully low-wattage performance is wonderful, and much more complex than at first may seem. Jack is still a little young to be cast as a retired insuranceman in his waning years, but he brings Schmidt to life--he's a three-dimensional man in a one-dimensional world. Refreshing to see movies like this get made in the 21st Century. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing I admire most about `About Schmidt' (or should I say about `Schmidt'?), is the fact that Jack Nicholson is a character you must submerge yourself in as an audience. If you don't, the movie is `boring' or `dull' in the words of other viewers. This is a risk most Hollywood Filmmakers are not willing to take anymore. Jack isn't `bigger than life', or `crazy like a Fox'. His character doesn't grab you by the throat and say `Watch me.' I'm a long way off from Warren's point in life, but there were times when I felt his discontent with his life, his love, and his rapidly diminishing future. Here was a man of average intelligence searching for a way out of a rapidly encroaching darkness and I felt that made him all the more poignant, but certainly not unlikeable. I guess that makes this a good movie, rather than a really great one. Great ones manage to transcend the differences we bring to the theater as an audience, allowing messages and themes to cross all manner of life experiences. Perhaps when a film succeeds in moving only a segment of that audience, it doesn't quite make it into the pantheon of `great' films, or at least one definition of them. So be it. The world needs more `good' films like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this movie to be amazing, it failed to deliver. It was well acted in, but I think the problem was that there was no character development. It's the type of story you would LOVE to hear from an old friend. The kinds of things you would want to hear everything about if you know the characters, but watching it unfold, knowing that it's a movie kind of makes you feel uninterested.e.g. when he looked at his childhood home, I didn't really care that it was a tire shop, but if it was a friend of mine, I'd be hanging on his every word.The ending WAS the slightest bit touching, when you realize just what the smallest things do to other people. I think the whole movie was trying to be based on that. Small actions and wishes do get magnified later.If you had a choice between this and another movie, I'd probably pick the other, but if you have a couple hours to spare, this is NOT a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most extraordinary films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's "About Schmidt" is a beautifully acted, marvelously photographed story of a 66-year old Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson), vice president of Woodman of the World, an insurance center in Omaha, Nebraska. After he retires, he faces another crossroad as his wife of many years dies. Then, with only his RV, he decides to rediscover himself along the way to his daughter's wedding. "About Schmidt" is filled with moments of sadness, irony, and the hardships of everyday life in America. "About Schmidt", although mainly a drama, has moments of laughter too. Many funny moments come from Schmidt's repressed life style when put to the test in contemporary society. Alexander Payne (who previously directed another extraordinary film, "Election") has a perfect way of telling a story that's sentimental, but not sappy, funny and sad, and real, but still worth watching. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The trouble with Schmidt.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>is that he is a throughly boring person. In the entire film, Schmidt never had an interesting conversation with anyone. He contributed nothing to his world, yet he was angry?? Looks like his wife thought he was boring too as she had an affair in earlier life. He rales against the in-laws-to be, but as low as they are, they were involved with life and loving it. His daughter was in the right place for her which he seems to concede at the end.One thing that disturbs me is that the film seems to validate those international charities that no one seems to know where the contributions really go. I admire Nicholson as an actor because I can think of none other who can take a role like this and make it live. If you like his superb acting then you should see The Border and Ironweed. Both of these are complex with personal issues, like Schmidt, but unlike Schmidt, they are engaging. They weren't big box office and maybe thats why other posters did not see them or hear of them, but they are two of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pathetic life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was recommended by a friend. Since I greatly admire Jack Nicholson, I watched it. This film is "great" in the sense that it does an excellent job in illuminating a life. Whether or not you think that life deserved to be illuminated will determine how you feel about this movie. I don't believe that every person's life deserves to be examined. This man, Schmidt, was interesting because Jack portrayed him. In real life, a man this disconnected from everything worthwhile in life would not be someone you would want to know. He was proud of having done a good job at the insurance company, where he was instantly replaceable. He had zero relationship with his wife, who apparently was a pleasant person, a good housekeeper, and something of a control freak. He did not know her, nor she him, though they lived together for over forty years. He had no close friends. He was a selfish person. He shared no part of himself with his daughter and was surprised when she treated his opinions with disdain. How could a person be this unaware? He didn't change one bit in the movie. He sent checks and whiny, self-obsessed letters to an orphan (who may or may not exist, judging from what I've heard about these organizations), and then felt he had done something "meaningful". At least he (dimly) realized that he hadn't been that great a companion for his wife, and made an effort to communicate that, albeit after her death. What a pathetic person, and what a pathetic life. Thank goodness for Kathy Bates or this movie would have been a wasteland. Jack Nicholson is an actor beyond categorization; I consider him something of a national resource, a legend. It's too bad his great talents were wasted here. The writer should go watch a real film, one that truly reflects the total spectrum of human potential, not just the negative, self-pitying, clueless part. How sad! Schmidt never experienced being truly alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A searing critique of America's soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the director/screenwriter made a movie about contemporary American society and the protagonist,Warrn Schmidt, just represented the everyday man trapped in it. Thus the common name Schmidt (smith). This movie has much the same sentiments as FALLING DOWN starring Michael Douglas and AMERICAN BEAUTY starring Kevin Spacy. Although, ABOUT SCHMIDT is much more real and subtle. Although,southern California does look as bleak as FALLING DOWN portrayed. And Nebraska (and many midwest towns)is as bleak as portrayed in ABOUT SCHMIDT.It's a little more Twilight Zony than California. Every character in this movie is looking for intimacy,authenticity and reaching out for connectedness.Emptiness and soulessness surround the characters. From the austere opening scene in Warren's office, to the vapid insincere farewell party to the dreary surroundings and environment of typical small town America. The Dairy Queen scene. The Tires plus franchise plopped on Warren's childhood home scene. The anal retentive milleu of the Midwest has nummbed Warren (the everyday man). His daughter tries to escape this "passive aggresive" uptight,distant, cold ,"Minnesota Nice" phoniness and moves out west to Denver. And the dysfunction is no better. Just louder and more chaotic.Kathy Bates' character(divorced twice) needs intimacy fast. And tries to seduce Warren in the hot-tub after only a few hours of meeting him. His future son-in-law is a con man/loser. Ahhhhhhhh, where's the balance? Where are the "normal" people ? In Tanzania !! Warren finds connectedness a half world away. I don't know, I just think this movie has many layers. But I'm quite sure the directer and screenwriter were saying, " American Society has some definate quirks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>having heard much about this film due to oscar nominations etc, i was sure it was worth of at least one viewing. the most decisive factor of course would have to be that jack nicholson was warren schmidt. this in mind it was hard not to play every other character off jack nicholson. the events and the way in which things transpire, left me in the position of not knowing whether to laugh or cry...example..when warren first decides to foster ndugu is a significant tear jerking moment but then what really throws the audience is the nature of the first letter which warren sends ndugu relating all the frustrating things in his life. the use of ndugu as a medium for warren to explore and get to know himself is an interesting idea. ndugu as a silent witness contrasts very much to characters such as Randall and Roberta Hertzel-roberta who is fantastically portrayed by kathy bates and had me laughing out loud in the cinema! i think the audience can share warren's frustrations with randall and to an extent his daughter. where his daughter is concerned, it is not evidently clear how much a art warren ahs played in his daughters life....brief outburts by jeannie crying that its too late for him to take an interest conflicts wih his high opinion of his daughter and the pedestal he puts her on.his journey, which is more about opening his eyes than anything else is full of pathos and humour. overall a fantastic film and jack nicholson i feel truly did deserve that oscar nomination, the only quibble would have to be the opening scenes which i think are more to do with direction than acting but fail to sustain interest.the woodmen tower block is not very appealing out to traffic noises but thi is later resolved when we see jack nicholson in full swing in retirement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Payne!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this film is a perfectly crafted mixture of Tragedy and Comedy. Both forces pull with equal intensity, and the final emotional result is something altogether new and beautiful. The film depicts and comments on overdue mid-life crises, aging, the concept of family, Midwest life/landscape, pilgrimages, regret, and acceptance (to name a few). But the tone of the film is not grounded in any way. `About Schmidt' lets viewer both laugh and cry at the screen - and this is what makes it so uniquely amazing.One element of the film's beauty, of course, is Jack Nicholson's performance. Jack IS Schmidt, down to the core. And because we all know Nicholson's on and off screen persona so well, he dazzles us all the more. But to put the focus solely on Nicholson's performance, and furthermore to dismiss the film as simply a great opportunity to see Nicholson at his best, would undermine beauty of the film.`About Schmidt' is a film with a great actor who was molded by an equally great director - Alexander Payne. For the most part, Payne has crafted each scene, as well as the overall plot structure, in a slow-paced and reserved manner. But it is this cinematic pacing that makes the film so extraordinarily funny and (at the same time) depressing. What Payne has created, with the HELP of Nicholson, is a film with a distinct `feeling.' If you're in the mood for a specific kind of film - one that is either dramatic or comedic, then this is not the film to watch. `About Schmidt' is simply the superb storytelling of certain kind of tragically humorous life/emotion - and it is beautiful.</fullReview>

It's not that their performances were inadequate, but the material is such DRECK to begin with, "who cares?!?". Any movie that has to rely on so much narration to carry it is a bad sign. Plus the running joke of the letter to his new foster child in Africa not only gets stale very quickly, it's patronizing and in unbelievably bad taste. And Americans wonder why they're hated around the world? Telling a poor, starving, 6 year-old African kid to be happy and appreciate the life he has??? It's a complete insult to viewer intelligence. I was ready to leave much earlier in the film, but thought I should catch Bate's performance. When it finally did arrive, I only needed a few minutes of her obnoxious character to realize I was wasting my time.Painful. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Jack Nicholson gives a superb performance as Warren Schmidt, but you really have to give credit to the other characters as well. The daughter was perfect as was her muddled boyfriend. The woman at the trailer park and of course Howard Hessman were all excellent.Then there is Kathy Bates. She was a sheer delight. I know the younger crowd will say that her brief nude scene was gross, but you have to remember that there aren't very many oppertunities for older women to show any sensuality on the screen. The nudity was tastefully done and accented her character.What I liked most about this movie (besides Jack and Kathy) was that there were no cliche Hollywood resolutions. Warren is still Warren when he returns home, but there is hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You want meaning? Try the dictionary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well?made, well-observed and very melancholy film about Warren, a very ordinary man who has lived his life in well-deserved obscurity in Omaha, Nebraska. The fact that he is played by Jack Nicholson means we go through the film waiting for him to explode, yet, in the end, he doesn't. After 42 years as an actuary (an accountant with a charisma by-pass) Warren slumps into retirement only to have his wife drop dead on him. She had made all the retirement plans, starting with a cross-country tour in a luxury Winnebago mobile home, and he is at a loose end. Wither Warren? He goes to his daughter's wedding in Denver, Colorado, and there's a bit of a story in that, but essentially Warren is bereft. Jack Nicholson's performance as Warren reminded me of his grumpy writer in `As Good as it Gets' but this time he is older, fatter and quieter. But not boring ? Jack is incapable of that. Instead we get a very internal movie ? despite the vast vistas of the mid-west what is put before us is the inner suffering of a man who realises his life is all but over and it has been as boring as bat sh*t. A lifetime of suppressing his feelings has made it difficult for him to express his love for his daughter (nicely played by Hope Davis), and now she is about to marry beneath her (a water-bed salesman). We know that Warren can feel ? his letters to the Tanzanian child he is sponsoring tell us that - but he long ago stopped acting on his feelings and succumbed to routine and his wife's tender care.Alexander Payne (`Election') is from Nebraska and through his direction gives us a sense of time and place, yet the story is a universal one. Perhaps the lesson is, at least if you are under 40, even if you can't get out of that nice safe job in the bank, develop some other real interests, preferably involving real people. Even Warren was a bright young thing once, as we see in his old College photos. (I shudder to think what Jack was like at college). Academy award? Jack's had enough, but Kathy Bates deserves one for stepping into the hot tub with Jack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"spoilettes" (i.e. tiny little spoilers)Indisputable superb acting from Nicholson notwithstanding, I did not enjoy About Schmidt as much as I had looked forward to. As I was watching, I had various thoughts of what the movie wanted to be but when it was over, I was still not sure.It started out treating the subject matter rather sombrely, and losing one's wife shortly after one's retirement is indeed a sombre thing. But then, there was also a bit of Archie Bunker thrown in (for those who remember All In The Family), although this was Bunker at a much higher social scale.Then, it developed into what looks somewhat like a highway movie and as long as we are on that, forgive me if a digress a little by just mentioning that Straight Story is by far the best highway movie ever made and even Nicholson falls a little short of Richard Farnsworth.When wonderful Kathy Bates appears, we seem to be watching a different movie as a results of the way Bates shines, or over-shines. The movie was concluded quite nicely though and I like the way the wedding scene was handled.The movie does have something to say, about lost of one's identity in the sea of human beings, about losing of purpose after retirement, about losing a spouse. But none of these is very deep nor requires very much to say. Maybe that's why the movie tries these different things and moods. At the end, it does attempt to end in a positive note by intimating that some meaning is finally found in an apparently meaningless life. But the way this affirmation is delivered comes across as rather shallow.</fullReview>

If you pay attention to the acting, the aloofness comes from a stiff neck, or so it seems. He looks at a person in turning around his whole body not the head. But what is the film about, where is it getting to? It was advertised as a comedy. Where are the jokes? I only mentioned three scenes where it could laugh, not more. In the middle of the film you feel as if it is already three hours later. This film is about nothing interesting. Some good approaches are not followed. In the end, nothing is to be remembered. Schmidt cries about finally finding a sense in his live, and it took you 2 hours to get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another Jack Nicholson performance that once again reminds us that he's one of the finest American actors that has ever lived. This is the type of role that Nicholson doesn't get to play enough of. He's not loud and over the top as we have seen him countless times but rather playing a desperate man who never really lived hard or left an indelible mark. Schmidt is a character who thinks he's running out of time in life and is not prepared for retirement. The years have sapped most emotion out of him and now he must travel and try to persuade his daughter not to marry some waterbed salesman. Schmidt is uncomfortable being around lively people and this is exactly who his future inlaws are like. The scene where Kathy Bates gets into the hot-tub naked with Schmidt sends him running because he's not accustomed to people being so loose and comfortable. Alexander Payne does a good job of portraying the characters not as yokels but as being just different from who Schmidt is. The closest performance that Nicholson has done before that reminds me of this is "Ironweed". A less subdued character. Schmidt is a desperate man who seems to be trying in a last ditch effort to be important. Anywhere. Interesting and quiet. Don't be surprised if Jack wins another Oscar!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to tell whether Jack Nicholson is actually good in this, or whether he just seems good because he's un-Jack. I think in the end it's a solid performance, but make no mistake, it's VERY hard to get past that familiar face and voice. The rest of the cast is variable; Kathy Bates runs away with the show, and Dermot Mulroney, unrecognizable under his sparse wig and mutton chops, brings dignity and likeability to the character Schmidt despises so much. But Hope Davis barely registers as a presence in her pivotal role, and when she does she comes off as impatient and ugly.As for the movie itself, it's a mixed bag. There's genuine emotion at its heart, and the title character is a complex creation. But it's also meandering in structure (a set-piece in a trailer park is a complete misfire), and the script is curiously flat much of the time. It's sad, but not terribly; and it's funny too, but not terribly. I think too much has been made of Alexander Payne's misanthropy, here and elsewhere; that said, the set decorator must have gone blind searching out the most hideous wallpapers and upholsteries to define these characters. But the movie certainly wants to do more than mock Midwesterners. It's just hard to tell what, exactly. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

This film has gotten some decent, even a few glowing reviews. They must be from those who would pay to see Jack read a phone book. While I admit it would be an interesting prospect, "About Schmidt" is about as enlightening as that would be. The whole of the piece consisted of set-ups that seemed promising, only to disappoint. Jack journeys to Denver to stop his daughter's wedding- here we go-- NOPE!! Nothing remotely interesting happens. Jack meets a quirky Wisconsin couple on the road- could be interesting here- NOPE!! Kathy Bates gives Jack a percodan--here we go- NOPE AGAIN!! Kathy slips into the hot tub in the altogether-maybe something interesting could possibly happen here- SORRY!!!-- Nix, Nada, Nothing remotely interesting yet again.I spent 20 bucks and 2 hours of my life waiting for this movie to begin-- and sadly came away with yet another Hollywood Zero. And here goes the Academy, in their infinite wisdom, giving Jack another "O" nomination- which he deserves about as much as that "As Good as it Gets" piece of crap. Just like the former, he could have pulled this off in his sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, dispassionate tragedy with a career-defining performance by Jack Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a follow-up to the critically acclaimed "Election" and to his scripting of "Jurassic Park III", you could hardly expect a more different movie from writer-director Alexander Payne. Loosely based on Louis Begley's novel but mostly borrowing from an earlier, unproduced script by Payne and his co-writer Jim Taylor, "About Schmidt" is a tragically, relentlessly bleak and desperate portrait of a man at a crossroads from where he's got nowhere to go: newly retired and newly widowed insurance actuary Warren R. Schmidt, whose only links to a life spent working to keep the family afloat are a dysfunctional relationship with a daughter living away who is about to marry a man he doesn't like and a young African boy he sponsors through a childcare organisation to whom he bares his soul open in the letters he mails regularly. Many have billed the film as comedy or satire, but in fact "About Schmidt" is rather the modern-day tragedy of seeing your life waste away and not doing anything to counter it. It's the sort of film that requires a career-defining performance from its lead, and here Payne gives us the exquisite gift of Jack Nicholson at the peak of his art, effectively effacing his larger-than-life persona behind a subtly nuanced portrait of a man mourning his life. "About Schmidt" is neither easy-going nor perfect (you often wonder if it's real poignancy Payne is striving after or if he is being merely cruelly cynical or callous), but the simple fact that the doubt is there makes it one of the most intriguing American films in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's have more such character-driven movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly not your standard Hollywood fare. For a start, the central character is not a pubescent teenager or a comic strip super-hero, but a former insurance man become brutally aware of the fragility - and indeed the futility - of his life. Recently retired, even more recently widowed and awaiting his daughter's wedding to a man he believes to be a nincompoop, 66 year old Warren Schmidt of Omaha, Nebraska is - in the words of one woman he meets on the road with his huge trailer home - "a sad, sad man".As the eponymous loner, Jack Nicholson gives one of the finest performances of his long and distinguished career, a magnificently understated portrayal in which a look, a grimace or a tear conveys so much about his inner torment and deep melancholy. He is supported by a series of finely-observed vignettes, none better than that from Kathy Bates who bravely reveals her less than svelte-like body. There is no simple resolution to Schmidt's dilemma, but he is ultimately given an insight into how even his selfish life has made a difference. Full of pathos and wry humour, great credit then to Louis Begley who authored the original novel and to Alexander Payne who co-wrote the script and directed. We need more character-driven movies like this which reflect life as most of us find it - frequently disappointing but never too late to redeem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with great expectations, I went home very dissapointed . Jack was Jack in this movie, funny at times, weird at times, but he didnt just bring the excitement that he usually does in movies like Easy Rider and A Few good men. The movie tries to be touching with his care for Ndugu the foster child that he signs up to donate $22 dollars a month for, but it reall didn't move me. It has 10 to 15 small laughs in it. Ok for a rental I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Payne did it with "Election", and he's gone to the higher level with this film. A film that mixes comedy, despair and sadness. It never goes for the sentimental, when it's there to be grasped. This film has focused upon Nicholson's understated performance. But it's much more than just that. This is a film that will linger in your mind, and could well end up a U.S small-town classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My vote remains with Alexander Payne's 1999 film "Election"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" could have been so much more but instead follows the course of "American Beauty" as one of the most overrated films in recent history. Alexander Payne created a masterpiece with "Election" in 1999, and so I had high hopes that his direction and Jack Nicholson's talent could propel this film to Oscar glory. Instead, the tone was too subtle and the Warren Schmidt character too unlikeable for me to care much at all.Sure the sponsorship of little orphan Ndugu was touching along with the memorable ending that saved the film, but was it enough? Leaving the theater, I had the feeling that more could have been done with the waterbed salesman son-in-law and the short-lived scenes with Kathy Bates as the hippie-esque Roberta. The relationship with Schimdt's daughter could have been fleshed out a little. Mostly, I wanted to exit the theater feeling sad for this forgotten old man who you'd never miss if he vanished off the face of the Earth. Instead, I just left with thoughts of Ndugu, the orphan we never even see on-screen but whose missing presence presented the only emotion in the film.Jack Nicholson did what he could but not even his miserable existence could make me like Warren Schmidt. I secretly wished that it had been Warren and not his wife that had passed on, perhaps she would have been a more exciting character. Watching paint dry or reading all 6,000 pages of War and Peace would be more entertaining then watching Warren make sense of his final years.Also perplexing is the subtlety of the film which dragged everything out, such a departure from the all-out satire of "Election." Some critics denounced Payne's lack of subtlety with "Election" but too much subtlety is also a bad thing as is evidenced with "About Schimdt." There were some nice moments but this is by no means the best film of the year. Make plans to see "Far From Heaven" if your looking for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson's comedic approach to later years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sometimes indulge in wondering, as I'm sure most people do, if my life has any fundamental meaning or value, whether or not I have ever made a real difference, etc etc and other such quasi-philosophical ramblings. It is the story of such internal soliloquy that makes up the substance ? padded out by Jack Nicholson for almost every frame of this not insubstantial movie - of what could have been a remarkable tale of self-examination and self-realisation. Playing a wittery old man certainly might be a timely challenge for Nicholson, but the question remains, in spite of plaudits for his performance, of whether he is really up to it.(Contains some plot spoilers): Schmidt (Nicholson) retires honourably as vice president of an insurance firm. The bleak, wintry cityscape of high rise buildings that opens the movie, a sort of respectable but unenviably mediocre world that any right-minded child would aspire to rise above one day, is a perfect metaphor for the emptiness of the central character's existence. He finds his age and wisdom is politely discarded, that no-one really seems to care what he thinks, and life just goes on from day to day as he tolerates his wife ? `an elderly woman living in his house'. When his wife dies suddenly, that is the first of his wake up calls as to the pointlessness of his own life. After deciding, retrospectively, that he loves her, he discovers she was unfaithful to him. A series of incidents confirms that he is ?surplus to requirements', except perhaps to write cheques for his daughter's wedding to a man of whom he disapproves intensely. The final sugar-sweet ending is predictable, even if delivered with a certain flourish, and aspires to be far more deep and meaningful than it is. Proceedings are only momentarily enlivened by the flash of (54yr old) Kathy Bates' pendulous bosoms when, as the twice-divorced and highly-sexed mother of the prospective son-in-law, she romps naked into a hot-tub to flirt with the flabbergasted Schmidt.The film could perhaps have been more successful if a talented unknown had played the lead. We are too used to Nicholson playing Nicholson ? either mad, bad, or heavily tongue in cheek. This reviewer felt he was a little too large for the part, although many, especially American, audiences may find that the small restraint he at least manages to show somehow marks his performance as ?understated.' It was still a good movie ? I was just rather underwhelmed.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson stars as the newly retired Warren Schmidt, facing his retirement with the knowledge that he has a 'seventy three percent chance of dying in the next nine years', gleaned from his boring job as an actuary. Desperate to seek a sense of worth that has been missing from his monotonous existence, he sponsors a Tanzanian child and spills his heart in series of rambling letters.

Unfortunately, Nicholson lacks a strong supporting character to play off, leaving him dramatically isolated which he shouldn't be, rather than emotionally isolated, which he should be. Having started promisingly, the plot seems to fizzle out halfway through, leaving a great deal of dramatic potential unexplored for the sake of of lugubrious meanderings. Furthermore, the emotional climax at the end connected on an intellectual level, but failed to wrench the audience as it needed if it were to be a truly moving and poignant film.Nevertheless About Schmidt is a well-crafted piece with some fine acting and many entertaining moments, but it needed to be about someone else too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems to appeal to "elites." Those who think of America as flyover country between New York &amp; Los Angeles. Nicholson's character (Warren Scmidt) has no depth, no contributions be they to work, family, or friends. The rest of the characters in the movie are much the same; characatures of people rather than portraits of actual people in America's heartland. Sadly, the movie mimics its characters. It's neither comedy nor drama nor is the viewer left with any clear picture of what it is intended to be.About Schmidt is an attempt to portray one dimensional characters in a three dimensional medium. It fails miserably. With changes it could have been either a fine drama or a hilarious comedy. Sadly, it was neither.A waste of talent, time, and money making this film; don't waste yours viewing it.</fullReview>

I retired three years ago and thank my lucky stars my life and career went along a different path than Warren's. My hat's off to Jack for taking on a role where he doesn't act crazed or sinister. His portrayal of a man facing the latter years of his life was great. The story, at the end, brought tears to our eyes. This movie was not made for the MTV or action-movie fans.

		<shortDescription>Who gives a Schmidt?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm afraid I'm getting rather tired of this new style of movie making where we forgo plot and character for director and actor. It doesn't matter that the story is so full of inconsistencies it had me giving my head a shake. Once you have achieved star status as an actor or director then your work becomes about you, rather than the story you are telling your audience. This movie is about Jack Nicholson the way Signs is about M. Night Shyamalan. So what ends up happening is the majority of movie goers (at least most of the people in attendance at the theatre I was in) already like the movie before they have seen it. We were told "wait until you see Jack Nicholson play someone his own age". The only scene that totally worked for me, where I didn't see "Jack Nicholson acting his age" but actually felt something for the man who lost his wife and realized he missed the comfort of routine and comfort of his wife's presence, was when he was putting her face cream on his face in heartbreaking urgency. Oddly enough however, the audience found this hysterical. "Oh, look. Jack's doing something funny."The director used the usual cliches about a man who retires - return to the office and find you're not needed. Really? Gee, I thought they'd give him another job; the man who loses his wife and is suddenly on his own - messy kitchen, clothes everywhere as if that's a given when you're suddenly on your own; as if there is no man of any intelligence who hasn't got the ability to clean up or pick up after himself. The argument of course is that he's gone into a mild depression but as a director, why not stretch yourself and come up with a different way, maybe even a symbolic way, to show us Schmidt's inner self. Messy kitchen and a pile of dirty clothes ain't art.Kathy Bates, one of the finest actors ever to grace the screen, was also given a paint-by-numbers character and handed the usual "schock schlock stock" dialogue to go with it - orgasms, breast feeding, cursing and nudity. Puh-leeze.About Schmidt is about Jack and Kathy. That's fine if that's all you want. If you want more, then watch "The Last Detail" or "As Good As It Gets" for not-just-Jack and "Misery", "Dolores Claiborne" or "Fried Green Tomatoes" for not-just-Kathy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one works! A little life under microscope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the previews for About Schmidt, the music of American Beauty was used. Actually, though, the film calls to mind something a little different: The Graduate. We meet a man, who is leaving his essential institution, and wades through time unsure what the heck he wants to do. Finally, he finds purpose in traveling cross-country to connect with a girl and try to stop a marriage. I wish FRIDA had been done at this pace, with this kind of small time frame and small moments. I DIDN'T find About Schmidt condescending. I thought it sad, but not spiteful. There was some reviewer who really said it, that the film looks at a normal man's life through a MICROSCOPE, through small facial motions, little questions. The most telling moment in the whole film perhaps is when Schmidt is having dinner in the trailer park with the couple who asks for a picture of his daughter: he has none, no photos at all, but he laughs it off with a joke about his age. You don't need some huge burst of music to get the sense that this man is lost, even while struggling. The family relations are so much more real to me than the shrill performances of Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey: whereas that movie FELT scripted, this feels very organic. Again, the majority of what needs to be said never gets there. All we have to really know this guy is through his letters to a 6-yr. old African child, and these moments are really the most poignant in the film. I CONNECTED with Schmidt, and what's most telling is that HE couldn't connect with anyone, much perhaps like Ben Braddock back all those years ago. (Come to think of it, does anyone think Hoffman could have done this role?) One of the best films of 2003, and even if you HATE it, you WILL be talking about it! ****</fullReview>

And because the buzz about the movie was so good, I thought I was going to see a interesting film about a retired man struggling through an idenity crisis. What a guy was a simple story about a man who, at the end, doesn't seem any different then what he was at the beginning of the movie.However, I will say that Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates were amazing, but what else do you expect from the two of them. There isn't really a need to explain the greatness of Nicholson, because it just goes unsaid. However, Kathy Bates, having only been in the film for about 10 or 15 minutes, totally captures the audience. Her part could have been played down, but because of the powerhouse of an actor she is, she took the audience on a wild ride, from cursing to boobies to bad hats. And not once did you take your eyes off of her.Nicholson and Bates deserve every award they get for "About Schmidt", but the rest of the team behind the film needs to rethink a few things before putting out a film that goes nowehere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Schmidt: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We meet Warren R. Schmidt as he's sitting in his office, briefcase in hand, staring at the clock. When 5:00 finally comes, he leaves and shuts off his light. He is now officially a retired man. He's not exactly the happiest man in the world: he and his wife aren't exactly best of friends, he got taken over by someone forty years younger than he, and he's not super-friendly with his daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis). And he's not happy about her choice of husband: Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney), a mullet-wearing `dude' who works in a waterbed store.Schmidt's wife Helen (June Squibb) suddenly dies, and he realizes how much he took for granted. He wants to do something with his life, so he sponsors a child in Africa named Udugu and goes on a road trip in a Winnebago to ruin his daughter's wedding.Jack Nicholson, who plays Schmidt, is perfectly cast (against his earlier work). He's somewhat of a cynic and his facial expressions (that don't change, just like a certain Mr. Clint Eastwood) sometimes even seemed sinister, even though his character didn't support that. However, Jack Nicholson can't stop being Jack Nicholson. I expected him to come out and say, `And what do you expect me to do about it?' I'm not saying he wasn't good. His performance was extremely good, and he showed emotion, though not physically. I could just tell that he was giving his all into the role.However, I didn't feel very emotionally attached to the main character. Sure, I felt with him (like all good movies should do), but I didn't feel like I was going along for a ride with him. I could, however, tell that director Alexander Payne put a lot of symbolism, such as Schmidt liked driving his Winnebago because he was looking down on people, making him feel important. However, when the horses came, it made him feel caged up again.The pace was slow but sure. New Line, who released the film, knew that the majority of people who they appeal to (they did the Austin Powers and Lord of the Rings series) would not like it, so they could do whatever they wanted in it. So they deliberately paced is slowly, but it didn't drag down the proceedings. In some ways, this movie reminded me of Ghost World, because Schmidt is slowly seeing that his world he loved is falling to shambles. He went to visit his home where he lived before, but, to keep the secret and surprise, it wasn't there. He couldn't bear to, after his wife's passing, see more of his life go away, so he has to keep his daughter.About Schmidt was in two parts: one of him coping with the loss and the second of going to his daughter's wedding. The music was gentle but brought out the mood. Sometimes the score was absent, improving the scene more. The opening camera angles were very impressive; I liked them a lot. It seemed like how the scenes were cut were sharp and quick, but worked well with the subject matter.Possibly the best, and worst, part of the film is Kathy Bates. She's Randall's mother, and she is quite good. However, as you've probably heard by now, she has a nude scene. Brrr? Thankfully, it's brief. She had outrageous costumes which added to her (barely developed) character.The deeper meaning of About Schmidt is to do the best you can in life. Schmidt didn't, and he felt unused and insignificant. The end had something happen that really made him think about himself. You can look at your life in two ways: either you didn't do all you wanted to or you did everything you could. Schmidt did the former, but didn't even think about the latter. The ending, by the way, is quite nice.The movie is played as a drama, but it had its funny moments. Most were about Schmidt's quirks, but a few were sight gags and slapstick. It was used, successfully, to lighten the mood. So, About Schmidt is a touching, if emotionally lacking, film about life.My rating: 7/10Rated R for some language and brief nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual, Hollywood can't make a film without putting in the trash it is so famous for. Do we really need to see and hear Schmidt urinating? Does inserting the periodic "F" word really enhance the film? Do we really need to see Nicholson's face (and other body parts) up so close and so often? You can count the pimples, wrinkles, and whiskers. I didn't see that he had much 'acting' to do...just be in front of the close-up cameras and look sad. If you really want to see ugly people doing mundane nothings in a depressing environment, then this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I found this movie hysterical and moving at points the obvious thing that a movie with this certain plot line necessarily has to have is a change in the character that it is portraying. You rarely see any change in Schmidt throughout the movie, and when he does temporarily go out on a limb with his beliefs, he regrets it later making this movie have a less profound message. Although I found the plot fairly drab and monotonous I found the acting to be superb. I found Kathy Bates to be wonderful in her hysterical role which is deserving of Best Actress/Supporting Actress. Being a fairly bad year for the cinema this was one of the better movies of the year. 6.5/10</fullReview>

These are major motion pictures we're talking about, FCOL (for cryin' out loud)! If you can't write at least a semi-poignant ending, GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS!

They showed only the least attractive and least modern side of Omaha. It is much bigger, brighter and more attractive than it was portrayed. It appeared that they deliberately did not do Omaha justice.Same goes for Denver. As much as I hate driving in Denver, it is a beautiful city and the movie makes it look like a slum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack grows up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it would seem to be a major disgrace to cast the hippest and most eccentric geriatric in cinema to portray a man of such blandness and inconsequence, it comes off as inspired casting here. This is a part that cries out against type. Had someone undistinguished played the part, such as a modern day Wally Cox or say, Tom Hanks in twenty years, the edge that is Schmidt's general malaise, and the contempt he feels for his failings in life would not have been profoundly prevalent in this film. And they should be. This is thankfully not "Forrest Gump 2" or any of the other usual Hollywood fare with the glossed over 'life is a box of chocolates" philosophy. Yes, this film is about the acceptance that being a nice person is not a sign of being bland, but a sign of having a great deal of character and value in the world. But it is also about the unsettling edge and sense of denial that lives in each of us, and the desperate need to be important to somebody or some thing. Nicholson thankfully does not ham things up with his usual robust ticks of being simultaneously cocky and charming. There is a lot of anger in the character of Warren Schmidt, but Jack wisely doesn't show it. This character can't since he isn't even really aware of it. He takes his own feelings of mediocrity out on others, like his lackluster son-in-law and "the old lady sleeping in bed next to him" (his wife).I've heard that the book on which this film is based took place in Manhattan. It's hard for me to imagine what this film would have been like in such a setting. Alexander Payne, who is a native of Omaha, beautifully captures the generic banality of Middle America. If Schmidt lived in a "hip" city like Manhattan, he would be coiled up in venom. It is important that he is so ensconced in his generic surroundings, that he can't recognize the depths of his angst. Setting Warren Schmidt in Manhattan would sort of be like FIVE EASY PIECES thirty years later. He'd be a man who had run away from the exceptional qualities within him, and was now full of regrets. We've seen that sort of story before. Perhaps this film is a "what if" FIVE EASY PIECES, with Jack as a man who never knew he had any exceptional qualities to begin with. Spending one's life in a place where the sense of something sacred or beautiful is reduced to church socials and little figurines that one buys on the Home Shopping Network, will very likely create a malaise of some sort eventually. To rebel against that in an old-aged rant of fury would be pure Hollywood: the familiar Jack the Rebel. While it is the role of youth to rant against the mediocrity that stagnates our society and to take a stand against it, it is the mark of maturity to grow from being against everything to being about something. One only needs to open their eyes and look deep within oneself and around oneself in order to find out what they are about. Our daily lives and our cities may not be exceptional, but we as human beings can be. If we can just forgive the flaws within ourselves, the rest is easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"About" perfect; "Schmidt" happens to Jack! The Best Film of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002) **** Jack Nicholson, Hope Davis, Dermot Mulroney, Kathy Bates, June Squibb, Howard Hesseman, Len Cariou. Nicholson gives a career high performance as Warren Schmidt, a recently retired life insurance actuary from Omaha, Nebraska who comes to an emotional crossroads in his life when his wife suddenly dies and his only daughter is about to marry a complete moron. Schmidt seeks some meaning for his existence and goes on a literal and metaphorical road trip, Winnebago at the helm, across America as he ventures to the wedding ceremony accruing while realizing that life will always take care of itself even if one doesn't know what will become of themselves (no truer thought has ever been realized quite comically nor clearly as it does here). Filmmaker Alexander Payne (who adapted Louis Begley's novel with his longtime collaborator Jim Taylor) shrewdly mixes the mundane with the meaningful in an acrid slice of Americana that threatens to curdle as it nurtures along its merrily demented way. Nicholson smartly downplays the easily caricatured character it could've been by ditching his waycool persona and physically resembles a shrugged shoulder replete with bad combover and easily to his 12th Academy Award nomination and possibly 4th win. Immersing himself wholeheartedly and - who expected, quite poignantly - brilliantly; one of the finest interpretations ever displayed in cinematic history (and that's saying something for this icon's canon of film work!) Bates is a riot as his in-law to be who has no qualms about herself - a complete 180 from Nicholson's impression - and Mulroney lets the mullet do all the work smartly. Davis manages the tightrope of good daughter and angry child within allowing her character's seams to show at her worst and deep down loves her estranged father. So far the year's best film and one I can humbly add has my surname in the title!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have very mixed feelings about this social satire. Jack Nicholson sure displays phenomenal acting talent in his Warren Schmidt role. At long last, he's actually acting his age, and this role suits him to a tee! But I find the story hard to buy. Nicholson's character is well crafted, but the rest of the characters seem to be Director Alexander Payne's intent at shoving bold ideas for laughter. If Payne has the motive of showing Randall's little happy community to be the reason for attracting Jeannie's fervent desires to become part of it, it fails. The characters' absurdities override their spiritual beauty! Except for the Warren character, one is positioned to laugh at the characters than to feel their emotions. Here's a man, retiring at 66 from his high-position at the Omaha insurance company, basically applauded by his equally old colleagues, yet is such a ridiculously pathetic, unloved and lonely guy! If it isn't for Jack Nicholson's awesome acting (definitely Oscar worthy performance!) and the obviously and astonishingly distasteful draw on human flaws and sociopolitical boldness to humor the moviegoers, I'd say, it's one tale that's hard to swallow and unemotionally dull to watch. I thought the ending was a wee bit too weirdly simplistic. Here's a man who stubbornly rejects all reasoning, and as an absolutely tragic bickering fool, so suddenly gets over-emotional over the contents of ONE mail-contents. It's difficult for me to accept his bittersweet redemption! Hey, am still wondering what makes Kathy Bates so bold as to appear in her raw birthday suit! Poor gal, it'd be tough to try to erase her new and shocking iconic image! My favorite scene is watching Schmidt having his rough night on the waterbed! And Nicholson's best facial expressions are exhibited with Roberta's grand entrance into the tub!My rating: B+ (for the fact that I did enjoy Nicholson's extraordinary performance!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good film, if a bit of a disappointment coming from alex payne, who did 1999's best film "Election," an hilarious and truthful satire. Payne also tries to make this film funny, and parts of it are, but the humor seems to detract from the emotional element of the film. Nicholson plays Schmidt, a respected businessman who has just retired, who goes on a cross-country trip in his RV to his daughter (Hope Davis) wedding. Along the way, he has some funny adventures and learns a little something about blah, blah, blah.There are some excellent bits. Like the painfully embarrasing scene where Nicholson tries to hit on a younger (probably in her 50's) married woman when her husband goes off to get beer. And the scene where Jack talks about how his wife instructs him to urinate. And the scenes at the beginning when Jack continues to go into the office after he's quit. oh, and dylan mcdermont's funny performance. But I'm not sure that it all really adds up to much. The "funny" scenes are interspersed between the "emotional" scenes and they don't seem to mix as well as they did in "Election." Also, some of the humor isn't that funny, it just seems to be in there to break up too many intense scenes being put together. Payne does seem to care about the subject of growing old, moving on in life, letting go, the difficulties associated with all this, etc. but possibly he doesn't trust himself enough to do it straight, so he includes some out of left-field comedy like the what will probably become infamous hot tub scene. maybe he shouldn't trust himself, actually, aside from these bits the film is quite conventional. Still, overall it's probably worth seeing. There are good performances and well-developed characters, and more to recommend than to take away from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I seen such a film with such little distance between point A and point B, but take so darn long to get there. The movie in a nutshell is pointless. All it is, is Jack moaning about how pointless his life has been. How he has never done anything worth anything. Well, this is just so easy to solve it's sad. If you want to do something with your life then do it. If you want your life to mean something then do something that has some meaning. But what does Jack do? He moans and groans for two straight hours and pretty much doesn't do one darn thing. Then, the movie just ends with him clicking into the fact that he helped out his sponsored child, thus his life meant something, but you knew this from the get go so you sit there and say, "I went threw all that nothing just to get an ending that was given to me at the start of the film?" So, the film is quite literally nothing. Nothing happens. It has no plot, no real story, no point, and well, nothing. The only reason I gave it a six was because it was so bland that nothing bad happened in it. This film is limbo. I just hope when I get that old I will actually do something to fill my time, like start writing again. Like really, Jack, just do something, anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I really enjoy about this film is that the overall film produces a large feeling of hopelessness within you -- a hopelessness that is very real, very true, very genuine, and such a very human experience. But what this film does is not simply crush and destroy your hope for the future, but it demonstrates that in the face of hopelessness there is still... Hope? Or should I say -- moments of pleasure, moments of joy, and small, little events that make life worth living. The film, from the beginning to the end, shows such a great unraveling of a life, such a great shedding of the skin -- you begin to understand what it means to be a human being (and not a fantastical character, but rather just an ordinary human). It is a borderline spiritual event: with 'About Schmidt' we all realize the hopelessness of life, and shed the old skin that we had worn, and realize that our hopes and our dreams should lie in a new direction. We also learn that we should step back and analyze the world for what it is, as we see that Schmidt cannot control his life the way that we wanted to, and as we see that Schmidt is overlooked, we learn a lesson: happiness will always have to come from within, and our hopes can never be unrealistic.A great film with a great lesson in it -- brutally honest. If you enjoyed this film, or would like to see more like it, I would recommend Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I thought this was a pretty boring movie. That was until I started seeing a deeper vision, something like Van Sant's "Elephant". Schmidt had no life: he worked 9-5 until retirement in a stuffy mono-chrome windowless office (spoiler: interestingly, when he returns to the office to visit the 'new guy', the office is colorfully well-lit and has large windows). He is 66, old and ugly. His wife is old and ugly. He has given his life to a corporation, and got only money in return; he realizes that he got a raw deal. As Schmidt sinks in deeper into his in-laws' family, we see through his eyes the horror of their shallow existence: the schmuck son-in-law and hopelessly plebian parents and relatives with their out-stretched hands for Schmidt's money. To add insult to injury, his own daughter renounces her adherence to him and has become one of Them. As the film unfolds, we see that Schmidt is powerless against the forces of fate, and can only sit and watch the vulgarity. The film is an excellent commentary on modern world, how ordinary and immutable our lives have become, with juxtaposed subtlety and vulgarity at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't particularly enjoy this movie because I wanted it to get up and go but it merely went away. I take it as a depressing, cynical, condescending look at a retired insurance actuary's life in retirement. It was an indictment of midwestern life, its people, and the way they act. This aspect was done much better in "Fargo". In the first place, Schmidt was a simpleton, a dolt who couldn't comb his own hair - not particularly accurate for the actuaries I've known who are generally brilliant people. The gloomy panning of the Omaha skyline is a not too subtle cheap shot at the midwest, as is the entire movie and its characters. The in-law family and the wedding scene were actually quite accurate in depicting the goofiness some people and families display at functions in everyday life. It wasn't particularly interesting to watch such people and I wonder if the makers of this film understand that we see movies to be entertained, not bored by the underbelly of society. This movie wants to say that Schmidt is a hopeless dolt who cannot handle his retirement and his life and whose emotions are so bottled up that it looks like he's ready to explode at any minute. Is this enjoyable, instructive, meaningful, entertaining? I think of it as just another pretentious attempt to create a classic of filmdom while managing to bore the Hell out of the majority of us viewers. Consider the bonus material on the DVD. There are long strings of text as preambles to the outtakes that we have to wade through before viewing them. A simple suggestion to the director - how about you telling us about each outtake with your voice instead of forcing us to read the drivel that precedes them? Yes, we're forced to read that material and we're forced to think about Schmidt's dilemma, not all bad, but it is so utterly depressing in the process that on balance we are not stimulated or entertained and if we don't have either of those we are not pleased with the experience. Giving it a rating of 6 is very generous.</fullReview>

A wonderful blend of off-kilter stereotypes, keen satire, plaintive reflection, and bittersweet humor, "About Schmidt" will drive like a dagger through the hearts of many while soaring over the heads of others. How you react to the film will tell you more about yourself than about "...Schmidt". An excellent wry meditation on the meaningful meaninglessness of one man's life which will resonate most with more mature audiences. (B+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson carries it from start to finish and makes it significantly better than it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Schmidt is in his mid-sixties and has recently retired from his long service employment with one of the leading insurance companies in Nebraska. On retirement though he finds himself with little to do and unsure of how he now fits into the world. His wife is little more than an old woman that lives with him, his job no longer seems to have had any purpose and the distance he feels from his family is intense. When his wife suddenly passes away, Schmidt finds himself at a loose end before deciding to head to see his daughter in his new Winnebago.The plot summary does make it sound like a rather obvious affair and I suppose in a way that is just what it is. The film looks at old age through the rather aimless eyes of Warren Schmidt and in doing so produces a funny and touching story that doesn't really force a "message" down the viewers throat even if that does produce the feeling that it didn't go anywhere. The narrative is rather rambling but it held my attention because I found each section interesting or comic and generally it all held together. The script could have been stronger though because I felt it was weakened by the way it tended to look down on all its characters rather than love and embrace them despite their faults. This did take away from how much of a character piece the film could be but, fortunately, it plays its one big trump card from start to finish.This card is a Jack Nicholson performance that surprised me throughout. I have so used to seeing him living his playboy personae in films and the Oscars that to actually catch him acting was a pleasant surprise. He delivers a contained and restrained performance that holds the entire story together because so much of it is played out in his face and body language. As a result the support cast is very much just that. Bates is OK, Davis is a nice find while Mulroney is well cast and funny and Hesseman is good in a tiny role. However Payne knows where his strength lies and the film focuses on Nicholson as a result.Overall then a comic and touching wander through old age. It isn't perfect by any means but luckily a wonderful performance from Jack Nicholson covers over the cracks and makes the whole thing better than it could have been.</fullReview>

So I rented it, prepared to get my heart ripped in two. As it started, I was wondering when it was gonna get good, and then his wife dies. OK so it was sad, but not at all heart shredding. From then on this movie was going downhill and fast! Half the movie was about him having nothing to do but travel the country. Then this wedding, women naked, by now I was barely paying attention. It sucked so bad I missed the rest and woke up as the credits were coming to an end. To sum it up, the movie sucked, but I gotta give Jack Nicholson some credit, he did a descent job. My advice, run as far away from this failure of a movie as you can.</fullReview>

This movie deserves to be in the two dollar bin at your local Wal - Mart . It sucks . It's wretched . It's boring . It has no redeeming value .

So I hope that my message gets out to those that intend to watch a movie and might wonder if " About Schmidt " is a worthwhile rental . No , it's not . Don't be fooled by the people who say that this movie is " The Best Movie Ever Created " . Goodness knows where these comments come from . I suspect that some insidious force produces these spurious opinions in order to fool the public into thinking that a sow's ear is , in fact , a silk purse . And I'm not alone .

		<shortDescription>Must be watched carefully.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film must be watched very carefully. If you're not paying enough attention to it, you would miss it (some did). It's in the frames, the atmosphere, the tiny details, the situations, the acting, everything. But it's not that obvious, unless you enter that world. Simple story? Sure. Life is simple. So is great art. All in all, "About Schmidt" is a really great film. Bitter humor, all-pervading lie, the infinite sadness of loneliness and failure, sincere egoism, everyday dullness, desperate and quiet hope - this is life, and in a non-blatant, nor melodramatic manner. But you're going to weep (and smile) at the ending (I did!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curious Character Study Propelled By Brilliant Nicholson Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" is about as humble, low-key, and unpretentious as films come, and mostly succeeds strictly as a character study of confused, reflective senior living, in the form of the ordinary Warren Schmidt, played with brilliance and compassion by the always great Jack Nicholson. The entire premise involves the goings and reflections of Schmidt, in a narrative where he is frequently addressing letters of wisdom and candidness to a naive six year old Tanzanian boy, disclosing practically every detail of his recent life. There's no way around it, if you are not interested in learning about the life of a common, tamed man (ironically played by Jack Nicholson, as eccentric and zany as they come), then there is absolutely nothing you can appreciate from this film, as it is strictly an exploration of "the values of life discovered much too late" and there are hardly any major developments or surprises to be found here. While it works harmoniously in this department, from someone who enjoys a good character study, I found the premise and the dialogue to be too simple, too practical, and missing a much needed conflict (unless you can argue that Schmidt's "self discovery" is a conflict of redemption for all of his many wasted years and everything he has- including his defiant and unappreciative daughter). Nicholson, as usual, gets completely lost in this character, and he is always very absorbing and convincing, even playing perhaps the antithesis of his casual "wild" role. The story is engaging enough, with Schmidt, after suddenly losing his life and retiring from his lowly job, searching for all of the values and experiences in life he has neglected for the past forty years, in reflecting and revisiting the happiness he once possessed early on in life, yet due to many circumstances, has completely forgotten about these values of his existence. In addition, he tries to rekindle his estranged relationship with his daughter, Jeannie, and perhaps even prevent her from marrying a man who is, well, not "up to snub" for her, as he incites. The scenery of the countryside of the midwest is gorgeous, breathtaking, and perfectly appropriate for this theme of solitude and rediscovery which defines this film. "About Schmidt"'s few detractions come from its rather dull screenplay, queer dialogue, and wandering tone: a blend of such serious drama and such raunchy comedy (e.g. the hot tub scene between Nicholson and Bates, the motorhome mishap, etc.) appears very odd in such a film as this. However, the engaging, delightful, and compassionate performances of Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates, as well as some absorbing music, breathtaking scenery, and engaging plot, make "About Schmidt" something about worth seeing, particularly if you enjoy a vivid character study. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but has everyone's idea of a good film completely changed? Why did people like this movie?! And why was it even considered for an Oscar?! I'll tell you why! It's because of two main reason: A, a previous oscar winner starred in it. And B, (the more important of the two) it came out late in the year! I'm starting to wonder whether I should stop watching Jack Nicholson movies. First "The Pledge" and now this! Jack, get your stuff together! I would hate to have to say this AGAIN about ANOTHER movie! Although I must say, I do like the odd part here and there (absolutely NOT the hot tub scene). Like the parts when he's writing (or narrating) to his foreign foster child. Or when he's on top of his motor-home, looking at the stars, with the blanket, and speaking to his wife. However, as the film went on I kept asking myself: "Where is this going?" Not once could I answer that! So, if someone is reading this now, and hasn't seen the film....get a restraining order from this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'About Schmidt' starring Jack Nicholson. This is a one-word movie, `Crap!' It might be funny to someone somewhere, but I failed to see the fun. The movie depicts a miserable senior who faces nothing but a miserable existence. He retires, finds out he is nothing without his job as an actuarial for an insurance company. His wife falls over dead. His daughter hates him and wants nothing to do with him; all the while she is planning to marry into a family of neurotic misfits. It's absolute crap for a man of his talent. I checked out the deleted scenes on the DVD to see if the editing cut too much of the movie. I'm sad to say the editor didn't cut enough! Had the editor cut all he should have, the movie would be the same length as the trailer. The only bright spots in the movie were the few scenes with Howard Hesseman, the discussion about the cheap casket and Kathy Bates rendition of her sexuality. Many very good actors have died shortly after their final ghastly performance. I can only wonder if Mr. Nicholson is ill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Schmidt is at best an opportunity lost and a disappointment on at last two counts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER-----SPOILER------SPOILERAbout Schmidt is a serious drama about life's big events; marriage, retirement, death and social contribution. Warren Schmidt [Jack Nicholson] has turned 65 years old and just retired; he immediately realizes [surprise, surprise] that he left his life at the office and has not a clue of what comes next. Tragedy soon strikes the Schmidt home and Warren realizes that he's got to get a life. He initially sees his daughter Jeannie [Hope Davis] as the solution, but that works only for 1-2 meals. Warren decides to jump in the RV and meanders around Nebraska and Kansas looking for the meaning of life. After what seems like an eternity [yet only 125 minutes later] he arrives in Denver for Jeannie' wedding where he meets her future in-laws. Enter the 2002 version of TV's Adams Family led by matriarch Roberta [Kathy Bates]. Warren barely survives the wedding and, upon returning to Omaha, finds his calling in a letter from Africa. `Fini'. About Schmidt is at best an opportunity lost and a disappointment on at last two counts. First, in an effort to attract the mass market, the previews cherry pick several humorous scenes to represent the movie as a comedy, nothing could be further from the truth. Second, and far more serious, the real themes of the movie exceed the technical reach of filmmakers. Any good film uses the cinematic tools of script, dialogue, scenes, sets, plot, story line and action [motion] to tell a story. Unable to use these tools, the message is conveyed with a voice-over narration by Schmidt himself; this runs over about 40-50% of the film. Sounds to me more like ?books on tape' than a movie. The story line---such as it is---raises issues of substance, but these are ill developed and don't really come to closure in any meaningful way. About Schmidt does have one bright spot after a dreary first 60+ minutes. Kathy Bates joins the story as the mother of the groom and an aging hippie somewhere between husbands two and three, but who's counting. She adds a desperately needed spark of life to the film and bares all for a lost cause, in the quintessential hot tub scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Warren Schmidt of Jack Nicholson is a man who has lived all his life in a fog. Even as he is ready to retire at the beginning of the film, it appears that life went through him, but he never had a life.Alexander Payne has created a portrait of a mediocre man who, might be living in Omaha, but for all practical purposes, he might be living in Mars!. Does he ever know his wife? Even though they've been married for 42 years, they are at different wave lengths. How about his daughter?. This girl is a selfish creature who only cares about her own wedding plans that might be shattered.Helen Schmidt, Warren's wife, has made a home for her family, but did she ever understand this man? For that matter, did Warren realize that he had a wife and built-in maid all in one? Like in all marriages, there are annoying things that Helen did that Warren resents. She is a typical house wife from the old school and values in an ever changing world. Warren, being in his own world, discovers a dark secret that challenges the happy memory of Helen.It's very hard to conceive this Schmidt without Jack Nicholoson. This might be his greatest achievement of a distinguished career. He is pure perfection as this man who goes in search of himself and to reconnect with a daughter that couldn't care less about him. Visiting his daughter's future family, the Herzels, Warren's world collapses around him. After all, he and Helen lived normal lives. Being a guest in Roberta's house proves to be too much for him. Kathy Bates is, without a doubt, right on the money with her portrayal of Roberta Herzel. Just look at her around the dinner table to realize how good an actress she is.The rest of the cast is excellent. Hope Davis as the daughter brings the right amount of selfishness to her Jeannie Schmidt. We have known people like her. Her role is typical of many a bride who wants to have a full wedding from parents like hers. Dermot Mulroney is very effective as the groom. He's as creepy as his hairdo. He and Jeannie will probably end up in divorce in a few years, but she will have the album, the videos and the party to remember her fifteen minutes of fame in Denver.For Jack Nicholson watchers, just wait for the last sequence of the film after he gets home to understand we are watching is a lesson in acting. Warren Schmidt at last connects with reality in a manner that only this great actor only could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember reading, when this film was released, that the writer on whose novel it was based, Louis Begley, thought the screen adaptation was a good job.Either Mr. Begley had been paid extraordinarily well for the rights to his book, or he was just lying.It's not that this is a bad film. Not at all! It's quite well-done. But any resemblance between this film and the novel on which it was based is coincidental.Mr. Begley really ought to be permitted to sell screen rights to his book a second time -- the story he penned has never been made into a movie! The tone, the social class of the characters depicted, the relationships among the characters -- all are vastly different in book and film.To me, the best adaptations are those that the viewer finds recognizable -- familiar -- rewarding because of some proximity between one's separate experiences as reader and as film-goer.But "About Schmidt" was not about Schmidt. It was about some other guy. An interesting guy; funny guy. A guy that poignant things happened to. But not Schmidt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of focus in potentially fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt starts out promisingly but quickly loses focus from the issues it establishes early in the film - specifically, Nicholson dealing with retirement and the sudden death of his wife. There's so much more to say about aging and loss, but this film digresses from its initial premise before barely touching on it.The dramatic device of Nicholson corresponding with a boy he's sponsoring through a charitable organization is wholly unconvincing. There's no way a sponsor would share such adult and personal information with a six-year old from Africa.The second half of the film is an unwitty variation on Father of the Bride, which leads one to ask, what is this film really trying to say?Nicholson gives a highly sympathetic performance, but good scripts are difficult to come by nowadays even for our finest actors. For a truly great film about aging and loss, look no further than Leo McCarey's 1937 masterpiece Make Way for Tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew I was going to dislike this, as I have a real distaste for Alexander Payne's films, so I probably should have just skipped it. But I had a chance to see it for free, so I did. And ugh. It is such an ugly and cynical movie, with obvious themes that, if a better writer or director had handled them, wouldn't have seemed nearly so trite. It is in vogue for critics to claim that certain filmmakers revel in deriding their characters, and it's a criticism that I personally don't like to make, but Payne is one who spends most of the time looking down on the poor saps in his creations. All one has to do to prove that in About Schmidt is to point out Dermot Mulroney. Payne's idea of humor is to give him a mullet, and to make sure that the audience can always see the mullet. I'll bet the audience in the theater (and this is the type of film that attracts pseudo-intellectual, semi-yuppies) was cracking up at it. I watched it alone on a television, so all I had was my own screams of horror. And the letters to Ndugu were on a whole other terrible level, as the depth of the `joke' is more complex; these emotional testimonies should really be touching, but instead Payne constantly has to remind us that Schmidt's pains are as insignificant as Schmidt himself. This probably wasn't even Payne's intention, but he is such an inept writer that he shoots himself in the foot with his own poorly judged gag. Well, the one positive thing I can say about the film is that Jack Nicholson finds every shred of humanity in Warren Schmidt that he can. If it succeeds on any emotional level at all, it is because Nicholson is such a great actor. Kathy Bates, however, in a highly celebrated role, is embarrassing. She was Oscar nominated for getting naked. Otherwise, she is just another one-dimensional character for Payne to tease. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know many people will disagree with me, but this didn't seem so much like a movie as it did a photograph, or a 6-panel comic.I should explain that a bit. See, normally in a story, you expect the characters to go somewhere internally, to change in some way. This is what separates 2D characters from 3D characters.Unfortunately, that seemed to be missing from About Schmidt. In fact, the the main character (Schmidt) spent the entire movie trying to get people to change, without success. By the end of the movie, he has simply given up. The major internal change in Schmidt is that he has lowered his expectations, and now no longer expects life to be anything but bad.Of course, there is the part about "adopting" the child, which allows Schmidt to narrate his internal thoughts as the movie progresses. However because his internal exploration is fairly monotonous, the viewer (in this case, me) may finish the movie and be totally confused. Is the message that the only way to find some glint of happiness in life is by sending money to charity? Or that you can do your best, but the people who know you best will never appreciate you? I should note that this confusion was even greater upon viewing the VHS, which ends with an advertisement for the charity shown in the movie. Was the whole thing some kind of conspiracy to induce selflessness?In any case, this movie starts off in a grey mood, and ends in a grey mood. The writers tried to fill the movie with black comedy, but it only serves to make the entire affair more depressing.As for the realism of the characters, perhaps that's true. But the events conspire in such a ridiculously contrived way that it ruins the effect.I'm not usually against sad films, or really dark comedy. But this movie seems to be a one-off attempt at depressing the audience; the shock-flick of sadness, if you will.If you don't know where to look for depressing things in real life, and you want to feel bad, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.IMHO, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very generation-specific film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...A generation of which I'm not a part of (I'm 21). I saw this with my dad, and as we talked about it on the way back home, he was revealing to me all these tiny plot details that I had missed altogether (or couldn't comprehend), not that they amounted to a sensible, well-balanced movie in the end. Yes, after a backlog of coming-of-age films regarding teenagers ("The Breakfast Club," "subUrbia," "Ghost World"), we now have one for seniors, which does nothing but reinforce the tired mantra of life being meaningless."About Schmidt" is the kind of indigestible sappiness that critics and 'The Academy' drool over. When they refer to Jack Nicholson's painfully restrained (I don't care how relevant it was to the character, he was just DULL) performance, they don't refer to it just in relation to the film, but "his sprawling career," trying desperately to justify the 'daring' of his acting chops and the film itself. The supporting cast is a collection of one-dimensional oddities (they don't deserve the privilege of being called 'characters'). Director Alexander Payne, who helmed the hilarious "Election," obviously wanted to do something different, but this is a pathetic instance of a filmmaker going too far in the WRONG direction. "About Schmidt" is playing into the hands of critics for its entire running time (and, granted, it's the type of bleak, empty dramatic portrait that gains high praise for its supposed 'depth'). Not only is it filled with unfunny, unfeeling characters you could care less about, it contains lots of unforgivably cliched symbolism. For instance: Nicholson is camping out on top of his monstrous Winnebago one night, talking up to his deceased wife; when he finishes, a shooting star actually flashes by (followed by Nicholson 'crossing' himself)! Or what about the poor, South-American child he sponsors, leading up to the heavy-handed 'picture' scene at the very end of the movie? Give me a break."About Schmidt" just chugs along with nary a purpose--a remarkably empty film that, in the end, amounts to jack schmidt.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Schmidt was full of it. Filler that is. It was the dullest film I've started watching in ten years.I'm not a Nicholson fan, &amp; Schmidt (that's a beer, right?) didn't help. I recall an understated character prone to explosions in "5 Easy Pieces". Hmmm, here he is again. "I wanted to get the Mini-Winni". And you *did*, Jack.As for the "point" of the "story", 1956's "The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit" developed this theme decades earlier. Joni Mitchell's song "The Arrangement" which sings about a man who "could have been more than a name on the door / on the 33rd floor in the air / More than a credit card, swimming pool in the backyard", makes the same "point" much more movingly in a song that lasts a few minutes. The suburban lifestyle *was* adequately pilloried in the 70s. Then, that 70s generation went on to develop it far beyond the vapid nothingness it represented in those happier, if blinkered, times. Nicholson was part of that generation. He did pretty well at cashing in.No doubt many people who don't like this film see themselves reflected in it just a litte *too* much. But stop and consider that Schmidt pretty much did all the things majoritarian American culture asked of him. Dressed right, lied convincingly, built a good home. He was even a part of the insurance industry, which a great majority of Americans invest heavily in. Is majoritarian American culture, then, life-avoiding ... or is it a facile if uninspiring adaptation to the world full of violence, duplicity and tedium Jarmusch paints in "Dead Man"? "Schmidt" is an easy exercise in mud-tossing. It's easy to criticize existing instutions without a vision of viable alternatives. The roles people have been offered and played faithfully in our culture may well be vapid, but what choices did they have? In failing to address how the options were engineered, "Schmidt" writes a check (for $22 to a foster child, about as magnanimous as the Thompson approach to welfare) that it, like so many films of the 70s era, can't cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maybe its an american thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being somewhat of a nicholson fan (when has he ever given a really bad performance?) I was quite looking forward to this movie - but was thoroughly disappointed. There is not one character in this movie that is worth rooting for. All of the people portrayed are so stereotypical: the failed insurance policy guy, his young and superficially nice replacement, the 'get rich quick' scheming hick, the sex-overloaded elderly woman, the inbred southerner, the pathetic extrovert husband, the nagging wife, the woman who has an affair with the mans best friend, the overly friendly camper..they are all there, and none of them show any depth. (the only non-stereotype person was the daughter...she didn't have any personality trait at ALL) maybe its an american thing, but I have noone on my list of acquaintances that even comes close to one of these people. So I sat there, watching a bunch of loonies playing out a schtick that had nothing to do with real life, or does it? Nicholsons performance was uninspired and there was no heart in it. I realize he coiuldn't put in any of his usual energy because that would not be part of Schmidts personality - but the only thing he conveys with his performance is a feeling of utter boredom with the role and the lines he has to say.summary: the film is money wasted - mine and the producers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Payne's weakest, by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt derails the Payne train I was in. It's certainly admirable in some of its scenes, but it's nothing at all original and it plays its sentimentality a little too much (and sometimes way too much without coming off realistic or very effective, like that last scene). Oh sure, The Descendants and Nebraska were sentimental, but this just feels like it's not doing anything much of worth and so it just comes sort of empty at times. Still, not a bad film, performances are good, but it's exactly the type of sentimental film I usually either don't care about or can't stand. I don't hate it, but I do think it's Payne's weakest film by far and the only one I don't particularly like.</fullReview>

In the movie Up, this takes about 5 minutes, in this movie it takes 60. Now I have to decide if I should waste another 60 minutes to watch the remainder of the movie.The whole point of watching a movie is to be entertained, to laugh, cry, be frightened, thrilled, so far this one has done none of that. This may have just been a movie about me or my dad or my neighbor. Except in that case by chance, something interesting might have happened.Maybe the second half will blow me out of the water, but that's where I have to decide if I should even waste my time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a thought provoking retelling of Charles Dickens 'Christmas Carol'. Just as Dickens critiqued Victorian society this movie does the same with the culture of our country, with Schmidt a stand in for us all. Some thoughts on the women in the picture. None of them seem to have a good place in society. Schmidt has failed his daughter has our society failed all of ours? The movie portrays them as ignored housewives, aging earth mothers, or underemployed perpetual adolescents married to losers. The ghosts of past, present and future. Tiny Tim lives in another country where a small monthly donation from Schmidt can mean the difference between life and death. The movie shows our culture consuming so much while a large part of the rest of the world goes without. Entertaining movie that will stay with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson's finest film performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren R Schmidt has an epiphany only days after his retirement. He's completely wasted the last 66 years of his life.About Schmidt is one of the finest and truest satires I've seen in some time. It comes from director Alexander Payne who previously helmed the sharp and unnervingly accurate teen comedy Election. He brings the exact same intuition to About Schmidt that consistently fired up Election.The haunting portrait of a newly retired man unsure which direction to take at the crossroads of his life, Warren Schmidt is brought wonderfully to life by Jack Nicholson.I must confess I normally find Jack Nicholson a difficult actor to stomach. He turns in good performances when characters fit like a glove. Such as The Joker. Or the Devil in The Witches of Eastwick. But when the character's all wrong for him, the results are really quite tedious, like Jack Torrance in The Shining.The good news is Warren Schmidt is a character that suits him down to the ground. In fact this may be the best bit of acting Nicholson has ever done. Its certainly his most inhibited.The opening scene witnesses the end of Schmidt's job as Assistant Vice President of Woodman Insurance Co. He sits in his office, patiently waiting for the day to end by intently staring at the clock on the wall. His briefcase is already packed and ready to go. And as soon as it hits 5 o'clock, he trudges out the door.His retirement party is a parade of empty promises and half-hearted moral support from former co-workers. And Schmidt knows all this.No sooner has he eased into retirement, fate drops a bombshell in his lap. His wife Helen suddenly drops dead of a blood clot to her brain. Schmidt's daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) comes for the funeral (but not his retirement party), and she's brought along her fiancée Randall Hertzell (Dermot Mulroney).Randall's a simpering loser of a water-bed salesman, and Schmidt doesn't approve of they're impending nuptials at all. Jeannie doesn't care. She advises Schmidt to only show up on the wedding day and do nothing else for this wedding (except write out a few cheques from time to time).Left all alone, Schmidt begins to reexamine his life. He senses his life has meant nothing to no-one, and the film itself is a confirmation of that belief. He freely admits Helen grew to annoy him constantly. They're marriage was over long before she died. His daughter has almost completely cut him out of her life. And his replacement at work doesn't need his advice. Schmidt's life is meaningless.He shares these confidences with Ndugu, a Tanzanian pen-pal he chooses to sponsor. Ndugu is only a six year old boy. It seems highly unlikely he could understand Schmidt's problems. But he needs to unburden his distress to someone. Anyone willing to listen.Schmidt decides to take the Winnebago (bought at Helen's request) and embark on a trip across country to look up his long forgotten past.I really loved About Schmidt. Alexander Payne's direction is right on the money. The film is filled with cute little throwaway gags. Little details packed away into every frame. And something new is revealed to you with each and every viewing.It's not only a gently amusing story. Its quite moving too. I'm not sure if Schmidt is on a journey of self-discovery. He already senses the truth about himself. I think he goes off on this little adventure to confirm what he fears about himself. But its all brought beautifully into perspective by Jack Nicholson.Nicholson has never been better. He adopts a minimalist mode of acting, which I think is about right for the character of Schmidt. Its all the more remarkable considering what an annoyingly over the top actor Nicholson can be at times. He downplays his emotions, and hides years of pain and frustration behind Schmidt's expressively wrinkled face. He never steps out of character.Each of Schmidt's stops on the road are like landmarks of his own personal road map. The home he lived in as a kid is gone. He meets a couple who represent the happiness he never had with Helen. And these vignettes are all wonderful. They highlight everything wrong with Schmidt's life, brilliantly underplayed by Nicholson.Then comes the inspired second half. Jeannie's wedding. Its at this point we meet Randall's mother Roberta, brought fantastically to life by Kathy Bates.She's the extrovert to Schmidt's introvert. She takes an instant liking to him, even though he fears Jeannie's life will sadly come to mirror his own if the marriage comes to pass. Roberta either doesn't see this, or doesn't want to. Its a beautifully modulated performance on Bates' part. Charming and ingratiating with Schmidt. Harsh and uncompromising with her family. And her scenes with Schmidt are eerily similar to her most famous character Annie Wilkes from Misery. The hot tub scene will stay with you long after the film is over.There's no ending of false optimism. Schmidt doesn't prevent the wedding. He knows Jeannie has made a serious mistake with Randall, but its too late to do anything about it now. There's too much bad blood between Schmidt and his daughter. He'll have to learn to accept that.The final scene is my favourite because its a moment of wonderful ambiguity. A letter from Ndugu reveals he can't read or write. A nun on his behalf sent a reply and a drawing he did. Schmidt bursts into tears. It's a beautiful scene because it opens itself up to a number of interpretations. Is he touched, distraught he poured out his heart for nothing, or overcome finally by his personal failures?About Schmidt leaves it to you to decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking strength</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching the film about 30 minutes in, just as Helen is being taken, dead, from the house, and that seemed like a reasonable place to start. I'm not sure what, if anything, is added to the viewing experience by seeing her alive. The film isn't about her, it's about Warren; it's his road movie.Is Jack Nicholson miscast? I know it was already 5 years since "As Good As It Gets", but this character isn't far enough away from that one, at least in the way that Nicholson plays it. Only right at the end does he look the part: really sad and un-Jack.Also I think that the film is either a bit under-scripted, or the directorial touch is too light. Some scenes come and go without a feeling that they've given their full contribution to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you look back at your life and you try to decide whether you accomplished anything after half a century of working, hopefully your answer will be both truthful and positive. Jack Nicholson's Warren R. Schmidt gives a decidedly untruthful and negative answer (to himself) in About Schmidt, an excruciatingly sad and painfully unfunny comedy.And yet, if you're willing to expend two-plus hours of time and patience, you're going to experience a wickedly dark satire about Schmidt, the middle-class company man whose retirement is as empty as his past.What makes AS worth the effort is the layering on of believable or forgivably satirical characters and events that lead Schmidt to an end-of-the-movie realization that he has, in fact, done something good and decent, that his life hasn't been a failure on every level except financial.My wife gave up on the story because she saw Schmidt as being so craven and bleak as to be declared beyond salvage. She's usually the one who has faith in humanity (I have embraced my inner misanthrope), but Nicholson's quintessentially anal and unforgiving Schmidt was a total loss to her. I agreed, but then there are the final moments of the movie, when Schmidt is confronted with a positive effect from a guilt-ridden cause he takes up early in the film.It's a sweet bit of forgiveness that will hopefully allow him to embrace his daughter's new family, an eclectic pack of working-class mutts and, in his words, nincompoops.Speaking of the nincompoopers, I have one complaint about Kathy Bates (and it isn't the cheap shot about how she drops--and droops--trou). Her badgering of ex-husband Howard Hesseman is so out of character, so nasty and Schmidt-like that it almost ruins an appreciation of her embodiment (and yikes, what a body; there, I got in my cheap shot) of a non-judgmental, hippie-dippy, sensual-being who welcomes Nicholson into her family with unconditional love.So, should you expend your time on About Schmidt? I'd say yes, but understand that, much like Nicholson's other retirement story, The Pledge, there isn't a clear ending, the payoff isn't in crisp, new bills. If anything, you'll be paid small, like in pennies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another film, much like American Beauty, about our futile obsessions with materialism and employment and thinking we know what's going to make us happy.Warren Schmidt retires from his long service with an insurance company that dumps him as unceremoniously as his files and turns its back on him. His wife, on whom he has depended his entire adult life, dies suddenly whilst he out of the house and his daughter is about to marry a man of whom he does not approve one bit.Oh, and in the middle of all this, he decides to start sponsoring an orphaned African boy in response to an ad he sees on TV one day.We initially meet Warren and feel for the way he has been treated by life, but soon realise that he was quite the bastard himself, in his time. Maybe he deserves what happens to him? Superbly shot, brilliantly scripted and acted and with enough moments to make anyone stop and think 'Haven't I been like that too?'.Watching this film could be the saving of you, if you are brave enough to look at yourself objectively and be truly honest about yourself.Go sponsor an orphan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1970-2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1970, Jack Nicholson solidly established himself as an anti-heroic star in "Five Easy Pieces", about a man in search of himself. In 2002 - when I was as old as my parents were in 1970 - he came full circle in "About Schmidt", as another character in search of himself. And in a way, this movie seems to take it a step further: whereas in the first one, he was a young man (that is, the younger generation disillusioned by society's mores) who had deliberately wasted his life, in this one, he's an elderly man (who seemingly has long since stopped caring about whether or not he goes along with society's mores) who suddenly realizes that he has not lived as he would have liked.Anyway, the movie casts him as Omaha resident Warren Schmidt, on the way to Denver to attend his daughter's (Hope Davis) wedding. His drive to Denver looks to be the defining moment of his whole life, especially with a certain scene involving Kathy Bates (which was apparently the only scene that a lot of people remember).I try to imagine seeing "Five Easy Pieces" when it first came out, and then seeing "About Schmidt" 32 years later. One would realize that even as a member of the rebellious new generation (rejecting the old generation's wasteful lifestyle), things would eventually come back around. I get the feeling that maybe in a number of years, my generation will look like the people who wasted their entire lives. If so, then I can only hope to have fun while possible.All in all, a really good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual with Alexander Payne's films, he builds up a nice story which equals to a devastating blow to Western values (in this case marriage, family, employment, personal relationships) only to contradict himself along the way by presenting sentimentally trite Hollywood melodrama &amp; a generic humanitarian message (backed by swelling violins of course). And frankly, the idea about the correspondence with the Tanzanian kid strikes as both unrealistic &amp; hypocritical. Payne has to decide what he wants to do: merciless nihilistic criticism, farcical comedy or insipid fairy-tale melodrama ? Cause the combination of the 3 just doesn't work. That he seems that to have struck gold with the critics and a large part of the audience is irrelevant. So has Lord of the Rings. 4/10</fullReview>

I don't want to give away much of the story here but trust me when I say that I have never seen Nicholson in a role like this. As a man who doesn't believe he has ever made a difference in anyone's life, he doesn't come to any real true revelation until the very end of the picture. I hope you will be moved, as I was.

		<shortDescription>The danger of conformity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt was a darkly comic cautionary tale about conforming. All of the details and characters in the movie are so typical of the everyday life around us (and a part of us?), so stripped of glamor, that it was at times almost painful to watch. At other times, that gritty realism, that lightly cynical coating over everything, was funny.One such moment was when Warren Schmidt is talking to the funeral director to make arrangements for his deceased wife, is told the price of a hearse, and asks, "What if I drive her myself?" Another has to do with Warren's hatred of his wife's collection of Hummel figurines, and his changing perspective on them after she dies. But this scene cannot be adequately related with words.The nice thing is that the movie is extremely accurate in its portrayal of everyday, bad-taste, unremarkable life. Usually movies like this end up laughing at such people from without--creating a caricature and ridiculing. This movie doesn't exaggerate, doesn't create cardboard clichés, and doesn't shield us from empathizing with the unlovely. There are even some tiny, brief but bright moments of touching sincerity that help buoy the film up. While the director clearly sees Schmidt as a tragedy, we also understand that he likes him. And we like him.It's worth the rental price to see Jack Nicholson so transformed. A good deal can be accomplished with makeup, but in many scenes he holds his mouth so wide that he looks like a bug. The opening scene, with Warren sitting in his office chair waiting for the minute hand on the clock to hit 5:00 so he can retire, is one such moment. Warren Schmidt is so opposite from the over-the-top Jack we know and love that it is a subtle but masterful testimony to Nicholson's talent.I haven't figured out if the movie will help me avoid falling into ruts, or whether it makes me feel smothered with the whispered thought that I'm no different. Immediately afterward, I think it had got under my skin. But with a little distance now, my appreciation of the movie seems to be rising steadily. As powerfully as Adaptation--but by showing us its exact opposite--the movie celebrates originality. It celebrates the road less traveled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is magnificent in this story of a man who has reached retirement age and is coming to the realisation that his existence has been pointless ( or so it seems ). When his wife dies suddenly he sinks into squalor and despair. It seems that the only way is down until he finds his dead wife's love letters! I found the scene where he dumps her belongings hysterically funny and sad at the same time (weird) Now he rallies and sets out on a voyage of self discovery. There is so much in the movie that it is well worth a second or third viewing a few weeks or even months later. At his daughter's wedding he gives a speech and one is expecting something nuclear but he says all the 'nice' things and keeps the peace. I'm not sure if he just didn't have the nerve to let them all have it between the eyes or if he had begun to see the hidden good in the people that now had become part of his family. The new son-in-law is a dimwit but his daughter loves him and Schmidt seems to finally accept this. The fact that Jack is the same age as the character he is portraying makes the film all the more poignant. All in all a very moving and enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "Sideways"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne first hit the radar screen with "Election" a few years back, an arch, smart little comedy that I respected more than I liked. When "About Schmidt" came out, I was interested but somehow managed to miss it. I finally got around to viewing it on a cable channel last evening.In a word, "About Schmidt" is spectacular. Each scene is a finely-crafted, understated gem. Part of what I loved about the film is that Payne obviously decided to play it deadpan. It would have been remarkably easy to make Nicholson's character of Warren Schmidt an object of ridicule, and while that might have made a funnier movie, it wouldn't have had near the resonance they wound up with here.Nicholson truly has the performance of his career here. His Warren Payne is utterly ordinary, even banal, but this only makes him that much easier with which to identify. He plays Warren without a hint of irony.I marvel at storytellers who can tell big, important stories by relating a series of small, ordinary events, especially when they can do so without pulling those events out of shape to heighten the drama. Much of this film looks like a documentary. Warren's speech at his daughter's wedding is given no false weight, and yet it winds up forming an utterly natural climax for this story.I liked "Sideways", Payne's subsequent film, but like "Election" it fell just a bit short of the mark for me. This is maybe another example of Hollywood rewarding an artist for a previous work that fell through the cracks. I would honestly call "About Schmidt" a great American movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is brilliant as ever as an "average guy" who suddenly faces multiple major crises: After some 40 years of service to an insurance giant, his final day at work is ticking away (literally). Now retired, a life of leasure and fun should begin. WRONG! Within weeks his wife of 42 years dies suddenly, leaving him to "look forward" to their only daughter's wedding to a total loser. "Schmidt" manages to face everything with dignity and without causing any trouble. Still, the man who tried to do everything in his life right, by the book, and with all consideration for everyone else, feels unwanted, unloved, as though his life didn't matter at all, he had lived for absolutely no purpose.If this had been "it", the story would be quite depressing. Fortunately there is a bittersweet "point" to it all. As Schmidt embarks on "married life after retirement", a TV ad asking for people to "sponsor a needy child" in a developing country, catches his attention. Schmidt responds to the call for help, and begins a "diary-like" correspondence with his foster son, a 6 year old orphan in Africa, whose photo he received from the relief organization. As though writing regular entries into a journal, Schmidt tells this boy all of his troubles, along with sharing fond memories and things happening at the time. The therapeutic value of this letter writing becomes evident in the final scene, which is heartbreaking."About Schmidt" is not fast-paced, but the DVD version explains that many scenes were shortened or cut entirely for time. All of the remaining scenes are somehow relevant to the story. The final "message" is worth following the at times dragging storyline. Nicholson (of course) and Kathy Bates in the small role as the "mother-in-law" are wonderful. Their teaming alone is worth watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's 2002 film, About Schmidt, is just as much the transformation of it's star Jack Nicholson as it is the transformation of the character Jack plays "Warren Schmidt." Here Nicholson is no longer the swaggering, smart alecked, tough guy we have seen throughout his long, illustrious career but a quiet, shell of a nice guy trying to understand his life after retirement. Nicholson does such an amazing job portraying this loser of a character one wonders why he hasn't been playing this type all along.The movie begins with the retirement of Warren Schmidt. He is a typical Midwestern "good guy" who is retiring as an executive from an insurance company. Schmidt is an everyman schlub. He has worked hard to have a "normal" life. He has a good job, a long standing wife, and a nice daughter. Yet upon retiring, the death of a loved one, and his daughters imminent marriage Schmidt must take a harder look at his life. In doing so he comes to realize there isn't much to it, really. The bulk of the movie centers on Schmidt traveling to Colorado to try to stop his daughter from marrying a redneck boob.Theerer are numerous perfect spoofs of Midwestern living. From Schmidt's life, to his retirement plans of living in a trailer the details of a typical Midwestern life are just about perfect. While on the road, Schmidt stops at numerous Interstate museums that are so banal it is hilarious. Once he arrives in Colorado the characterizations of the fiancée and his family are both hilarious and frighteningly real. Dermot Mulroney plays the mullett wearing, salesman fiancée and Kathy Bathes plays the still living in the 60's time of free love soon to be mother-in-law. The family dinner before the wedding is reminiscent of real life, mixing hilarity and sadness with the eye of an artist. The actual wedding is so dead on perfect that I believe I have actually attended that very ceremony. From the off key singing of the schmaltzy "Longer" to the self written vows (I will love you every day, and when I say day I mean all 24 hours, and when I say hours I mean...) the ceremony is hilarious in its real life cheezeball hokeyness and yet manages to remain as sweet.This is what makes the film so memorable. While it pokes fun and satirizes everyday Midwestern life it is full of rich glowing love for that very life. Schmidt is an normal schmuck who has lived his life by the rules. While at the end of his life he begins to regret that simple life, I don't believe the film is suggesting that this type of life is meaningless. Just the opposite in fact, I believe it is showing all of us everyday schmucks that living a normal life can be glorious in its own way when we help those around us.</fullReview>

Poor old Schmidt hits retirement and comes to grips with the fact that life doesn't always turn out according to plan. All he wants is to find something in himself that will be significant and lasting. An unwelcome retirement and the even more unwelcome marriage of his daughter to a loser underline his sense of powerlessness and frustration. The subplot of his developing relationship with a foster child in Africa yields some wonderfully incongruous moments. Great performances by Nicholson, Hope Davis and Dermot Mulroney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought Jack Nicholson won an Oscar for this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb acting for Mr. Jack Nicholson! I just saw this today and I immediately researched the internet if Mr. Nicholson won a Best Actor award for it. I was touched, moved, amused with him. He can truly portray modern man, alienated in a capitalist society. (When I was in my teens I saw One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and he moved me, too, here.) I had not seen or read Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller who just died, and I do not know if there are parallels, but this film made me more curious.It made me think, will I become like Schmidt in my old age, when I retire? Will I feel my worth in life?The film also shows how industrialized countries may learn from people in poor countries, how his foster son touched his heart. Modern man has seemed to lost his roots, his humanity. Struggling for success, he sometimes forgets things which really matter in life - family, spouse, love, commitment, true sharing. And abandoning these things leave him sad in the end because he had abandoned the things in life that make humanity what we really are: symbolized by the holding of hands of two people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seem to be a few comments here to the effect that people who don't like About Schmidt are young, and that, by implication, you have to be getting on in years to appreciate it.However, if you look at the voting demographic you'll find that, although females under 18 mark it down, males in that age group like it as much as anyone. And the other voting figures don't reveal a distinct age-related bias either way.Equally, I would hesitate to suggest that intelligence has a lot to do with the extent to which you are likely to enjoy it. I know highly intelligent people who didn't get it at all. I think it's much more to do with expectations: some of us enjoy thoughtful films that focus on relationships and the delusions to which we can fall prey, while others demand action, a clear narrative, comedies that strain every tendon to squeeze humour out of any given situation, or rip-roaring pace.In summary, it takes all sorts. If you don't like this movie, fine. But don't dismiss it as bad or pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film with two exceptions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a wonderful quirky film about personal growth, life's meaning, priorities, and reconnecting with your life. Be warned however that the trailers for this film depict it as a comedy; it is not. Yes, there are funny bits, but overall it's on the depressing side of funny. The two exceptions are the body shot of Kathy Bates as she enters the hot tub and Jack Nicholson's butt. Kathy, Jack, if you're listening, no one wants to see it. Beyond that the parts are very well played, what else would you expect from Bates and Nicholson? It was nice to see Hesseman again and Mulroney is great as the boyfriend. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was perplexed by the number of negative comments herein on this excellent black comedy, until I realized that most of the people who enter comments appear to be in the earlier stages of their life journey. This flick can truly be understood only by those of us who are closer to the end than the beginning. The hollow disappointments of life, the realization that much of what we do is ultimately futile, and that we have failed at life's biggest task - making a difference - are the themes that underlie this tale of an Everyman nearing the end of his journey. It is one of Nicholson's finest roles, and he has created the perfect screen persona for Warren Schmidt, hesitant, awkward, slow-moving and a bit ponderous, with a face that reflects his astonishment at each new revelation. This is truly a movie with some depth, and despite its darkly rich comedy, the closing scene is close to heart-breaking.</fullReview>

The movie is both humorous and touching and succeeds on all levels. Have we ever seen a more restrained performance from Nicholson? Kathy Bates delivers a funny and brave piece of work, and their is a nice turn by the underrated Hope Davis as Nicholson's daughter.

		<shortDescription>About Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a true gem of a movie warranting repeated viewings (though even once is a nice reward). Nicholson gives a truly "grown up" performance, and one of his best performances of any year. His Schmidt is a character instantly recognizable ? a weary Everyman who ponders unknowingly and unpretentiously about life's greater meaning and its relevance to who we are. His searches lead him to tackle things each to "give" meaning to what he feels is his uselessness to the world at large. I believe this is something each of us (or most of us, hopefully) can identify with: the starving orphan "over there" who reaches out to us from the T.V. via the has-beens of Hollywood; a road trip of epic proportions, etc. Schmidt's "Pain and Prejudice" becomes our own and the entire film is an exultant deceptively reluctant paean to life itself. Alternately hilarious and heartbreaking About Schmidt is one of the most beautiful films I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe "About Schmidt" is a film we should be grateful to have come along.Only because they don't come around very often.Finally a film with rich,believable characters-a lonely recent widower,trying to cope with retirement and his new life,his abrasive and emotionally distant daughter,her 1980ish oddball fiance with enthusiasm and a good heart-just like his family.This is nice little character study seen trough the eyes of Jack Nicholson - in another wonderful performance where we get to see his amazing versatility.He makes this depressed,lonely,quiet man so utterly believable,it seems as if you know him and feel his sorrow ,anger,and happiness along with him.Anyone who had trouble with the film or its pacing is either too young to understand, or simply didn't grasp the point that the film simply moves along at the pace of its character.It has to or it would not have been near as affective.Nicely done 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine piece of cinema, well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is Warren Schmidt in this bitter-sweet 'comedy' about coping in late middle-age and being plagued by your demons. After retiring, then losing his wife he embarks on a road trip towards his daughter's home in Denver where she is about to get married to a man Schmidt holds in a great deal of contempt. Ultimately the movie's story isn't actually that coherent, but it's supposed to be that way. It's not really so much about the events themselves as the way Schmidt's life is affected by them, and Jack conveys Warren's emotions supremely well. He's immeasurably believable.But Nicholson's acting isn't the only commendable performance; all actors in this are faultless. The script calls for a quirky edge without being ridiculous, and we get that extremely effectively from them all.We get inside Warren's head via his reading out, mentally, of letters he writes to a poor child in the 3rd world he's sponsoring, and tells the child the bad aspects of his life as well as the good.It's this attention to detail, as well as Nicholson's outstanding portrayal, which means we really get inside Warren's soul. His entire being is on display here, which makes this a quite personal film.Many reviews, such as the blurb on the box, wax lyrical about the comedy aspect, but really I'd suggest it's a light-hearted drama with deeper overtones. There are no belly laughs, that's for sure. While there are amusing moments, it's never really a *funny* film.Yes, what carries it are the performances, particularly Nicholson's. It's a finely made movie, and worthy of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson shines in this multi-layered film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not entirely sure exactly what was keeping me from seeing `About Schmidt' for so long. Misunderstanding of the premise? Lack of education about the film? I was under the impression that this film, directed by Alexander Payne (who also brought us `Election - a fantastic film) was another sweet comedy abut the life of Middle Aged America.**Spoilers Within**Well, obviously I was wrong on several levels. About Schmidt is probably one of the saddest films I have ever seen that wasn't in the standard `tear jerker' category. The film tells the tale of Warren Schmidt, a man in his 60's who is forced to retire from his job, realizes that he has `grown tired' of his wife and has to contend with the fact that his beloved only daughter is about to marry a complete moron. When his wife unexpectedly dies, he decides to take the obligatory deluxe motor home he and his wife had purchased to enjoy their `golden years' and takes off across the country to try to stop his daughter's wedding.The story sounds simple enough when you outline it on paper like I just did, which is probably one of the reasons I avoided it for so long. What it is however is an incredibly multi-layered story that shows the `other', perhaps more real side of retirement. We don't see Schmidt elated that he is now retired and has free time; we seem him going back to the company mere days after his last day, hoping to get a bite of any kind of project from his much younger successor. We don't see Schmidt and his wife frolicking on the beach like the retirees we see on television. We see their bored, habitual relationship that has an enormous amount of strain because they have surpassed the `passion' level and long ago entered `routine tinged with irritation'. Even something as cliché as trekking across the country in a motor home is made different by the sights visited and the experiences had. Additionally, Schmidt is such a seemingly emotionally closed-off man that sometimes the only way we as the audience definitely know what is going on in his head or what his true feelings are is through the letters he sends to his `adopted' sponsor child, Ntugu. Since Schmidt sees things mostly as black or white, and took the `suggestion' to write to your child seriously and possibly because he needs an outlet to discuss his feelings, we hear his innermost thoughts about everything in his life. It isn't until he indirectly hears back from Ntugu at the end that we finally see him really break down and allow himself to cry.All of these elements make for a fantastic and intriguing story, but it is Nicholson that gives Schmidt life and heart. When I watched the film a month ago, I proclaimed him to be one of the saddest characters I have ever seen, and upon reflection time has not swayed that opinion. His appearance, his quiet demeanor and even his shuffling walk all make Schmidt a sad man, and Nicholson played the part absolutely brilliantly. It is a given that Nicholson is going to be good in anything that he does - he is in the same league as Hackman, where they can pretty much utter a line and people are going to line up to give him a nomination of some sort. But Nicholson, at least in his last dozen films or so has relied on playing the role of the scoundrel or the playboy - pretty much what he projects as his public persona as well. Schmidt is an entirely different role for him, and he was astonishingly good, and unbelievably convincing. Actresses are sometimes lauded for `not being afraid to play their age' - which, in these image conscious times is a valid compliment. Nicholson should be praised in the same light for his role in this film.About Schmidt should be a must-see film and will probably garner many different reactions from many different people. The few people with whom I have discussed the film that have actually seen it did not feel the profound sadness I felt. Of course, there were some comedic moments, but the film is so touching and so thought-provoking that it is impossible to categorize it in a general sense, but I would give it one label - Excellent.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to Reflect...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, to me, was about taking some time to reflect on where one's life is going. It also helped us (sis and I) to understand what my Dad was and still is going through when he retired. He also has that same amazingly selfish attitude towards his children and wife, and that same aura of disquieting aimlessness that was so beautifully brought to life by Jack N.--which can be seen all too readily again in my father.I think this movie also helps you look 'outside the box' on your own life and your lifetime goals. Should you blindly pursue your mcCareer to the point where you are alienating people around you of whom you might really care about? At the end of the fastlane, what's next for you?These are uncomfortable and brooding questions, of course, but nevertheless, the questions above underly the main theme of the movie. So get prepared before watching this deep, thought-provoking flick: don't watch it alone, make sure it's sunny, warm, and cheerful outside and then start playing it in the VCR/DVD. Not before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERSI saw this movie last year and thought it was a nice little slice of life and even posted saying that it was pretty good. I Just watched it a 2nd time on DVD and had a very different reaction. This movie was excellent, sad, thought provoking, real....I actually dreamt about it what felt like all night and couldn't wait to write this down.This movie is about Warren Schmidt who retires from his career and really has no clue as to what to do next. He goes down to his old office with a sense of pride and accomplishment wearing a suit and feeling important to ask the new guy if he needs any help with anything. The new guy brushes him off with a polite nod and pretty much shoo's him outta there pretty fast. When Warren gets downstairs he sees stacks of his old files in the trash. His lifes work. His wife dies unexpectedly and he is REALLY alone and has no idea how to take care of himself, his life, his house, cook, clean....He makes an observation to himself that after he dies and the people he knows die then there will be no proof of his existence. How depressing. In the meantime, after watching a tv commercial about starving children in Africa he decides to become a sponsor of a small boy named Ngutu who is 6 years old. He sends him letters, and checks of 22/month.After taking a road trip in the winnebago him and his wife had bought for after his retirement he is desparate to find meaning or some way to make some sort of difference in someones life. He decides he must stop the marriage between his daughter and her goober, low life fiance.His daughter does not take kindly to his interferance and asks him why NOW he's taking an interest in her life (indicating that he never had before).After staying with her family in Denver and pleading with Jeanie to call off the wedding (he is sure that THIS will be the one way he can have some sort of positve influence on someones life) he realizes this is futile. He goes to the wedding, tries to be a good sport, and goes home to his empty house.While going through his mail sees a letter which was written to him by woman who works to help Ngutu and other children. She writes to him about how while Ngutu cannot read or write he is so happy to receive the letters and how he had an eye infection, but with the money he received this all cleared up, and how he is a very happy child who loves to paint and enclosed is a picture that he made for Warren. The picture is childs drawing of an adult and a child holding hands while the sun is shining which makes Warren burst into tears and me too!!!! I cried for 10 minutes.I loved this movie, and more the second time. I think everyone wonders if their life counts or makes a difference in any way. Everyone wants some sort of legacy and the desire to be remembered after death, and have their life not have been in vain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Jack's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of my friends were very disappointed with About Schmidt. It went against their perception of Jack Nicholson's recent comedic typecast; a wicked Jack who embraces his roles with gusto. But even though the film claims it, About Schmidt is no comedy. It's a downer. Jack looks like the same old Jack, but Warren Schmidt is not a funny man, he's a shell of a human. A recently retired life insurance underwriter in Omaha, his wife abruptly dies leaving him alone and with nothing do to. His wife and his job were his whole universe, and now they're both gone. To make matters worse, while going through his wife's affects, he finds love letters from a long ago adulterous affair with their best friend. In late middle age, what little life Warren has remaining comes crashing down around him.His grown daughter is getting married in Colorado (to a man Warren believes beneath her), so Warren embarks on a road trip to see her and meet her family. A family headed by Roberta, played by Kathy Bates, who embraces life. Will she be Warren's salvation?Warren Schmidt is a very difficult character, but Jack Nicholson nails it with a very understated and gutsy performance. He is supported by a great and believable supporting cast, and the on-site Midwestern winter locales add truthfulness to the tale. And then there's Jack in one of his best roles. About Schmidt is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>homogenized America theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another movie that I knew a lot about before I even entered the theater. I knew Jack Nicholson starred as Warren Schmidt. I knew almost the whole story of the movie before I even saw it. He retires and starts realizing he does not like his life. I knew his wife would die, and he would set out to try to stop his daughters wedding. I even knew that he would meet up with Kathy Bates, and would see her naked in the hot tub. It is too bad, I probably would have enjoyed the movie more if I knew nothing coming in, but I heard so much about it from critics, chat boards, and previews before the movie. I hate previews because they have so many spoilers.This movie was a new age Easy Rider. This Easy Rider in the 21st century is not going to find much in America. The director, Alexander Payne kept showing franchises in his shots. I think he did this on purpose to show that America has turned into a homogenous country. It doesn't matter where you go, you cannot escape the monotonous scenery. I see Auto Zone, Dairy Queen, and a Tire Center. I think an ironic and powerful part of the movie is when Warren decides to visit his childhood home, and finds it has been turned into a tire store franchise. America (like his life) is nothing of interest. If you want to find something meaningful in your life it will not be with a good job, home, and family in America. I sometimes feel the same way, because I am traveling in the same path as Warren. I am living `the American Dream', but it feels like a meaningless existence, and I do not think there is any escape from where I am, and where I am going. I can try to escape from where I am, but I know that no matter where I go, I will only find the same situation and place as I am in now. 7.5/10, but then again I am the drunken_critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-crafted, powerful, funny - although shuffling - Nicholson vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things are delivered with a unflinching honesty by Alexander Payne. First is Schmidt's inner voice. Using the clever device of Schmidt's sponsorship of a Tanzanian orphan we are told a number of things but, most arrestingly, the true nature of his thoughts which are almost always in contradiction to the way he behaves around the people of whom he talks.The second is the cringing contrivance and downmarket - but vital - life and behaviour of his future family-in-law. His inner voice betrays an attitude to the people around him at odds to the affirmative, congenial front he presents not only in their company but also, earlier in the film, to that of his friends and family. Alexander Payne's carefully prepared and crafted use of this juxtaposition is a wonderful, if melancholy surprise. Scene after scene goes by in which we feel that something must give as we recognise that Schmidt, with his alternative inner voice is as much an observer as we are. But every time - especially in the brilliantly acted set piece of Schmidt's wedding reception speech - nothing happens. This is how it is, says Payne, and we make the best of what we have, because none of it's perfect.Rather like David Lynch's The Straight Story, it has road trip centre-piece and the general pace of the narrative is paced to reflect the principal character; About Schmidt spreads this a little too thinly in places, probably to even out the movement from one episode to another. A rich film, at its core is an investigation of precious things buried in the ordinariness of life, embellished with easy going humour and no-nonsense cinematic narration. Nicholson is excellent, although Sean Penn's The Pledge has still managed to snare the most extraordinary and compelling Nicholson screen performance I've seen so far. But I'm sure that Alexander Payne's satisfied - 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem I had with this movie relates to the personality structure of Schmidt himself.On the one hand, I find it hard to believe that an individual with so little communicative talents would have held a seemingly top managerial position in a large corporation, on the other hand, the total lack of empathy exhibited by the main character does not inspire the viewer to experience a deep form of sympathy towards him.Schmidt is basically an extreme introvert who lacks real human warmth and his attitude towards himself and others borders on the pathological.The confrontation with his retirement prompts him to give a new meaning to an existence which has passed him by as an unconscious process.He is unable to cope with the insight, which others have grasped long before him, that life is basically meaningless and it's too much of a burden and too late to give his remaining days a purposeful content. Nicholson acts well and avoids his usual tics and tricks.The movie however, leaves the viewer with a feeling of emptiness, as, apart from the final scene where Schmidt probably sheds his first tear ever, the overall impression is one of coldness and despair.</fullReview>

The stark landscape of Nebraska, the mullet haircut on the sun in law, the letters, the RV - all perfect.

		<fullReview>Spoilers!!!!! My dad retired recently, and we watched this movie together. The retirement party, what people say, and how Schmidt reacts to his new life makes this a reality movie. My guess its influence is reality TV. The humor is every day reality faults in people. Schmidt's job was his life, and without it he lost his existence. He finds out how mundane, and empty life is. How spiritually, and emotionally empty life can be when we do not work on these needs and he notices these inequities. He finds out realities, like most of us will not be anything special, what we build decays including what if any legacy we leave behind. He finds out the office can easily replace him and shows him the elevator when he visits, which my dad mentioned. That his wife had some secrets, he needed her and the house falls apart. His daughter looks homely, and has social behavior issues. Why at an older age does she marry who she does? This is the best she can do. Instead of being happy, he gets to see a really social dysfunctional Hippie style family (the writer must have some real life experiences). Good humor in this part with good details. The hippie family's ex lives in denial, mother who can not cope with age gets weirder, son in law balding with pony tail. How many people go to weddings with dread, with the same monotonous ceremony with no heart involved. Jack is great speaking at the wedding, and how one lies in life. Hey it not so bad most of us have to deal with this junk. It's just life. In the end this movie is funny, but a little too close to real life. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a sad movie; there is no doubt about that. It doesn't highlight a happy ending or happy characters. But it is not intentionally that way. Well no more than it is intentionally funny or intentionally disheartening. The only thing it tries to be is a good movie, and at that it succeeds marvellously. What is sad about this film is that it is hard to watch bad things happen to good people. But is Warren Schmidt really a good person? I have read several other reviews sighting him as a jerk and in a film of lesser calibre such may be the obvious, but this is not a lesser film. Schmidt is not a jerk; he is indeed a good man, an instantly lovable character. That's what sets him apart from other characters of his kind. But he is a lonely man. He is also angry and afraid, maybe afraid because he is angry, or angry because he is afraid, the kind of man who excuses himself from his own retirement in order to get a drink at a bar down the hall. `I wake up and ask myself the same question ever night. Who is this old woman living in my house?' Schmidt says of his wife after his retirement party, which has seemingly left him at a loss for himself. That's how the film begins. Warren R. Schmidt is 66 years old and ready to step down as the assistant vice president of an insurance company. He seems miserable as all of his friends pay homage to him, and he seems equally as miserable on his down time at home. Everything his wife does seems to annoy him, he visits the young man who has taken over his job in hopes of him needing some help with current affairs, and he lies in spite of himself. He lies because he needs comfort but doesn't need others to know of this. Material like that on its own would be enough to comprise a great film, but this one pushes further. After the sudden death of his wife and the upcoming wedding of his almost estranged daughter, Schmidt has some soul searching to do. The coping process with the loss of a spouse is done with specific care and grace. Where again, a lesser film would use such a circumstance as a means to sway the audience, director Alexander Payne uses it to show the viewers what it is truly like to lose someone. Now instead of waking up asking who is sleeping beside him, Schmidt doesn't sleep, instead wondering why there is no one beside him anymore. All the while Schmidt narratives himself through the letters he sends to a starving foster child that he is supporting in a foreign country. This could have been used as an excuse in lazy scripting, something some writers do to tell how characters are feeling instead of allowing the director to show it. Here it means so much more, coming full tilt in the end for a beautiful scene of misunderstanding. With no better option, Schmidt loads into his Winnebago and decides to go see his daughter sooner than previous arrangements had allowed, but his daughter doesn't want him sooner. She knows he will just get in the way, telling him to go back home and wait until the set date. But adventure calls and Schmidt decides to travel to many locations that he has never been to before. He buys collator Hummel's, meets up with another family in a camper and in one of the films most effective scenes asks his wife to forgive him for the past while sitting out under the stars. There have been a lot of films of this same nature, but this one sticks out. It is not a happy film, but it does itself the justice of developing an understanding of its characters instead of just presenting them. Director Payne allows us not to look into the life of a tragic man, but look into the `man' of a tragic man, using the same type of urgency that he mastered so fondly in his tongue-in-cheek high school satire Election. The same basic formula for comedy applies here as it did in Election. Schmidt is a man who we don't know if we should laugh at or cry in sympathy for. I guess that's the genius of comedy done well, it has to transpire from natural circumstances. Proving that it may be a lonely world that we live in, but it can always be a funny one. The acting in About Schmidt is superb. Jack Nicholson garnered his twelfth Oscar nomination for his starkly honest portrayal of the title character and the always-enjoyable Kathy Bates is also unforgettable as the mother of Schmidt's soon-to-be son in law. A hot tub scene in particular is a priceless movie moment. Hope Davis also shines with all she has as Jeannie, the daughter of Schmidt, who wears hair clips as if to insert that she is still her father's little girl. Davis does a brilliant thing in portraying a character that loves her father, but can't help but resent his ways. In the end the lesson that Schmidt learns in life may go unrealized or unappreciated, but we, the audience know that, it doesn't take a hero to make a difference and you don't need to make a difference to be a hero. The moment Schmidt catches a glace of a sign at a pioneers road attraction let's us know that a moral lost is still better than a moral never gained: ` The cowards never started. The weak died on the way. Only the strong survived. They were the pioneers.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film starring the always fantastic Jack Nicholson, Kathy Bates, Hope Davis, Len Carniou, Jane Squibb and Dermot Mulroney as the perfectly casted bumbling salesman.This tells the story of a 66 year old man named Warren R. Schmidt. Intent on making everything perfect and always failing at it. He's married to a pleasant woman, has a daughter marrying a complete idiot, and a worthless job as an insurance salesman. So after he retires he and his wife plan to go visit his daughter before her wedding. But just then Warren becomes widowed, and goes on his own journey to see her. But along the way runs into new friends, strange attractions and a whole new view on life.Perfect telling of a lonely man wanting to be noticed and appreciated. Jack Nicholson was very convincing and very different in the title role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie that is not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of those rare gems that seem so few and far between lately. About Schmidt is a slow moving observation about a man who takes a look at his life after retirement and the death of his wife. This is not a rip roaring laugh fast, more a gentle, touching, poignant and sometimes sad comedy, full of reflection. Jack Nicholson is absolutely superb as the title character and it is very difficult to imagine anyone else handling this type of role with such sensitivity. Those of you who are expecting a comedy in the style of "As Good as it gets" will be disappointed. However, I recommend you give this a try, it is well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to Ponder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is true that About Schmidt is a slow-paced film. You keep watching Jack Nicholson, expecting him to suddenly burst out from his sad sack character and be the Jack Nicholson we all laugh with and enjoy. It never happens, though. For some, that's frustrating. For me, it was the only thing that could have happened for this film to remain true to its message.There are plenty of reviews here that talk about plot, so I will not. What I will add is that, for any person who has worked at the same company for 10 years or more, About Schmidt strikes a little close to home. The truth is, when you retire, all the things that you THOUGHT were so important at work for so many years, aren't. In the grand scheme of things, when you lie on your death bed, you will NOT wish you had done a better job on some work project. No, what matters is your LIFE, and you better be sure to create one that doesn't have to do with your job.One other point, and this is a spoiler, so if you haven't seen About Schmidt don't read this: I think many reviewers missed the point of the ending. Jack's character wasn't redeemed. He didn't suddenly find purpose because he could help the kid in Tanzania. Listen to the voiceover his character has in the film. He says that when you are gone, and everyone who knows you is gone, and you have left nothing, than what was the point of your life? Ngubu hasn't met Jack's character face-to-face, but he IS someone who "knows" him. So Ngubu falls under the same catagory as the character's daughter. As a result, the end is very sad. The main character realizes that, at age 66, he has done as much for this child to whom he has sent a small amount of money in the past couple months as he has for anyone on Earth, and he cries for that reality.Three days later my wife and I still talk about About Schmidt, a rarity with today's movies. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

This is a film about getting old and how it affects the way you react to certain situations and how you become less tolerant it is also about how this make make you lonely. In a way it is a sad film but it also makes you smile too because most people will see a bit of themselves in the main character. The end is very tearfull in a nice way as well and i defy you not to well up at the the final scene. Top notch stuff. More film should be like this. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midwestern Americana At It's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up in Central Illinois, and having fled the emotional constipation of the region to the geographical and social variety of the Pacific Northwest, I perfectly understood the mindset of the main characters in this masterpiece. The anal innocence or naivety of people far removed from the sophistication of a connected world was painfully real yet humorous. Because of my deliberate emancipation from that culture (interestingly enough, I'm still Christian and moderately conservative) I could look at it from the outside and laugh at myself, my father, mother, relatives, and friends.This movie was well researched. It is both funny and thought-provoking. I am quite frankly surprised that Hollywood could produce such a quality movie with this much positive and negative insight to the psyche of the Bible belt. Everyone associated with this film deserves an Oscar. Thanks for the memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "funnier" version of "Death of a Salesman"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a review of an old theme: the awakening from the "american dream" or what is the meaning of life for a typical middle-class man in western urbanized civilization. In 1949, a very famous theater play ("The Death of a Salesman") begun this discussion. Another example of this theme: "American beauty"."About Schmidt" presents this discussion in a funnier and more optimistic view than the classic play. Maybe it's because this is Hollywood, pop entertainment or simply the fact that Marxism is dead and, therefore, the "american way of life" is seen differently today than it was in 1949.This movie is highly recommended if you dream of being rich and famous and conquer the world. It tells you that the price is quite high, specially if you fail. But it also gives you some hope of redemption. Some people criticized the ending as being to sentimentalist (I'll not spoil it). I disagree. It made sense to me. It makes sense to U2's Bono, too ;-).</fullReview>

From reading some of the comments here and hearing what some of my friends have said, the expectation of a comedy kind of ruined this masterpiece for many people.It's not a comedy, although it has funny moments. This movie is perhaps one of the best portrayals of how life REALLY ends up for many people.There are scenes, moments, in this movie that make you want to scream. Ol' Schmidt, though... he just sucks it up, puts on a brave face, and soldiers on.Jack Nicholson's performance is Oscar-worthy.This movie should be instructional to many people. You need to appreciate what you have while you have it. You need to forge meaningful relationships with those in your life. You need to actually DO things instead of just thinking about it. Because retirement and loneliness is closer than you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Most Surprising Performance By Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack, since "Five Easy Pieces", which I regarded as his best "piece" of work, has not really moved me with his performances. Too much attitude, too much emotive "acting". Too many characters which were more or less the same. In my opinion, he became typecast as an unsympathetic jerk!This movie, (after what... 35 years) has changed my opinion!I saw the trailers and shrugged. A lover of movies, but not necessarily going to theaters to watch 'em, I finally saw the show on a pay-per-view basis and became totally engrossed. Nicholson's performance was most believable! His character was one that you could alternately empathize with, feel sorry for or regard with some disgust. To evoke those sort of emotions, from this viewer at least, was astonishing. I'll say this... he deserved an Oscar for this performance far more than for those performances for which he won! Bad luck for him, I suppose, that Brody had perhaps an even better vehicle to display his talents, at least to the Academy.There was more to enjoy about the movie than Jack's acting, especially if you've lived in or are familiar with life in small cities or towns. The movie touches bases within that experience, particularly the wedding scene. The byline of Jack's character spilling emotions to a six year old African, who could not possibly understand the frustrations of a person 60 years his senior, was crafted irony. Kathy Bates performance also deserved recognition.One last point... if you're over 50, too many points the movie makes may strike too close to home on many levels. It gives pause for thought!This was a movie that totally exceeded my expectations. 9 *'s</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Ulysses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schmidt is an exemplar of American middle class virtue. When he retires, his many friends and colleagues gather to wish him a fond farewell. A successful VP of actuarial science in a large Omaha Nebraska corporation, his golden years before him, he looks forward to a life of adventure in his new Winnebago. At first, the process of defining himself without reference to his career is predictably tough; but then, when his wife dies, he's forced to look at himself without any of the socially constructed icons that he's used as a crutch for over forty years. Like Jack Kerouac, he goes searching for himself on the road. And mad Captain Ahab on the maiden voyage of his Winnebago has no shortage of lunatic first mates to offer their advice ? always wrong, always genuine American kitsch. The situations in which Schmidt finds himself are darkly comical. About Schmidt is a film devoted to the problem of kitsch, particularly its emotional and intellectual manifestations. There's kitsch on the left, and kitsch on the right. There's an economy based on its production, and an economy based on its avoidance. And this film finds kitsch everywhere, in modern evangelical churches, in New Age practitioners of lovey-dovey touchy-feely instant familiarity, in the mobile home parks along the road to the American Dream, in the `Precious Moments' figurines that are so nice; worthless, but nice. I came away from the film thinking of Schmidt as an American Ulysses, of sorts, a hero forced to negate everything he'd learned to value in order to overcome the curse of kitsch. In the end, he succeeds. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly touching film that spotlights the sadness, humor, and possibilities of getting old in America. Jack Nicholson portrays Warren Schmidt so subtly and accurately, you feel you have met and want to cry and hope for him. The use of Ndugu as a device was brilliant -- it gives Schmidt voice without breaking the quiet sadness of the man portrayed. Great underplayed performances are often missed or ignored, certainly when they come from actors known for more boisterous ones. Marlon Brando's quieter acting roles are some of his best, and this could be one of Nicholson's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film with anyone else but Jack Nicholson in the lead would likely not work. And it wouldn't work as well without Kathy Bates. Some roles were made forsome actors and this is the case in this movie. It takes a while for the character to develop and at first we're not sure if we're going to get a typical Nicholson personna. There are glimpses of it, but what we get is a brand new character. And the character and story work. Kathy Bates is very impressive in a supporting role. The spa scene could have been done in a less revealing manner, but it's a testament to her "taking one for the team" that she went the distance with it. You may feel good at the film's conclusion; you may feel sad. But you shouldn't feel disappointed.</fullReview>

"Set" music (e.g., at the wedding reception) was much better.It was good to see Nicholson making a film like this, showing that he can still deliver the real dramatic goods while subsuming his skills to the service of deftly tackling perhaps the two biggest existential questions--who am I, and who is this woman who lives in this house with me?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie; very realistic situations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike alot of reviews I am not going to rehash the plot but address the broader impact of the movie on myelf. I found the dialogue and interaction between the characters very realistic. I think if most of us were honest we know alot of people in similar relationships. The manipulation and attempted manipulation of and by the characters was very real to me. Nothing very sinister but rather the mundane types of pressures we put on our loved ones on a daily basis. When you first see Kathy Bates browbeating Howard Hesse you sympathize with him but then realize later that this windbag has probably just gotten on her nerves over the years. He is like the uncle who the first twenty times telling a story or making a point finally starts to grate on your nerves. Not all the time mind you and you still love the guy but sometimes you just want to tell him to shut the hell up. The thing that struck me the most was the realizations that Schmidt has through the movies and the epiphanies he has but in the end he is the same guy he was when he started. Maybe a bit more accepting of things as they are and realizing that he has little control over the people in his life but maybe has control over himself and the African foster child he has "adopted". I think most of us have had those epiphanies in life that we at first find life altering but we are still basically the same person. Maybe a little better or a little changed but seldom completely reinvented. To me this was very realistic. Good movie. I recommend it to movie lovers who do not get upset when the movie does not end in a nice, neatly wrapped package. I give the movie four stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"About Schmidt", is an accurate portrayal of an ordinary man who searches for the meaning of his life after retiring.The movie stars Jack Nicholson as Warren Schmidt, and may be the best performance Nicholson has given. Nicholson is not only acting, he actual becomes Warren Schmidt.The Director, Alexander Payne, use various techniques to show Nicholson's isolation and confusion. Scenes are often shot with low angle and wide lens to minimize the importance of Nicholson's character, for example the opening scene's images are dreary, depicting the environment as large and confining.When Nicholson first appears, he is shown in his office awaiting the clock to strike five, and end his career. He is alone and his office seems huge and confining, and when Nicholson takes his Winnebago on the road, the road is pictured by extreme long shots, simulating a journey or search for something with no end in sight. Payne usually keeps Nicholson at a social distance from the other characters in the film, unless the scene calls for an intimate relationship.The theme of the movie is the looking back on his life by Nicholson's character. In one scene he is shown returning to his office to lend advice to his replacement, and this shows Nicholson's need to feel that his life's work had some mean. After being dismissed by his replacement, and on his way out of the building Nicholson sees all of his office belongings and records boxed up and sitting in an enclosed storage site out side of the building. It makes me wonder, what purpose Nicholson's time at his job served. In another scene, Nicholson travels back to the town where he grew up, and to his astonishment his house is no longer there. Instead it is now a tire store, but Nicholson finds some irony in the fact that when he was a little boy living there he had a tire swing outside in the yard.In a way "About Schmidt", reminds me of "The Graduate", in both films the leading characters are searching for some meaning in their lives. The only difference is that Dustin Hoffman's(Benjamin Braddock) character has many options to choose from, where as Nicholson's characters options are limited because of his age. They are just at different points in their lives, but both are still searching."About Schmidt" is easy for me to identify with. Soon I will be turning fifty years old, and although I still have many options in life, I will be heading towards retirement. Will I be ready,and like the character Warren Schmidt, will I also be looking at my past in search of my purpose in life?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson plays Warren Schimdt, the titular curmudgeon in Alexander Payne's "About Schimdt". Schimdt is recently retired and beginning to question the importance of the life he has lead. A road trip to his daughter's wedding becomes Schimdt's voyage of self-discovery, and he shares his inner thoughts in letters to Ndugu, the African child that Schimdt "adopted" through a charitable organization. Schimdt's correspondences with Ndugu are priceless, as are his adventures on the road.Payne's funny, melancholy movie resonates because of its emphasis on reality. The warts-and-all approach he takes is reflected in everything from Schimdt's awful comb-over to repeated unappetizing close-ups of food. The technique clicks, and by the end of the movie you will feel like you have MET these people.That feeling is cemented by the vivid characterizations of the top-notch cast. Kathy Bates is fearless in her Oscar-nominated turn as the mother of the groom. Hope Davis and Dermot Mulroney are dead-on as the soon-to-be-married couple. But, of course, "About Schimdt" is about Jack - and from beginning to end, Jack is stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is a master craftsman. From "The Shining" to "Hoffa," "As Good As It Gets," and "About Schmidt," his voice, diction and body language capture the essence of the people he becomes on screen.It would be too easy to dismiss "About Schmidt" as something that skips over life's surface without digging deep. But Nicholson's Warren Schmidt is a mid-westerner whose Nordic ancestry and upbringing make him stand out from the usual fare among American movies. Schmidt is unable to express his feelings about life, marriage, friendship, job, the futility and worthlessness of his existence--until he by accident becomes a pen-pal and "foster parent" for a black child he has never met and whose life he cannot hope to understand.In his letters to the child, the audience is able by eavesdropping to look inside Schmidt and see what he loves, fears, resents. The letters are but a vehicle for the character and a powerful one, especially at the closing moments of the film.I like Nicholson, and believe he is one of the powerful male actors who get better with age, so it is natural that I rate this a 10. It doesn't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rewarding for the Discerning Viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films which explore the everyday realities of the common person are often the most poignant cinematic experiences. Movies like American Beauty, for example, take average people and examine both the positive and negative aspects of their lives to reveal the humorous undertones of the mundane. About Schmidt does this very thing, perfectly extrapolating humor out of the struggles of one typical man.We follow Warren Shmidt as he deals with several important life transitions (SPOILERS FOLLOW HERE) including retirement, loss of a spouse, and the marriage of his only daughter. It all sounds incredibly depressing, yet writer Alexander Payne (who wrote another wonderful dark comedy, Election) keeps discerning viewers chuckling (if not laughing hysterically) from start to finish. Second only to the film Adaptation, it is the best comedic screenplay of 2002.The title character, Warren Schmidt, is played perfectly by the brilliant Jack Nicholson. If you are expecting to see the typical Nicholson character--wild-eyed, sharp-witted, handsomely dressed, and hysterically dramatic--you will be disappointed. This character is a departure for Nicholson in that he is mostly reserved (at least outwardly), often transparent in his manipulations, and unglamorous in every sense of the word. Still, despite Schmidt's many flaws, you find yourself liking him. He is the common man: cheap, dishonest, insensitive, ignorant...in other words, hilariously human.Unfortunately, the fact that it explores everyday life--one of its most interesting features--is what diminishes its appeal. Many viewers used to flashy, over the top antics, will miss the subtleties of this film, turning it off long before the finish. DON'T! With a little patience and attention to detail, this film is easily one of the best of the year. Rating: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson does it again, but in a role that is quite different from most of his. Here he plays a 66 year old insurance VP who retires and doesn't quite know what to do with himself. He prefers solitude to silly crowds, and during his retirement dinner excuses himself and goes to the bar for a drink. Schmidt usually avoids confrontation when he can, preferring to live in peace. some SPOILERS follow, read further at your own considered risk of discovering more than you want to know!Shortly after he retires he goes back to the office to see if his young replacement needs help with anything. No, everything is just fine. Then when he returns home Schmidt's wife of 42 years is on the floor, vacuum running, she is dead. Plus, his daughter in Denver is getting married soon to a man that Schmidt immediately correctly sizes up as a real loser. In the big mobile home that his wife had got him to buy, he takes off towards Denver, with several side trips, his old home as a child, which is now a tire store, and other places. At one trailer park he meets a nice couple, when the man is out for more beer Schmidt is so comforted by the woman that he puts his head on her shoulder. She is surprised, but goes along. Then Schmidt kisses her on the lips. Horrified she orders him out, flustered and not knowing what came upon him, Schmidt not only went to his trailer, but drove off, too embarrassed to risk a confrontation of any kind with the couple. This episode was indicative of how lost Schmidt was, and his actions completely out of character, as evidenced by a later scene where he is embarrassed when a nude Kathy Bates gets into the hot tub with him, suggesting a sexual liaison, and he nervously excuses himself to his trailer, not even wanting to sleep in her home again.Against his advice, the daughter and imbecile get married, Schmidt ever cordial pretends to enjoy it, but at the end of this road trip, his adventures have broken him out of his doldrums, he could then get on with his life in retirement. It is a character study, somewhat in the same vein as ONE HOUR PHOTO or THE STRAIGHT STORY, although in a very different set of circumstances. Nicholson is in top form here. Good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson gives acting another try.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most interesting thing about this movie is that Jack Nicholson actually makes an attempt at acting for the first time in years. It's true that I caught Jack's patented eyebrow raise a couple of times (out of place, as usual, for the character) and he may have flashed his big ol' devilish smile once or twice (again, out of character). But for the most part, he did attempt to create a character for us, as opposed to giving us "Jack Nicholson on screen, ladies and gentlemen." Otherwise the film's main attraction lies in its ethnographic portrait of lower-middle class life in the provinces. (Strictly speaking, Schmidt had more income than a lower-middle class person, but culturally and ideologically you'd have to locate him and his daughter right smack in the middle of the wasteland of the lower-middle class.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely A New Spin on Death of A Salesman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, About Schmidt, Nicholson is forced to confront his limitations as an actor; and throroughly embraces the eccentricities that define him as a person. In some sequences, such as the Roof of the RV, Nicholson is proven inept in all regards while trying to capture real emotion. As Nicholson falls short of the acting that is required of him the plot also seems to jog at such a lacadasical manner towards the finale of the film that one often feels as if they are trapped in the RV w/Nicholson forced to travel uncomfortably across the vast wastelands and abysmal desolate plains that make up About Schmidt's general attitude. While the plot devices are sometimes rather weak, and side plots aside, the film is a rather depressing dry slice of horrible yuppie life. The plot is quite depressing the acting from Nicholson is a bit lacking but the film's acting is saved mostly by the strong supporting cast. Kathy Bates' never ceases to amaze me, she looks like a gritty horrible lesbian, while in the film she still manages to come off as a very sexually active and engaging person, proven and for once played while with Nicholson himself. Randall, Dermot Mulroney, is such a wonderfully idiotic character that the audience can't help but love him and seeing his bumbling attempts to comfort Schmidt are among some of the most comedic and dark parts of the film. Also of interest, and in defense of the writing in general, they did a wonderful job of amalgmating the parent's annoying and yet delightfully garrish personal habits. About schmidt is still so reminiscent of Death of A Salesman that you can't appreciate the genius of the film, the simple and indescribably uncomfortable moments that you must spend with Schmidt, the ugly face of Schmidt's reality, and most of all the realization that life doesn't always go as planned. Being the story of a retired and crushed man both stories bare a striking resemblance to one another and upon closer examination it appears that this is merely the case of a tale that must be told by every generation; their disallusionment. For the 60's perhaps it was Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the death of all morals every attached to the decade and the revelation of drugs being the morals. Though it's hard to attach any sort of actual generation to this film its' quite easy to see that it is certainly designed to address this issue, for what generation we may never know, but let this film stand as a testament that not all Blockbuster Hollywood films are crap.

Things that you get up in the morning and go through life for gradually disappear.

		<fullReview>About Schmidt is a beautifully-done film and frankly, I have a hard timeunderstanding why people think it's "boring." Clearly, people who find it to be boring expect all movies to represent fantasy life-- car chases, tidy romance, gorgeous people-- and not the real world.About Schmidt is the real world. Boring? Yeah, the majority of life is boring. You get up, eat breakfast, go to work, come home, eat dinner, watch TV and fall asleep. Not only does Jack Nicholson understand and embrace the rut andhumdrum of everyday life for this man, but he uses subtlety to work his way into the viewer's perception of everyday life, showing us exactly how we feel as we go through the motions.I immediately saw that Schmidt's life is exactly what we will all go throughsomeday. People retire, their spouses die, their children marry and I have yet to find a film that so accurately portrays LIFE. Life is not glamorous, life is not exciting, life is not a dream come true. The statement of the film: We have to break free of the grind of everyday life if we want to find our own personalcontentment. Contentment may be boring without glamour and excitement but,as Schmidt shows us, deep down we just want to be content and happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Marvelous Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" is a marvelous film featuring a great cast. It takes place in Nebraska where Director Alexander Payne shoe "Election". The story centers on Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) as he retire and how he adjusts to his new life. He at first, seems tired of his life and is looking for something else. He has been married to his wife Helen (June Squibb) for 42 years and she seems to be getting on his nerves. While watching TV one day, he decides to become a foster parent to an orphaned child in Africa. He writes to the child in a way that describes what is going on in his life. When Helen passes away unexpectedly, Schmidt has to come to terms with the tragedy. His daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) and her fiance Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney) come for the funeral and we find out that there are some longstanding problems between father and daughter. And to make matters worse he finds out that his wife had an affair with his best friend Ray (Len Cariou). When they return to Denver, Schmidt decides to hop into his Winnebego and drive out to Denver for his daughter's wedding. Along the way he spends an eventful evening with the Rusks (Harry Groener, Connie Ray)at a trailer park. When he arrives in Denver he is greeted by Randall's quirky mother, Roberta (Kathy Bates) and meets his estranged father (Howard Hesseman). Nicholson is outstanding in the title role. He is able to convey emotions ranging from the unwanted worker, to the henpecked husband to the distraught widower and the concerned father. Bates almost steals the movie as Roberta. The scene in the hot tub is hilarious. And the scene where Schmidt first encounters the water bed where he is to sleep, is equally hilarious. A definite must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Schmidt is one of the most depressing comedies I have ever seen. While the film is laced with hilarious moments, it has an extremely bleak tone, as Jack Nicholson's character struggles with his wretched wife, an ungrateful daughter, her crass, idiotic spouse, and the coming of old age and death. This film is unlike anything that Alexander Payne has previously done, as it has no obvious political overtones to it, as "Citizen Ruth" and "Election" did. Furthermore, signifigant portions of the film are set in Denver rather than Omaha, as in his previous films. Overall, it is a highly recommendable film. Jack Nicholson gives his best performance in recent memory, playing someone other than himself for once. Hope Davis is great as his daughter, and Kathy Bates has a small but amusing role as Davis's soon to be mother in law.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`About Schmidt' should be required viewing for all budding directors, screenwriters and actors. I have never seen a film that manages to perfect the bittersweet nature of the human condition as well. I think `About Schmidt' is a masterpiece. It took me awhile to be comfortable enough to make this statement. Jack Nicholson said when accepting the Golden Globe for Best Actor In A Drama, `I don't know whether to be ashamed?I thought we were making a comedy'. Well, as the saying goes, `Life is but a jest.' I first saw `About Schmidt' in New York with a boisterous audience and I was right along with them in uncontrollable laughter. Nicholson's face is one in a million. He is the personification of a star. He can convey with one look, like Norma Desmond I guess, more than a paragraph of dialogue could ever do. He knows cameras and he is a master of film acting. Of course, Alexander Payne should be given tremendous praise as well.I'm a pretty jaded person and unfortunately these days it takes a lot to make me laugh. In subsequent viewings I still bust a gut during so many moments in the film. The line between laughter and tears, happiness and madness has never been so fine as in this brilliant movie. `About Schmidt' is a deeply profound statement and is now one of my most endeared favorites.</fullReview>

That fat girl serving his meal at Diary Queen? We shouldn't feel too sad for Schmidt. He has done better than millions of other people.The truth is, he was going through the retirement process, and needs time to adjust. Pretty soon, he will find his old friends again, go for holidays, take his trailer to Canada. But the message for the younger ones: time is short. Don't waste it. Family and friends are important.

There is however a sentimental touch, which is disturbing and that is Nicholson's "life-opener", which is the money he sends to the little boy in Tanzania.

(This movie does not even have `good' guys and `bad' guys!)About Schmidt is a movie about a man who is confronted by the banality of his life and his attempt to find rhyme and reason in what he has done and in what he will do. It is about the issues that confront real people and is one of those rare movies where the actors look and act like real people.

		<fullReview>After The Royal Tenenbaums, this is the second movie depicting in great detail and with respectable subtlety how absurdly sad (and how sadly absurd) the emotional universe of families really is. There won't be a happy ending, it is impossible even to imagine one ? only pain, uneasiness or complete ignorance are possible feelings, realistic solutions for people in family relationships. Alexander Payne has a lot to say about this, and what he shows us is real, not only in mid-west American `white trash' families, also for instance, in my own family.While Wes Anderson's Tenenbaums dealt with the family issue in the first place, in About Schmidt it is only a side issue. The film focusses on the character Schmidt who is old and sad and meaningless and begins to realize this, desperately trying to add some sense to the final nine years granted him by statistics. Jack Nicholson's touching performance makes us immediately feel the tragic consequences of age. Death is not hell but age is. About Schmidt is actually a horror film. Nicholson looks so terribly old that, although he is only 65, you inevitably think: `O dear, poor Jack Nicholson is going to die soon'. Without doing a lot (Nicholson used to over-act from time to time in his career but he doesn't overact at all here) he makes us perfectly understand what he thinks and what he feels.Although the whole story is concentrated on Nicholson/Schmidt, the supporting roles are cast and conducted very intelligently, too: Hope Davis is a terribly authentic nervous bride-to-be, Dermot Mulroney a gorgeously simple-minded but likeable young groom. Kathy Bates and the couple on the campsite are comical highlights.At times thescreenplay doesn't know which direction to take and therefore helps itself with rather stupid gags that do not fit into the overall concept. This is why I still prefer the Royal Tenenbaums to this movie. But the incredible actors and the honorable attitude of the film make it an absolute must.</fullReview>

The movie works in the beginning, as long as you expect something to happen, supported by the music, but thenlets you down. I cannot recommend this film to anyone who is planning to get old - the script has not many options as to what a 66 year old widower could do: annoy his daughter just before her wedding or go on a solo-trip to places where nobody takes notice of him. The letters to his little foster-son Ndugu serve as a trick of the script to make the lonely man talk, and in the end turn sentimental. A dull attitude reigns the film, and so the few funny scenes and the good acting are in vain.</fullReview>

I explained to the young lady behind the counter the need for this boost and she responded by asking what film I was about to see. I told her and it turned out that she had already seen it. Not only had she seen it but she really enjoyed it as well. In fact, the film had left something of a lasting impression on her. After having seen it, she got to thinking about her parents and the kinds of issues they'll be facing as they approach their retirement. Oh, and she thought Jack Nicholson was great!My father is only fifty-two years old but he retired last year after the plant he worked at for over twenty years closed down their production. Albeit an early age to stop working, it still has to be something of a drastic change of pace. Fortunately for him, he has always been heavily involved in outside projects so he has plenty to keep him busy. However, I still feel it necessary to ask myself, what was it like that moment he realized he never had to go back to work again? What was it like when he realized he was free? And then what?This moment comes for Warren Schmidt as he wakes up just before his alarm would've ordinarily gone off at 7:00 A.M. The film opens just the day before, at the last remaining minutes of Warren's working life. He is 66 years old and about to retire. His bag is packed; his desk is cleared. Slowly but surely the seconds slip past him and his moment of triumph has arrived. He looks neither happy nor elated that this moment has come. Instead he looks complacent, distant and lost. Warren is going through the motions. He meets up with his wife of many years for his official retirement dinner and when the evening is done, they almost systematically head for their home and their bed. Their home looks lived in and their faces look tired as they head off to bed. Warren's life is consumed with routine. He's had the same wife, job, home and purpose for so many years that he has no idea what to do with himself now that his schedule has been rearranged.Jack Nicholson. Attaching that name to a film means you're in store for bravado, snarls and trademark toothy grins. Nicholson is so popular and easily recognized that it makes it very difficult for him to escape his on-screen persona from film to film. Director Alexander Payne manages successfully to strip away each heavy layer of Nicholson's ego. In fact, when Payne is done with him, all that is left is a glassy-eyed, quiet, 66-year-old man who shuffles slowly from room to room looking for something to occupy his aging hands. Nicholson's celebrity glow is extinguished so that we actually see his age, weight and skin for what they really are. Nicholson could be your older neighbour sitting on his front porch that you wave to as you walk past or miss entirely. Of course Nicholson deserves some credit as well. He plays Warren with understatement and bewilderment, searching for himself in everyone else to avoid looking in.Enter Kathy Bates as Roberta Hertzel, mother of the groom. Roberta is the perfect character to offset Warren's aimlessness. She is a confidant woman who casually rattles off the details of her first orgasm in ballet class at age eight. She has no shame and why should she? She is aware of whom she is, where her life has taken her and she is in control of her decisions and actions. Roberta's comfort with herself comes directly from Bates' ability to command attention the moment she walks on screen. She carries herself with a self-assured gusto that fills everything she does, whether that's devouring a chicken dinner with her bare hands or disrobing into the nude for a late night hot tub dip with Jack.Payne has crafted a simple, moderately slow-paced film about discovering who you are at any age. I'm not going to lie; he made me cry more than once. I'm a long way off from retirement but the concept of being chewed up and spit out by a hollow capitalist system is a potential reality that many people face and embark on without realizing what the end result may be. Like Payne's previous work (Election, Citizen Ruth), he tones down the usual Hollywood gloss to reveal a world that more resembles that of the general movie going public, making the situation all the more believable and relatable. The clothing and art direction choices are always plain and natural. Either the crew just pulled up to shoot at a place that already looked perfectly normal or the designers went through painstaking lengths to achieve a look that's meant to seem like no movie magic work went into it at all.Reaching out to the people around you is not always easy. There can be so much fear of rejection and being misunderstood. This can be especially difficult when you don't know exactly what it is you have to offer. I say you've got to start somewhere and Warren starts by taking a trip down memory lane to remind himself that he's alive and that all his memories were at one point a reality. And even though, by the close of the film, Warren only manages to share sincerely in letters he writes to a third-world country child he's sponsoring for so many cents a day, he's come to understand to some small extent for a man of his stubborn nature that as long as he's still breathing, he still has a place, be it on the open road or that front porch swing.To the lady at the Starbucks at the Chinook Mall in Calgary, thanks for the chat and the latte.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few surprises in a touching portrayal of advancing years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a man of mature years, I enjoyed "Schmidt", and could feel myself inside many facets of what the relentless march of time was doing to his character. And based on my own experience, I could see some of these coming a mile off. When the unpleasant young sprog who succeeded him said "come into the office any time" I knew he didn't mean it, and when I saw him on his way back in there, I physically cringed at what an unpleasant shock I knew he was about to get when confronted with the realisation that he was neither needed nor wanted.It was a massive solo performance, well deserving the Oscar nomination it received, although of this year's two best actor nominated performances I've so far seen, I'd rank higher another performance of the emotional crises that confront an ageing man, that of Michael Caine in "Quiet American". I can also see why Catherine Zeta Jones won "best supporting" ahead of Kathy Bates, who in a movie so dominated by one actor was left with little more than a clever extended cameo and a nice surprise flash of her saggy tits. But I felt that this was never terribly far from Jack Nicholson playing Jack Nicholson, with some of the more manic facial expressions and rolling eyes that we have seen in everything from "Shining" to "Cuckoo's Nest", and being a cantankerous old viper like in "As Good As It Gets". All he had to do was act naturally! And some of the slapstick, such as the water bed scene, was downright silly. Too many of the turns in the plot were telegraphed so well in advance, not just the cold reception on his return to the office but also Helen's long past affair with the best friend, the daughter not being pleased to hear he was on his way, the scene in the trailer while the husband went for the six pack, and Roberta getting naked into the hot tub. Also Helen's death itself. Tragically, her final words to him were something as silly as "don't dilly dally", which he did, and I began to think "what's awaiting him back home?" So I feel the screenplay was too obvious with few surprises, but the theme of his monologue to Ndugu was clever in the extreme, provoking the thoughts of how a boy in a village in Africa could ever hope to understand the American culture he was portraying, and I'm sure all the nice liitle touches poking fun at all that is kitsch and oversentimental in that culture were meant to heighten that. I liked the roadhouse revelation that "I spoke to this Indian guy, and it seems they got a raw deal!"  I WAS surprised that he fled in such terror at Roberta's physical approach in the hot tub, which seemed out of character especially after his attempt to kiss the woman in the trailer, which I thought was very weird. We old blokes may have a hugely exaggerated sense of our attractiveness to younger women, but even though we were clearly being visually told something was about to happen between them, I couldn't see anything at all that he might have interpreted as "come on" signals from her, and we knew the husband had only slipped out for a six pack. I thought in the desperate loneliness he portrayed in that scene, he'd warm to a bit of casual friendly nookie with Roberta.I actually thought Randall was OK. Being an old hippie myself, I liked his parents, and felt he was making a big effort to include Warren as one of the family. OK, so he had a lousy sales job, was foolish with pyramid schemes, and had a ridiculous moustache and mullet haircut, but he seemed to be a warm and open minded character. The daughter was a downright cold fish, and I personally don't reckon she was good enough for Randall. Just like Schmidt, I do at times get to wonder as I get older whether my life is of any use to man bird nor beast, and small things can significantly help enhance my feeling of worth. And so the one other surprise was the picture from Ndugu, which did just that for Schmidt. Full marks for the ending!Was this the movie version of Italo Svevo's novel "Senilit??" It certainly provoked a lot of thought about growing old and how we come to terms with the changes it brings and our impending mortality, but for me it wasn't brilliant cinema to the point I'd rave about it. But it would be an amazing tour de force as a stage play, which I think would be its ideal medium. I might get it out on video in a year or two and see how well its points continue to ring chords with me, and in the meantime it was well worth the ticket price and I'll give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly unique and well crafted drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sick of cliche, seen it all before, American movies. You know they always have the token Negro characters, the hero's love interest and of course all the main characters are models. This move is a totally BELIEVAVLE representation of one man's life. It does not galmorize the characters, infact Nocholson gives a painfully honest description of his wife right at the start! It is just straight up and believable.The performance by Jack himself is outstanding, well deserved an Accademy Award nomination for this one. A very emotional performance (my girlfriend said she cried about 3 times in the first 30mins I think!) And the thoughts that are provoked and main themes are amazingly well communicated. The final scene where things come together for Schmidt is extremely powerful and so well built up.Sure, this movie may not be for everyone. It is quite slow and just follows one man's life which action movie freaks may not be able to stand! But if you appreciate a good drama then this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works on so many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant on so many different levels. I won't go on about the many different things that are so great about this movie because it has been said so many times, but I just have to touch on a few things. I think my favorite scene is when Schmidt is on his trip and he stops for gas. He is drinking a big gulp and listening to how the Indians got a raw deal and that he really felt for them. So many things happen which speak volumes for his character, but I think the best shot is when he stops at a dirt road to take a breather. He walks up to the dirt road and bends over, tired with life. I hope other people can appreciate this film for how great it really is, but I doubt that is totally possible. While it has gained much success, the ending contains not enough resolution for Hollywood mainstream. It is definitely a movie in which one will like about one hour after it is over when time is given to ponder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's follow-up to his raucous, furious `Election' couldn't be more different. It moves at a deliberate speed, placidly shot (James Glennon's camera barely moves) and will surely test some audiences. There's a pervasive melancholy in Payne's narrative (written with Jim Taylor and based on Louis Begley's novel, unread by this reviewer) of a recently retired actuary (Jack Nicholson) who finds himself newly widowed and begins to question his life and place in eternity; this prompts him to travel throughout the Midwest, visiting places from his past en route to his daughter's wedding in Denver. Though it's good to see Nicholson finally playing a character his age, his performance also illustrates the film's thorniest problem: deliberately underplaying the role of a simple man whose greatest fear is that of being forgotten long after he and anyone who has known him are gone, you can't help but feel it's Nicholson acting--this is an emotional struggle Jack Nicholson will never have to deal with. It's in the film's supporting roles, fortunately, that Payne's observations are beautifully driven home, particularly Hope Davis' as Nicholson's daughter, long ignored and unwilling to allow her father further access. Davis is stunning, a complex, emotional woman with full understanding of the control she exercises and an unwillingness to sublimate that control to that of her father's; she underscores the shrinking significance of Nicholson's character that is at the heart of the film. The other fine performances are from Dermot Mulroney (as the ne'er do well groom), Kathy Bates (somehow sensual as the groom's earthy mother) and Howard Hesseman (as Bates' pathetic ex-husband).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy with a profound message for all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" does for people in their 60's what "American Beauty" did for middle-aged men. It is a monologue about being old; remembering what you used to be, what you wanted to be and what you have become.Jack Nicholson steps aside from his usual neurotic over-the-top performance and shows he can play an generally shy and insecure man trying to set things straight in his last years of life. He is truly a great actor.Although the constant insights of Schmidt about his life are those of a 66 year-old man, I believe the message can be understood by young people as well. Well, I for one felt a connection with this guy. His letters to Ndugu, that were more likely pages of a journal, makes you think about your own life, your perspective for the future and your idea of success. Perhaps, one way or another, all of us will inevitably become Warren Schmidt. Will we also have the courage to detach ourselves from our routine and go look for something new?The movie is a little bit too slow. It makes you laugh along the way, but as it is coming close to the end it becomes more and more a dramatic and depressing story. But the ending, the very last seconds of the movie, are just precious. They contrast completely with all the conclusions that Warren got from his journey and tells you that you might still find happiness in your seemingly pathetic and useless life.

		<shortDescription>Strikingly real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sentimental but unpretentious, this case study of a new retiree too angry and disappointed to show it plays less like a movie and more like life itself. Jack Nicholson's performance is astonishing as Warren Schmidt, but it's his character's experiences--largely painfully dull--that ironically draw you in. It's all so real that you swear you've been through it all before. "About Schmidt" is sort of a male version of "The Hours," but without the tricks and immortality. As Schimdt sadly remarks, the world will not remember him when he's gone. But it sure will remember his movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Little Film about Growing Old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne, who previously directed the biting and satirical "Citizen Ruth" and "Election," treads on the same dangerous ground usually traversed by the Coen Brothers in "About Schmidt" as you are never sure whether he is making fun of his own characters and settings (in this case common folk from the MidWest) or is being dead serious in his depiction of their humdrum life. I was never quite sure if this was a drama or comedy. I laughed a few times as I watched Jack Nicholson give a charming performance as a man forced into retirement, who then loses his wife suddenly, has to watch his beloved daughter (an only child) marry a dolt, and find some meaning in his average unspectacular life, but was mostly depressed. Quirky characters and nicely photographed "road movie" shots of middle America abound. This is a very slow moving movie that will not appeal to everyone (I suspect people who are retired or close to it will find deeper meaning in it than younger viewers), but is worth a shot if you like off-beat films or are a die hard Nicholson fan. Like the more manic Wes Andersen, Payne is an acquired taste, but a solid film-maker (even if he is making fun of us).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film...for all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to express how wonderful I felt this movie was. Jack Nicholson really delivers the goods, and carries the movie here. Like most other IMDB readers, I feel the movie could not have been made without him, let alone been nearly as successful. Director Alexander Payne also shows his talent here---check out 1999's 'Election' for more proof. Back to 'About Schmidt'...it's a film I enjoyed immensely now, but I can tell I'll appreciate it even more later. The ending alone made it worth watching---it'll be tough to call who gets the Oscar for 'Best Actor' this year.The real point I want to make about this film, though, is you don't have to be of retiring age to enjoy and relate to this film at all. I was the youngest one in the theater by far, and absolutely loved it. Through Jack Nicholson's performance, you don't have to be his age to understand his situation. A topic covered in the message boards is about the controversy surrounding the MPAA rating this film as 'R', when I felt it wasn't offensive at all (and there's a lot who will agree with me). The same could be said about last year's 'Amelie', which was also rated 'R' for some reason. Perhaps it was to get teenagers out of the theater, or present them as more 'adult' pictures? Either way, I found a lot to like in 'About Schmidt' (and Amelie as well, but that's another matter). Overall, 'About Schmidt' is well worth the time and money...maybe at least you can catch in on DVD on June 3rd, huh? :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to picture this movie without Jack Nicholson in the main role. `About Schmidt' is a movie about an uninteresting person, and the script might have been written on a rainy October afternoon. But what makes `About Schmidt' such a winner? Jack Nicholson's on screen presence is why. Any other actor would have made this movie a dully. Nicholson's manic facial expression, the way he expresses surprise and shock, his energy and wit. Besides Nicholson's there is also an excellent supporting appearance by Kathy Bates, who plays a multi-divorcee whose sexual urges seem to play the most important part in her life. Overall, it's worth watching `About Schmidt' if you're in for some great acting.</fullReview>

It is a magnificent work of art that has been brought to my consideration late, here in argentina, and i fear that it has only been premiered here because of it's oscar nominations. I believe that those were correctly given, because the movie, to make it short, is great. Jack nicholson in one of his great performances. He gives the best of himself in this film. I was very surprised with kathy bates (naked!!!!) and hope davis, who didn't give all she had to give in mumford. Dermot mulroney.well he's dermot mulroney. Hard to believe that alexander payne (election), responsable for the awful writing of the worst jurassic park movie ever, can pull off a stunt like this by directing and writing about schmidt, one of the best movies of the decade. After the forgettable election, i was wondering: `what happened to payne?'. Well, not really, to tell the truth i didn't like the movie at all, but the director could do so much more, and we can see that here, in his latest movie. Payne offers us a review of life itself, from the eyes of a retired ensurance employer that has lost the charm of life at the age of 66. after the sudden death of his wife, he is forced to rearrange things, with his daughter's (davis) wedding to a total loser (mulroney). And we see a particular relationship between schmidt and a young boy from africa, a pen pal, whom he takes under his wings after seein a commertial; this little boy will have a very important participation in the movie. Well, to close, this movie could be an oscar winner, add it to your must see list. *** out of ***** yours sincerely, see you next time in a very interesting movie,cinefila barbara</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was quite enjoyable, although I can't help but think that that was because Jack Nicholson had the leading role. It was as if the story was written for Jack as no other actor would have played the part as well as he did, in fact, no other actor would have gotten away with the film being a hit like Jack did. Although the story line was slow enough, Jack made it all worthwhile. His facial expressions and excellent acting was a credit to him throughout. Kathy Bates was very good also, especially when she shocked us all by stripping before entering the jacuzzi. What I also enjoyed were the hidden messages throughout. Firstly how it was made obvious that no one is indispensable when Schmidt retires and realises he won't be missed and things will go on without him. Although there was humour throughout, you couldn't help but feel sad for Schmidt as old age catches up on him, and loneliness, and he realises he may not have much time left. I would recommend this film, but have to repeat that it is mostly thanks to the 'wonderful Jack'.</fullReview>

Now his only outlet for his frustrations are the letters to an African child he has chosen to sponsor.This is a sad movie that could have easily sunk to tragedy, but thanks to Nicholson's acting it dosen't.

There are a lot of lonesome old people in the world, and there are a lot of couples living together without knowing each other, and there are a lot of parents and children who have lost the mutual respect towards each other.But in the world there are normal people, only in this movie there is no-one. Schmidt's daughter is selfish, unthankful and totally consumed by her fiancé's family. This family itself is totally nuts, and all the persons Schmidt meets in his journey are very strange people.Come on, this is not true. And there is hope in the world, not all people have gone mad.Very good acting, indeed. But far too pessimistic. Reminds me a bit of the US-American contribution of the '11-9-2001'-Project (which is genius, however).So, all in all: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it if you liked "The Straight Story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely not a first date movie (but then again, what is these days?) and if you're expecting a typical Jack Nicholson performance you may be disappointed. However, "About Schmidt" is a surprisingly honest portrayal of old age. This movie had numerous opportunities to go into a standard Hollywood plot, either comic or tragic, but instead chose to go straight down the middle, which is much more difficult but potentially more rewarding. Nicholson's stoic, straightforward character reminded me of several older men I've known in my life, yet it is rare to see this type of man portrayed in the movies. The best cinematic comparison I can make is David Lynch's "The Straight Story," although the Lynch film was a bit more sentimental and more hopeful. If you like one of these two films you will probably like the other.(slight spoiler below) It was refreshing to see Nicholson portraying a man who is about his own age and who looks and acts like it. He is to be commended for putting his talents to such good use in this self-deprecating role. Like Lyle Straight in "The Straight Story," Warren Schmidt is neither a saint nor a scoundrel. He is a regular guy. When his wife suddenly dies, the camera symbolically fixates on the mouth of the vacuum cleaner she is holding, which is still running. This is what Schmidt faces: a vacuum. Emptiness is one of the most difficult, yet also one of the most familiar, enemies that human beings must face as they go through life.The only purely positive relationship in Schmidt's life is, fittingly, his written correspondence with a six-year-old boy in Africa whom he sponsors through a charity organization--a boy who undoubtedly has no clue what Schmidt is writing about. This frees Schmidt to express what he feels--something that he hasn't done with anyone in a long time, if ever. Later, when a woman he meets in an RV park correctly perceives that he is a sad man, and tells him so, he is so thankful that he tries to kiss her. If this were a typical Hollywood movie, Schmidt would have at least had a few minutes of fun with her--but it isn't and he doesn't.Another realistic aspect of the film is the portrayal of Schmidt's daughter's wedding. The preparation, the ceremony, and the rehearsal are all presented with such honesty that if you've attended a wedding recently you may be squirming in your seat with discomfort. (Especially when the groom's best friend, who is slightly drunk, makes his speech at the reception.)Many people will find this movie to be depressing, but I thought it was too good to be depressing. Underneath the story is a critique of mainstream American life that reminded me more of Sherwood Anderson or Sinclair Lewis than of anything I've seen onscreen. From the wallpapered interior of Schmidt's overly large house to his halfhearted attempt to learn about history through roadside displays (while driving an enormous Winnebago), this film has a sharp eye for the wastefulness and emptiness that has crept into our culture. Even the more progressive people, from the family that Schmidt's daughter is marrying into, are taken to task. (The performances here, especially from Kathy Bates, are all first-rate.)(total spoiler in this paragraph) Yet in spite of this, I don't feel that the film is cynical. Jack Nicholson's performance is key here, as he avoids total callousness and remains sympathetic. His tears at the end are hard-earned and are not just a trick to win the audience's favor. By this point we know that Schmidt is not going to be saved so easily. The tears are composed of equal parts hope and misery. Nicholson's presence, along with his uncharacteristically restrained performance, makes this bitter pill a bit easier to swallow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" is a wonderful character study of Warren Schmidt, a recently widowed,66-year old retiree who comes to the realization that he was not satisfied with his life. If I say anymore, I'm afraid that I will give away too much about the plot. Jack Nicolson gave an unbelievably mesmerizing performance. I am not 66 years old. I am not a retiree. And I did not just lose my wife. My point is, Nicholson's performance was so deep, that as the viewer, I completely felt what is character was feeling. And you will too. Jack Nicholson will win his 4th academy award. I guarantee it. Kathy Bates is also fantastic as a spunky divorcee. It was also a pleasant surprise seeing Howard Hessman (of WKRP in Cincinatti), as her ex-husband. This is not to be missed! 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

Through all it's twists and turns, it very accurately reveals the early grief that all widowers must deal with. Including, but not limited to, the seemingly unlimited supply of people who 'just don't get it' about widowhood. If you know someone who has recently lost their spouse, this movie will greatly help you to understand what they are going through.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson's best performance yet. (Spoiler alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene of Jack, watching the clock with a vacant expression on his face, you know that his character will shine in this movie. It's hard to understand how a lot of the critics praised this movie as partly comedy. Yes it does have a few funny moments in the movie but I would only place 10% of comedy as it is fairly hard hitting, depressing (in places), and realistic (even though I am at the other end of Jack Nicholson's age generation). It must be a sad life to be on your own, your family living miles away with their own lives to take up their time, finding out your partner had an affair years ago with your friend, not knowing to do with your own time and wishing you had changed your previous life style and knowing that you can't change your past. It has opened my eyes up to realise that you can't waste time sitting around doing nothing. Get out there and make the best of your life, get more hobbies, before you reach the age of retirement and not knowing what do with all the spare time. I watched this with my grandmother and she enjoyed it but also agreed that it wasn't a comedy.Oh, one more thing, although Kathy Bates is a great actress she should leave her clothes on! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story of a Midwest American Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" continues director/co-writer Alexander Payne's exploration of the people of his home town of Omaha, Nebraska, that he demonstrated such a humorous but non-condescending or cruel feel for in "Election."Payne's going from high school graduation to retirement, but revisits the steps along the way, in what seems to be a response to "Straight Story," in effect saying that way too glorified the plains people and made a regular life story too romantic and heroic. Neither the static nor the picaresque parts of Schmidt's life involves the climax or catharsis of that film, even with the one suspenseful existential act that we think the film is building towards with Schmidt's daughter. Kudos to the production designers, location managers, and the midwest casting director, who gets a separate credit in the film, for finding the most natural representation of a region outside a documentary, supplemented with excellent character actors, who surround Jack Nicholson with authenticity. Much about the characters is revealed visually through their environments -- from a wall full of awards and trophies only for attendance and participation to the Americana roadside tourist attractions Schmidt enjoys.While the movie is adapted from a book, Payne invented an introspective avenue for Schmidt through letters to a charity case, shown with much less cynicism than such fundraising deserves.Is Nicholson's performance so impressive on its own, as a Middle American Everyman who is not in charge of his fate, or because it's Jack so different from his showy roles and Hollywood life (reflected in the credits with a screen-full list of assistants)? It's been a long time since we've seen him matched on-screen with age-appropriate women. Kathy Bates is a wonderfully earthy foil to Nicholson's actuary, but there's only gentle jabs at all. For example, the soundtrack is full of treacly classic rock that is part of the Muzak soundtrack of our lives. And that's all that it is, the story of an American life. Will this movie be comprehensible to foreign markets?</fullReview>

This film is a must see for every man who is reaching or has reached the end of his "productive years." Schmidt grapples with one life- defining change after another, beginning with his retirement. You can almost see the wheels of Nicholson's character as he faces each new challenge. The supporting cast is also brilliant, but it is Nicholson's film from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep and thought-provoking look inside the mind of one man and his struggle with retirement, independence, and family...beautifully done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one needs to stand up and argue whether or not Jack Nicholson can act, nor does one need to defend Jack putting 110% to every role he has. Jack is a phenomenal talent, in all senses of the word, and his talent is only matched by the quality of About Schmidt, his latest endeavor.Although some people might describe parts of this movie as slow-paced, I believe the intent is to give you a complete understanding for what is going through Warren Schmidt's (Jack Nicholson) mind. Without a complete understanding of Warren's mindset, this film would not carry near the weight that I found it to carry.We have all heard the critical response to various movies over the years, which goes along the lines of "I laughed, I cried...", but possibly for the first time ever, I found a movie in which I was doing a lot of both. The funny moments in this movie, like the letters to his "foster child" Ndugu, had many in the theatres laughing hysterically. Yet, within this same film were moments so emotional and touching, like the final scene which, for Warren, all appears lost and pointed toward a rather sad ending, comes almost out of nowhere and gives Warren and the audience something to feel good about.For those who like faster paced movies with a laugh a minute or films that do not require much thought, this is probably not the movie for you. But for those who enjoy a movie that really allows you to get to know someone and understand the very essence of who they are, for those who don't mind mixing some great laughs with some very emotion moments and have no shame in shedding an occasional tear over something very relevant and powerful, and for those who know that their money seldom goes to waste when they invest in watching a Jack Nicholson movie, this movie comes nowhere close to disappointing.Jack is brilliant, and Kathy Bates enters the movie in the second half to bring her backwoods country charm to the mix in this movie that is certain to be become an addition to my extensive DVD collection. This film is definitely worthy of a nomination for Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good depiction of events from central character's perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: contains spoilers!I appreciate the unique style of Jack Nicholson but I'm not an automatic fan who pre-judges all his movies to be good just because he's in the movie. This film was pretty good, a depiction of changes in the life of a sixty-something man. What was striking after a while was that the events and his reactions were portrayed entirely from the character's (Nicholson's) world, his view, his private space. Other movies may do this psychologically but not cinemagraphically. Every scene was focused on his experience or interaction with the events at hand. In that sense it was almost documentary-like from a fly-on-the-wall's perspective. There was a slight incongruity between his character being portrayed as the precise, ritual-oriented insurance executive (waiting until exactly 5:00 pm on his last day of work before turning out the lights and leaving his office) and the angry, devil-may-care slob he felt like being (and did be) much of the time. At times it was hard to read his emotion, as again the style of the movie focused only on him and not, for example, other scenes or characters talking about him (or anything else) when he wasn't there. This made it hard to get a grasp on how to perceive this movie at first--was it a tragedy, a comedy, a classic Nicholson anger role, or what. But then that was part of the "reality" aura of the movie--the character was developing new feelings, having new experiences from milestones in life, going where the buttoned-down insurance executive had never gone before. Older people in real life don't show as much direct emotion either, and so the role was played well.Acting out his spontaneous affection for the neighbor in the camping park, which was a credible reaction to another person finally recognizing and accepting his anger within, was also met with a a jolt of reality that was again portrayed very realistically and was not your typical Hollywood scene. Several little themes like this in the movie were handled quite realistically and will give many people, especially perhaps an older audience, something to identify with. An entertaining little theme, and sub-plot of its own to me, was his daughter Jeannie's life. It was refreshing to see someone fallen from the usual movie character yuppie role and the sometimes ugly unresolved tensions between adult children and their aging parents told like it privately is. Not since the movie "Baby, it's You" have I seen this kind of parent-offspring realism portrayed. Being in Jeannie's generation I have known people like her and wondered about their parents; this showed it from the parents' point of view wondering about THEM. It was touching to see his attempt to rescue her, albeit from the island he himself was on and needed to rescue himself from. It was also comedic in an almost Woody Allen-esque way. These scenes never did quite gel into a full-blown comedy (although in a more crowded theater if laughter took hold it might be contagious and could have been different--that's how on the verge it was). And the surprise finale to that situation was magnificent in its quiet way-- the empathetic viewer will certainly identify with the surrender and forgiveness despite the misgivings. Again not your typical Hollywood ending. This movie is great for adult children or their parents. Nicholson fans will be pleased but the movie is much more than just his inimitable personality. A little slow at times (for an audience used to helicopter chases) but a well-told story that stays on my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, satirical writing from Alexander Payne, as usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite modern-day filmwriters. His Schmidt so captured the type of man from that era and how he related to his family, his work, his reason for living. It was like watching a movie about my own father (a quote I've often heard from fellow baby-boomers), which doubled the pathos of the film for me.Unfortunately, my own father has never seemed to experience some of the same epiphanies and self-realization that Schmidt did in his retirement. I think by the end of the film he has learned more understanding and empathy for his fellow human beings and has learned to reach out to others more for his rewards in life instead of merely performing rote duties. (Not an indictment of my own father, who is a wonderful man! The point of the film is how so many of us can become trapped in these stifling roles and responsibilities in our life.)For example, I love the way he comes to understand the potential reasons for his wife's old affair when he experiences those same feelings of longing and loneliness himself with an attractive stranger. He's able to come to grips with his anger and it compels him to forgive. Great writing.I can't wait for the next Payne film to arrive. There's so few intelligent films now being made for adults instead of 14-year-olds, they're all the more appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grandly depressing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(8 out of 10) Jack Nicholson continues to get better with age. His acting, that is. His hair, wrinkles and fat accurately reflect the age of his character, Warren Scmidt, 66. Jack (oh, EVERYONE calls him Jack, and you just know who they're talking about) doesn't use any of his devil-grin and devil-eyebrows in this film. No tricks, just great life experience to bring pathos and hilarity to a difficult role.You know what great acting is? It's when you CAN'T SEE they're acting! I LOVED Jack in "As Good As It Gets", and thought he totally deserved his third Oscar. But it was obvious he was ACTING, and we thanked him for it. In 'About Schmidt' he truly seems the 'Everyman', facing the twilight of his life, and reflecting on what he's done with all those years. He will certainly be nominated for another Oscar, and off the top of my head I can't think of a better performance this past year.Kathy Bates is delightful as always, playing yet another eccentric woman. The audience howled when she got in the hot tub with Schmidt! She's the only cast member who holds her own against Jack. The rest of the cast is fine, with a special nod to Dermot Mulroney, playing a loser who doesn't know he's a loser.The problems I had with the movie are that it sometimes didn't ring true, and it missed the mark with some scenes. The funny bits maybe were forced, and not naturally funny enough. The drama wasn't always moving enough. However, if you get into the movie, I DEFY you to not have a tear in your eye at the final scene (the end scene may push Jack over the top for his Academy Award).The writing is very good, but not excellent. The directing is fine. The film properly catches the feelings of growing old, death, and regret. But so what? It's been done before, and so this film sometimes merely winds up depressing.So the only thing to save this movie, and really, the only thing it needs, is Jack. He carries it all, is in virtually every scene, and we watch him like a comfortable old friend. The only Oscar this film may win is Best Actor, and that's just fine with me.</fullReview>

The movie is blunt, and depressing at times, it is easy for someone to become offended or upset as it envokes a critique of ones settings, trivial or no. The Movie satires mediocrity and holding back. Schmidt represents the people who have reached a point in their life when there is a risk of life becoming a living death. I don't have time to give this movie it's dues. So I'll cut it short. Brlliant satire. Stunning performances. apiphinous experience. To all those experiencing depression after this flick, that's a good sign, this film is about the truth in all it's eccentricities and oddities.

		<shortDescription>Finding the Meaning of Life (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel silly warning that there are "spoilers" in this review -- it's not like this is the Crying Game or the Sixth Sense. You don't go through the whole plot of the movie and find out at the end, shock upon shock, that Jack Nicholson's character is actually the long-dead ghost of a transvestite (but that would be pretty wild). If anything, this film contains an almost surprising absence of rigged plotlines and silly twists. In a strange and haunting narration of dry humor and sad moments, you watch a man reach what's been called the Golden Years and wonder what's so damn golden about it. On the verge of Winnebagoing around the country in his new life of retirement, Jack Nicholson's Schmidt is struck by the sudden death of his wife of over 40 years. In thinking about hi wife before her untimely demise, he realizes the spark of their marriage fizzled long ago, and to him, she's nothing but a necessary caretaker with annoying habits. The shock of her death remains muffled by his own ennui about his own measure of his life. His only daughter lives states away, too busy with work to visit, and is about to marry a mullet-sporting, yet sincere, dimwit -- a man unfit to marry (in Schmidt's mind) his perfect, treasured princess. He feels as though he's failed in his professional life, now obsolete, with only dreams and regrets to dig away at him.Before his eyes, he realizes that his life is at the end stretch and he asks the ultimate question: what have I done with my life -- what do I have to show for myself? As he drives his huge, but empty Winnebago out to his daughter's wedding, Schmidt travels the road and the paths of his own thoughts, coming to terms with the ghosts in his life to realize one of life's ultimate truths -- that it isn't what you make of your life, but how you touch others' lives and how they affect your own. In lesser hands, this movie could have been a sappy, sobbing mess, but the story is so rooted in the reality of life, its unfairness, and its quiet moments of grace, that this uninteresting nobody, Schmidt, becomes an elevated figure representing everyone's need to feel a part of this world. Jack Nicholson gives a fantastic performance, portraying private, lost moments of grief when he realizes how important his wife was to him, and how she really was so much more than just a homemaker. He comes to realize his daughter has grown up and that his idealized vision of her as his shining, perfect little girl must be broken to accept the fact that she has her own life and makes decisions that he may not always approve of. In that realization, he makes his own sacrifice and growth as a person, letting go of his unrealistic ideals to show his ultimate contribution to the world -- his ability to be the better man, to wish good upon others, and to not ruin their happiness for the sake of his own. In that moment, while he still feels he is a failure in letting his child enter an unfit marriage, the viewer sees that sometimes it is in the things that you give, even at the expense of your own personal satisfaction, that truly marks your place as a decent human being in the greater scheme of things. In the end, Schmidt eventually realizes this and is finally able to weep, for his wife and for himself.</fullReview>

This has two wonderful effects. First of all, it made me care more about the main character more than I would in a typical film. Secondly, it made the comedy more enjoyable.

While his portrayal of Warren Schmidt sometimes lacks depth and substance and a little more than a few funny faces, his held back performance speaks louder than the rambunctious, trite material that he has been prone to portray the last few years. What I especially liked was the subdued quiet that Alexander Payne achieved in this film, bringing the bleak Nebraska landscape into the minds of those who have never been within its borders. Never has a state looked so downtrodden through he eyes of a talented film maker like Payne. While many may be beguiled by the fact that this may not be a typical `Jack' movie, the lasting appeal of this film will provide another piece of Nicholson's storied career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its about life, Its about you, Its about me, Its about Schmidt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got the chance to see an advance screening here in one of my local cinema. Although the release date was last December, well, it was quite late here then. Having heard that Jack Nicholson has won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture for this, I was curious so i went to see the film.My, my, Jack has not lost his touch. Having seen him in engaging dramas like A Few Good Men, and in the comedy As Good As It Gets, Jack is still amazing and yes he is.Its about Schmidt here as the title says it all. A retired pensioner who has lost himself after the passing of his wife. A father who is concerned about his daughter's choice of her soon-to-be-wed husband. A man who is disillusioned about his life. And what does he do about it? He sets out to do some soul searching and away he went in his brand new RV. Along the way though, he corresponded to a child he has sponsored. And through his letters, we see Schmidt pouring out all his anger and frustrations that he has pent up in him all these years. Although we never get to meet the boy, in the end we see the child bringing tears to eyes of Mr. Schmidt. Throughout the movie, i noticed many life events that has affected Schmidt; his retirement, the passing of a loved one, the marriage of your offspring, and the impending predicament of you own passing. Schmidt represents the kind of fears that we all will have once we are pass our prime. However, we see Schmidt trying to make a difference in his life and the people around him even at this age. What can i say? Its about life, Its about you, Its about me, Its about Schmidt.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first great film of 2003!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsA film that took the Golden Globes by storm by rights should do the same at Tinseltown.About Schmidt is a fine film that firmly re-establishes Jack Nicholson as a top ranking Hollywood star,despite now being 65 years of age.And it's great to see him acting this rather than playing it down,as a retired pensioner who becomes disillusioned with life after his wife's sudden death and his dissatisfaction with his daughter's fiance.One of the driving and most enthralling character's of the film that Schmidt develops a relationship with however,is one that we never see ,a Nigerian boy named Nubagu,whom sponsoring gives him a sense of purpose and fulfillment in his life.It's the letters he writes to him that provides the film it's most powerful and not-to-mention comedic scenes,as he vents his frustration on the things that hinder his path to a rewarding retirement.Warren Schmidt will surely emerge as one of the most endearing characters of the year,because he embodies all the worries and potential traumas that late-in-life retirement could bring.Nicholson plays him with endearing realness,which in turn pays off in the final reel.One of the most involving and funny films of the year.*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seem to be more movies coming out where to really appreciate them, you need to be of a certain age. I found that with Far from Heaven, and I find it with About Schmidt. The trouble is, this time I'm about twenty years too early.I wouldn't call this film either a comedy or a drama. It's more like a character study, with Jack Nicholson playing your kindly next door neighbour - or worse, your dad. While I didn't find it out and out hilarious, there is some beautiful comedy in here. The rebellion in the bathroom. The waterbed incident. Grocery shopping. The ribbons display. Wow, well SEEN, guys.I would also love to see Kathy Bates and Howard Hessman star in a show together. Don't take this the wrong way, but I start to laugh just looking at them. Besides, nobody swears like Kathy Bates.But like a trip across the prairies, the rest of the movie takes a little long. I kept waiting for Jack to just snap and get raging, freaking, vein-popping angry. I wanted him to total Len Carou's car with his motorhome. But instead of unleashing all his sadness and anger, he stays calm; as calm as, well, as a retired insurance salesman. Which is true to the character but, to me, kind of dull for a movie.This movie is a time capsule - and probably a warning. I expect to be squirming in my seat when I watch it again in twenty years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson was simply incredible in this movie. The range of emotions he displays, mostly through just body language and his eyes, is astounding. This movie had me laughing, crying, and cheering. It's that good.Ah, but there's a catch. As much as I hate to admit it, this movie might be for the young of heart ... but not for the young. The average age of people in the theater was about fifty. The movie is drenched in adult humor, much of it beyond those who haven't yet suffered decades of the dreary repetition of a job and a life they learn to hate. Oddly enough, Nicholson makes this not only tolerable, but somehow more justified.If you're over fifty, you have GOT to see this movie. If you're younger than forty, I'd still recommend it. But don't expect laser beams and six-dimensional warlords trying to conquer the universe. It's just a love story of a man who forgot what life is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite movies are those ones that portray a person absolutely at the end of their rope and then before it's over -- somehow -- the person manages to find some hope -- movies like It's a Wonderful Life.What a great production job in this movie creating such a gray, Class C, low quality world for Schmidt to live in. It was depressing -- even more so to realize how familiar it was.What a great actor Nicholson is. This guy Schmidt - I was agonizing for him. I could sense how hard he was working to try to keep his desperation below the surface. Thank goodness for a few laughs in the movie to give me a break. But the ending made it worth it for me. Very sweet.For some reason, I keep thinking about this movie since I saw it. That's how I judge the good ones. I give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing, thought provoking look at crisis (SPOILERS).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "About Schmidt" in a nearly empty theatre; and it turned out to be a great advantage for me.Jack Nicholson in his twilight years has come back with a vengeance and turned in some of the most powerful performances of his career. And this performance is most decidedly one of his best.In the film, Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt, a retiring executive of an insurance firm in Omaha, Nebraska. The opening scene depicts the last twenty seconds or so of his career as being about the most boring as that of anybody who spent so many years co-leading one of the largest firms in the city. Without party or celebration, he gets up from his emptied office and, without saying a word, quietly turns off the light and leaves. Schmidt's life from there seems more or less usual. Little talk with his wife; less talk with the young kid who took his place.The only reason for his staying alive, his only child, is engaged to marry in a few weeks, which means he'll see his daughter even less than before. His only solace is to vent his feelings, and he's found that avenue when he begins to sponsor Ndugu, a 6-year old orphaned boy living in Tanzania. His charity encourages sponsors to include letters if they wish with their monthly donations, and Schmidt feels some relief with both helping a little boy survive and being able to relieve the stress of his life via writing.The stress of his pride and joy marrying some punk who sells waterbeds is multiplied one-hundred fold when his wife suddenly dies. With no one at the house to take care of him, Warren turns into a massively depressed widower. With only Ndugu to talk to, Schmidt decides to take a long trip in their new RV.In time, Schmidt arrives in town for his daughter's wedding. His life takes only a turn for the worse when he meets his entire extended family, who turn out to be a broken and pathetic family. But his daughter loves the guy, and there's no convincing her otherwise.In the end, Scmidt comes back home facing loneliness, but finds that Ndugu has sent a painting that he made for Warren. At that, the sight of a new hope and reason for living, Schmidt breaks up and cries for the only time throughout the film.Schmidts' crises, the reality of aging, the death of his wife and the marriage of his daughter, take an enormous toll on Warren's life and demeanor; but in the end, he's revived and willing to try life again.With a plot as simple as this, this film is amazingly engaging and entertaining. It's thoroughly gripping and won't let go. The few people with me in that theatre were either sniffling or flat-out bawling. Hats off to Nicholson for such a screen presence to carry the film almost single-handedly.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson gives his best performance to date as a sad widower living alone for the first time in his life, and visiting around the U.S. in his top-of-the-line R.V. Another great performance is given by Oscar winner Kathy Bates. She plays the mother of a sleazy, Joe Dirt-like waterbed salesman who is marrying Jack Nicholson's daughter.

		<fullReview>Watching this movie is like watching a great pilot episode on TV and discovering after you've seen it that the show has been canceled. This film is so earthy that it captures you immediately and puts you in the position the characters are in. The screenwriting, direction, and acting are perfect, almost to the point of disbelief. Great performances abound, even beyond that of Nicholson. In particular Kathy Bates is easily the best support role I have seen in a long, long time. She does her character so well, it is almost as if she was the person written in the film. Ultimately therein lies the problem. Once the stage has been set and the characters introduced, the lights come up. Ultimately the film doesn't know where to leave us once it has captured our imagination. This is easily one of the best films of 2003, but only because of shear technical ability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On receiving his best actor Golden Globe for About Schmidt earlier this week, Jack Nicholson said: `I don't know whether to be ashamed or happy, because I thought we made a comedy.'He's not the only one. The poster for the film depicts him with a cartoon-like thundercloud above his head, suggesting a new take on Grumpy Old Men. And the critics' quotes are all along the lines of `a super soar-away comic slam-dunk of a movie'. This is all extremely misleading, if not downright stupid.Only The Independent newspaper correctly, I my view, identifies it as a `bitter satire'. It is a remarkable, beautifully shot film, but it's no feel-good movie.In fact, it's almost anti-Hollywood: with no reassuring affirmations of how great life really is, it's the complete opposite of escapism.Starkly shot in desolate Omaha, Nebraska, and working-class Colorado, Nicholson plays an insurance executive who is hit with retirement after 30-odd years, followed soon after by the sudden death of his wife. Even the opening interior shot tells you so much: Warren Schmidt sitting in his packed-up office waiting, with no irony, until the exact second of 5pm before he leave on his final day as at Woodmen Worldwide.Sunshine is absent and the settings of the movie are homogenised, plastic 21st Century US where the Pioneers' progress of the States becomes a mini-theme park at a shopping mall. It's real Americana? the kind people live with every day.Schmidt's best friend uses the word `superficial' early on, in a drunken speech at his retirement dinner. And this is the essence of the satire: the superficiality of life in the Western world in general.The screenplay ? by the film's director Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor ? also won a Golden Globe. But it is Nicholson's face which makes the underplayed, almost banal wording so brilliant. Almost everything that is said to Schmidt in the film is an ultimately pointless platitude. And you can see it in Nicholson's face: it's a mixture of bemusement and disgust.Schmidt's true feelings are made clear using a clever device, presumably taken from Louis Blegley's original novel (which I have not read). Just before his wife dies, he becomes the sponsor of a six-year-old orphan in Tanzania, sending the child a monthly $22 cheque. In his first letter to his `foster child' he starts inoffensively enough and then launches into a ruthless attack on his wife of 42 years, saying that everything about her irritates him and writing: `Who is this old woman living in my house?' When she suddenly dies, of course, he goes to pieces.He suffers a pyjamas-in-the-supermarket crisis that isn't helped by the fact that, as a veteran insurance actuary, he can calculate that ? at 66 (virtually Nicholson's real age) and given his socio-economic details ? he has nine years left to live.Mrs Schmidt had persuaded him to buy a huge Winnebago motor home and his subsequent experiences involve his driving this monster across the US to Denver to the one remaining light in his life: his daughter, Jeannie (Hope Davis).It has to be said that there are funny moments on this journey, but they are all set within the overall pathos of the film (and shouldn't be taken out of context in trailers). The incidental and end-credit music is unrelentingly chirpy and uplifting. I sincerely hope this is irony on the part of the film-makers.The direction of this film, unlike so many, is very difficult to predict. Jeannie's wedding is perhaps an obvious denouement, but, in Schmidt's view, she's marrying a second-generation hippy `nincompoop' called Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney). He's just not `up to snuff' for Schmidt's little girl. Which way will Schmidt go?There's a scene where he's staying at the home of his future son-in-law's mother (played powerfully by Kathy Bates), just before the wedding ? sleeping in Randall's old room. There are many rosettes pinned to the wall marked only with the word `participant' and a framed certificate stating only that the waterbed salesman completed a course `with perfect attendance'.Randall's no rocket scientist but we can all see that Jeannie ? virtually ignored by her father until retirement and bereavement snapped him out of his unquestioning existence ? just wants to be with her fiancé.So we just don't know whether we should sympathise with Schmidt. He's self-centred, miserly and narrow-minded. But he truly appears to be seeking something other than a futile existence. But even this is flawed: is it the meaning of life he's after or is he going off the rails simply because he only made it to assistant vice-president of a Nebraska insurance company and not the cover of Time magazine?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Positive Impression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The viewer serves as Warren Schmidt's companion while he tries to find a life after retirement. I really like this film although the foundation is rather weak: Jack Nicholson portrays an actuary who seems not too sharp. Isn't an actuary supposed to be among the brightest of insurance people? Wife Helen does not fit as the wife of an actuary, and her household decor is in need of something -- anything. Daughter Jeannie, I guess, takes after the mother (assuming Warren has some smarts). Her hooking up with loverboy Randall and his unique family makes for a funny story but an unpleasant life. Don't you just want to clean Kathy Bates' house, within and without? Those in charge of set decoration must have had fun. The Milk-Bone on the table is a gem, and that brother is the perfect consumer of said biscuits. Hope lies with the orphaned boy, and we all shared Warren's response at the end. I listened in on a lobby conversation among four retired men who agree that, having seen this film, their lives are not so bad. To assuage the fears of those who have not seen About Schmidt, the hot tub scene with an unclothed Kathy Bates is brief, but you'll grimace and shudder anyway, just anticipating the unthinkable. Bates is hilarious, especially her mother-of-the-groom attire. Nicholson is excellent, but he is still Colonel Nathan Jessup in my one-way mind. See the film, ride along with Warren in his huge RV, and find happiness in an unexpected source. Oscar-worthy? No -- but good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Very Shocking Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ABOUT SCHMIDT is a very shocking movie. It is shocking in that no one in the movie is good looking. The conversations on the whole are quite banal and general. There is no spicy banter or sharp one liners. The characters are all happy at keeping things at a status quo. There are no wild scenarios or tense confrontations. There are no exotic locales or exciting settings (It takes place in Omaha, Nebraska for God's sake!!) It also digs deeper than most films, dwelling on certain aspects of life and our existence that most films avoid at any cost. It also doesn't try to sugar coat them with any easy answers. It is basically about a 66 year old retired man who tries to come to terms with a certain inner sadness. A sadness that stems from the fact that he feels he has made no impact in life or on anyone. That by and large there is a certain insignificance in our existence. We are simply a minor supporting character in the ever evolving film of life. Nicholson at first seems like a odd choice for such a role. After all he is a living legend and has always seemed so bigger than life. Yet career wise it seems like a perfect fit. After roaming the country in EASY RIDER and FIVE EASY PIECES as the angry young man it seems only appropriate to do one for his 'golden years'. It's a sort of 'coming home' journey that completes the cycle. He also gives his most restrained performance since KING OF THE MARVIN GARDENS. Yet what really makes this film a success is director Payne and his attention to detail. These characters really do embody the traits of everyday people. It's almost like watching someone's home movie. Like when Nicholson walks into the suburban home of his son in laws family. It looks so perfectly like all the other suburban homes one has walked into in their lives, with it's odd color schemes and various clutter, that you can almost get a sense of that lived in house smell you get when you first walk in.  Overall despite it's rather somber tone and subject matter this is really and a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. Basically because it emphasizes coping and accepting limits without making it as a defeat. It shows how we all share a certain insignificance and yet can still be significant to others in other ways. You don't have to be 'old' to get this movie or relate to it's message. It would be especially good for those who question why they are here or what their place is.</fullReview>

As Warren tries to find his way in this new world, struggling to define himself, we are drawn into laughter and tears. the only outlet Warren has for revealing the details of his life is to a foster child in Africa, whom he hurriedly sponsors at the end of a TV starvation plea. Warren tries to create a relationship with his soon to be married daughter even though he despises his future son-in-law. Every communication Warren makes is difficult. He is appalled at the free spiritedness of Kathy Bates' character whom he has to stay with. The hot tub scene surely has to go down in movie history. Hallelujah Kathy. I gave it an 8 out of 10, great script, some heartfelt laughs and superb performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`About Schmidt' provides Jack Nicholson with a role virtually guaranteed to earn him another Best Actor Oscar to go along with the ones he garnered for `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and `As Good as it Gets.' Here he plays a 66-year old man coming to terms with the reality of his own aging and trying to figure out the meaning of the life he has lived. Warren Schmidt, like so many men his age, finds that the end of life is really made up of a series of losses ? of careers, of spouses, of the hopes and dreams that come with youth. Upon retirement, Warren feels not only that he has little purpose or direction left in his life, but that the insurance job to which he devoted almost all his time and energy was an empty enterprise, evidenced by the fact that all his old files have been thrown unceremoniously into the company junk pile (a metaphor for himself, perhaps) and that a young upstart has so quickly and so easily taken his place in the corporation. Adding to Warren's misery is the fact that this newcomer treats Warren with the kind of patronizing dismissiveness that reduces the veteran to a complete nonentity. Warren can no longer stand his wife of 42 years, a woman whose every idiosyncrasy drives him to distraction, yet her death early on in the film leaves Warren feeling utterly bereft and desolated. Warren's daughter, whom he loves dearly, keeps a cool distance from the father whom she feels lost interest in her and her life many years back and, hence, no longer has the right to voice objections to the husband she has chosen for herself, a smooth-talking car salesman replete with a pigtail, a bottomless goatee, and a coterie of off-the-wall relatives. `About Schmidt,' for much of its length, is structured like a road picture, as Warren takes to the highway in the mobile home he and his wife had bought for his retirement years but which he now travels in alone, stopping off at various locations in Nebraska and Kansas that played an important role in his early life, and ending up in Denver to try and talk some sense into his daughter on the eve of her wedding before she makes what he feels will be a fatal mistake in her life. The best part about the Alexander Payne screenplay (based on the novel by Louis Begley), is that it feels generally spontaneous in nature. The author is not afraid to take detours off the basic path of the story and he doesn't feel obligated to tie up all the loose ends into a nice, bright, prettily wrapped package at the end. Warren comes to some pretty sober realizations about the minimal effect one individual's life can really have on the world around him. Warren discovers that, painful as it may be to acknowledge, we all end up making compromises in this world which come to determine the kinds of lives we end up living. In the end, with few exceptions, most of us achieve a kind of bland mediocrity that fills us with regret only after it is too late to do anything about it. This is the direction Warren sees his daughter's life taking, and he wants desperately to help divert her on to a better path while there is still time. Ultimately, however, he comes to realize that he is no position to affect that kind of radical change in another person's life and so he sadly conforms to the social amenities called for by the occasion and makes a `heartfelt' wedding reception toast to his daughter's happiness. In fact, in the closing scene, he learns that it might be easier to actually leave one's mark on the world by going outside the confines of one's own immediate family and environment. `About Schmidt' is almost brutally frank about such topics as the effects of aging on both the body and the spirit, the loss of love that occurs between husbands and wives after too long a time together, and the regret that comes with a life lived with no real passion or purpose. Yet, the film itself is often slyly witty in tone, even though the humor is, occasionally, a bit more broad than it needs to be (Warren's slapstick struggle with a waterbed is a prime example). Credit for bringing out the script's subtle comic richness goes primarily to Nicholson and the wonderful Kathy Bates, who plays Jeannie's eccentric future mother-in-law and manages to steal every single scene she is in. As director, Payne establishes a reflective, almost melancholy rhythm, one that allows the scenes to play themselves out with little sense of artificiality or hurry. The bleak, Midwest landscape, through which Warren makes his epochal journey, provides an appropriately stark backdrop for this sad little tale, and Rolfe Kent's simple, haunting musical score enhances that feeling.Finally, of course, we have Mr. Nicholson himself. Rarely before has this phenomenal actor seemed so at one with the character he is playing. Stoop-shouldered and jowl-faced, Nicholson literally inhabits this man from first scene to last, making him a completely believable individual whose every action and reaction we can empathize with thoroughly and whom we come to care very deeply about by the end. Nicholson's is a bravura, tour-de-force performance.Unlike most films, `About Schmidt' stays true to the seriousness of its subject, providing us only with a slight ray of hope at the end and some moments of sly humor along the way to help us through its dark, often painful reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated, but fascinating portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few that can deny Jack Nicholson's status as one of the greatest actors ever. His larger than life presence has inhabited some of the most interesting characters ever created on film. As my fiance likes to comment almost every times we watch a movie with him in it, "That was pure Jack". What was interesting in this film was how Jack Nicolson's persona disappeared in this movie, leaving the viewer with a recently retired 66 year old man like many other older men that I am sure we have all known in our lives at one time or another. I can't recall there being a single scene in About Schmidt that did not contain the title character (and you can correct me if I am wrong), making it very much a study of this one particular regular guy, who can sometimes be a real jerk, and how he copes with huge life changes. All the people were very real in About Schmidt. They made me laugh, they made me cry, they made me feel very uncomfortable at times. This movie was depressing in a way, but do all movies have to make us feel happy at the end? I read somewhere here that someone thought that About Schmidt hammered to viewer over the head with the pointlessness of life, and in a way it does show that. But it also shows that people can make a change, however small and pathetic it may seem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There should be a separate category for nicholson movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and for those few hollywood products that feature actors and actresses who make the screen **sparkle**.This happens not only because Nicholson's Schmidt is so tightly played (to the point of being a character who is a bore without being boring) but the stellar (and way too short) appearance of Kathy Bates. It's too bad Hollywood relies so much on women's roles played by young, thin look-pretties who can't deliver a line. Bates provides a wonderful counterpoint to Nicholson's, but without going over the top. (I would not have minded if they had both gone ballistic, but that would have been a different movie entirely.) Although Bates provides the main support, Mulroney and Davis do well in their more minor roles of support, crafting fairly complex characters to help explain more "about Schmidt". I'm sure the other supporting roles would have done better with a longer editing, but this is still a main stream movie (although it made it to our local art house) and as such had to be of "regular" length.A good watch, and one of the best out of hollywood for the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Final Score: 6.0 (out of 10)***Possible Spoilers***With his last movie, the brilliant, subtle, acerbic "Election", Alexander Payne made a name for himself with me by using a style that was sarcastic, smug, but generally objective about it's lead characters without any clear heroes or villains. The movie seemed to be told in 3rd person from many points of view and, while it threw the L-word around a lot, there (intentionally so) didn't seem to be a genuine moment in the movie. Payne stood at a distance, satirizing everything. Here we have "About Schmidt", Payne's follow-up, where he appears to be trying to prove that he has a heart. He dives right into this story and wallows around in Schmidt's feelings of loneliness, isolation and shallow induced sadness. The story is fairly basic, but this is an actor's movie and it's most effective moments are the one's where we just follow Jack Nicholson around as he revisits his past and tours roadside historical landmarks. It also feature stellar turns from Hope Davis (who I love), Kathy Bates and a hilarious Dermot Mulroney as the quintessential hillbilly- complete with balding mullet, goatee and get rich quick pyramid scheme plans. The movie is also at it's high when Schmidt writes to his 6 year old adopted foster child from a 3rd world country, Ndugu. The letters are funny in the sense that Schmidt speaks well over Ndugu's head (swearing and talking about insurance and pledging fraternities), but there is a real sweetness to it: Schmidt is giving this unloved child fatherly advice. It's that cuteness and sense of realism and honesty that make "About Schmidt" watchable.However, as I mentioned, the performances clank around in a generally unimaginative and predictable film. It's tone swings wildly from syrupy sweet to sarcastic or oddball. It is a sad portrait of a sad man in a generally sad movie- the kind of portrait we have seen in abundance recently from "American Beauty" to "Fight Club". The defining moment in the film is the payoff in the final scene which will either win you over or turn you off. To me it was completely predictable and something, had Schmidt not been so shallow, he should have gotten much earlier. It makes the whole film seem like a commercial for adopting foster children, but Nicholson still pulls it off (which is why I admire him so much in this film- it's easy to be good in a really good movie) and sweeps you up with the expressions on his face and the look in his eyes. Still, staring at that picture and watching Schmidt's face and reviewing the events that just occured, I couldn't help but feel manipulated. Doesn't matter anyway, when "About Schmidt" is over all anyone is going to be talking about is Kathy Bate's gutsy nude scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MOVIE REVIEW: ABOUT SCHMIDT [Rated R]This movie depicts the lead actor in the best role I have seen him play. Mainly because he played a role that was exactly what Jack Nicholson of Brick, NJ is not. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award with Jack &amp; Kathy also getting acting nominations.Although it related to a retiree, it is something that our young should also see since it is the story of Warren Schmidt who didn't prepare well enough for his retirement.As a retired executive of a large company, I should have been able to identify more with him. However; I did not because I have so many interests in life that I did not find retirement so empty and boring as he did. It is very funny ...and at the same time very sad. It will affect people differently depending on their outlook of things but it SURELY will have a profound affect on YOU one way or another.I found Schmidt's letters to 6 year old Ndugu of Tanzania of key interest in this film in that it gave us the only way to really learn what this colorless guy Warren Schmidt was all about. The letters were also very humorous coming from Mr. Schmidt. As Roger Ebert - who gave it 3 1/2 stars - says in his review: "Most teenagers will probably not be drawn to this movie, but they should attend. Let it be a lesson to them. If they define their lives only in terms of a good job, a good paycheck and a comfortable suburban existence, they could end up like Schmidt, dead in the water." Ed of Aberdeen - who gave it 4 out of 4 stars - says: "You will find it to be two hours of great entertainment and I highly recommend it. I will be surprised if it is not nominated for an OSCAR."</fullReview>

Unfortunately the movie never allows Schmidt to break out of his isolation, selfishness, and shallowness. Instead we get a sappy ending. Hard to feel sorry for, or to empathize with such a klutz and bore. The question is...is the director commenting on how difficult, impossible it is for a man to break out of his shallowness after a lifetime of being in a self-imposed prison? Or is the director just shallow himself, and thinks that Schmidt has "woken up?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson Portrays Bleak, Heartfelt Retiree In Sturdy Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt is an extraordinary film, and we have Jack Nicholson to thank for it. We're grateful not just for his excellent performance, but for achieving what movie moguls consider unthinkable. Jack, now age 65, shows that a character who is a retiree, a senior citizen, can star in a marketable film. He reveals and deals with all aspects of aging: the extra weight, sagging skin, reduced libido, and diminished capacity to enjoy life. (Many of these attributes can be diminished, if not eliminated, if we try.)The circumstances of losing a spouse, struggling with independence after a long marriage, grown children wanting to separate from parents, and disillusionment from retiring are painfully believable. Schmidt's thoughts are very clear since he narrates the film, including his sponsorship of an African boy and his refreshing cross-country trip across Kansas &amp; Nebraska. Nicholson fans will be satisfied to see that his well-known cynicism and irony reveal themselves in his narration. His characterization of Schmidt ? a retired insurance executive who appears in every scene and is almost devoid of emotion -- is a complete departure from the volatile, explosive personality he usually portrays.About Schmidt challenges us to explore whether a corporate management job is meaningful, what makes life worthwhile, and whether parents' intervening in the lives of grown children is meddling or helpful advice. Despite the movie's capacity to wear us down with weighty issues, it entertains us by introducing fascinating characters and unpredictable situations. It ends on an appropriately poignant note, with scattered audience applause. We see that the formula found in most box-office mega hits -- violence, special effects, young photogenic stars, characters easily identifiable as good or bad, and a happy ending with lovers uniting or villains vanquished ? can be turned aside for more nourishing entertainment. A good story and candid dialogue still matter, and Schmidt delivers on both counts. As someone who grew up admiring Jack Nicholson as a counter-culture figure in Easy Rider, I find his ability to still command center stage inspirational. At least in this film, the coveted 25-49 media demographic plays a secondary role to Jack and his near contemporary, Kathy Bates. It's hard to imagine a lesser actor or personality pulling this off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in his familiar Midwest, after tackling such life-and-death issues as abortion in Citizen Ruth and high school politics in Election, Alexander Payne wanders through the flat landscapes as he follows an ordinary man's journey of self discovery. The director's latest, About Schmidt takes its time to develop as it introduces us to Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson), who at 66 is retiring from a lifetime of service as an actuary, is coping with his wife's sudden death and has to stomach his only daughter's marriage to a halfwit. Schmidt's excellent adventure aboard his 35-foot motor home climaxes in an impassioned attempt to stop the wedding after meeting the groom's boorish family. Kathy Bates is a hoot as the free-spirited mother-in-law, but this is all about Jack. His understated performance is heartbreaking as he embraces his physical maturity to solidify the character's distress. His crossroads happen to be Midwestern in kind, but Payne's sharp comedy reaches beyond the plains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"About" a non-surprising surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> In the course of critiquing films, one is bound to stumble across one so shocking and so unexpected that it leaves the reviewer gasping for words. This was something of the case after I saw `About Schmidt,' but in other ways this description is the farthest thing from the truth. The end of the film is a mundane and non-surprising, but the element it gives is nothing but a surprise. Maybe I'm babbling here, but follow along and maybe you will see my point. Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is bored. Having recently retired as an actuary at a major Omaha insurance company, only to be replaced by a young nitwit, Schmidt is questioning his entire life, including Helen (June Squibb), his wife of forty-two years who he professes to have woken up and wondered `Who is this woman sleeping next to me?' Schmidt's only consolation and relief to this new found life of retired `ease' is Ndugu, a Tanzanian orphan that he has `adopted' for $22 a month and has taken to writing long epistles detailing his fears. But Schmidt's orderly life is turned upside down when his wife suddenly dies. This tragedy causes him to set off on a roadtrip through the Great Plains and his soul to Denver where his daughter, Jeannie (Hope Davies) is preparing to get married to Randall Herzel (Dermot Mulroney), a waterbed salesman with a balding mullet (you'll see). In Denver, he will have a, uh, personal encounter with his future son-in-law's nutty mother (Kathy Bates), which adds to the impact on a life of order. What amazed me most about `About Schmidt,' is director Alexander Payne's use of silence. It sounds crazy, but in this world of sound, the occasional meditative aura of silence improves this film by leaps and bounds because it is a technical trick seen in a very few other movies of the modern era. But the silence would not be nearly as effective without Jack Nicholson as the star. To just go into a cinema to watch Nicholson's facial expressions is an experience that ANY theater buff or prospective actor should do. Nicholson, without a doubt, carries the film like few other actors of his, or any other generation could aptly do. Along with Jack, actress Kathy Bates gives a standout performance. She is able to juxtapose herself with the taciturn Nicholson that runs the gamut from the extroverted Roberta (her character) to the introvert Schmidt. I also grudgingly have to give props to Bates for her courage. Why, you ask? Well, you need to see it to believe it. There is one other thing of note that I mustn't fail to mention-the unique plot device of the voiceover letter. Clearly the highlight of the film, the several letters that Schmidt writes to his African sponsored child are some of the funniest works of writing that I have ever seen. Truly, the entire audience cracks up to hear the familiar beginning to words of wisdom, `Dear Ndugu?' `About Schmidt' is all about modern philosophy and satire. This is a movie about ordinary people doing fairly ordinary things and living fairly ordinary lives as they try to impact the lives of others. Philosophy speaks through the film that the need to impact other's lives is a needed part of the soul, which provides food for thought from an arena better known for food from the popper. I liked this film a lot, but it unsettled me at times, but not enough to prevent my bestowing a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many people, I expected that "About Schmidt" would be a great film, out-doing the greatness of "Gangs of New York" and "Lord of the Rings".I was sadly mistaken. Not even the exceptional talents of Jack Nicholson could have improved the meandering script, the uninteresting relationships, and the overdone plot.I have seen and read about enough old men, who having lived their lives without any thought or merit, try to make up for it all-and this film makes a little African boy's picture enough to reconcile this problem for Schmidt. Ultimately, this film adds nothing new to this exploration of the human condition, it lies about life and tries to make the audience accept it.In an attempt to give Warren Schmidt some meaning and direction for his life, the script has him run into all sorts of the things, like a commercial asking for donations to help feed Poor and Starving African children, or a box of letters proving that his recently-deceased wife was having an affair with his best friends. First of all-who cares? Second of all, I feel cheated that the writer would create a story out of such arbitrary occurrences, rather than penetrating the faults and deep emotions of the main character. This film was script driven, not plot or character driven-but it kept trying to pretend that this was life happening.As for Jack, I did say that he has exceptional talent as an actor. Yes, he can convey a wide array of emotions with a twitch of his brow and a blink of his eye-but if there is no story giving any of this relevance, what value does it have? And for the record-what was the story? Schmidt finding the meaning of his life in helping an African child? Trying to make amends to his estranged daughter? Learning what a selfish fool he has been and doing something about it? The script refuses to focus on anything, and all these elements suffer.I walked away feeling that Schmidt's life was even more pointless at the end of the film than at the beginning, but the film wanted us to think that all of his troubles somehow amounted to something, especially with that run-of-the-mill drawing by Ndugu. Bathetic to the lowest degree! Sorry, folks. That won't work for me. You cannot make me believe the exact opposite of what the screen is showing. And Jack's tearful ending makes no difference.Last of all, seeing Kathy Bates "au naturel" was unecessary, and the merit or lack thereof of the fiancé was so muddled, I just gave up trying to understand.American cinema has got to do better than pretend to be artistic.Jack, find better work, or quit while you're ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many 'User Comments' whine and cry about many different movies and how they have propaganda written all over them. 99% of them have been far from the truth, yet ABOUT SCHMIDT would be a reasonable complaint that propaganda could be started from this movie. I remember in RKO 281, Orson Welles said that "people watch movies to watch themselves," or something along those lines. ABOUT SCHMIDT has that effect, though many people when they pursue a normal life and then hit retirement may look back at themselves like this. Jack Nicholson portrays a brilliant character study in a movie that will doubtfully make big numbers at the box office due to its views.After 42 years of work, Warren Schmidt has retired. What do you do?There are a few problems with this movie. First off, could you call it a movie? ABOUT SCHMIDT takes so many breaks to study Warren that it can become draining. The supporting cast saves us from joining Warren in his desperate search for himself. Secondly, the idea of a character study does not appeal to everyone, and despite Nicholson's positively brilliant performance (his monologue during the wedding was excellent, as was soul searching in the stars), ABOUT SCHMIDT feels long. There is no bad acting in this movie, but I can already feel dissenting voices against the critics who love Schmidt. It is hardly an uplifting experience, but ABOUT SCHMIDT will not betray anyone who loves Jack's study on human behavior. It has a nice ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About JACK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best of the year. It is directed with a quiet ambiance and stillness by Alexander Payne that reflects the situation affecting its main character. Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) has just retired from the insurance business and his wife suddenly passes away. His daughter is about to marry a man he doesn't approve of and throughout all of this, he looks back on his life and feels like he's accomplished very little or nothing and that his contribution to the world will be insignificant. Based on the novel by Louis Begley, Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor have crafted an adapted screenplay full of ordinary and yet powerful observations on life. This is a little like an 'American Beauty' on geriatrics only with a more sympathetic feeling. Very little music score is used and the contributions of the supporting role including Kathy Bates, Hope Davis and Dermot Mulroney are terrific as well. This is a picture for those who REALLY appreciate the art of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern-day Everyman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" is cinema at its best, what moviemaking should be all about. Jack Nicholson (as Warren Schmidt) is a modern-day Everyman. Like all of us, he spends a lifetime pursuing a career and fearing he has nothing to show for it, caring for a wife and family and still doubting that he has made a lasting impact. He sees all of the people and things he valued slip from his grasp, and we share his loss, bewilderment, grief and pain. Kathy Bates serves as a perfect foil for Nicholson, with her portrayal of a woman with a healthy appetite for life and a no-nonsense attitude that is diametrically opposed to the quiet rage and flat emotionless response of Nicholson's character. In the end, Schmidt finds new meaning in life and a new way to contribute to the world. His triumph, as much as his tragedy, is ours too. When the lights go up on "About Schmidt", we are all uplifted and redeemed.</fullReview>

Warren Schmidt's life was his work; his wife an aging stranger who occupies his home and whose snoring disturbs his quiet. He is completely unable to take care of himself or his home when he retires and his wife dies. There's a whole world out there which he doesn't understand because his life was his work and his wife managed everything else for him. He finds himself lonesome for someone whom he probably never really knew.Here's where the subtle optimism of this movie comes into play. When Schmidt can no longer bear the squalor of his widowed life, he goes on a road trip in his Winnebago to visit his daughter, hoping that she'll take care of him as her late mother did. He futilely attempts to find some meaning or purpose for his life. He attempts to retrace his childhood. He misinterprets the sympathy of a stranger for sexual advances. He journals his feelings in letters he writes to a 6-year old African child whom he sponsors. He ultimately acquires a tiny bit of humanity, grace and perhaps redemption.Leaving the movie I heard a woman remark that she didn't like the ending of the movie. Although I didn't ask her what she meant, my guess is that she didn't find it upbeat or optimistic enough. I would have told her this: most of us leave the earth with little insight into our lives and ourselves. We all-too-rarely make amends, tell others how we feel about them, or take stock of our lives. Perhaps redemption only comes in teaspoon-size, about the size of Schmidt's tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that I just loved about this movie was the use of silence. I didn't realize how much music &amp; sound they pack into movies until seeing this one, when I realized that the only thing I was hearing was the audience. It's just amazing, and so perfectly used and it brilliantly states the point.I don't think I've ever seen a movie like this before. So unique and so frighteningly real. Jack's performance was extremely heartfelt and stunning, and I think this film will change the way I look at, treat, and think about "old people." 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just another brilliant performance by one of the greatest actor, Jack Nicholson. I liked the start of the movie with the different shots of the Woodmen tower. Touching story, compassionate movie about a guy, Warren Schmidt, who's entering a new phase of his life, retirement. And it's a time for soul searching. Warren, 66 years old, goes on a road trip with his R.V. Some scene are predictable but it didn't bother me that much cause the rest of the film is great. I also like the technique used by Alexander Payne to make us know how Warren feels. His letters to Ngudu are strong on emotion, even if they make us laugh. Interestingly enough, there were people, at the end of the movie, distributing pamphlets about fostering a kid in Africa. Supporting cast was also great.Out of 100, I give it 87. That's good for ***? out of ****.Seen in Toronto, at the Cumberland Cinemas, on December 29th, 2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Coming of Age film, without the 'Coming of Age'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Director Alexander Payne first caught my eye with his 1999 eye opener?Election'. Matthew Broderick and an undiscovered Reese Witherspoon starredin that fine film dealing with conflict and pride. In his newest outing, Payne directs the sublime Jack Nicholson in one of his richest roles and conflict and pride are also brought to the forefront in a delightful little film entitled ?About Schmidt'. Payne engineers a rich screenplay which stems from a novel by LouisBegley. Payne's screenplay allows Nicholson to show a wide array of rangeand depth as his Warren Schmidt is a character befuddled by inner angst and a lack of true satisfaction with life. Payne sets the story in his hometown ofOmaha,Nebraska ( One of the Theatre Marquis in Omaha showed the title for?Sideways', Payne's yet to be released Project). and uses the simplistic setting to retell the complicated story of a retired Assistant Vice President of anInsurance carrier who must deal with his abrupt end to normality.  Or so one thinks. As the film unravels, we are introduced to a myriad of characters and dilemmas as Warren Schmidt makes us understand themonotony and tediousness of his life. Payne opens the film with a smart little series of shots displaying the building where Schmidt works. After a quirky few shots presenting the high rise building as the centerpiece in the middle of a small town, Payne thrusts the viewer right into the empty office of a lonesome Schmidt counting down the seconds until his retirement. Without saying a word for the first three minutes of the film, we can already feel the loneliness and discontent of this man. Payne unravels his characters at a ?snails pace' intentionally so the audience can appreciate and understand the complexities of these well writtencharacters. Schmidt's biggest complexity is his unhappiness. The characterdeliciously incarnated by Jack Nicholson is a treat to watch as he wrestles with his inner angst. Payne's screenplay tackles issues many grapple with on aregular basis: Have I made a difference in the world? Was my life worthanything? Did I lead a good life? All these questions arise when Nicholson retires and is forced to travel the US to celebrate his daughter's wedding. Without giving too much away, thescript is just superb. The character of Warren Schmidt is a sad and insecureindividual who for all of his life despite his wife, or his child, has never really spoken with anyone. Payne uses an unconventional outlet for Schmidt to vent,for not even his adulterous best friend can be turned to anymore. Schmidt'scharacter seemed cold and frail, but he warmed up to an overseas child foster care program. For twenty two dollars a month, Schmidt was not only able to help a child in Tanzania, but he was able to help himself as those letters sent to his foster child were testaments of his repressed good nature and dire loneliness, Some hurdles discovered along the way are close deaths within the family, an idiotic future son in law and a daughter he would do anything in the world for. Payne paints a miraculous portrait of appreciation and zest for life and does so in at times a quite comedic manner without being overbearingly funny. Payne directs the film with a touch of class as he presents us with a fresh and awe inspring tale of insipdness and hostility for one's life. It is a coming of age film without the coming of age. It simply tells the story of a man searching for inner peace. It shows us how easy it is to get caught up in our careers, in our successes, that many tend to forget the riches far past those of monetary value. The film is a remarkable journey into a thorough soul searching session and additional marvelous performances add to the anti-generic film that it is. Kathy Bates, Howard Hesseman and Dermot Mulroney add to the brilliance of this film. A categorically great film for anyone who has dealt with crises of their own and wants to see how other would deal with their troubles.Giancarlo's Rating: ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" presents a squirmingly realistic portrait of an aging man whose connection to the human race is nonchalant at best, who learns through the course of the movie that one's connection to humanity is truly the only thing that actually matters in this world. Nicholson portrays Warren Schmidt with remarkable and uncanny restraint, knowing exactly how much emotion to invest into each response and reaction; it is a performance he's not given before (I generally think he plays himself in most of his movies and it's about time he's shown us something deeper, more profound.) This performance will most definitely earn him an Oscar nomination if not an actual Oscar, and the entire cast is brilliant as well, particularly Kathy Bates who will most likely get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. "About Schmidt" is not for everyone; a lot of people (particularly YOUNGER people) may find it torturous to watch, for all the wrong reasons - it IS torturous to watch but there's a magnificent pay-off, one of the best in any movie I've ever seen. So hang in and endure. You can do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of discovery and loss...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers ahead.......)I recently ventured across the city of San Francisco to a quant little theatre called The Presidio to see this new film from the writer and director of Election. I will give my review of it....About Schmidt is a difficult film. It is both funny and sad. Slow yet appealing. It is what a film is essentially supposed to be. It tells the tale of a man who lives an Existential life. It reminded me very much so of the novel "The Stranger" by Albert***as... Jack Nickelson plays Warren R. Schmidt a man in his mid sixties who has come to realize in a series of events that he not only hates his life and is full of anger, but that he has wasted every precious moment of it. It is a dark and tough film for many to watch. It questions the essence of conformity. It questions wether or not to comform or to be free.The film also has an opposite in the respect of that light. Kathy Bates playes Roberta Hertzel the mother of groom and she is a free spirit. She is a nymphomaniac and is not afraid to be that way. An example of this is the hot tub scene...a funny yet disturbingly bizarre on ones eyes...Hope Davies plays Jeanie Schmidt the daughter of Warren and she is love with Randall Hertzel played almost unrecognizable by Dermot Mulroney. They are a cute couple and they are very much in love.So what is the film about? In terms of plot it is about man's awakening and a daughter venture into her own life. The film is slow but it is graceful and so wickedly funny. So many scenes that I do not want to give away.Jack Nickelson went all out in this one. Playing a character that is so different from any of the ones that he has previously played. The interesting aspect of the film is how back ground information is told to the audience. It is told in a series of letters to a poor child named Ngudo who lives in Africa whom Warren sponsers in one of those sponsership programs.Do I recommend it? Yes I do! I think if you're a film lover this is definatly one to see. It is dark and it doesn't pull any punches. It is a dark satire about middle American and the concept of conformitism. It is also harshingly depressing. But at the same time it is funny and it makes us appreciate life.BTW it was kind of cool to hear Jack Nickelson say the name Randall...it reminded my of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Schmidt, are you ready for a new Jack?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, Jack Nicholson has been one of my favorite actors. From One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to Heartburn to As Good As It Gets, he has never ceased to amaze me, and he has never disappointed me. Now, as he has "slowed down", along comes About Schmidt; a film where Nicholson takes a low-key role and plays a man who is trying to fix the life he feels he has wasted, period. No strings attached. Nicholson is playing a relatively normal guy, without having to be a psychotic or a womanizing older man. And he does it beautifully. I would have to say that About Schmidt is a one-man show, containing great backup characters for Jack. There is no doubt in my mind that Nicholson will be recognized for the subtle role he took as Warren Schmidt, retired and on the road seeking something more, and learning about life along the way. I don't have much more to say about this movie, although I was very impressed. I guess you could compare Schmidt to some aspects of the quirkier As Good As It Gets, but I'd have to say that this is a kinder, gentler Nicholson. Schimdt is no Chinatown, but it's a beautifully crafted film with one of the finest actors of all time. ****/**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear Ngudu:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Wonderful, gem of a movie that is, for some reason, in extremely limited release. Nicholson again proves that he is THE absolute most remarkable actor working today. I believe that Mssrs. Hanks and Washington and DeNiro would agree - if administered a polygraph. Jack has an uncanny ability to communicate without words - and not just by raising one of his infamous eyebrows. He has never been more human than as Warren R. Schmidt. It is touching, painful and humorous to watch his search for the meaning of his life as he struggles to establish a real relationship with his engaged daughter, Hope Davis ("Mumford" "Hearts in Atlantis"). This quirky story introduces us to her fiance Dermot Mulroney and his mom, Kathy Bates and dad, Howard Hesseman. All wonderfully lively characters with a touch of hippie-holdover midwestern realism. When a secret about Schmidt's wife (June Squibb)is revealed, he begins the quest for discovering what his life has meant and to see if he has made a difference. Bates, Mulroney and Nicholson all deserve Oscar consideration and I hope this finds a few more screens so that many more filmgoers can taste this multi-layered drama-comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for grown-ups that packs an emotional wallop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson shines in his sensitive, tour de force performance as Warren Schmidt, the vice president of an insurance company who finds retirement anything but fulfilling. In fact, his world starts to crumble in short order, along with his relationships, his priorities and his sanity. A superficial reading would pigeonhole Schmidt as a Willy Loman retread, minus the heart condition, but Alexander Payne plumbs deeper emotional currents with this wonderful film - the sort of film that reminded me why I go to movies in the first place.To the director's credit, the film never quite crosses the line (so common in Hollywood these days) of ridiculing its characters and their sensibilities. Make no mistake: Midwestern middle-class values go under the magnifying glass, but just when the viewer starts to feel superior, zing! Payne pulls you back from the brink, and you find yourself caring deeply about Warren Schmidt and his universal predicament. As Warren drives his RV down the interstate, he seems as doomed as the cows his glimpses in the passing cattle trucks. Constantly thwarted in his attempts at communicating with his family and friends (by their indifference, by his unwillingness to hurt their feelings, or by the annoying demands of a voice-mail computer), he pours his heart out to someone he has never met. The editing, the supporting cast (especially Kathy Bates), and the cinematography are well-nigh perfect, and all this combined allows Nicholson to soar. The layers of his character, a man who sees the truth but dares not express it to those closest to him, erupt in a volcano of mixed emotions of anger, fear and despair by the film's last scenes and transcendent finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No other film has better shown me how being prepared for retirement is a lifetime job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`About Schmidt," starring Jack Nicholson, is a credible reflection on middle class retirement and self-awareness. I am moved by the static images of this retired insurance man, staring off into the unknown, comprehending little of what life means and failing miserably to deal with the recent loss of his wife of 42 years. Don't look for Jack's patented wise-ass grin; his Warren Schmidt moves like a robot or a patient just off the surgery gurney--dazed and confused by life's indifference to him and his inability to make a difference. The core of "About Schmidt's" success is Nicholson's ability to wrench meaning out of the commonplace: a small wringing of hands, an awkward, limping shuffle. Only when he assumes command of his Winnebago does he seem at all relaxed. Yet he cannot escape the existential awareness journeys offer (Remember his journey in `Easy Rider'?), as when an RV camp lady says to him, "I see inside of you a sad man." Warren narrates through voice-over to his "adopted" son, a Tanzanian boy benefiting from Schmidt's $22 a month to a world charitable organization. Most of his letters to the child are inappropriately adult or insensitive to the child's impoverished, illiterate life. Yet the comments are a signal about how out of it Schmidt really is and how manipulative the child-care charities can be in getting a man's money. Schmidt's ineffectuality is best expressed in his misguided, recently acquired concern for his daughter and the dorky, pony-tailed salesman she is about to marry. Don't look for a Monsoon or Fat Greek wedding; this one (they play Dan Fogelberg's "Longer" and Paul Stookey's "Wedding Song') is as bland as Schmidt's phlegmatic retirement party. For both those events and his own personal life, Schmidt is an outrider. Director Alexander Payne, who caught the sad spirit of high school politics in "Election," triumphs here in directing a hero like us, lost in our thoughts, divorced from family and jobs, but good enough to carry on and maybe find some light while camping out on the top of the Winnebago.Nicholson's Schmidt is the most memorable and least glamorous protagonist this year in film. He should take home the Oscar honors with more awareness than poor Schmidt, who might not have seen a movie this year.No other film has better shown me how being prepared for retirement is a lifetime job. No other actor has played the man who wasn't prepared better than Jack (nor does Jack show signs of retirement himself). Thank goodness.</fullReview>

Though the script suffers a bit from predictable depictions of the humdrum nature of modern life, there's enough spark and cleverness to keep it going. Schmidt's search for meaning takes on a bit of a road trip quality and this has proven to be a winning formula in many memorable films. Nicholson's got his entire bag of facial tricks going strong and, though clichéd, just when we're about to lose hope at the end, redemption is quick and pointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In praise of civility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One scene in "About Schmidt" epitomizes this wonderfully sly satire of Americana. Warren, the recent widower and frustrated soon to be father-of-the-bride, sits and observes the groom's family chomping at food as if they were grazing at the trough. His predicament is that his daughter (Hope Davis) is eating just like them. Jack Nicholson, as Warren, is in practically every scene and his dramatic and comedic talent have never been better showcased (the tearful widower in a wonderful monologue atop his travel van, the struggling water bed sleeper who soon shows the effects of too much Percodan, and the seemingly vindictive father who turns 180 degrees in his wedding speech) . He doesn't work with glamorous women like in "The Witches of Eastwick" and he has a future son-in-law (Dermot Mulroney) that he graciously calls a nincompoop. No, there is his very old looking wife of 42 years, Helen, who makes him use the toilet seat to urine and a domineering soon to be mother-in-law, Roberta (Kathy Bates), who doesn't mind talking about her breast feeding, her orgasms, nor does she mind indulging in a nice hot tub session with Warren. The film deliberately keeps the straight-laced, broad shouldered Warren as a one dimensional, penny-pincher (the pine box was too cheap for his wife but not the upgrade) who is unable to deal with his retirement, his estranged daughter's wedding, nor self-doubts about what he has really accomplished. Much like the Coen brothers' film, "Fargo", this film makes us look at ourselves from the microscopic detail of sagging skin to the macroscopic view of a man's small place in his universe. It goes further by showing the terrible irony of a lonely, frustrated man whose only joy in life is confiding in a six year old boy he has never seen, in a faraway country where for the cost of $22 a month, he can finally say he has redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack's back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`About Schmidt' reminds one why `American Beauty' seemed uplifting: it made us see an ordinary man's boring life as something he could toy with and perhaps escape from. Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicolson) makes feeble efforts to escape ? and once he sets sail in the Winnebago, he can always jump into it and drive off again. But he has no inner wildness to discover. Inside he has perhaps wellsprings of fear, sadness, and rage, but he's neither willing nor able to express them. To call Schmidt's fate in the movie an `existential crisis,' as some critics have done, is a bit of a stretch. `American Beauty' was Kevin Spacey's finest hour, if not his most challenging role. Opinions vary on Jack Nicolson's performance in `About Schmidt.' Is this the work of a great actor, or the wreck of one, or was he always a great obnoxious scene-stealing ham who's lucked into some terrific roles -- but here simply winks at the audience from behind the befuddled Babbitt he is playing? In `About Schmidt,' Nicolson surely has moments in which each of these facets appears: we see a great actor, and a burnt out one; a ham, and a celebrity hiding in a role that would be beneath him if it didn't rise to such sublimely nerve-wracking and embarrassing levels of tragicomedy. For the most part the hero of Alexander Payne's movie is simply a thinly disguised but magisterially reposeful Jack Nicolson who in scene after scene holds back or, as A. Lane memorably writes, `swinishly lolls.' And this is what the role calls for. One can debate the performance, but it's pretty clear that the cinematic Schmidt is largely a cipher. Inside every Schmidt, it appears, there is a Jack Nicolson violently gesturing to be let out -- but here exercising moments of cunning repression. For an actor as flamboyant as Nicolson to play with great restraint is in itself a form of flamboyance.Schmidt doesn't wish to face anything, and he doesn't. He tries to escape from almost every moment that calls for active presence. First it's by slipping off for a drink at a bar when his retirement party is going on. Then it's by jumping into the Winnebago when living alone gets rocky. He has shown himself pathetically unable to cope after his wife dies. He has turned against her and his best friend for a short flirtation between them long ago. And he has run away from it all. But in the end he only escapes into drugs (the Percodan Kathy Bates' character gives him for his twisted neck) and fantasies of a paternal relationship with a small African boy he buys foster care for. This is how he buys off his `existential crisis': he sends off monthly checks to Africa for $22. You could better call this not `existential crisis' but middle class white guilt. The voiceovers of Schmidt's letters to the boy are the only semblance of a sensibility that the movie offers, and its only resolution is validation of this boy's existence via a letter from a nun in the final scene. There is much sadness in this, but no enlightenment.`About Schmidt' indeed is a rather distressing (but nonetheless surefooted) example of what could be called Todd Solandz lite, which was found much more amusingly displayed in `Pumpkin' and `The Good Girl' earlier this year. This time the level of caricature is kept low enough and pervasive enough to be hardly ever funny. The movie offers a quarter of an hour of genuine amusement when Schmidt arrives at his daughter's future mother-in-law's house. Kathy Bates provides some relief from the emptiness of Schmidt's respectable, actuarial existence (he was in insurance in the director's own native Omaha). She swears; she yells at her ex. Her house has a dated hippy charm and the way her New Age sexuality threatens Schmidt is blissful because she also threatens for a moment to take over the screen with her warm presence. The bad taste of the décor is enormously welcome here after the Fifties colonial neutrality of Schmidt's residence; the dinner featuring the garrulous ex, rude Roberta, and airhead son Randall is a hoot. As Randall the handsome but ill fated Dermot Mulroney (he once seemed destined to become a matinee idol) comes supplied with a balding pate, a ridiculous set of whiskers, a long ponytail, and a job selling waterbeds ? a pretty heavy load for an actor who once squired Julia Roberts. `About Schmidt' quickly descends into mild slapstick with Schmidt's injury in the waterbed and doped-out behavior on Percodan. His speech at the wedding dinner teases us with expectations of a hostile outburst, but he ends by saying only the most conventional things.This movie will get more attention than `Pumpkin' or `The Good Girl' because of Jack Nicolson's presence: Solandz lite will inch closer to mainstream. And audiences will get a few big laughs -- Jack can create heavy irony with just a raised eyebrow -- but they will not get many. This is the saddest movie of the year, and the sadness isn't just from views of joyless marriage, helpless retirement, and death, but from a steady satiric vision of Middle America that is restrained yet deeply cruel. Anderson Payne has delivered a heavy wallop to the rebel in us. He himself, it is said, has moved away from Omaha and gone to live in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare cinema accomplishment. This is why I make films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson gives the most Oscar-worthy performance of his career short of "Cuckoo's Nest." Understated, subtle, and remarkably HONEST. Jack is Schmidt. In rare form, Nicholson is truly vulnerable. The film is at once funny, poignant, and a true reflection of life in middle-America, or anywhere else for that matter. For once a script has been created, and a film produced that foregoes the fantasy that we as an audience are so accustomed to. "About Schmidt" is simply about Schmidt. And Nicholson's triumph is not in his portrayal of Warren Schmidt, but in how he inhabits that character in such a way as to hold up a mirror to the audience. I did not see Jack Nicholson playing the role of Warren Schmidt... I saw a real man reflecting on the experience of living; nothing more, nothing less. And that is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comb-overs and mullets, oh my!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson may have traded his wild-eyed gleam for a comb-over, but his talent for pouring himself into a role is as evident in this week's About Schmidt as it was 28 years ago in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.As Warren Schmidt, Nicholson is befuddled, to say the least, when, just days after his grudging retirement, his wife of many years drops dead on the kitchen floor. As if that weren't enough, Warren's only child (Hope Davis) has her heart set on marrying the best mullet and mustache combo middle America has to offer (played with aplomb by Dermot Mulroney).Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor wrote the dead-on screenplay, which should come as no surprise to those who've seen their previous collaborations, Citizen Ruth (1996) and Election (1999). Payne and Taylor are able to take the seemingly banal setting of Payne's native Omaha and reveal the lascivious and perhaps pitiful stories hidden among the cornfields. (Those who remember the line in Election referring to the level of moisture in a particular nether-region of Reese Witherspoon's body might be just as wide-eyed when a saucy, stark-naked Kathy Bates attempts to seduce Nicholson's Schmidt.)About Schmidt is by far the year's most original movie, (yes, more original than Spike Jonze's wacko Adaptation), due in no small part to uncanny performances by Bates and Nicholson-not to mention Payne's sympathetic direction and that phenomenal script (all of which are up for Golden Globes this year). It is even nominated for the grandest, most golden Globe of all, Best Picture-Drama, which begs the question, if the movie's that good, doesn't Mulroney's mustache deserve at least an honorable mention?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This brilliant film reveals the lie behind respectability that ultimately kills the unsuspectingly spirit...and takes the viewer through an experience of "Everyman" (Warren Schmidt...magnificently portrayed by Jack Nicholson, with uncharacteristic nuance) into realms of self-discovery and ultimately human connection that reaches his (and our) soul.The dialogue is fresh, spontaneous and real, bringing all the characters into honest focus as believable people, even when they're quirky and unconventional. Payne is to be commended for his gifts as a screenwriter and director. Outstanding performances also by Hope Davis, Kathy Bates and Dermet Mulroney. Be prepared to laugh, to be moved and finally to feel so deeply satisfied by this great movie that you'll want to tell all your friends and see it more than once.</fullReview>

And both his performanceand the final effect of this picture are enormously moving.Perhaps you'll have to be well into middle age to experience thefull poignancy of "About Schmidt".

		<fullReview>About Schmidt is so multi-dimensional. To be brief, as a college student in Omaha this last couple years, wavering on what I wanted to do, it was spending a day on the set of this movie that pushed me to come to Los Angeles to go to school for acting. And now after seeing the movie on opening day, from the plot alone it drives me to do better. Even with it's 'sad story' of the man, Warren, one can easily pull hope from the show. It's funny, sad and uplifting all in one blow. As I eventually pursue acting all the way, I shall look back to this movie and remember About Schmidt and drive to have no regrets at the end of my own life.Great movie, amazing actors, best writer and director.Joe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson Shines in "About Schmidt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" got into my mind and my gut slowly but steadily. Director Alexander Payne has given us a portrait of a man's late-in-life discovery of the anguish of loneliness and the possibility of overcoming sadnesses he never identified let alone confronted.Jack Nicholson, in a bravura performance worthy of another Oscar, is Warren Schmidt, an insurance executive in his mid-sixties who retires as the movie opens, his place taken by a young and stereotypically facile man boasting about the value of his Drake business degree.Schmidt has been married for four decades to his now overweight wife and for more than thirty years to his employer. An actuary by training, his role at his company was spectacularly unglamorous while internally essential to his employer's business interests.It's not a spoiler to tell, as all the reviews have, that Schmidt is suddenly widowed early in the movie. This loss comes at a time when the daughter he remembers adoringly as a little girl in pigtails is engaged to be married to a man about whom Warren is less than ecstatic.Nicholson invests his role by alternating a take-charge business persona that did much for him when in the insurance industry with the unwelcome intrusiveness of the intermeddling dad. Jeannie, his daughter, is well into her thirties. She knows what she wants. Hope Davis, a very good actress, plays a woman with an ordinary job and...a really ordinary life. Her fiance is a nice guy, not much more. She deals with shipping for an electronics outfit. He sells waterbeds. This isn't a power marriage about to happen.Driving a very expensive Winnebago, Warren takes off sightseeing, showing up in Denver in time for the nuptials. His host is the fiance's mom, portrayed with humor by the great Kathy Bates. (She should get a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role here.) She comes close to stealing some scenes from Nicholson.Nicholson's depth is astounding. He slowly realizes something is wrong with his life but he can't identify, at first, the issue. Torn between supporting his daughter's choice and giving unwanted advice, he's forced to reexamine his own life and Nicholson, overweight and slightly disheveled most of the time, does so with increasingly subtle but mounting ferocity.The theme of elderly loneliness, in this country and for those who seem to have all the material advantages, isn't new to film. But here the director and cast portray ordinary albeit in some ways wacky folks with whom we can empathize. At least I did.Is Nicholson a better man, a happier one, at the end of the film? That's a question he leaves us with.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow moving journey about loneliness and isolation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"About Schmidt" is director Alexander Payne's third in a trilogy of films he's shot in his hometown, Omaha, Nebraska. "Citizen Ruth" and "Election" were the first two."Schmidt" is a study of the loneliness and isolation of a retired actuary named Warren Schmidt played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. Schmidt's life has passed him by. His salvation is trying to reconnect with his alienated daughter after the death of his wife.The film's cinematography captures the grayness of Schmidt's life. We see the Midwest as a flat, rolling surface-a blank canvas for Schmidt's empty existence."Schmidt" is a regionalist masterpiece like the Coen brothers' "Fargo" and 'O Brother Where Art Thou." Payne's humor is a bit different, less dark. He's more tweaking and loving of his subject matter and his origins.Kathy Bates, Hope Davis, and Dermot Mulroney are part of the fantastic supporting cast. Even the hairstylist in this flick should see an Oscar nomination. Nicholson's combover and Mulroney's mullet alone are worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern masterpiece of the heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Mr. Payne's third attempt to make a watchable film. In "About Shmidt," he cobbles together a series of unused vignettes from "Election" and "Citizen Ruth" that were best left on the cutting room floor. The multi-talented although aging star of the film is clearly exasperated with the take-no-prisoners, bad-boy attitude of his baby-faced wunderkind director. When Payne wants to distract your attention from the painful truth on the actors' faces, which is often, he irritates you with a blaring soundtrack. When he wants you to see the eye-twinkling, unpretentious, home-cooked honesty of his Oklahoman kinfolk, trapped-in-their-ring-around-the-collar, middle american, ways, he cuts to parades, clowns, and orderly town meetings, not unlike those you might see on public access at 2:00 a.m. Contrasted with those not-so-subtle filmmaking techniques is Payne's judicious and plentiful use of in-your-face, shameless nudity. That alone almost made my experience worth the price of admission. Thank you for this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's 'About Schmidt' is an average effort, it has a tangy storyline, but that doesn't happen in the celluloid. It is loosely based on the 1996 novel of the same title by Louis Begley, I don't how the novel was, but the film surely disappoints! 'About Schmidt' caters to a very tiny section of audience, its not meant for those who like entertaining &amp; escapist cinema, they'll sleep off if they see this one. The film was Crtically Accliamed, that's it! The journey of Mr.Schmidt has very, very less appeal, that's the bitter truth! Coming to some right points: Payne's direction is good. He does his best to rise above the not-so-happening script. Jack Nicholson delivers, as always. Kathy Bates is remarkable in a brief role. Others are also good.'About Schmidt' is weird &amp; boring at many places... watch it if you are a fan of Nicholson &amp; Bates.</fullReview>

If you have not yet had a chance to live, try things, succeed AND fail at things, and have enough time to live with regrets and wonder about decisions, this movie will be a waste of your time.As an example, when this movie first came out, I went to a movie theater ot see it and walked out 35 minutes into it. HOW BORING I thought it was. Now, a few years later, I have watched it again at least a dozen times on HBO, and each time the movie makes more sense to me.If you are impatient, don't watch it. If you need the obvious, don't watch it. Subtle meaning, understated humor, and themes that exist under the surface are the stuff this film is made of.Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack does dull!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(NOTE: used caps where I wanted to do italics--sorry if it's offputtting)ABOUT SCHMIDT is nothing if not a tragedy, and no less so for its farcical elements. Alexander Payne's style works when his characters' tragedies could maybe be ours if we were them, but thank God we're not. ELECTION works wonderfully that way. ABOUT SCHMIDT crashes because it doesn't work at all that way.After several shots of skyscrapers with slums at their feet, Arthur Schmidt (Jack) is introduced staring at a clock ticking towards 5PM in an office where we see nothing except for boxes and his desk and chair, looking like Randall McMurphy if he'd survived the lobotomy and gone on into a career as an actuary. Plainly the pooch is long since screwed in this man's life, done deal, let's move on.There's nowhere for the movie to go after this except for balls-to-the-wall farce, ELECTION style, which seems a possibility given that it's Jack Nicholson. Maybe there's a Randall McMurphy type back story, indeed seems like there'd have to be. After the lobotomy, though, do you really expect anything interesting to happen? You shouldn't and it doesn't.Next is the retirement party, where it looks like Schmidt didn't just miss the train, but the railroad long since went into bankruptcy and the station collapsed around his ears. Similar idea although a decidedly different feel from the office scene. Events have been passing this man by for a long long time. How did Schmidt/Jack get HERE? Subsequently, we see that Schmidt must have been in the midst of things at the office somewhere in the not-too-distant past. He visits his whippersnapper successor in his office and we see it's top-of-the-line in the office hierarchy. (By the way (NOT), how excruciatingly pathetic is it that Schmidt submits himself to the totally inevitable humiliation that everybody but him sees coming from this visit? Payne is demanding you get something out of this scene that was totally not there for me.) And the letters to Ndugu tell a story of a man really not much interested in anything outside the office but plainly a player in the office's confines. Schmidt's is a 1950's story glaringly out of place in the 21st century.From all this it seems we are to understand that Schmidt's life is unspeakably bleak and Schmidt himself has been rendered dull to the max by some kind of repression the essence (and possible resolution?) of which is the story of the rest of the movie. And by the way, he's from Omaha and one significant recollection he has is of an event (I've forgotten what) attended by folks all the way from Des Moines and Wichita. Don't think for one second that THAT isn't as significant as it gets.I frankly don't see how you can think there's a story here unless you buy the proposition the director seems determined to advance that you really can't distinguish between repressed and dull, at least amongst typical Midwestern folks. And much as you might want to try to read depth into this character from subtleties of Nicholson's performance and nuances in the screenplay, there's no denying that the major effort at work for Jack is to dull it down some way you never thought Jack Nicholson could.I won't deny he succeeds, but even if he does, so what? How Jack got that damned dull would be a story, given that it's Jack. What he does having gotten that way, though, isn't, even if it is Jack. I don't think you really want to see this performance unless you'd like to see how Michael Jordan will look on the hardwood after he's in the throes of acute arthritis.I won't deny also there are bits and pieces of a very good movie here. One I haven't seen mentioned is the scene with the Eau Claire RV folks--we can buy that these are real people because we don't have to see too much of them. The actors do yeoman like work. There's real pathos and humor in the letters to Ndugu. But as a plot device, the Ndugu angle is, well, a plot device--a plain acknowledgment in the screenplay that there would never be enough of a story in the day-to-day doings of this man to make a movie out of.I saw a review recently of SIDEWAYS complaining that Alexander Payne seems as a director as though his characters are beneath him. I didn't mind this or even see it in ELECTION, maybe because that movie makes a good argument for life as farce even while it's characters seem to be taking it seriously, which I can hope SIDEWAYS does as well. ABOUT SCHMIDT, though, is about something else entirely. Maybe Jack Nicholson can do dull, but Alexander Payne plainly can't do tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's interesting to me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...that a lot of the user comments here equate "depressing" with "bad," as if great films are inherently uplifting (see Citizen Kane, Network, or The Godfather for irrefutable proof to the contrary). Films are under no obligation to make the viewer feel good, and this misconception is the reason so many modern Hollywood productions are transparent, maudlin wastes of time and money.For most of us, life doesn't consist of fending off the advances of airbrushed-beautiful women, or tossing magically-forged jewelry into the fires of Mt. Doom. And happy endings are the exception rather than the rule. Real life is a pretty tragic affair, even if the tragedies are minor compared to those of Hamlet or Oedipus. About Schmidt is a chronicle of just these sort of tragedies, and is clearly made with the belief that art should reflect life. The idea is that seeing real people on-screen (as opposed to, say, the ladies of Charlie's Angels) will encourage viewers to relate to the film on a deeper level and connect the characters' failings, foibles and triumphs with their own. In this, the film succeeds. The first time I saw it, a bunch of 30-something Hollywood industry folk gathered outside the screening room afterward and asked each other, "What are we doing with our lives?" If you live in LA, you already know that this kind of introspection is about as common as snow in mid-July.I'm not saying you have to love About Schmidt--taste is subjective, of course--but dismissing it as "bad" or a "waste of time" because it is a downer betrays a certain amount of naivete about the art of filmmaking. This film isn't trying to make you feel good--it's trying to make you question the trajectory of your life. If you can't stand feeling bad for the two hours this film runs, imagine Warren Schmidt's position when his wife dies and he finds himself utterly alone. That's the kind of depression you should fear; and that's the point.A close friend of mine called this film "sincere" and I think that's the word for it. There's nothing in About Schmidt that isn't honest and heartfelt, and that's a rarity these days. Cherish it.</fullReview>

Although I'm much younger than the lead character, I'm currently going through my own mid-life crisis and the movie resonated with me on a deep level. I thought Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. You could see so much going in inside his head. There are very few actors that can be so expressive and sardonic in such a subtle way. I think some of the reviewers here that thought the movie was "boring" and Jack was miscast and "wasted" in this role are just to young and/or inexperienced to understand the point of the movie. I'm glad Jack decided to take on this role--he is fascinating to watch.If the Hilton sisters intrigue you, this isn't your movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS WITHIN, I THINKI was told this film was a comedy when we rented it out. The title also said to me 'camp stuck up stereotypical Hollywood comedy'. It didn't start well either. It seemed mundane and boring. There were no fast movements, no really major events. But i must say by the end i was actually emotionally involved. The ending really touched me, which is strange, because i tend not to get involved with films in that way. i honestly felt for jacks character warren. I also felt for his little friend in Africa, Ngudu! The comedy was tender and very REAL. Warren retires from his insurance company, and he feels inadequate because he was never the boss but the assistant manager i think. Anyway he's watching the TV, switching the channels looking for something interesting to fill the time - something im sure a lot of us can relate to, and another REAL touch of this film - when he spots a charity third world commercial, which gradually catches his attention. Anyway he gets a pack, which introduces him to 6 year-old Ngudu, who he'll be sponsoring for 22 dollars a month. It also asks to send a letter so warren writes his letter. This is the first real moment of comedy but its good. He pours his heart out about his life. He talks badly about his wife.He goes out to post the letter to Ngudu and comes back to find his wife has died. He has neglected her and it's another metaphor for depression and loss and waste. Anyway he writes again to Ngudu after the funeral. At the funeral his daughter comes over with her fiancé, this trailer trash bed salesman. Warren argues with daughter over marrying this man and the funeral. He's obviously at odds with her. She meanwhile is estranged from her father, angry with and yet loving of her father. The fiancé meanwhile proposes business after trying to console warren. Anyway once they've all gone, warren descends into a life of squalor, hilariously denied in his next letter to Ngudu. Another funny moment follows when he writes that he misses her. Moments later he finds a box of letters from her lover, his best friend. He goes maniacal for once in the film - he plays a timid tired man - and hits his best friend. Then he trashes all his wife's stuff, before embarking on a road trip, which he intends to find his soul and peace on. He tries to go to see his daughter early ? the wedding is on soon - but she rejects him. This prompts the soul searching.He goes to a camper van park where he meets a couple that like to meet random people. This is a metaphor for the desperate measures that people go to, to find friendship and love, i think. Anyway he kisses the woman after reading the wrong signals, and has to leave. This is he searching for affection from anyone who can give it. Then he meditates, and forgives his wife. Then he goes to attend the wedding. He meets his soon to be son in laws mother, who is a slob and open about her sexuality. The whole family is a disgrace, and he tries to persuade his daughter to not marry into it. She won't listen to him - they have been distanced. He attends the wedding and gives a forced speech at the cringe worthy reception. After leaving he contemplates his failure, and writes to Ngudu. He writes back - the hilarity of his writing to Ngudu - both the content of the letters, and the fact that he is writing in quite grown up language to a 6 year old boy in a third world country - is fully revealed. But the nurse looking after him at the nursery writes a heartfelt reply, with messages from Ngudu to him, who although indeed cannot write or read thinks about Warren and his kindness every day. Enclosed is a beautiful little picture drawn by the boy. Warren finally cries and its truly a heart wrenching moment.For me the films success comes in its realism - little touches like the daughter going to open the car door after arguing with warren, and having to ask her boyfriend to unlock it, his terrible hairstyles when waking up, his bored watching of the TV, his checking of the phone boxes money thing for change, and so forth. The message of this film is that it can relate to all depressed and tired people, this is a result of conformist lives, as the retirement party emphasizes. Basically, open your heart, don't waste time fighting or not being interested and/or involved in the lives of those you care about, because that's what's really important. He was open to Ngudu, and got the love and affection and interest he perhaps craved. He failed to stop his daughter marrying this man he hates, but realised the value of communication, love and life in his tears at the end, one hopes. The film is very beautiful, with slow and quiet classical music, great and heartfelt performances by every actor and actress, and SUBTLE and underlying humour. It's a real masterpiece, and probably one of Nicholson's best, in a distinguished career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When A Minor Action Makes the Difference of a Lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren R. Schmidt (Jack Nicholson, with an outstanding performance) is a typical middle class American and has just retired. He has worked for many years as an actuary in a great insurance company and now he is starting to adapt himself to live without one of the pillars of his life, his job. One day, while watching television, he decides to 'adopt' a six years old boy from Tanzania. Together with a check of US$ 22,00 per month, he is also supposed to write a letter to the kid. While writing these letters, he 'opens his heart', describing his life, his frustrations, his lost dreams, like he were in a psychologist. He is married for forty-two years with his wife and he has a daughter living in Denver, who will marry a very simple man pretty soon. He misses his daughter. A few days after his retirement, his wife dies, and Schmidt loses his second pillar, his family. Alone, his routine life ruins and Schmidt gets his Adventurer's trailer and starts traveling through some specific places in America, like the house were he spent the first years of his life, or some museum that he had never had the chance to visit. His trip ends in Denver, two days before the wedding of his daughter. He stays for a couple of days with her fiancé's family. Meanwhile, he keeps writing to his foster kid, and finds many hidden facts about himself, in a parallel interior journey to his lifestyle and behavior, questioning how common and plane has been his life, without making any difference. A wonderful end will show him that sometimes a minor action indeed makes the difference. This movie is very beautiful. Slow, but dense and touching, with a marvelous performance of Jack Nicholson, who supports the whole plot. I have imagined the situation of his character, losing in an advanced age and almost at the same time, everything that has supported his life. I really felt very sorrow for him. There is also a great message regarding the importance of First World countries supporting children of Third World countries with love, not hate. The supporting cast is composed by great actors and actresses, therefore this film is a pleasure for the viewer. Alternating funny situations, like a black comedy, and drama, it may be not indicated for all audiences, specially those in advanced ages. But viewers who likes sensible and touching movies, with a great direction and cast, and a stunning performance of Jack Nicholson, will not be disappointed. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "As Confiss?es de Schmidt" ("The Confessions of Schmidt")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Hollywood scriptwriters think about America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was prepared to enjoy this film because it had gotten good reviews and I had seen some funny clips featuring two of Hollywood's biggest stars, Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates. But it was a disappointing movie.It's a dark comedy about a recently retired man who's just lost his wife and goes out on an adventure to try and reconnect with his daughter and find meaning in life. The setup is good. Nicholson is introduced as Warren Schmidt, an emotionally detached husband and father. he character is so out of line with his public persona we expect Nicholson to play with it, but the laughs only come in spurts.The thing that bothers me about this film is the overwhelmingly negative view it has of people in general. We see things through Schmidt's eyes, and it's not a pretty world out there. His wife is a nag, his daughter barely talks to him, the person who replaced him at his job is a dolt, he finds out his best friend had an affair with his wife, his prospective in-laws are slobs, everywhere he goes on the road he meets dull people. The world view you're presented with here is that everyone is stupid and superficial. The situations Schmidt goes through are humorous, don't get me wrong, but there's an ugliness to the laughter, like the people behind the film are laughing at us, not with us. Everyone is dull-witted and visually unappealing, which tells you something about the writer's view of the world. Frankly, it just left me with a bad taste in my mouth.Jack Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar as best actor, but I didn't think his performance was all that great. He's got the character down pat, but I thought he did it much better in "As Good As It Gets." At least in that film his character undergoes change. Here, he looks like someone on prozac most of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is not "As Good As It Gets"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of you out there-this is not "As Good As It Gets". I sat with the intention to see something similar like crazy old guy doing and talking funny things, you know that kind of stuff, but this was not the case. Unlike the other movie "About Schmidt" is a drama. However, in order to ease the tension the creators of the film have given the story scent of a comedy. And I think that this blend came off very well.This is a story of a man looking for the answer to the question that all of us are asking at one time or another: Am I leading a meaningful life? Depending on the age this question changes the tense. In case of Schmidt it was in past tense: Did I lead a meaningful life? The movie is very realistic and simple. And again my confusion with "As Good As It Gets" I thought that Nicholson's character would snap out of it like in "American Beauty" and will do something more like for a Hollywood movie, but no everything was very simple and ordinary. As life itself. At the end I found that that?fs why I liked the movie: it kept everything real.Once a read somewhere that There are only two tests of a life well lived: Did one do as one intended? And were people glad one lived? Well this movie is a story of a man looking for those answers. And depending on your mood, age, satisfaction with life you might like or dislike the film. I know I liked it. P.S. Another very important point that this movie made that could make the tests of life well lived three instead of two: Have I found (depending on the age: Shall I find) my Ndugu to share my life with?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to sit through the whole thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Occasionally, a movie comes along where one or more of the main characters is flawed and so strikingly formed by the acting and writing, that it is difficult to watch these people. Jack Nicholson as Schmidt is such a character. To endure this man's post retirement life and the unsubstantial persona developed through his work and family life is a challenge. On one hand, you have to applaud the work of director Payne and Nicholson to paint a vivid portrait of this woeful character, but be prepared to squirm a little when situations arise you know he isn't prepared to gracefully manage. The strength of this ability is that Schmidt has phenomenally true characteristics imbued in people we know and meet everyday. It is too scary to contemplate. And that is why, as a movie watcher, we want to look away at times because he is an embarrassment, someone we don't want to be in whole or part. If you've seen Scorsese's movie "The King of Comedy", De Niro's Pupkin was flawed as well, different flaws than Schmidt, but still making you sweat by watching him because they are so truly lifelike. What I don't buy in this movie is the whole "Meaning of Life" theme and Schmidt's resolution in the end to this theme. Depending on your view of life, the ending will support whatever philosophy you may have in this regard. Frankly, it can be done more simply and definitively with a glass of water filled up halfway. By the way, you don't see many movies based out of Omaha, its worth seeing if you've ever lived in or around there. One of the other reviewers took exception to casting Midwesterners as collectively troubled and narrow-minded, similar to those who felt "Field of Dreams" made Iowans look like country bumpkins. Hey, it's the movie business, folks. This may be in part due to Nicholson doing a bang-up job of portraying Schmidt, but the rest of the cast, especially the more screwball parts, don't ring true (except for Schmidt's wife - I wanted to hug her).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best film to come along since "Schindler's List". It is one of those truly rare films, marketers' superlatives aside, that stays with you, days, months and presumedly years after, a la after the first time you saw "The Graduate".This is a brilliant, wise, moving, funny, poignant film. It truly deserved Best Picture, Best Screenplay from Another Medium, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress. One has to wonder what is going on with the Academy members. Why wasn't it not even nominated for Best Picture? Maybe some of them need to have their heads examined. No, on second thought, maybe they need to have their hearts examined.Two years in row now the Academy hasn't recognized the best acting performance in a motion picture (e.g., Russell Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind" in 2001).Jack Nicholson was better than his performance in "As Good As It Gets" and most people thought with that movie Jack was about as good as he could get but that turned out to be not so. In "About Schmidt" he was perfect.Kathy Bates was marvelous, brave, with a wink to her role in 1990's "Misery".One sequence after another unfolds so seamlessly, so naturally you alternately laugh, cry or exclaim out loud, almost involuntarily, at how the filmmakers got all right, a great script draft, great supporting cast, great direction. What else could the Academy ask for?I'm really not sure the Oscars will ever be the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being Jack Nicholson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson (Oscar-nominated) has put in his time and retirement from his insurance agency in Omaha, Nebraska is imminent. All should be peaches and cream now, right? Well, not necessarily. Nicholson is scared to death of his daughter's (Hope Davis) upcoming marriage to waterbed salesman Dermot Mulroney in Colorado and is obviously unhappy in his life as he wonders what he has done to make a difference in the world. Shortly after his wife's (played by June Squibb) sudden death, Nicholson begins to examine his life through his own eyes and decides that a road trip in his new Winnebago is just the thing he needs. What follows is a "Harry and Tonto"-styled film without the Tonto. As his daughter's marriage looms, Nicholson goes to Denver to stay with Mulroney's out-there family (led by priceless Oscar-nominee Kathy Bates and ex-husband Howard Hesseman). There the film continues its simultaneous comedic and dramatic assault on its audience. Nicholson's feelings are made clear by personal writings to an unseen foster child in Tanzania that he sponsors through one of those television commercials. "About Schmidt" is a strange dime-turner of a film that gets real dramatic and then switches quickly to comedy and vice versa. The film is heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time. Nicholson makes the whole project work with yet another ungodly role that just adds to his greatness. Growing old is never easy to do and the range that Nicholson (who almost always plays younger than he really is) brings to the part is revolutionary. A joy, and admittedly sometimes a trial to get through, "About Schmidt" is overall an enjoyable cinematic experience that works because of extremely likeable characters and a truly original and life-affirming tale. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I registered for IMDB simply so that I could rate this movie a 10. It has been years since I've seen a film with so much humanity, so much richness of character and such great attention to detail. The movie is genuinely poetic--it is not a purely realistic slice of life, although there are so many humorous, sometimes hilarious recognizable character traits in the people we meet on Warren's journey, The last scene of the movie just took my breath away. It ranks right up there with the final scenes in films like "Harold and Maude", "Field of Dreams", and "King of Hearts". For me there was a realization that Warren was not simply a sad sack of a man, who lived a small life. I felt that he was really a universal person.He is Everyman. Life is hard. It's a real struggle...and the curve balls one gets until the day we die are endless. But sometime during a person's life--whether it comes early on, or in Warren's case, later in life--if we can just find that moment to be thankful it is all worth every minute.</fullReview>

And guess what, my husband loved it too!!Jack Nicholson is fabulous playing Warren Schmidt a retired insurance actuary. Warren Schmidt was definitely an anti-Jack character and it is a tribute to Jack's acting that we could imagine him cavorting around in real life with the likes of Lara Flynn Boyle and being married in REEL life to Helen, his wife of 42 years.Kathy Bates was sensational as was Dermot Mulroney (his mullet deserved special attention).This movie must win Oscar nods for Best Picture, Best Actor for Jack, and Supporting Actress for Kathy Bates!!!</fullReview>

About half way through; while watching Warren Schmidt go about his pathetic, winding-down life, I couldn't help but ask myself: What's the f*cking point?That's what's so amazing about this movie: it challenges you to ask yourself what the hell it is you're doing with your life. Whether you want to face yourself or not is likely a factor in whether or not your liked the movie (surprisingly, i heard many people around me in the theatre say that they didn't like it).SOME SPOILERS What's so freaking great about this movie is this: Schmidt (Nickolson) worked for his entire life, was married for 42 years, and still felt as though he had accomplished nothing. In the end, he received more validation from a $22 a month check than he did an entire lifetime's worth of accomplishment. If you fail to ask yourself the question of: What's the f*cking point; then feel free to criticize and go about your pathetic, meaningless lives. I'm really passionate about this movie, and that definitely warrants your watching it. 10/10My favorite line: Dear Ndugu</fullReview>

If he played it more loose and without his usual assuming manner, then the film stood a chance. This is the umpteenth time Payne has put verisimilitude on the screen and widely missed the mark.

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS AHEAD*This movie is simply not enjoyable. I have some apprehensions about classifying it as "Terrible", but it barely saves itself.Though there isn't much about it that is openly objectionable, the sheer dullness of this piece of cinema will leave you confused as to why anyone thought that it was a good idea to make it.Imagine speaking to a strikingly unimportant man for two hours. It's quite bad. We are told the story of an almost miserably uninteresting man, who loses his wife (who he never really loved that much in the first place), goes on a decidedly unadventurous journey of self discovery, and allows his daughter to marry a man who is probably the most likeable character featured (however HATED by Schmidt), since there really isn't anything he can do about it.It sounds immensely boring, and it really is. Just when you expect it to take a twist, pick itself up and grab your attention, it doesn't.To it's credit, however, this film was well acted, and though authoritatively grim and pretty much a colossal waste of time, it had it's mildly amusing moments.Then again, it also featured a fully nude Kathy Bates.Scratch everything I said up there. If movies could go to hell, I'd shoot this one dead and delight in it's burning.</fullReview>

This was among the worst movies any of us had ever seen. Don't get me wrong. I love Jack Nicholson. I love Kathy Bates. I truly enjoy movies with deeply underlying themes that don't sing about the point of the film under neon signs. But this film had no point. It had no deeper meaning. It was Seinfeld without the humor. It's just about a pitiful man with nothing going on. Even the tragedies in his life don't seem pertinent to anyone or anything, including Mr. Schmidt himself. How is the audience supposed to feel sorry for or relate to a man who shows no emotion? And it isn't even as if he reaches some sort of epiphany! The entire movie is one long, continuous anti-climax. Every time you think the next scene will be poignant or a turning point in Schmidt's life, you're left wondering why they wasted the film needed for the scene. I think watching this film can be considered comparable to watching someone else watch TV. There are bits and pieces that are mildly entertaining but, in general, it's the least interesting thing you can watch someone else do. I think you could pick a random stranger up off the street and film their life and it would be more interesting. Oh, and one more thing. Although Kathy Bates is a wonderful actress, neither I nor the men with whom I watched this film ever had the desire to see her naked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know that confused, bored, Stan Laurel, near bugs-bunny expression that Jack Nicholson uses. Well that was about the highlight of the whole film... according to the audience when I watched the film. I can say that I felt like that expression by the end of the film!

		<fullReview>Any Film starring Jack Nickolson is worth the effort of buying a big screen ticket. I have been disappointed with his work in the past "Wolf" being an example and so I was disappointed again. This is a sad little offering. Nickolson's performance is faultless of course, who else could play such a very dis-likeable character and get away with it. It was just that the film was boring and un-funny.The sales pitch has been one of "a delightful comedy". It is no such thing. It is a bitter/sweet observation of a wasted life. There was one laugh early on in the first reel, then no-more. All the characters were un-likeable and self-obsessed. I can not understand the critical acclaim for this small and empty movie. A Great Disappointment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mild Spoilers AheadNot since I suffered through A Trip To Bountiful have I experienced the kind of bone-deep boredom that engulfed me as I watched this interminable infomercial for the Childreach organization. Jack Nicholson is a fine actor, and his depth of expression here is something to be admired. Kathy Bates also did a fine job. The problem is that nothing happens. There are about 10 minutes of notable moments in the movie, about half of them being cheap laughs almost unworthy of the pretensions of the rest of the movie. The final resolution of the 1 (one) vaguely interesting issue raised by the film was grotesquely unsatisfying to the point that I am still not sure what degree of satire, if any, was being attempted at the end. I don't understand all the fuss and praise for this movie, except for the fine acting.</fullReview>

But even to the last scene, I kept wondering when it would get to the point. Then it was abruptly over. It looked like the director got tired of the movie, too, and just 'stopped' it.The topics had potential. The movie just never took the topics anywhere. The plot was dreadfully slow. The casting was awful. The acting was mediocre. The insight was superficial.Interesting? At times. Entertaining? No. I was totally disappointed.</fullReview>

My husband and I however, (who are not American but have lived in the US), were bored to tears and serious contemplated walking out of the cinema, but decided that since the movie had received such great reviews, it would improve. It didn't - that is the only irony I could find.I think my friends didn't realise that these shallow, empty, pathetic characters truly exist in vast quantities in America - they are in fact, the bulk of the lower, middle class. I don't see any humour or irony in this - it makes me rather depressed, on the contrary. If you want to understand the point of this film, save your money and watch a couple of Roseanne re-runs.</fullReview>

Second, the story is so mundane, pedestrian, run-of-the-mill that it adds nothing, nada, zero , zip! And J.

Why didn't they just take a camera and just shove the thing up the tail end of a hippo, for cripes sake! You couldn't have found an uglier group of people if you tried! Indeed, while Jack Nicholson exhibits a lot of that hideous flesh himself, the man as an actor is simply the greatest! The rest of the story outside of Jack? Well, it basically sucks.

It is in my mind, one of the best movies I have seen in recent past. I would have liked to see this movie at a later stage in my life to have appreciated it much more.. but at least, now I know what I have in store ;-) Noticeable: Absolutely perfect performance from Jack once again! He is one of the best stars in Hollywood. This movie would have been perfect.. except for two scenes: the one scene where Jack kisses the woman who understands him very well, in an RV and the other is the Kathy Bates hot-tub scene, which was really needless.Verdict: It is a must watch movie.. at least once in a lifetime! Visu's movies and other Indian movies which show the retirement sorrow, must really learn from this movie! It also tells us, how we can really make a difference to someone before heading back to where we belong! This movie really sent a chill down my spine and I was really really touched by the ending! Awesome! Awesome!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all the films I have seen that stars Jack Nicholson previously there are always certain elements that come through of Jack's character. The wide manic grin, the devilish eyes and all the other things that make Jack tick.In this film though they remain hidden and Nicholson puts in a great muted and understated performance that may be amongst his best.His character is a sad man that realises his life is ending after his retirement and wife's death.He is left all alone to ponder his own mortality but his outlet is his only daughter and the impending marriage to a man he believes to be beneath her.As you watch you realize that one thing that everybody needs is a purpose to their life and when it is gone there is nothing left but memories.The film is beautifully scripted with everyone putting in sterling performances that make this such a touching piece of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Good Advert for Water-beds !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A curious and original film with excellent picture and sound quality. I was conscious of both its weak and strong points. As far as the latter are concerned, of course Jack N. gives a great performance and this is doubled up with touches of humour such as his comments about his wife ( prior to her death, of course ) and above all the scene in the water-bed which is just hilarious.On the other hand the overall picture painted is depressing, be it in the physical surroundings, the weather (grey overcast skies for the most part). There is also a lack of passion / love in the story ( which is what a good movie's all about of course ) so trying to make a reasonable film without either action / passion / love in is rather a foregone conclusion of a second rate result.I found the film a bit long and lacking in a spicy enough script. It was though a pleasure to watch because Jack is SUCH a good actor. He is put to better use in SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE which has both LOVE and HUMOUR. About Schmidt is rather on the depressive side, a little too much so for my tastes but you will always find movie goes who wallow in depressiveness and pessimism and I'm sure this film will end up being their heart's delight !</fullReview>

The way it was filmed, as well as the chronological order of events in the film, the acting, the storyline, the characters, were all different and interesting in their own way. It was at times hilarious, yet also extremely sad. You really feel bad for Jack's character throughout the movie. The ending was amazing and tear-jerking. If you are into mainstream junk like "You Got Served", "Love Don't Cost A Thing" "Torque" and all the other crap Hollywood is dishing out these days then you probably are in need of a dose of reality (like this film portrays) or have the mind of a 12 year old. In other words, don't see it if you have a lack of maturity. But, if you can enjoy and respect a great movie like About Schmidt, then go get it as soon as you can.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breath of fresh air in modern cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Schmidt tells next to no story, yet kept me riveted to the end. The film is a portrait of the main character, Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson), drawn through a series of events in his life just after retirement. Nicholson plays an utterly believable, very boring person. Nicholson is surrounded by a strong cast: from the not-too-beautiful daughter to the daughter's father-in-law's 'Yoko Ono'ish second wife. Such a film needs slight eccentricities to offset the dreariness of Nicholson's character. Nobody is utterly perfect, yet nobody is too repulsive. The film is full of small jokes and quite sarcasm to alleviate the mood, such as a large interstate bridge to commemorate the progress of the original pilgrims, contentedly appreciated by our man Schmidt.Note, if your idea of a good film is a hundred minutes of fighting, or non-stop slapstick, this is not the film for you. Those with Scary Movie or Matrix 2 &amp; 3 posters slapped throughout their rooms may find it a bit of a yawn. But don't despair: there's a chance to see a fat woman's breasts for you to giggle at.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson was truely great and Katy Bates was magnificent as always. I could hardly believe my eyes when she did the nude scene in the hot tub. The suggestive overtures as Roberta to Warren were hilarious. Just as Warren Schmidt exemplified, no father believes the person his child is going to marry is worthy of such a prize. The foster child was a moving time for Warren and also one with which I could identify. Over all this has to be one of the all time great movies due to its humanistic approach and realistic presentation of a person's life. Well worth the time to seen again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002)THE GOOD:--Warren's letter to Ndugu was uproariously funny and the highlight of the film.--I liked how towards the latter part of the film, Warren started to feel useless and that he had done nothing to change the world and that he had wasted his life away. Though I didn't feel too much sympathy for him, I think it may've been the point.--The wedding scene was terrific. I was even close to tears at that point, especially during the scene where Warren gives his speech.--You gotta give Kathy Bates props. I mean, she got naked for the film and gave a pretty funny performance. It wasn't as amazing as I was expecting but still a good, note-worthy performance.--Though Kathy Bates and Jack Nicholson have been getting all the awards for this film, I really must mention my personal favourite performer in this movie, and that is Hope Davis. She is the emotional anchor of the film and gives a gentle, genuine and brilliant performance that went unnoticed.THE BAD:--Generally, I found this film very boring. I looked at my watch a lot and took my time during a toilet break. It got more interesting towards the end, though I'm afraid it was too little too late.--Schmidt realising he had changed Ndugu's life was a dull and extremely obvious ending. They copped us out with Schmidt changing someone else's life and not his own?in the end it feels like some of the character development we felt going somewhere with our main character was lost in this cheesy message.--The movie is too long and doesn't have enough material to fill the space of 125 minutes.RATING:6/10 - There was some good stuff here, just not enough to fill a two hour long film. I felt rather bored and disappointed with the movie considering it had so much potential. Overrated.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:About A Boy (9/10) American Beauty (10/10) Election (10/10) The Royal Tenenbaums (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Endings in Hollywood History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is gem of a little film, set in Nebraska, and starring a sterling Jack Nicholson as a recently retired VP who looks back at his life, trying to understand its meaning and his place. Despite some mis-labels that it's a comedy, it's truly a drama with some ample doses of humor. Refreshingly, Jack plays his age (about 66), with a wife who is utterly real, a great performance by June Squibb. All the characters are realistically portrayed with superb support by Hope Davis as their only daughter, Dermot Mulroney as her fiance, Kathy Bates as his mother, Howard Hesseman as his father, many more. The film has lots of surprises and an ingenious plot device of Nicholson telling his thoughts by writing letters to a needy African boy called Ndugu. My favorite scenes book-end the film: in the beginning, we see Nicholson sitting in his office watching his clock tick to 5:00 P.M. on his very last day. The film covers repression, loneliness, aging, conformity, beautifully expressed by Nicholson. It all leads to a completely unexpected, and most gratifying conclusion. If you want aliens, explosions, car wrecks, look elsewhere. But don't miss one of 2002's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, any film with Jack Nicholson is worth seeing, and this simply blew me away. Another academy-award performance by Jack and he is better than ever.**##MINOR SPOILER AHEAD##** Jack Nicholson is Warren Schmidt, an old man who then realizes that he did not do anything with his life. So after his wife dies, he decides to go on a journey trough places he lived or places where he studied and so on. Sincerely, when the film started, I got a little sad to see how old Jack is, but that´s just how life is. The ending scene is sad, and happy at the same time. **##END OF SPOILER##**Concluding, this is an excellent film overall, drama at it´s best. Although old, Jack still continues to be the best. This film really shows how being old is not that easy. Kathy Bates is also good in this film.I give this film 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy - and in insightful presentation of the shallowness of much and many around us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed through much of this movie. But I didn't cry, even though I recognized the great truth the movie portrays about the shallowness of our lives. Almost every utterance of every character was empty of genuine feeling. Poor Schmidt. I shared with him incredible boredom with the people in his life. I shared with him his feelings of despair with the perfunctory statements made at weddings and retirement parties and dinner tables. People talk just to receive a moment of attention. What they say is not worth listening to. Almost everyone Schmidt meets is a "Stepford wife." But there is one exception. The one genuine soul in Schmidt's life is a little boy who lives halfway around the world, someone that Schmidt has never met. When that little boy wishes Schmidt well, Schmidt recognizes his sincerity and is deeply touched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming to Terms With Oneself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tells the story of how a 66-year old man, Jack Nicholson, tries to come to terms with his lifelong disappointments. Having retired from his actuary position, he feels forced to start analyzing himself and deal with his frustrations regarding his wife, daughter, and even his previous job.Jack Nicholson depicts a non-charismatic Warren Schmidt, who has spent his life phasing out his ambitions and giving into his weaknesses. Only when alone and not needed, does Mr. Schmidt realize how little he has left to lose and has the courage to admit and accept his errors. Yet, people around him are just as obnoxious and selfish and little does happen throughout the movie to suggest that Warren would ever be given more than what he already has. He lives in his own little world and take pleasure in little things. The end only brings him to finally accept his fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein:Jack Nicholson is definitely one of the greatest actors of our time; his work in this movie is absolutely amazing. The writing of this movie is just as impressive. Schmidt (Jack) realizes his life has been a waste after his wife dies. This movie is funny in a very dark, sad way, like when he finds his wife cheating on him and throws out all of her stuff out... the way it was portrayed it was supposed to be funny, but that was right after he was crying for his lose and smelling her perfume and putting on her lotion. It's almost funny but sad- hard to explain. There are however many little things that are tied in together that are funny that, if you pay attention, you will notice.The foil relationship between Schmidt and the 6 year old boy he sponsors is perfect; there is brilliance in this story that you cannot see until the end. He tells his life story to the boy regardless of his not being able to read and write, so his letters are more like a diary than anything else. After the whole rest of the movie of his trials and failures when he gets back home and narrorrates something to the effect of "my life has been useless, I have not made a difference or touched anyone's life... whose life have I changed?..." and at that moment he picks up the letter from the boy he sponsors, reads it and just stares at the picture... still makes me teary-eyed thinking about it.I would defiantly suggest this movie, awesome acting by Nicholson, amazing writing. I give it a 9/10, could have been a little better paced but overall, awesome, awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Jack's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At 66 years old, Jack Nicholoson hasn't lost his touch as one of the best actors in American cinema. The three-time winner of the Oscar for Best Actor always manages to pick projects that capture the audience's hearts and imaginations. And with his latest project, "About Schmidt," his streak continues. Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt, a recently retired life insurance actuary searching for meaning in his life. He realizes very quickly that his life has hit rock bottom. His wife of 42 years has just died, he finds out afterward that his wife and his best friend had an affair 25 years ago, his former job has been given to an eager young hotshot and finds that any of his own input is useless and unwelcome, and his daughter is about to marry Randal (Dermot Mulroney) - a mullet-sporting mattress salesman that has "loser" written all over him. But, he finds an output for his frustrations by sponsoring a young Tanzanian boy named "Ndugu," to whom Schmidt sends several letters about his life, or the life he thinks he's living. Fed up with the way things are going, he sets out on a road trip in his Winnebago for a much needed break from reality in the weeks before his daughter's wedding, to which he is constantly trying to stop. At the end of his journeys, he arrives at the home of Randal's mother, Roberta (Kathy Bates). He then finds, to his displeasure, that his future son-in-law's entire family brings a whole new meaning to the term "dysfunctional family." Roberta does try hard to make Warren feel as comfortable and at home as possible, but that's impossible. In the end, through the wedding, Warren makes his journey home, still not finding the meaning to his life he hoped he'd find and has realized that he spent the last 60 years of his life with blinders on. But, hope does arrivefor him in the form of a letter from the nun who takes care of and eductaes young Ndugu. "About Schmidt" is the warmest comedy of the year, and no doubt one of the best. The entire film encompasses a feeling of reality that could depict almost anyone's life. The film has plenty of laughs, but does rely on lowbrow humor or Hollywood gimmicks to get them. The laughs are plenty and honest. It wouldn't surprise me at all if Nicholson took home a fourth Oscar for his portrayal of Schmidt. Nicholson gives off a performance that is funny, touching, and saddening at the same time. Bates also is comic perfection in her role of the control-freak, foul-mouthed mother-in-law. But, the most over-looked performance of all is Dermot Mulroney's portrayal of Randal. He's a typical loser, but he's a charming loser. Randal brings in laughs, not only with his rediculous hair, but with his overall being, and one of the worst wedding vows in history in which we learn just how many seconds and minutes there are in a day. "About Schmidt" is my pick for the best comedy of the year. On a scale of one to ten, definitely "About Schmidt" desevres a ten. Filmmakers should look to this film to learn what a great American film can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the last years silence get out of buiseness in Hollywood. Everything must be flat, loud and spectacular. Directors like M. Night Shyamalan and also Alexander Payne found out, that slowmotion and silence is a very good way to tell storys intensly. "About Schmidt" works perfectly as a combination of comedy and drama. It is perfectly written and i don't understand, why it did not get nominated for an Academy Award after winning the Golden Globe as best Screenplay. The cast ist outstanding, everyone gives his best to support the story. There is a lot of truth in that movie as it was in "American Beauty" for examepl. A movie wich can change the Audience. Something, big Hollywood Flicks like the totaly overproduced "Chicago" never could reach. Nicholson is at his best. I think, every three to four years he gives a performance of the Decade. When you liked "As good as it gets" you'll love Nicholson in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing for the acting--nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) has recently retired. He's lived a quiet, meaningless life. His wife dies and his only child Jeannie (Hope Davis) is getting married to a very strange man (Dermot Mulroney) that Warren can't stand. He travels from Nebraska to Colorado to stop the wedding--but can he--or should he?Slow, morbid and extremely unfunny...but worth seeing for the acting. Nicholson is just superb as Schmidt. He completely covers his usual Nicholson mannerisms and gives a quiet, restrained performance. Kathy Bates is absolutely hysterical as Mulroney's very odd mother...she's even better than Nicholson! Aside from these two and some beautiful scenery, there's no reason to see this movie.The script is horrible--very slow with some really sick humor throughout and peopled with unpleasant characters. All the characters here are unlikable and tiredly strange and "cute". I seriously considered walking out a few times. Also when he travels from NE to CO the movie turns into a pointless travelogue--for 30 LONG minutes. I didn't pay $10.00 to see pretty scenery.See this for Nicholson and Bates. Otherwise this is long and dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Schmidt-7/10 is a quiet, understated little film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SpoilersAbout Schmidt is a quiet, understated little film about making a difference in people's lives and whether or not those who know and love us will remember us when we are gone and features a good performance by one of America's great actors. Jack Nicholson stars as Warren Schmidt, a 66 year old man who has just retired from the insurance industry and lives in Nebraska with his demanding wife of 40 some odd years. Warren's life is boring and dull nothing is happening in his life and he wonders is this all that there is left for him. Out of curiosity or charity Warren decides to sponsor a young orphan boy from Tanzania, after watching one of those commercials on TV. This really provides the heart for the film as we hear what Warren writes in his letters to the young boy and it serves as narration for what is happening in Warren's life. After his wife dies rather suddenly, Warren decides to get away and takes a trip in the new RV they had bought. He hopes to go to Colorado and meet with his daughter Jeannie played by Hope Davis, who is recently engaged to Randall, a man who Warren disapproves of, who is very rough around the edges and is the epitomy of white trash. However, Randall has a good heart and good intentions and even offers Warren a business oportunity. Warren also meets other folks along the way and the rest of Radanll's family including his mother Roberta played by Kathy Bates the sort of fiesty no nonsense character she always seems to play. I'll also say right now I did not need to see Kathy Bates stepping into a hot-tub...an image that was frightening! Beyond that this film really isn't much more. Nicholson dominates the film and he is funny and amusing in a sad and pathetic kind of way. Overall About Schmidt really didn't leave a lasting impression on me, although it had a good cast and a nice performance by Jack Nicholson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made a believer out of me (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: I am not a big Jack Nicholson fan. I just have never understood what people see in him that makes him so revered. Yes, I think he is talented, yes I think he deserves the accolades he receives, yes he seems to play the same old "Jack" in every movie, and yes he has turned in some memorable performances. But I've always felt that he has received just a little "too" much attention/respect for his craft and that other actors, most notably Gene Hackman, have not received equal attention/respect. I do not dislike Jack Nicholson, it's just that there are other actors I prefer to watch more. But, after seeing About Schmidt I think I have turned over a new leaf regarding Jack Nicholson. This movie was wonderful. Superb, realistic dialogue and realistic relationships that are not contrived, animated, or exaggerated. Well written and well directed. This movie may appeal more to people who can relate to the issues the main character is facing; boring marriage, advancing age, mourning, strained and distant relationship with offspring, loneliness, the pondering of one's own death, self-pity, and failure. At times it is excruciatingly depressing but manages to inject small doses of humor as well. The best movie I have seen in a long time. Jack made a believer out of me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost too real ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is deeply touching. Although I am only 26 years old, and the movie is about retirement, it helped me put things in perspective. Don't get me wrong, I love action flicks that take you along for a roller-coaster drive of explosions and punches, but I have a soft-spot for movies that make me think and, most of all, make me feel.Jack Nicholson is absolutely brilliant. Although some of the scenes are overly-exaggerated for dramatic and comic content - which many times reminded me of Steve Martin in Father of The Bride or Kevin Spacey in American Beauty - the storyline is very believable, and at times almost too real. Warren Schmidt's soul searching becomes an excruciating experience where he faces his innermost fears and challenges the beliefs he's held for 66 years. The contrast between his "contribution" to corporate America and his humanitarian help to Ndugu becomes the driving force of the movie. How can more than 30 years at a company be blown away by contributing USD22 per month to become a foster father of an African child?All in all, the movie is deeply moving. To anyone currently questioning his career choice, his aspirations in life or quite simply making an inventory of achievements, this movie is of great value. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragicomedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a fundamental dislike of films that might have some note of "depressing" subject matter for American viewers. I can never understand this. I think this speaks volumes of a nation so hung up on seratonin reuptake inhibitors to "wash our blues away". I for one find a certain honesty in films which are not afraid to poke around those dark corners of the human soul, because in reality, life seldom wraps up with a happy ending by the time the credits roll. That said, my thoughts: (Spoilers) About Schmidt comes across as a very funny and yet terribly tragic comment on life after retirement. Warren Schmidt is the restrained everyman we encounter daily, often unnoticed, and perhaps so close to ourselves that the film hits a bit too close to home. Schmidt took the path we have often been taught to accept...He went to college, got a good safe job, had a family. He seems well liked and respected by his cohorts and lives a comfortable middle class life. And yet upon his retirement he is faced by the haunting realization that in fourty years of gainful employment, he has contributed virtually nothing to society. Upon the death of his wife, he embarks on a winnebago tour of self discovery, pouring out his thoughts in letters to a six year old adopted Tanzanian boy named Ndugu (who doubtless cannot understand a word Schmidt writes,) precisely because he has no one else to talk to. This trip culminates with the marriage of his daughter to a waterbed salesman deemed by Schmidt to be sub-par for his princess, but he deals with her choice with characteristic midwestern restraint. Feeling totally lost and alone in his life, he returns to an empty house a self proclaimed failure, only to find that his great life question has been, in some small way, answered in a child's drawing. And if you are human, you should be crying at the end of this film. Nicholson makes Schmidt the restrained master of repressed emotion. I am reminded of literary characters like "Alfred Lambert" In Jonathan Franzen's "The Corrections" or Chris Ware's epic cartoon novel "Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth". Here we see what can happen when the banality of corporate offices and meaningless jobs reduce life to an automatic routine allowing the important things to pass by unnoticed. If only Schmidt had been reading "Organization Man" when he was in college, or listened to Malvina Reynolds sing about lives made out of ticky-tacky all looking the same, he might have arrived at 66 in better shape.Without a doubt, one of the best movies of 2002. You won't be hit over the head by anything (this movie is so restrained it hurts) and I might compare it to "The Strait Story" for its slow and deliberate pace and quiet revelation at its conclusion. If you don't have an attention span, skip it because I don't want to have to read another response about this movie being boring. And yes, it is depressing, but hey, that's life. About Schmidt doesn't take the easy way out. You want bubble gum? Watch Britney Spears. You want great cinema, see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Performances Make One Of 2002s Finest Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, who is no stranger to greatness in motion pictures, gives another superb performance as Warren Schmidt in Alexander Payne's new film, About Schmidt. Jack Nicholson has performed in such wonderful films as As Good As It Gets, The Shinning, A Few Good Men, and who could forget his hilarious/psychotic roll as the Joker in 1989s Batman. However, About Schmidt is a far cry from Batman. In fact, this film is somewhat comparable to American Beauty in that its main characters are too men who have been completely disillusioned by life and it's experiences. But About Schmidt's Warren Schmidt, is not nearly as disillusioned as American Beauty's Lester Burnham. I would say that Warren is simply tired of living a life that is a letdown and is flat-out boring. But the real problem is that Warren has absolutely no idea what life is really all about to begin with. Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is a 66 year-old retiree and shortly after his retirement as vice-president from a large insurance agency in Omaha, Nebraska, his wife (June Squibb) dies. Having no one around to keep the house clean, or make him three square meals a day, Warren slips into a state of absolute childhood; he only watches television, doesn't clean up, and eats TV dinners by the dozen. The only things that really seem to matter to Warren are his daughter, Jeannie (Hope Davis) and the letters that he writes to an orphan in African village, named Ndugu. Realizing that there is nothing left for him at home after his wife's death, Warren hits the road in a huge Recreational Vehicle (RV) that he and his wife bought prior to her death. He heads out to Kansas for his daughter's wedding to a man that Warren despises, played by Dermot Mulroney. When he arrives, he meets his future in-laws played by Kathy Bates and Howard Hesseman. Kathy Bates plays the groom's mother, Roberta, who is a little more than unorthodox, from lying naked in a hot tub with Warren, to revealing the secrets about her sex-drive. In the end, it's up to Warren to accept the challenges and tribulations of life and make the best of things, or else, what else wallow in a state of pity for the rest of his existence. This film is quite amusing at times, especially when we see Warren struggle through his problems. Probably the funniest parts of the film occur when Warren meets Roberta, played by Kathy Bates. Bates steals the show with her hilarious take on the mother in a dysfunctional family. And of course, the reports of nudity of Kathy Bates are true. Although very brief, we don't see anything that is all too revealing at all. Nonetheless, she gives a great performance, as does Nicholson as the disillusioned, Warren Schmidt. Nicholson, in fact, just won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for his performance in About Schmidt. When I first heard this last week, I was a bit apprehensive. I was hoping for Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in Gangs of New York. However, after seeing About Schmidt, it is clear that Nicholson did deserve the award. If I had been a judge for the awards, it would have been difficult for me to choose which man for the award. But one can't complain about Nicholson. His performance is top notch. About Schmidt is very funny and not at all what I was expecting. I highly recommend About Schmidt for anyone looking for a change of pace from the normal comedy genre films currently playing, such as Just Married. Although it starts out a bit slow, don't let that deter your enjoyment from this excellent motion picture. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this has really divided the users. What with the comments and all.Well I went out to see this with very mixed opinions given to me. Half of everyone here was saying that it was generally uninteresting. However on the other hand Jack just won another award. And the critics seemed to love it aswell. And I also liked the makers former film Election. Very confusing indeed.Well all I can truely say about About Schmidt, is that it is so damn depressingly real, it's like a holding a mirror up to John Q at the last chapter of his life. I say that for sure, the rest I am mixed about.Well, Jack was good. Better than good. No other actor can emit emotions with simple facal expressions better than Jack. I really do hope he gets another Oscar, cause hell, he desevres it. Kathy and the rest of the supporting cast are exceptional and gives the movie it true comedy element. Jack simply bounces off these guys, because they are pretty odd. Those 3 things are all I'm positive on. The other things, not too sure.Direction wise, a few little worries. The directors job is to get the actors to act well. And like I said the cast is pretty good. Telling Jack what to do, just seems wrong to me. The approach of the film was good. No flashes inside Warren Schmidt's head, no "What Warren Schmidt wants right now to happen" sequences(OK just one but that doesn't honestly count). Just honest pictures. Just capturing the sad, angry mans life. It's a like doco really.The script is where I'm all over the place. I like it for it's brutal honesty but i hate it at the same time. I, along with some users who posted negative comments, wanted something more from a film. I wanted to see ironic twists, off-beat moments, one-liners, anything!! I wanted Jack to say a funny line just like in 'As Good As It Gets'. But he doesn't. He stands and sits and walks, with nothin but a sad look on his face. Honestly, some people really do need more which does explain the upset comments. But in keeping the film honest, it is one of the best and most intelligent scripts ever. Just don't forget, it's more drama, just not 'American Beauty' drama. You understand what I'm saying?But all in all, I would lying if I didn't say i hated this film. I actually thought that it is easily top 5 films of the year. I really did enjoy it in the end, speaking of ends this one has a really good one. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson has filled the big screen for nearly half a century. He hasn't lost a beat. His highly nuanced performance about a post retired Omaha executive, who comes to realize that his life has been without meaning. Watch Nicholson's face; what other actor his age loves the camera so much that extreme close-up tell us more than dialog. Most "A" list actors are concerned with looking good, all the time. Ever see Mel Gibson when his hair didn't look perfect, even in the morning. Ever look at your hair in the morning and wonder how he does it. Nicholson has no such reservations. He takes chances and he succeeds. Another chancey performaner is Kathy Bates, who does a nude scene, despite her Reubenesque proportions. Nicholson's character is finally redeemed, but that tidbit you'll have to see for yourself. What a wonderful movie; there wasn't a dry eye in the house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Schmidt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this film, I was expecting it to be a boring family drama, but it was a really good one once you get into it. Basically Warren Schmidt (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Jack Nicholson) has recently lost his wife, Helen (June Squibb), who he felt had annoying habits, but he still loved her to bits. Anyway, the story is about him because he is sending letters to a poor and hungry person in Africa for a charity. The rest of the story really is his journey through his past, where he is visiting places in his childhood and young life. Also starring Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kathy Bates as Roberta Hertzel, Hope Davis as Jeannie Schmidt, Dermot Mulroney as Randall Hertzel, Howard Hesseman as Larry Hertzel and Mark Venhuizen as Duncan Hertzel. It does seem a bit boring for 15-20 minutes, but stay with it and you will find it is an enjoyable drama. It won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Director for Alexander Payne and Best Picture - Drama. Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Got me hooked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When flipping to this movie on cable I came in about 15 minutes or so into the film, the funeral had just been over and I watched as 1 man who had his wife take care of him progressed into an utter slob. I watched as many small things progessed up to his daughters wedding. I enjoyed the movie as it kept me entertained with the smallest of things one retired man could do. It seemed to slow down for me when it came to the wedding, I wanted to see more Schmidt, but no...we had to see this bullshit wedding crap. All in all I did cry at the ending because here he goes on for about 3 minutes about how his life mattered to no one and he reads a letter from a boy about how he made a difference in a boy...I guess to me that was a tear jerker and if you think I'm a wuss, you should die. All in all it was great and I find the Kathy Bates naked scene was kind of pointless. I didn't like the Kathy Bates character and thought meeting the family was extremely pointless and not very funny, so besides me seeing a possible good 15 minute start and a crappy pause for the wedding, I enjoyed this movie and will buy it on DVD so on bored days I can pop in this great watch! 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kathy Bates nude... uuuhhhh....Anyway, Jack Nicholson stars as a guy by the name of--that's right--Schmidt. He's down on his luck, seeing as how his wife, who he didn't really appreciate in the first place, just died. So he goes on a road trip to stop his daughter from marrying the wrong man. He soon discovers himself and that he can't always control everything.Great acting, great characters, but a fairly plain plotline. Which it's meant to be. I suggest seeing it if you're in the mood for a good character study, or if you're a Nicholson or Bates fan.But man, why did she have to go nude? Just a little rant here, but from what I understand, she did it to sort of say that hey, other people than "beautifuls" can do nude scenes. But the problem is... THERE'S A REASON only "beautifuls" do nude scenes... anyway. It's still a good movie, just... eww....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing "About Schmidt", and I must say that I was pretty impressed. Jack Nicholson gave an amazing performance as just a regular old guy. This movie contained so many little truths that happen in everyday life, and I thought it was very well done. I like to keep my reviews pretty short, so that's it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God It Was Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the majority of writers for this film, I found nothing in this monstrosity to commend it in anyway. I feel at a total loss to find so many people who think that this was a beautifully portrayed masterpiece from Payne and Nicholson. Thankfully my own life is a happy one, because after watching this abomination, I could easily have taken my own life had there been the hint of depression about it beforehand.This was not funny, imaginative or probing. It was simply a waste of 2 hours of my life that otherwise may have been happy. I hope and pray that Nicholson finds it in him to stay away from roles such as this which in my mind, will only hurt him when remembering his wonderful career. I even drove myself to start watching it again because, so many of you out there cannot be wrong..... well, you are and remind me not to ask you out to watch a movie of your choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about Schmidt?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, Warren Schmidt is a boring, cheap bastard who's having a life crisis, and... well, that's about it. I guess the film is supposed to be about his literal/figurative journey towards a better life, but as far as I could see he didn't really get anywhere.The film is deliberately slowly paced, but that doesn't have to mean that it's boring as well (which it, sadly, is for the most part). With a running time just shy of two hours, it's not a good thing when it takes 45 minutes for something to happen. The film could easily have been trimmed down quite a bit, and been all the better for it.Normally, I don't like Nicholson's (over)acting, so it's a bit of a paradox that I think that the film picks up pace only when Nicholson does something other than staring out into space with a sullen look on his face. I loved his voice-over bits, though, maybe he should do an audiobook or something.There are some good things in the film (the score, Dermot Mulroney, and a couple of funny scenes), but on the whole, I would have expected more from director Payne, whose previous film Election is a real treat. As for About Schmidt, I shrug my shoulders, say "What about Schmidt?", and give it a (barely) passing grade. [4/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Which Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Brando invented the modern acting technique of giving you two films: the one in which the characters exist, and another in which the actors exist. Nicholson has developed that into something rather clever. The basic job is the same, to inhabit a character and create a truth so sharp you think you knew it all along. But the second layer for Nicholson -- at least in these later films, say after `Chinatown' -- is to reflect another film. So the question when watching one of his newer projects is: while we see him in this film, what film does he see himself in?David Lynch made `The Straight Story' with `Easy Rider' in mind, and I think the film Nicholson created here as his shadow film is `Easy,` through `Straight.' That scene by the river is Lynchian.But the tone the director had in mind was very close to Christopher Guest, where every being is terminally pathetic in some way. `Best in Show,' in fact has a scene with Guest traveling along a road which reminded me very much of the visual narrative that Payne spins.Peter Greenaway made an extraordinary film (`Death in the Seine') which illustrated notes from a Paris coroner on corpses found in the river. These are exquisitely presented views of completely anonymous bodies, who have had worse than a worthless life, they have no life at all. More, these deaths occurred during the brief use of an odd calendar after the French revolution -- when the calendar was restored, these deaths were virtually erased. By bringing these eclipsed lives to film, he makes them more real than they ever were in life. I think that is what Jack is sometimes about these days; taking a worthless man, in a worthless environment (city, profession, family, even Rush Limbaugh!) and making him bigger through archetyping by force. It is something like the attention given to the plastic bag in `American Beauty,' but made personal by lifting our own ordinariness a smidge.Every other character is background noise.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie but it never gave me a chance. It was as though Jack made this movie with no heart or care and did it just for a paycheck. I was so depressed after this movie family guy could barely make me laugh. I have never been to Kansas or Denver but please tell me they do not look that depressing. The only believable performance was from Kathy Bates. Also, if my daughter ever talked to me the way his daughter did and acted like that to me I sure would not be handing over check to pay for anything. If you do not want me around then do not expect my money to be around. Finally, if my wife every told me I had to sit down when I pee I would think she had gone crazy and made her an appointment at the crazy house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps if About Schmidt were about something other than nothingness, I would have found myself actually caring about Schmidt as I watched this movie. But as it was, the film really didn't make me think or feel much of anything. Sure, Warren Schmidt's character is pitiable - it's hard not to sympathize with someone whose life is devoid of any real passion or human connection, and Jack Nicholson, of course, brings Warren as much to life as is possible.Warren has just retired from his position as vice president at an insurance agency, only to find himself wondering who the old woman who shares his bed is, and how his daughter Jeanie can really plan to marry the ponytail-wielding, pyramid scheme-vending man she calls her fiance. So, when his wife is out of the picture, Warren embarks on a meandering road trip that will eventually land him in Denver to try to stop his daughter's wedding.While Warren's adventures, if one can call them such, are portrayed with a satiric edge, the tone of the movie is quite maudlin, not at all what one expects from director Alexander Payne, whose brilliant Election managed to pick its characters apart yet still garner viewers' sympathy for them. About Schmidt, on the other hand, is unevenly satiric. Some characters, like Jeanie's fiance and his mother, are utter caricatures who serve mainly to remind both Warren and the viewer that he can't care about anything surrounding him. When he finally meets someone who notices his sadness, someone he thinks he can care about - in an R.V. park, no less - he is reminded, with the pain and awkwardness we expect from Payne, that life has room for very little human understanding.The only real emotional connection he is able to forge is with a six-year-old Tanzanian boy, Ndugu, whom Warren adopts through a charity. Letters to Ndugu become Warren's outlet, and the movie is filled with voiceovers narrating Warren's adventures and emotional state. Perhaps it sounds as if this plot line is not meant to be taken seriously, as if it keeps with Payne's signature satiric style. If only such a presumption were true. One does laugh upon hearing Warren beginning yet another letter to his illiterate young friend and revealing absurd details about his life, such as the fact that his wife used to make him urinate sitting down so as not to get the toilet seat wet. But Payne seems to be just as earnest about Ndugu and all that he represents as Warren himself does. The way that Ndugu ends up being the one person whose life Warren has significantly touched and therefore the one person who significantly touches Warren is meant to be viewed sentimentally, not cynically.It seemed to me, after watching About Schmidt, that Payne wants us to feel the pain Warren's emptiness has caused him, and to find hope and significance in the `new life' we see him beginning over the course of the film. The problem is that we aren't sure who to care about. The lives of the characters presented to us are laughably pathetic, but frighteningly resonant. While watching this movie, we aren't sure whether to laugh or to cry, to love or to hate, because the film itself, like Warren Schmidt, hasn't quite figured out what it's about.</fullReview>
