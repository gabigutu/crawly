		<shortDescription>Good, but not worthy of the Terminator franchise (including nerdy rant &amp; SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it's easy to put "Terminator 3" down. Everybody had great expectations and it was clear that this movie would have lots of enemies, especially if someone else than Cameron was going to direct. So, here it is now, T3, and the truth is, it is a good action movie, just not as good as Terminator 1 &amp; 2.What I liked best about this movie is that it doesn't include any martial arts. Since "The Matrix" came out, I often wondered if it would even be possible to make an action movie without Kung Fu anymore. Also, Mostow really tried to not only focus on the action but include some story and character development, too. The problem is, the story is nowhere near as good as it used to be. The writers mistook character development for endless whiney monologues by John Connor, supposed leader of mankind. Where Cameron always found the right balance between someone explaining what was going on and action scenes, T3 fell into the trap of slowing down too often.What's bothering me even more, is that writers really had a lot of chances to turn ?Terminator 3" into an interesting story that picked up from the end of T2. I hoped that finally we'd get an explanation for why only one Terminator is sent back at a time, how the time portal works, how CyberDyne recreated the information on future technology after it had been destroyed in part 2, etc. Instead writers gave vague or no hints at all to previous riddles and went away too far from the original ideas of ?Terminator". ?No fate but what we make for ourselves" we were told in parts 1 &amp; 2. Now it has changed to ?Judgement Day is inevitable". Why is that, you may ask yourself and why would a Terminator know that? It's only one of many things that don't really make sense. A fact that's even more annoying when you think about how perfect the series has been so far. Sure, James Cameron had also made mistakes (John's and Sarah's age, for instance) but the main story did always make sense.Mostow obviously was afraid of stepping into Cameron's shoes and be compared to him, so he decided to put several nods to the previous movies in sequel no. 2. Nice thought, but T3 is definitely too much of a ?nod" to T1 &amp; T2. It's part parody, part rip-off that has only few new elements. Again there are two Terminators, one brand new, one obsolete, we get a spectacular car chase, desert scenes, etc. Furthermore, we get a funny version of the bar scene at the beginning and a ?funny" cameo by infamous psychiatrist Dr. Silberman. Yes, some of the jokes are actually quite funny, but really, why would the Terminator smash the gay glasses? Come on, this is supposed to be a serious movie! The worst thing about all this repeating old stuff is that this time there's no suspense whatsoever. It just feels like we've seen it before and we know exactly what's coming.One scene that could have brought a cool twist to the movie was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. It would have been so cool, if the T-800 had turned into the bad guy again now. It would have showed that a machine knows no loyalty. Instead we got the most stupid scene ever in a ?Terminator" movie: John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 ?It can't be bargained with" and now John did just that. Sad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And what's with John Connor? Isn't he the one who will go on to lead mankind? In T3, he isn't much of a leader to me. Is it the writers fault or Nick Stahl's, I don't know, but the character is such a sissy in this movie, it's painful.About the T-X: why the hell isn't that thing bigger, stronger, faster? The T-X has no real improvements compared to the T-1000 and it seems to be really stupid. How else could it lose to the trashy T-800? And why did it change back to its known form just before it could have killed Kate Brewster in the disguise of her fiancé. Why would it walk around with the same face all the time, anyway? (Granted, that's a question that T2 had already raised and not answered) Although Kristinna Loken played her part quite well, I think it was a bad decision to have a woman play the T-X in the first place. How cool is it to watch Big Ol' Arnold beat up a girl? There are so many more minor mistakes in this movie it gives me headaches (why was the T-800 already programmed to not kill innocent people and look for the keys in the car when it was a different Terminator than the one in part 2? If Arnie is not programmed to answer John's questions why did he answer when John asked if he was gonna kill him? Why did the T-X investigate the place where Kate Brewster works at night? Why didn't the T-X try to reprogram the T-800 from the beginning? Why has the Terminator never used the little atom bomb chip, he's carrying within, against an enemy?), but I think I better stop here.However, I did like the ending a lot as it's the only real improvement to the whole story and an open door for a sequel. "Terminator 3" is still the best action movie of this summer and it feels really good to see Arnie back in action one more (last?) time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who cares!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks "now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up" or "let's try this - it might be funny". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of "who cares!" The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Terminator is a character idolized by thousands of people around the world. The imagery - along with unconscious symbols - made this character an icon for generations. Jim Cameron ingenuity (with the help of Bill Wisher) gave us two movies that complement each other, folding the story in ways ever more interesting each time you watch them. Action packed, fun and original. We helped spread the word on Terminator mythology. How come a movie studio using their rights to use a character build up such a opportunity-jackpot-halfbaked popcorn movie just to make cash out of loyalty of this huge fan base? I felt betrayed and sad when I saw this (God permits) last installment on this sequel. What have they done to my robot? What did they do with my movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if there were no Terminator or T2, T3 would be a horridly mediocre movie. The original Terminator was an exercise in imagination conquering budget limitations, while T2 showed what could be accomplished if imagination were wedded to an unlimited budget. T3 shows what a tremendous budget with little imagination gets you - a terminator whose unique ability is to make her fingers into sharp points. Whoopee! There are narrative lapses too numerous to mention, such as our non-tech hero operating an atom smasher. Or a heroine who doesn't know exactly what her father does for a living traipsing into the super secret underground &amp; armored military installation where he works. T3 operates best as a self-administered IQ test: if you thought this movie was good, you should seriously consider remedial education.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3 is a solid follow up to a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 was actually very good. Put it this way, if we had never been treated to the classic and innovative T2, I believe a lot more people would have been in love with T3. T3 was looking at some serious obstacles: 1.) following up T2, a monster success 2.) an aging Arnold Schwarzenegger 3.) making a cohesive story that wouldn't contradict the former Terminators 4.) making a better terminator than the T-1000.As I said before, they followed up T2 respectably enough. There were good fight scenes with the T-800 and the T-X (I particularly like the fight in the bathroom), and there was an excellent car chase scene near the beginning. The action was good and plentiful, the effects were nice, and there was some good humor in the movie as well.Arnold was still in shape enough and made up enough to be believable. Of course he wore the leather jacket the entire movie. Not only that, he was an older Terminator model anyway, so any signs of stiffness or slow wittedness could easily be blamed on that.The story flowed well. John Connor (Nick Stahl) was again the focus except he is now a bit more subdued and scared. In his attempts to stay out of any electronic systems, he chooses a horrible life of joblessness, homelessness, and just plain bumming it. He was complimented by a much smarter, cleaner, and stronger partner, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes); she was tied into the story rather well. They stayed true to the Armageddon type story line and even had a bit of misdirection at the end to make the movie even more interesting.The T-X model terminator (Kristanna Loken) was nice. Sure, they chose a beautiful woman for the T-X, but she was not to be trifled with. The T-X had the same shape shifting abilities as her predecessor (the T-1000) but she also had abilities to control anything that had a CPU and she could form her hand into a variety of weapons. Similar to the T-1000 (Robert Patrick of T2), the T-X (Loken) took the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) to town, but she was a bit more dangerous even than the T-1000.T3 was a solid movie for a third installment. Usually by the third sequel you are begging Hollywood to stop, but I can't say that about this movie. This movie is good enough to watch more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introducing the T-X.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schwarzeneggar is back (he said he would be) as another T-1000 cyborg sent through time to protect the now grown up John Connor (Nick Stahl), and his future wife, Kate (Claire Danes), who are being stalked by the T-X (Kristanna Loken), the latest in murderous machines hellbent on destroying the human race.Rise Of The Machines might not be the (near) perfect juggernaut of an action sequel that was Cameron's Judgement Day, but as far as edge-of-the-seat, sci-fi fun goes, it's still bloody good! Director Jonathan Mostow certainly makes the most of his mega-budget, and delivers plenty of jaw-dropping mayhem along with loads of impressive special effects. And Schwarzenneggar does what he does best: blowing things up, shooting huge weapons, and delivering cheesy one-liners.The (mostly) smart script follows on nicely from The Terminator and T2, further developing the character of John Connor, neatly explaining away the absence of Linda Hamilton in a not-too-disappointing way, and brilliantly bringing the whole affair to a satisfying, and not altogether happy, conclusion. There is blistering action (a set piece involving a massive crane causing untold damage to umpteen cars and buildings is absolutely incredible), some nice touches of humour, and a bit of quite gruesome violence (for a DVD that is rated 12!).Sure, T3 isn't quite as good as its predecessors, but how many films are? Both the original The Terminator and T2 are extremely tough acts to follow. I think Rise Of The Machines does a pretty good job and deserves a lot more praise than it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a "Terminator" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers Ahead*For T3, I wanted a serious movie with dark tones(afterall it is the supposed Rise of the Machines) that had a message of deep meaning like the previous 2 movies and that would develop each character, their inner thoughts, and expand the storyline while being faithful to the Terminator universe. I wanted to see the Skynet A.I. being developed, i wanted more hints at the establishment of Skynet and the machines. I wanted a movie with dazzling chase scenes. I wanted an established and well executed plot. I wanted a moving T3 score on par with the previous 2 Terminator movies. I wanted an Arnold that was "the Terminator". In all i just wanted a decent film faithful enough to be able to call itself a "Terminator" movie.But what did we get instead? A bizarre comedy which made fun of the Terminator and destroyed everything Terminator previously stood for. A movie which had no serious tones and that preferred comedy and weak action scenes directed in a careless manner. So much for T3 being a "REAL" Terminator movie. The crane truck sequence was ok, but every chase scene in T2 s***s all over it. Was that the only chase sequence in T3? Well no if you include that p***weak hearse chase. So much for upholding the strong element of chase scenes the previous 2 Terminator movies were renowned for.What about the T-X? Given a secondary mission as well as a primary one? How stupid - there should only be one mission - to kill John Connor. Any secondary objective just takes away any impact of the primary one. What about her one liners, array of cheesy weapons, and crappy abilities? Again - more stupid decisions. I didnt once feel that the T-X was a threat to John, nor did i feel that it had the screen presence likened to that of the T-1000.What about Arnold? Now a T-850 he has a basic knowledge of psyhcology, the ability to change power cells, and a great sense of humour. He should be called the T-850 wise cracking breakdancing disco cyborg. Not once did i take Arnold seriously, and cringed everytime he said anything.As for Claire Danes and Nick Stahl - i thought they were ok - but ultimately the story didnt allow to develop their characters or give them any scenes of deep meaning or of a serious tone.What about the futurewar sequence? What a joke - we get about 1 minute of CGI endoskeletons - and an older John Connor parading victory in front of an American flag. Where the hell are Stan's menacing T-800's? Where the hell is the "future war"? All i see is a rushed scene.And the supposed "Rise of the Machines?" We get about 3 minutes explaining that there is problems with Skynet, a virus, and a little hint of the creation of a machine army. Woah! Don't go overboard on story Director Jonathon Mostow! I would have been much better to see the plot more fleshed out and explained properly rather than told in a poorly rushed manner.Was the movie fun? If your looking for a paper thin movie with lots of comedy and crap action scenes you'll probably like T3. But ultimately T3 came off as a stupid popcorn comedy flick devoid of any serious tones or intelligence, filled with undeveloped characters, poorly directed and lacking action scenes, a non-existent score by hack composer Marco Beltrami, and an unfilling and rushed storyline. T3 felt as if the movie had at least 20 to 30 minutes cut from it, so it wont surprise me if we see a "hack directors cut" T3 DVD. Painfully obvious is the absence of James Cameron, Brad Fiedel, and true Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger.T3 is the Alien 3 of the Terminator saga, but at least Alien 3 went with more of a serious tone instead of making the Dog Alien a wisecracking breakdancing disco Alien. Comparitively with Alien 3, T3 will probably garner the same reaction from hardcore Terminator fans - treating it with a ghostlike non-existence. Because that is what this movie truly deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To think: I'm criticizing Arnold for showing TOO MUCH emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor writing and poor directing plagued this film. The characters simply weren't who they were supposed to be.John Connor (Nick Stahl) who was trained in weapons and warfare from childhood by his mother dealt unflinchingly with the threat of the T-1000 as a 13 year old boy now appears to be a scared and confused drifter who freezes under pressure and exudes none of the confidence or ingenuity he did a decade ago.The T-X (Kristanna Loken) is cartoony. In place of ruthless efficiency for which the terminators are known she kills sadistically. Rather then relentlessly pursuing her enemy she seems to saunter and pose in what I can only assume is an attempt to build suspense. And in the end, she simply isn't that frightening of a villain.Arnold was the biggest disappointment if only because he played the role with far too much of a human feel. He has emotional conversations with John Connor, appears angry and surprised at times, and has a number of one-liners during action sequences that require far more wit than a machine with no emotion should be capable of.The sound was absurd. When the terminator or the T-X was hit with something heavy we were greeted by a cartoony "boink" rather than something realistic. The soundtrack also lacked all of the attitude and intensity that truly set the atmosphere for the first two movies.*spoilers*And the continuity errors and unanswered questions ruined any hope of a story the movie may have hadTerminator 2 tells us that terminators (at least stock terminators) can't learn. Arnie clearly does, after learning and reciting the "talk to the hand" phrase.Terminator 1 tells us that The Terminators were only sent back to kill John as a last ditch effort once the resistance had destroyed the skynet core. Now, Skynet doesn't have a core at all.Why would the US government leave a secret, high grade fallout shelter COMPLETELY unguarded?How did John, Kate, and a 6 foot tall terminator in black leather make it to the command center of a busy high tech military research facility without authorization and while carrying loaded weapons? And why isn't anyone surprised to see them there until shooting starts?While the T-X can control machines, how can she remotely move the gear shift of a car from park to drive, an action that requires physical interaction?If, as T2 suggests, the concept of skynet was only made possible by the discovery of the pieces of the destroyed terminator from T1, how was it possible in T3 after John Connor destroyed all remnants of the terminators sent back through time?Unfortunately I could go on and on from here. From the final product it appears as though the writers spent less time on the script for this movie than I did on this review</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be ? a big loud enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets ? Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be ? be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene ? partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character ? the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do ? no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reasonably fitting end to the series, or a vision of things to come?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 was nothing short of a thrill-ride of explosions, over-the-top action and fun - although after three movies I am finding the Terminator series getting very repetitive. Is it just me, or does it seem like a member of the resistance comes back to protect John Connor/Sarah Connor, the machines send back a Terminator to take them out - we see some fights and bingo-bango, a couple hours later it is all resolved?I felt Terminator 3 lacked the look and feel of the classic Terminator 2, and often bordered on unintentionally comical scenes. I had to laugh at some of the fight scenes between The Terminator and the T-X, which seemed like some sort of CGI bad dream. On the opposite side of the coin, the scenes throughout the movie which were supposed to be comical, felt very cheesy and tacked-on, i.e. the Elton John glasses.That aside, Terminator 3 was packed full of what Arnie movies do best - fights, chases and s*** getting blown up. The car chase scene involving the crane was great, and as far as I am concerned was better than The Matrix Reloaded's attempt at a car chase any day. The T-X, played by very cute Kristanna Loken, brought a freshness to her role as the 'Anti-Terminator' Terminator. The T-X seems to take the best of the Terminator and the T-1000, and chucks in some extra firepower for added effectiveness.Terminator 3 might not add as much to the overall story as possibly Terminator 2, but it will fill a lot of holes, expand on some of the concepts hinted at in previous movies and tie up some loose ends in the series. You will learn more about John Connor's future, Skynet, Judgement Day, and the future of mankind's battle against the machines.As for the ending? Well I thought it was a very interesting and thought-provoking way to end the movie, and possibly the series. Although given Hollywood, I would imagine there will probably be at least one or two more movies. With or without Arnold, the series surely must move away from the "send back a Terminator to kill John, and they send one to protect him" style, and take us to the future where John Connor takes control of the resistance.I give T3 an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so critically i'm forced to accept that my one star rating could be seen as maybe a bit harsh, the action was OK after all, the film looked pretty enough and the story was genuinely not as slap-dash and floored as we all dreaded it would be. As a stand alone film i could've genuinely forgiven this movie it's quirky sense of humor and cartoonish action sequences (that comedy 'DUNK' noise when Arnie is hit by a truck whilst riding the forklift truck is pure Wylee Kyote). However, that's where we hit the real meat of my problem with this movie, it's not just any random piece of action pie, it's the sequel to terminator 2, a film which even if you don't consider to be the greatest action movie of all time (which i emphatically do), everyone must agree had a certain iconic, macho appeal and tone. Now i accept that for a fairly unknown director, resuscitating such a beloved and successful franchise after such a long time must've been daunting, and i thoroughly expected to sit back in my comfortable cinema seat and watch with joy as the third terminator strained with mighty, piston-like muscles in an effort to avoid being crushed under the weight of its prequels. So you can begin to imagine my disappointment when rather than standing up to its prequels with its chest puffed out, T3 seemed rather to make a camp hand gesture and prance away. In short, my greatest problem with T3 is not that it isn't as good as its predecessors (i mean what is?), it's that it often feels like you're watching a spoofed remake, an impression not harmed by the fact that T3 'shares' most of its basic plot structure with T2. Case in point would have to be the scene in which the terminator seeks to acquire his trade mark leather jacket ensemble, although in previous films this simply seems to be the first outfit he found, in T3 it seems nothing else would do. You can almost hear the writers laughing and congratulating themselves at their sparkling wit, as the terminator is forced to regurgitate his iconic "i need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle" line... to a male stripper. And the icing on the cake, when the 'unstoppable killing machine' walks outside and puts on the pair of pink, Elton john-style, star sunglasses: and the writers laugh, and the producers laugh and i die a little bit inside.However, the saddest thing i found, watching this movie was not the horrible, gimmick ridden plotting (ooo... lets make this evil terminator a girl!!!!!) that coated each scene, but the much broader plot-strokes that smashed into the terminator mythology like a certain hanging steel girder into a certain skull. Killing off Sarah Conner (the only woman ever created who could've kicked Lt. Ripley's ass) off screen no less, shifting the credit for saving mankind from John Conner (who's become a pussy instead of a super-soldier) to 'his wife?!?'. Its these massive blows that seem to have crippled a franchise that always seemed to have one last movie in it.However, i must freely admit that to most people this movie represents a small slice of action escapism that should warrant at least an hour and a half of you time if not your thoughts. But for me, and anyone else who bothered to learn to spell 'mimetic polyalloy' it's like watching a once proud bear being made to dance in a dirty tutu for the mild amusement of its owners.I always maintain that T2 was one of the saddest movies i've ever seen, at least in that way T3 managed to emulate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie's last stand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following James Cameron's original in this series, few could have projected Arnold Schwarzenegger's rise to Hollywood legend. The first film was a low-budget, B-grade (in theme and style only; the story was superb) sci-fi actioner. Arnie may have gone on to star in ill-advised yet somewhat bearable comedies, and the budget for "T2: Judgment Day" may have been among the biggest at the time, but at heart, Arnie was always a B-grade action movie actor. Films like "Raw Deal", "Total Recall", "Commando" and "Predator" reinforce his B-grade credentials. And as the final film in his career, "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is the fitting B-grade send-off for the most popular action star of the last twenty years.Fans will be familiar enough with the story; a cyborg is sent back through time from a post-apocalyptic future where man fights machines for his very existence. The cyborg's mission is to destroy, or terminate, the leader of the human resistance, a certain John Connor. Of course, the human resistance sends back its own defence for the protection of Connor, first as a human solider to protect John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in "The Terminator" (1984), then as a reprogrammed Terminator that bears an exact resemblance to the original cyborg, famously played by Schwarzenegger. Now, some 12 years after "T2", Arnie is sent back again, this time to protect a twenty-something John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) and a woman, Catherine Brewster (Claire Danes). After the failure of Arnie's T-800 in the original film, Robert Patrick's T-1000 in "T2", the machines decide on sending back a female cyborg, the T-X, played by newcomer Kristanna Loken. "Terminator 3" starts as each other film in the series, with the two cyborgs entering earth nude and seeking out appropriate clothing. Thereafter it's a hunt to find Connor and Brewster first, and many cars, buildings and people are destroyed in the process. A stunning action set-piece, and without question the action highlight of the film, involves a crane on a truck driven by the T-X disecting a row of shops, all the time with the T-800 hanging on for dear life. This is the part of the film where the action transcends its B-movie confines. Generally however, the film sticks to being B-grade. What makes it B-grade? It's the lack of grandiosity, the almost claustrophobic nature of the sets, the lack of a huge cast and the cheap(ish) special effects. This is not a James Cameron movie, and although director Jonathan Mostow tries hard, he lacks that grand canvas approach that has made Cameron's films so successful.While the story may be familiar, it takes a turn when we discover that Brewster's father is the man responsible for the managing of Skynet, the computer programme that subsequently launches attacks against man. This subplot is the best narrative transition from the first two films, which essentially were exactly the same. In fact, the subplot itself delivers a surprising and highly effective twist at the conclusion of the film. You can't help but think that this would have been the best way to end "T2", rather than the schmoltzy goodbyes between the Terminator and John Connor (then played by Edward Furlong).Furlong's absence from this film, while not perfect for continuity reasons, is not a major factor. Stahl plays Connor with immediacy and power and while he cannot always project the mood of a man with the world's future on his shoulders, he does work well with Schwarzenegger and Danes. She herself is really only working on autopilot, and although she shows occasional signs of depth, the role, or moreso the sci-fi nature of the plot seems to escape her. Loken is suitably wooden as the emotionless T-X, and lacks the weasel-like menace of Robert Patrick's T-1000. Her battles with Arnie are impressive however. And then there's Arnie himself. He's always been great at non-emotive, physical acting, and he once again performs well here. The Austrian accent seems thicker than ever, and although he moves a little slower, he still projects power and strength. His whole career was built on films that emphasised his physical presence, filling the screen with his muscles and big aura. But every action hero's career comes to an end. In a fitting epitaph to his career, the Terminator speaks of being an obsolete model, without any purpose. Just as well Arnie ended his career here, with a role and film that symbolised Arnold Schwarzenegger the actor perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent installment, worth the 12-year wait.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that James Cameron wasn't going to be involved with the third installment to this fantastic series, I was less than pleased. The thought of another director taking over the franchise kind of upset me, I just had to hope that they would find a director that could fill those rather large shoes. I later heard that Jonathan Mostow was named director of T3 and was pleased due to being VERY impressed with both of his previous directorial efforts, "Breakdown" and "U-571", but of course I was still skeptical.So the film was finally released and of course I went and saw it opening weekend. Let me tell you I was NOT let down! I thought the film was truly fantastic! I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me and I'm sure plenty might even get upset with me, but I thought "Terminator 3" was just as good as both previous installments of the series. They all had their pros and they all had their cons.I was at first a little uneasy with the idea of a female terminator. But, after seeing the film and thinking about I've come to the conclusion that having a female terminator if a brilliant idea. What would have an easier time infiltrating just about anything? A gorgeous and sexy woman or a large intimidating man? The woman, definitely! Besides, Jonathan Mostow did such a fantastic job with the T-X that it just worked perfectly.The special effects in the film are truly amazing, looking even better than the effects in T2. There were VERY few times where I thought it looked like obvious CG. There is one scene in the first few minutes of the film that show a slew of Terminators walking around doing what they do that nearly brought tears to my eyes, it looked so awesome! I won't get into the specifics, but the special effects are reason enough to see this film.The actors all did a fantastic job. I thought Nick Stahl was an excellent replacement for Edward Furlong. When I first heard Nick was taking over the role I didn't think he looked the part, but he really pulled it off. In fact, in the end, I'm happier that Nick took over the role rather than Edward Furlong continuing his role, because I really don't think Edward looks the part anymore, he was fine as the young John Connor, but I don't think he'd work well as the John Connor of this film. Claire Danes did a fantastic job as well, she pulled off a great job in the film and looks as beautiful as ever. Kristanna Loken plays the part of the T-X very well, looking sexy as can be and doing a great job with her facial expressions and her limited dialogue. I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for her future work. Then of course, there's the great Arnold Schwarzenegger, reprising his role as The Terminator (T-800/T-101). Arnold, again was excellent as the Terminator and didn't let me down. There is also a very nice cameo by Earl Boen, the only other actor to reprise a role from the first two installments in the Terminator series. Despite having very little screen time, he did a great job and I was very happy to see him in the film.Personally I thought the story in this film was great and very well thought out. There are a few things that may have been overlooked or improperly explained, but nonetheless, this is a movie we're talking about here and there are bound to be a few plot holes, so I didn't let those little things affect my enjoyment of the film.The only thing I would complain about if I had to, is some of the humor in the film. I won't deny that the jokes were funny, but I thought some were a little misplaced, this is, after all an R-rated sci-fi/action film. There were only really two or three comedic moments that I thought should have been excised from the film, but otherwise I thought everything worked pretty well.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that liked the previous Terminator films. I would hope that you can enjoy this for what it is and not what James Cameron MIGHT have done had he directed the film. Just because Cameron opted not to direct the film does not mean it's a bad film. Don't get hung up on the fact that Cameron didn't direct it, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Thanks for reading my review, and be sure to check out my reviews for both previous films: "The Terminator" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No match for its predecessors, but good nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In musical terms T-3 would be the 'difficult' third album, the one that perhaps didn't need to made, or was over-produced and over-hyped. Think 'Be Here Now' by British band Oasis, following in the footsteps of two hugely critically and commercially successful albums.The first two films in this franchise really set the bar high, the first a low budget cult classic, and the second an overblown but ultimately superb blockbuster action movie. But T-3 is a flawed project. First and foremost there was no James Cameron, meaning Mostow got the job instead. Coming from U-571, in which history is changed so that the Americans found the enigma machine instead. Not a good omen. With Cameron's films there is a focus and seriousness that is hugely appealing. 'The Terminator' is completely straight-edged and 'T-2' for all the one liners is serious when it needs to be. I don't get that with this film. From the moment the TX's chest expands it feels silly, at times a little gratuitous. What I liked about the original and it's sequel was how cold and efficient the Terminators were when it came to the killing. In 'T-3' the deaths are over the top and pointlessly visceral. Why would the TX choose to saw a victim to death rather than just shoot or stab them? Surely that would save valuable time and attract less attention? For me the TX is a real shame in this picture. A female Terminator could have chilling, more terrifying than Arnie or Robert Patrick. But for some reason it just doesn't work, she's just not cunning, or relentless enough. The T-1000 remains far more intimidating in my book. My other concern is with John Connor. Okay so Ed Furlong was a little annoying in 'T-2' but at least he had had some heart, a spark and an initiative. I could perceive him as a leader because he had some BALLS. Nick Stahl just doesn't have that. John Connor is too pathetic, too resigned to things to be the hero he'll turn into. I understand maybe Mostow felt he needed to explore Connor a little, but it doesn't work.It's not all bad though, in fact far from it. 'T-3' has much to commend it. As you'd expect the special effects are good, and the action is fast paced and good to watch. The chase scenes are not as good as in 'T-2' but hey, it's hard to climb Everest twice. In particular Claire Danes is great as Caroline Brewster. Her resourcefulness and spirit despite not having a clue what's going on are hugely refreshing when placed next Nick Stahl's Connor. And of course who can forget Arnie? The big man delivers enough solid display as a character it's hard not to like. Arnie also delivers maybe the best line in the series so far 'what I what is irrelevant, I am a machine!' which I think is a fantastic line.My favourite part of the movie though, is the end. No i'm not being sarcastic. The ending scene at Crystal Peak is inspired, a wonderful ending to the film. Wheras 'The Terminator' and 'T-2' needed happyish endings, 'T-3' needed the opposite. The notion that John Connor and Caroline Brewster were only meant to survive, not change the course of history is a far better concept than having them stop Skynet again. Obviously it's leading into a sequel, and it's a fine way to do it. The ending to me is the only time the whole film really captures the spirit of the original, in which survival was everything.'T-3' is a good film, but it's not a great film and as such will always suffer unfavourable comparisons. Viewed objectively at times it's very good, but it doesn't do the serious stuff as well as 'The Terminator' or the action as well as 'T-2'. As a film it's quite good, but as a sequel it ultimately doesn't stack up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Skynet sends back another Terminator, the T-X, in an attempt to kill as many Resistance officers as possible, the T-X coincidentally finds the leader-to-be John Conner. Conner and his future wife aided by reprogrammed Terminator must escape the TX if mankind is to survive the Rise of the machines, Judgment day.Great third Terminator movie! It may not have the brooding atmosphere of the first film but considering creator James Cameron didn't write or direct, it turns out very watchable.T3 is close to the original concept and a nicely thought out sequel. It does disregard the notion of the T2 about the future not being set and sticks close to the first, in that, the future is set and things have to run their course.Despite Arnold Schwarzenegger has aged, he's again excellent as the Terminator. Newcomer Kristanna Loken as the silent and deadly T-X is fantastic and the rest of cast are sufficient. The effects and action scenes are impressive but the original music score is forgettable and the original theme turns up late at the end.There maybe a touch too much humour in this instalment but the brooding brave ending finishes the film on a fitting serious note.This film is certainly worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews T3 is receiving. It was as good as the previous two Terminator films, which makes this franchise the only title out there that's great, quality entertainment without any interruptions of garbage in the middle (ala Alien 3). Of the many positive aspects about this film that all the critics out there ignore because they're too busy on the Miss James Cameron bandwagon, here's some: ***********SPOILERS************From the start we definitely missed Linda Hamilton's character from T2, as she was the best (though not only) asset from that film. But Nick Stahl did as good a job as her here in taking over as the human who was caught in the middle of a battle of titans. I had a bad feeling about this actor when I first saw that Edward Furlong wasn't coming back for T3, but my doubts were quickly put down when I saw how good an actor he was, playing an incredibly well-written character. Here we have a brooding, depressed John Connor who doesn't want the role of humanity's leader, feeling that way especially after his mother died and after having watched the only friend he had, the T800 from T2, leaving him at the end of the second film. He never thought that he was good enough to carry this huge responsibility, but he also suspected that he couldn't avoid it no matter how much he just wanted to disappear off the map, thus the nightmare of a chilling army of terminators who were seen approaching the screen as a dream to him after he dropped the bottle of beer into the lake whose ground was covered with skulls. But the fact that this guy was willing to put a gun to his own head to pressure the T800 to help them try to stop Skynet was proof that he was as good as his reputation said, as no one would be more qualified to lead the humans after the apocalypse as a person who showed that much heart and backbone at that scene.Following that, we have action and special effects that are incredible to watch, surprises ala the coffin full of weapons and the fact that it was Kate who sent the T800 back instead of John being the one who did so, as well as humor like the sunglasses at the beginning and the `talk to the hand' comment as the T800 was taking food out of the store, which made the entire theater laugh where I was.As a conclusion, we have a battle between machines, but not between the T800 and the TX, as expected, but between the T800 and the earliest terminator models that the TX reprogrammed, sending them out to massacre people. So we have the early terminators killing people and the only one who's fighting back against them is the T800, machine versus machine for the lives of the human survivors who were in the compound hanging in the balance. The T800 reached a level of humanity there that it never expected to have. And that was followed with it rebelling against the reprogram it then received from the TX to kill John and Kate, which made it into a much more sympathetic character than it ever was in T1 and T2. And this rebellion within the T800 was conceivable since the TX was used to ordering neutral machines to do its bidding (ie, cars). But the T800 already had an order to protect, thus the new orders to kill were coming into conflict with the previous ones, thus leading it to prefer to shut itself off rather than go against its original orders. Whether its interaction with John and Kate had any say in its decision is something that's debatable, of course, as it was fine with being reprogrammed to save Kate after its very first orders by Skynet were to kill humans. So in the future, it accepted its second orders to protect just fine, but not its third orders in the present time to return to killing. Begs the question as to why.And lastly, there's the ending, which I'll just summarize as being one that was a jaw-dropping surprise. I won't say what it is here in case there's anyone out there who's waiting to see this film on tape or DVD, but suffice it to say that you won't see it coming and it'll leave you on the edge of your seat. With John and Kate totally exhausted and realizing that they did all they could and all there is to do now is watch their efforts unfold while waiting for the future.So when all is said and done, I can say that James Cameron can return to doing Titanic 2 or another lousy show like Dark Angel if he wants, but if he doesn't wish to participate here, he's not needed as J. Mostow is doing just great. Anyone who wants to watch garbage can see Matrix Reloaded, a movie whose only premise is making as many marketing products from the once-great Matrix title as possible. But for those who demand quality for their money, it's clear what the best movie of this year is. My only question now is, where is T4?! It's time for John Connor to take charge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll say that for the most part this third film by Johnathan Mostow is pretty decent. He clearly made an effort to bring back the same atmosphere that was present in the first two films. This I very much enjoyed that aspect of it all. However, there is a somewhat diminished sense of realism in my opinion. This new terminator has flamethrowers and plasma cannons, built in of course. Oh geez... But I've come to embrace that actually. Except for that scene with KAte's 'fiance'. Didn't anyone notice a guy driving with an arm through his gut. Overdone...The cast is rather well put together, I'll give it that. Gool old Arnold is able to reprise his role as the T-101. Unfortunately this will be the final bout. John Connor is portrayed by Nick Stahil, and he does nicely. One other weakness to this film is the run time. The second film was over two hours, and there was plenty of action and what not. But there was still lots of time for character development throughout. We saw the characters' inner demons, you know? The story in "Rise of the Machines" certainly has nice plot points, but their not used to full their potential. Not only that Kate Brewster's father and Skynet. We only see an early scene "greeting" scene as a phone chat and short conversation about the system's dangers; and later the opening of "Pandora's Box". It was constantly hinted at that Skynet was already beginning its attack in subtle ways, so why not show a little more of the government tension? Getting away from that, the action is superb. Winston's studio does its job with artistic talent. I can say without a doubt the Terminators are looking better than ever. My favorite action scene by far had to be the hand-to-hand fight sequence. I find myself constantly rewinding it. Another plus is Marco Beltrami, one of my favorite composers. I'm definitely not let down. And so, Terminator 3 is an all in all decent contender, but it did not surpass either of the previous films."Desire is irrelevant. I AM a machine!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly don't get the hate for this movie, unless you're one of those types that goes to comicon and asks questions about insanely obscure trivia to flaunt your vast knowledge of the T universe or writes erotic terminator fan-fiction from your mom's basement. It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.</fullReview>

I have just one little note - too much humor. Why he had to put these stupid star-glaces?? Why saying "I'll Be Back" and "She'll be Back". Just a few moments that made me a little nervous. The pressure from the first and the second part wasn't so great here because of these comedy elements.

		<shortDescription>BEST TERMINATOR YET</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I got to see T3 last week, I was skeptical. At best, I expected a good summer popcorn cgi-laden sequel blockbuster-"been there-seen that" type of flick. Fun to watch, but that's about it.I was pleasantly surprised. Much better than that overrated horse opera SEABISCUIT, that's for sure.Arnold still has it. Even at age 55, he is still Terminator material. (Whether he's Governor material still remains to be seen, but he can't possibly be any worse than Gray Davis). Anyway, Arnold, as a Model-T 101 is sent back to the present era to do battle with the latest model, the TX, or Terminex,(Kristanna Loken). Far more advanced and deadlier than the previous cyborg assassains, Terminex has been programed not only to take out John Conner, but his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Daines)as well. What follows is the kind of mayhem not previously seen in TERMINATOR 1 or JUDGEMENT DAY. The two cyborgs manage to wipe out two city blocks with a giant tow truck, and later do battle in a men's washroom smashing each other with toilets and urinals (somehow, it's not as ludicrous as it sounds). The ending itself was very well done-or not so well done, depending upon your perspective-either way, it leaves room for the possibility of a TERMINATOR 4, that is, if Arnold loses the election. Stay tuned.Rating: *****out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninvolving And Dumb Franchise Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original TERMINATOR showed what can be done via a relatively small budget and a very tight script and even today remains one of the finest thought proving films in the sci-fi genre . TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGEMENT DAY showed one of the problems with Hollywood and that is milk an idea for all it's worth . I can understand why many people enjoyed the sequel - everything is bigger , bolder but not better since sequels usually jettison things like intelligence and characterization , things that made the original so involving . With TERMINATOR 3 RISE OF THE MACHINES we see a very good example of why intelligent , involving films should never become a franchise First off we see the set up which is absolutely no different from JUDEMENT DAY . A new super dooper terminator ( T-X ) is sent back to the past to kill future resistance leaders so the human race send Arnie back to stop it . Bad enough Arnie is introduced in a humorous way in the sequel but here it's done in an entirely camp manner , almost self parody . Not only that there's ridiculous plot holes involved such as why wait hours before the nuclear war before killing the resistance leaders or having an obsolete terminator protecting John Connor and co ? Perhaps the lack of internal continuity is worse where the T-X steals a gun to kill its victims when it's later revealed that the T-X has the capability to shoot people with a ray-gun . It's one of these films where you're left with the impression that the screenwriters are making things up as they go alongThis is Summer blockbuster entertainment which unfortunately comes across as being very old hat . There's car chases , explosions and stunts . However between the release of films two and three in the franchise blockbuster entertainment had changed . No longer had films to rely on star power , not that Arnie was much of a big name in 2003 , nor did they have to rely on explosions . HARRY POTTER and LORD OF THE RINGS had become the new event movies , Anglophile films with literary sources . Watching overlong , loud chase sequences filled with explosions and zero plot and character development might have worked in the 1980s and 90s but had obviously become extinct at the turn of the century . When you're watching set piece action sequences whilst glancing at your watch this can only be an unmitigated failure There is one set piece that does work and that is when Skynet comes online and the newly developed weapons systems start exterminating their human creators . Indeed watching this sequence I was instantly struck as to how well the film could have worked if this had been the central core of the film . Don't bother writing iT-X or Arnie in to the movie , get rid of chase sequence and make a much darker , smaller budget film that contains drama . But I guess that would have been beyond the intelligence of Hollywood studios</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very worthy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curious as it may sound, this is my favourite of the Terminator-series. It combines the relentless pace of the first film with the clever twists, emotional sensibilities and grand visuals of the second one, while it actually moves the story forward towards the unavoidable (?) end, unlike Terminator 2 (which I also like).Interestingly, Terminator 3 manages to be visceral and funny (oh, those sunglasses! - the humorous takes on the iconic moments from the first two films work especially well), light-hearted (almost family-friendly) and grimly pessimistic at the same time. So far, it is the only instalment in the series where there is no happy ending. Hope, yes, but humanity does fall here, nevertheless. You cannot escape your destiny.Kristanna Loken is wonderful in the role of the merciless terminatrix (kudos for the costume designers for her leather dress), as is Claire Danes as Kate Brewster, especially when she unleashes her anger. The all-wrecking car chase through the city didn't impress me much at the time, but has become one of my favourite action sequences since. All in all, highly rewatchable, great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines Mixes A lot Of Action With Some Comedic Scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie and was very surprised. I actually liked this movie, better than I thought. I picked this movie up at Hastings entertainment store, for 1.99. I am glad I got my money's worth, it's not the best of the series; but I am surprised by some of the negative comments. My favorite of the series is Terminator, it will always be. I rarely like sequels except for The Empire Strikes Back. I did have a WTF moment in T3 because it did start to get lame for about 15 minutes around the 20 minute mark. I thought I would be turning it off, but I was so wrong. The funny parts were the strip club, especially the dancer, and some of Arnold's quotes. I especially liked the fact they decided to make a female Terminator. In most movies Hollywood seems to portray females as damsels in distress. That is type casting and it is old and so wrong, that's why I hate Hollywood sometimes. They need a dose of reality sometimes. This is the third installment of the franchise and I thought it was good. Even though Nick Stahl played John Conner I thought he was great. I loved the storyline, and the ending was a surprise. If you liked T1 &amp; T2 you should like 3. It is a movie you will either like or hate, but regardless of what some say this is a great follow up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Termionator 3: Rise of the machines is part of the third part curse. Though it's not the weakest in the series. The Plot: Arnold Swartzenegger returns as a new Terminator model. He is sent back once a gain to protect John Conner, the future resistance leader, and Kate Brewster,who is John's future wife. The Terminator has a new villain. The T-X, who is stronger,and could easily defeat The Terminator. The plot isn't quite as complex as the first two films. Terminator 3: Rise of the machines is a good summer film. Though it came out six years ago, it was good for it's time. I love Claire Danes and was surprised when I found out that she was in it. Kristanna Loken (who's Michelle Rodriguez's lover)is a pretty good villain. I was rooting for her while watching the film, though I knew she was going to lose. But both Arnold and her blew up. I am giving Terminator 3: Rise of the machines a recommendation. The problem I have with it is that I don't like Nick Stahl as John Conner. I Don't think this film is as well thought out as the others. Though it's more thought out than Terminator: Salvation, which I gave the same rating. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is occasionally funny and entertaining. It may not be as good as the original or T2(which is the best and one of the best ever), but Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After being completely disappointed by the horrendous extended A-Team episode known as T2, (Maybe the biggest drop of in quality from original to sequel ever) I was prepared to really hate T3. Maybe the lower expectations played a role, but the movie surprised me. It doesn't live up to the original of course, but it far surpasses T2. The action is tremendous, the fight scenes between the Terminators are much better than in T2, and the chase scene outdoes The Matrix Reloaded in my opinion. Throw in a great ending and I'm actually hoping we won't have to wait ten years for the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I spoke to a friend before seeing this movie, and he said he did not like it. But, trusting the 7.2 vote it recieved from IMDB, we chanced it--and thank God we did. This has got to be the best action movie I've seen in years. We loved it. Some other friends said that there was a more humorous side to it, so I went into the movie expecting a hammed up version of its predessosor; however, the "comedic" scenes just added to the entertainment of the movie, they did not detract from it's seriousness that the end of the earth as we know is near. The ending was fantastic and added more intrigue to the idea that machines will rule the earth and fight mankind for its rule. Moreover, the ending left you with a feeling similar to reading The Stand, or War of the Worlds. A great movie that's worth full price. Bravo! Arnold. I'm looking forward to T4!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Good To Be Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mostow has injected a lot of the same spirit from previous Terminator films into Terminator 3, cleverly causing you to undergo a bit of what weightlifters call `muscle memory.' Although wildly entertaining and pleasantly reminiscent of past films, Terminator 3 as a whole did not resonate like the first two films. That's not to say it didn't achieve greatness, just not the type of greatness Cameron achieved in the good old days. The key change from Cameron to Mostow proved too dissonant for some fans. Cameronistas resent Mostow's style as action over substance. Reading their remarks on the movie forums would have one believe the film represents more of a lowering of humans than rising of machines. T3 is not T2. Mostow is not Cameron. Let James Cameron be James Cameron, or at least Jim Cameron, and let everyone else be themselves.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had to hold its ground and simply not be bad. It held. It did more than that. It succeeded. Humor, action, and preservation of the Terminator motifs gave the film life. The word `terminated' will continue to live as a great movie euphemism. Whether or not the Terminator series will rise again, only time will tell.--Emory Rowland</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime action masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the T3 that Cameron would have made, of course, that goes without saying. But Johnathan Mostow has directed an action masterpiece. Although I'd challenge any director to make an unwatchable movie given a 170 million dollar budget, this film is a truly superior example of the genre and easily the best of this year's blockbusters.For anyone worrying that it's just a brainless action effects flick like so many others, it's just not the case. The story has a true and palpable contribution to the Terminator ethos, one you will only really understand at the very end. Despite what anyone thinks, action films do need comic relief, and the humour in T3 is used just at the right moments and never goes too far into being inappropriate or self parody. There's really no more here than was in T2.The writing was very good, and much time was given over to the character development between Kate and John. This was necessary however, considering what they will have to go through later. The acting in all areas was good, including Loken, although sadly for her she never really got any memorable lines like Robert Patrick in T2. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes showed that there are young actors who can actually put in good performances in demanding roles, rather than just reading lines like the two young leads in Episode II. Arnie was back to his all time best, delivering his lines with aplomb and putting in a physical performance that completely belied his 55 years. He looked simply amazing stepping back into the role he first made his own nearly 20 years ago, barely changed in fact, apart from a tan, from how he looked in T2.Now let's get down to what the movie was really about, the ACTION. T3 has it it bundles, and it's executed flawlessly. A collossal car chase through the streets of LA causing all kinds of mayhem and with a brilliant finale, and an epic fight scene which puts all others to shame with its sheer power and intensity. T3 truly has the best action sequences ever put on film, it's that simple. Integral to this action of course were the special and visual effects. T3 never attemped to have ground breaking effects, the point was to use them without overusing them and to do it superlatively. And that's precisely what ILM and Stan Winston Studios have accomplished - no computer game like graphics or obvious CG doubles here, just pure quality. And that really helps selling a story like this one.The music was good, although I still have mixed feelings about Marco Beltrami. This is probably his best score yet, but it certainly would have been interesting to see what Brad Fiedel would have come up with for T3.Bottom line, this was a film that even Cameron could be proud of and it's no surprise he gave it his stamp of approval. The story fits into the existing one as well as adding it's own dimension, and all in all it's a more than worthy entry into the saga.And that was as much as this or any Terminator fan could hope for.</fullReview>

Also I'll take Terminator 3 over Terminator Salvation any day. Here's why. The plot in some ways feels like a "What if" Storyline as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is send back through time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) from T-X (Kristanna Loken).The film features some extreme action stunts that have you on the edge and it goes to show that the film did a lot to make it feel like Terminator and the fights were pretty intense for this one.The score in the film is pretty strong where the music helps the story of the film.There is a good bit of humor in this film but it don't take away from what the film from what it suppose to be. The special effects are pretty impressive with attention to make them look believable. Yes I know this movie gets a bad rap but if you're a fan of Terminator you should at least give it a shot and it is must better than Terminator SalvationI give Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How not surprising I have just discovered the division among fans about this movie while browsing the reviews. I feel the duty to give an opinion in lights of recent viewings : 1) the latest installment in movie theatre 2) the TV series I didn't know, which seems to me quite interesting in some aspects. Agree with most of you : a superfluous sequel, much resemblances in terms of structure with T2. Don't agree : the comedic elements are what makes the difference, they are not lame. Some of you say it's unwanted parody, that I just don't know, I believe it might be intentional : the appearance in the Chippendale spot, the inflatable TX breast, the dialogs ; my favorite is certainly this one T 800 : your confusion is not rational, she's a healthy female of breeding age. John Connor: well, you know, there's more to it than this. T 800: My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bondings. Arnold Schwarzenegger has always been considered, in my opinion, capable of "self mockery" way before other actors of his kind (Chuck Norris was forced to develop this when his agents made him aware of his commercial impact on fans, I believe), he shows a bit of his self parodic humor potential when quoting himself from Commando (I lied). So, according to these few elements, plus the beauty of Claire Danes, much cuter in red I believe, and Kristanna Loken, I pronounce this film not so bad and worthy of redemption in the eyes of purist fans. The last one, Genisys, was acclaimed in France by most papers (most of them having lost their Independence and only paid to encourage disposable culture consumption), they say it is able to make us forget T3? oh God, we must not have seen the same film. Genisys is full of inconsistencies (the saga is itself a bit hard to follow for the rational mind), complexities, senilities, devoid of fun and drama effects, and there is not a single sound from the Brad Fiedel theme. In my memory, back in 1991 on the big screen, the score was a major source of pleasure and dramatic credibility in T2 ; Bear Mc Creary redeveloped this music for the TV series, which is pretty successful to me, though inessential as well. Inessential also would be for me to review what I think of each films of the saga, the thing is I have not been able to feel the slightest ounce of pleasure since T3, and some of the series episodes. T3 is to be rediscovered in spite of its inferiority to the films of the conceptor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken star in this 2003 sci-fi sequel. In this sequel, John Connor (Stahl) is older and living his life on the road secretly. He's about to meet another T-101 cyborg (Schwarzenegger) sent to protect him from a lethal female prototype assassin called, a T-X (Lokken). John reunites with an old girlfriend, Kate Brewster (Danes) who gets into the action because she's John's future wife and daughter of an Air Force General. This isn't a bad sequel, but it's not as good as the first 2 films and I missed Linda Hamilton. I still recommend this for your Terminator collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Drop-Off Was Inevitable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the Terminator movies, 1 and 2 were superb! Unfortunately, T3 suffers from the "Hollywood blockbuster" syndrome, the need to out perform and surpass its predecessors with bigger, bolder, more blast-worthy action. Chases and nitroglycerine abound in this film as characterization is pushed to the background.To be fair, very little characterization is needed except for the Claire Danes character. Unless you've been living in an isolated commune for the past 20 years, you know the Terminator. Arnold's persona has become pop culture myth -- like the Six Million Dollar Man writ large. Stahl's character, John Connor, is still the ordinary man tormented by his awesome destiny.T3 does deliver the stunts, the explosions, even the catchy one-liners to which we've become accustomed. Arnold's performance is stellar. His charm breathes humanity into an automaton (Gov. Schwarzenegger one day perhaps?). Stahl is competent, while Danes is immeasurably underused. Note her role as Juliet in Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet -- but hey, this isn't Henry James. Kristanna Loken is good as well, sexily exuding VERY homicidal tendencies.I agree with Roger Ebert in saying that T3 is really a dumbed down version of its history. Were it not for the creative ending, I probably wouldn't have been as impressed. That said, T3 is a worthy addition to the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third film in the Terminator franchise sees Arnold Schwarzenegger return as a T-850 sent back to ensure John Connor and his future wife Kate Brewster survive the impending Judgment Day whilst a rival Terminator, the T-X, hunts down and kills people important to the future human resistance.Jonathan Mostow steps into James Cameron's big directing boots and produces an enjoyable follow up to the previous instalments but also provides nothing outstanding either. The action scenes are directed competently but you really do feel as if some flair is missing that Cameron would've brought to the film, although the stand-out chase sequence involving a crane truck, two police cars, a fire engine and an ambulance features scenes of automobile destruction rivalled only by The Blues Brothers.Nick Stahl does a good job of portraying a John Connor haunted by his impending legacy and struggling to come to terms with his destiny without the guidance of his now deceased mother (Sarah Connor having died of leukemia off screen between T2 &amp; T3) but you can't help thinking that the film would've benefited hugely from the involvement of Edward Furlong who was originally lined up to return in the role but pulled out and/or let go by the producers as a result of his then current substance problems. Claire Danes does well with an under written role of Connor's future wife and Kristina Loken does a great Robert Patrick impression as the T-X, the latest in Terminator assassins from the future.Essentially a remake of T2, what gives this film extra points is the unexpected twist ending (which I'll discuss without spoiler boxes as the film is 6 years old so if you haven't seen the film, look away now!) It's very rare these days in cinema that a summer blockbuster ends on a downbeat note but the makers of T3 deserve kudos for ending the film with the destruction of 3 billion human lives in the nuclear apocalypse and actually bringing about the event that even Cameron avoided, Judgment Day. The ending alone makes up for the slight feeling throughout the film that you've seen it all before. This film could've so easily been a standard run around with an obligatory happy ending but in bringing the franchise full circle, they take the films away from the now tired concept of Terminators being sent back to present day and give the franchise the opportunity to move the story forward instead of it remaining stagnant. It's just a shame that they didn't build on that promise with the fourth film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been too long. But Arnold seems have only aged in his face. He still is The Terminator all the way! I enjoyed this film and greatly appreciated its ending. That's all i'm sayin'. See if you like Arnold Schwarzenagger as the Terminator alone; if you will.BUT see it for the hot new terminator, as well. She did very well. Some say her performance was too mechanical. Um... hello??? 'Nuff said there, i think. She's very beautiful and cold looking at the same time. Though she's a lot smaller than Arnold; she appears as a formidable foe to the "obsolete" T101 model. Let's just say The Terminator had his hands full with this pint-sized beauty AND beast - The TX (Terminatrix).The actor playing John Connor delivered a very believable performance and didn't seem nervous next to the great Arnold; and yet he wasn't trying to over-act to compensate, either. The two worked well together if maybe slightly less a father-and-son combo as the John Connor in T2. Still, very well done!The 'other' girl in the flick was good, too. I know i know her from somewhere, but she did just fine for the character she was and again didn't try to over-do it, at all. You do feel sympathy for her and times and yet see why she becomes what she becomes in a post-judgment day world.All in all, i gave it 8 out of 10. For such a long wait; maybe i wanted too much. But it was a very good film and i like the chill in the end.thank you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw T3 tonight and I think the one line summary is about all that needs to be said about it: T1 &amp; T2 on steroids. This movie will live in the trilogy. It follows the story line enough that the true Terminator fans can make the easy predictions as far as what's going to happen or be said next, but Ms Loken does exactly what the character is supposed to do: keep coming until the job is finished.Arnold, on the other hand, once again, plays the good guy in this film. And although I could not see him as a bad guy like he was in the first Terminator, he was a good guy who could make it believable! Nick Stahl is an unknown to me. I have never seen him perform before, to my knowledge, but his character portrayal is not bad! The whole film plot is enough to make someone think, though, about two things: 1) The events that lead to the eventual destruction of mankind, &amp; 2) the fact that someone's destiny can be changed, but weather the timeline can follow pretty much the same path or not.Sci fi strikes again in the summer of 2003.

		<shortDescription>The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the "Reluctant Hero" theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!</fullReview>

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is an amazing visual spectacle as well as a story driven film. Mostow stages some amazing combat sequences, and Arnold is on top of his game in the role that made him famous. The script is well written, with classic Schwarzenegger one lines, and the repetition of the line "She'll be back" actually works. The movie is peppered with humor and smart dialogue. The story actually makes sense in the timeline, although taking some liberties. Instead of a vote of 10 the reason this film gets a 9 by me is that the action sometimes seems to take center stage, although it drives the story along. One scene comes to mind when the T-850 drives a truck through a wall, suddenly fuel barrels explode. The Terminatrix is an imposing villain, definitely a great screen character. Kristanna Loken's icy blue eyes truly make the T-X a menacing villain that you grow to hate. Nick Stahl plays John Connor as he should be; a boy who knows what he's destined to do but questions why he was chosen, and resents it every minute of his life. Overall the action and script are great, the direction is excellent, and Arnold breaks the slump of bad movies. Definitely a worthy sequel to a great franchise, unlike the disappointing Matrix Reloaded. No T4!!!(You'll understand when you see the movie, especially the ending)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll try not to sound like a Warner Brothers Exec. with my comments on this movie, but it's going to be difficult I'm afraid.Let me just get it out of my system: T3 - Rise of the machines is one of the best (if not the best) Action/sci-fi movies I have ever seen!!! Now there I said it...It's hard though, to judge a movie these days as you become older and older cause the first time impressions will never become the same as when you saw like The Terminator as a 10 year old boy back in 1984. Still from time to time a movie comes along that simply grabs you by the ba...(well they are fragile) within 10 minutes and don't let go till you've tormented your wallet with half a dusin repeat viewings, which will be the case for me with this movie, once it's officially released. The last time I experienced this was in ´98 when The Matrix was out (something that sadly wasn't repeated with "Reloaded").Terminator 3 is simply AMAZING IMO. It is fast paced, in your face high definition action wrapped around a tight storyline with some very fulfilling revelations, but as an action piece, this baby comes close to being orgasmic!Now though I may sound like it, I'm no Arnold/Terminator fanboy, but I AM an actionjunkie, a true sucker for clever action epics.This movie took me by total surprise and that may be the explanation as to why I seem so positive. I really didn't expect much from this movie judging by the trailers. Not even the last trailer was particular good IMO, but let me tell you this is one of the rare times when a trailer truly didn't reveal anything from the movie. T3 is SOO MUCH bigger than what the trailer makes it appear.I loved T2, it's one of my fav sci-fi movies, but T3 is just better! At NO point does this movie drag and though it does rehash most of the scenes from T2 it makes sure to nudge these scenes up like 50-100%, but at the same time it introduces a lot of new and fresh jaw-droppers. This movie will leave scars on the furniture of the theaters from all the nails that will dig into the seats.To you skeptics out there, and I now there are plenty, FORGET YOUR WORRIES and go see this thing, cause NO ONE can claim to NOT be entertained by T3.Isn't there anything negative? Well there was a corny cameo from T2 that I didn't like and I was certain I would hear the famous Brad Fiedel theme playing to the credits which it didn't (we got some remixed version in the end though). Other than that it was a perfect movie!5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given all of the negative publicity that this film has received, I wasvery shaky on what to expect walking into the theater. I've beendefending T3 for months now in arguments with annoying Matrix fanboysand others who refused to believe it possible that Arnold had anothergood film in him... but deep inside of me there was that lingeringdoubt... could T3, without Jim Cameron's direction, without BradFiedel's score, and without Linda Hamilton or Edward Furlong... be agood film? The answer for me and those in attendance (includingnumerous T3 bashers) was a resounding YES!!!I got my hopes WAY up for this movie, and I think for the first timesince I saw True Lies in 1994 (with high expectations) a movie actuallydelivered on its promise. This is not just a mindless action film. This is not "heartless" (as I've heard some critics say). This is oneof the most suspenseful, emotional, gargantuan action setpieces in thehistory of cinema. That may sound ridiculous, but it's the truth. Ifyou walk out of the theater disappointed with this film, I'll tellya... I can't think of much that would entertain you. I think thatsomeone would have to be dead to not enjoy this movie.That having been said, I don't know where I would place this film(rank-wise) in the terminator series. Suffice it to say that on ascale of four stars, I would give each film five. Thank you JonathanMostow... thank you Arnold... it has been far too long since an actionmovie of this caliber has been released. Please, if T4 is in theworks, don't wait another 12 years, OK?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on the first day it came out! It was awesome, entertaining, I understood the storyline(Why the T-X was killing off people in the beginning, etc.), and I thought it was very Interesting, the action scenes were better than Terminator 2: Judgment Day's. The only faults in this movie is that it wasn't directed by James Cameron and that James Cameron didn't write it. The Visual Effects were superb although some of them did look a little fake, but so did Terminator 2's T-1000, it looked fake, so I'm not going to gripe about the Visual Effects. I feel the visual effects are needed to fabricate scenes that are too hard for the actors to do and is also needed to make a great film(take The Lord of the Rings films for instance) but, there are instances when Directors go a little to far with the Visual Effects in their films. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a great film, great acting (still by Ol' Arnold Schwarzeneggar, of course), great action scenes, and great storyline. When watching this film I got a sense of deja vu because if anybody has seen The Animatrix it sort of talks about Nuclear War also(just my opinion). Does anyone agree? Well the rating on the IMDB website for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines should go up because I think it deserves a better rating than a 7.3/10, may be a 7.8/10, at least. Well those are my thoughts and Feelings about this film, thank You for reading. Oh, by the way, I gave this film a 10/10 on the IMDB website's rating system, I think you should too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was quite a relief. The first movie was groundbreaking in its raw exploration of man vs. thinking machine, but there really wasn't much breadth to it - it centered around that concept alone. The second movie was painful to watch, and I was afraid the third movie might go further down the road of dumb catch phrases and uninteresting sci-fi but instead, it was very well done. As has already been mentioned, the action and effects are heart-pounding, and the visuals are dazzling, but the movie also raised questions about predestination and explored the means by which the robots were to eventually take over the world. This provides substance for the movie and gives meaning to all of the action and excitement. Add to that some well-placed humor and this movie is sure to satisfy Terminator fans everywhere!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main problem I have with the films in the Terminator franchise is that they couldn't possibly happen given the time travel element involved. In this picture, Arnold's T-101 tells John Connor (Nick Stahl) that he'll see him again one day even as he's being destroyed by the T-X. OK, how? See what I mean.But I love the terminology. The T-X (Kristanna Loken) can control other machines, driven by a plasma reactor and carrying on board weapons with nanotechnological transistors designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms like the T-101. So it's an anti-Terminator, Terminator. How can you not love that analysis? I also got a bit of a kick out of Connor's use of a little Captain Kirk type logic when he reminded the T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenneger) of his mission to protect Kate (Claire Danes) and himself, after being corrupted by the T-X. That was kind of a weak argument to be using given the premise of the T-X in the first place, but I guess the film makers needed a little wiggle room for the story to pan out.So like the Terminator flicks that went before, this one appeals to me the most at the action and special effects level. The best was the T-X doing the complete 180 with her body, almost erotic in the execution if I must say. I know the T-X was supposed to be a potent killing machine, but it probably wouldn't have hurt if after one of her rampages she might have cracked a polymimetic smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that many people hate T3 i'm just not one of those people Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Rocks. And Arnold is Back the new villain is really cool and she is a Woman. If there is something that i didn't like about this sequel is the way the director worked the humor it just didn't work at times but in others did. Also Connor's and Brewster's characters are weak but as the film goes on they find the strength they need to stop Judgment Day. Also the film has a great cameo by Dr. Silberman and an amazing ending that we didn't expect to see. T3: Rise of the Machines is an amazing action packed film and it deserves more respect for what it tried to acomplish and it was great to see Arnold returning on the role for one last time before Genisys. Even if it has those 3 problems i think Terminator 3 is still a great movie and it deserves a 10/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocked By How Much I Liked This Twelve Years Later!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being very disappointed when this movie came out. The first two Terminator movies have always been some of my favorite movies, or at least they were when I was more of a youth. Indeed, for many years I would have said that "T2: Judgment Day" was my favorite film.I guess I've grown up a fair bit since then, because I've been watching the series this past week, and while I still have a great love for T1, T2 failed to impress me the way I imagined it would after not having seen it for several years. And then tonight I got around to "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines". I prepared myself to be let down. This is, after all, the worst of the series (I still haven't seen Salvation or Genesis). So I settled in waiting to be unimpressed.To my great surprise, twelve years after having first watched this film in the theater, I found this movie to be a lot better than anything I expected to find. Indeed, I'm rating it higher than I rated T2 (7 stars--after having given T1 a perfect 10).So why did this movie work for me on a second viewing? Perhaps it was because when I saw it the first time my expectations were very high whereas today they were very low. Or perhaps my relative displeasure with how T2 has held up for me made T3 a better movie. What I do know is that this film nailed its action sequences quite well--the long scene with the crane truck is pretty awesome if you ask me. And the female Terminator (whatever model number she is) was neater this time around. Clare Danes does a great job as supporting actress in this movie, and whereas I was expecting the plot and script to be weak overall, I actually felt that it arguably did a better job of advancing the story of the franchise than T2 did.All that said, I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. It greatly exceeded my expectations for a lazy day Blu Ray movie. Definitely worth giving another shot if you haven't seen it since it came out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the years 1984 and 1991, two films came out that would forever change how we see films and how we see action films as a whole. These two films were both directed and written by James Cameron, and both featured Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. These two films were of course, The Terminator and T2: Judgment Day. After these two films, the studios had expressed interest in making a third film, however Cameron was not to be a part of it. Schwarzenegger wasn't going to be in it either until he was persuaded by Cameron himself. The film was released on July 2nd and received mixed-to-positive reviews, making about 2 1/4 times it's budget back at the box office. The general consensus? Not as good as the first two, yet somewhat enjoyable. I'm here today to crack the case on an age old question: Are the third and fourth Terminator movies worth counting among the greats? Rise of the Machines follows John Connor nine years after the events of Judgment Day as he has become a drifter, due to not wanting to be apart of the Skynet databases. After he breaks into a vet hospital to get drugs he needs, a new brand of Terminator known as the T-X comes back in time to kill not only him, but all of his lieutenants in the future. Just as all seems lost, the T-850 appears too to protect John Connor. Now, with the police and the T-X on their tail, John, the T-850 and John's future wife must set out to stop Skynet before Judgment Day truly occurs.This film is a bit of a mixed bag for me. Some elements don't work and others, surprisingly, do. The acting is pretty good, to be honest. Schwarzenegger, of course, kicks ass so we don't need to question his acting prowess. Nick Stahl as John Connor, I was pleasantly surprised by. At first, it took me a while to get into his character, but as the film went on, he grew on me. He's a pretty good actor, I don't think I've seen him in anything else actually. Claire Danes does a great job as Kate Brewster, John's future wife. Kristanna Loken is the one person I'm iffy about in this cast. She played the T-X, and she did an okay job, but not as good as Schwarzenegger does as a Terminator. David Andrews does a good job as well in his limited role as Brewster's dad, the Lieutenant General of the USAF and also one of the people responsible for SkyNet.The action sequences and special effects remain as good as ever. Arnie still manages to kick some serious ass in this film, just as he did in the previous films. Even though some of the action sequences are a bit ridiculous and long (the scene after the vet attack, for example), they still manage to entertain. The music in the film, composed by Marco Beltrami, is serviceable. It's not exactly memorable like the first two films, it's more of just background noise.Although the plot has it's inconsistencies, I did enjoy the scriptwriting for the most part. A lot of the conversations, like a few with the T-850, John and Kate in the RV are enthralling and sort-of entertaining. The cinematography was great in this film. Some of the shots of John during the opening especially, my favorite one being the shot of him by the fire, looked really well done.Here comes my issues with the film. The film basically ruins what Judgment Day had going for it. While I can accept that, the reason why I enjoyed the ending to Judgment Day so much was because we have no idea where the future is going to go. We don't know if they stopped Judgment Day or if they only furthered it along. In this film, we get a sloppy answer, in my opinion. Another problem I had was a few plot holes. For one thing, how did SkyNet get built if most of the work was destroyed in Judgment Day? And how does all of this even affect the timeline from the first two films? I would ask more questions, but I probably shouldn't. Time travel hurts my head.Overall, although I dislike the film's concrete answers to the end of Judgment Day, and some of the plot holes, the film overall is an entertaining ride. Don't expect to be intellectually challenged, or to be extremely involved in everything that's going on. The action, effects, script and acting all are great, still, and although the film is paving the way for a different kind of Terminator film coming up, it seems like this series's third and fourth installments may not be as bad as some say. We'll find out soon enough.7/10. | Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part III(now directed by Jonathan Mostow) picks up the story of an adult John Connor(now played by Nick Stahl, who is fine, taking over from Edward Furlong) effectively living off the grid, who nonetheless finds himself pursued again by a new cyborg assassin from the future(a beautiful woman this time, nicely played by Kristanna Loken) who stumbles onto John by accident, since she was sent back to his time to assassinate all other resistance members who had nearly wiped out the machines. Once again though a familiar face(Arnold of course!) is sent back one last time to protect him(or is he?) Fantastic action punctuates this intriguing story about inevitable fate that cannot be shaped the way the Connors had hoped(Sarah is absent here...) but that one can certainly be prepared for. While not as fresh as the first two, this still works, with an appropriate and logical ending.Should have ended the story here though...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really have no complaints about this movie. I had been wanting to see it for quite awhile and finally rented it on CD. I liked it at least as well as the others. Probably more. I've been in the mood for action lately. Action starved. Too many Beaches movies. And, this movie has action. In fact, I remember several times thinking that I couldn't look away even for a moment afraid of what I would miss. That's the definition of action in my book.Unlike a lot of action movies, it wasn't just mindless mayhem. Each individual scene had a point --- in addition to the mindless mayhem. I even liked the plot quite a bit. Logical. And, I love movies that mess with the time line as long as it makes sense.The other nice thing about T-3 is that it set us up for T-4, T-5, etc. I don't know exactly how Arnold is going to do it since by the time he gets out of politics, he won't look anywhere near as chiseled and it will be hard to believe he is the best the robots have to offer. I would still like to see him have a role, but since robots don't age, it might be tough.All in all, excellent mayhem of the first-rate mindless variety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw T3 at a screening. Very enjoyable, likely the best of the lot. Strong performances from Claire Danes and Nick Stahl helped humanize the over-the-top scenario. The only problem with the series' development is that the cyborgs keep becoming more omnipotent so that it strains credulity that they couldn't easily destroy a couple of mere out-of-shape mortals who can do little more than run or drive away. Still great stunt work, especially in the first part of the film. In fact, the first half uses up most of the adrenaline of the movie, which deflates the climax a bit. Should win awards for sound effects editing: tremendous! See it at a theatre with good sound system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 12 long years, the Terminator is back. Between 1991 and 2003 there were many rumours surrounding a possible Terminator 3 with James Cameron at the helm and the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, with many ideas going flat as well as possible adversaries to beat the T-1000 (one magazine in 1995 suggested Shaquille O'Neal was going to be the next Terminator to go up against Arnold) however nothing eventuated, particularly with Carolco Pictures going bankrupt in 1996. A lot of Terminator fans were eagerly looking forward to see a new Terminator sequel. Terminator fans had their prayers answered when Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was released in 2003. I thought Terminator 3 was a good movie and a worthy sequel, but overall was not great. To be fair, it was certainly going to be a hard act to follow. Given that Terminator 2: Judgement Day was a huge blockbuster that set the benchmark for all movies, Terminator 3 had a lot to live up to.Following the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, we learn that Judgement Day did not eventuate on August 29 1997 however John Connor (Nick Stahl who has taken over from Edward Furlong) has since disappeared of the grid. His mother Sarah Connor has since passed away from leukaemia, John does small jobs from time to time and lives as a drifter around Los Angeles. John still lives in fear that Skynet may track him down and kill him. Unable to find John Connor, Skynet sends back the T-X (Kristanna Loken), an female Terminator with an advanced prototype succeeding its predecessors with built-in weaponry within its endoskeleton, a liquid metal exterior similar to the T-1000, and the ability to re-program other machines. The T-X is sent back to terminate John Connor's future lieutenants and other members of the human resistance. Another objective of the T-X is to terminate John Connor's future wife and second in command Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes). To protect and ensure the survival of John Connor, a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back by the human resistance to prevent the T-X from successfully completing her mission. At the same time, Katherine Brewster's father who is a high ranking US Air Force Officer General Robert Brewster (David Andrews) has taken over from Miles Dyson's work from Cyberdyne Systems is linking up the US Military computers to a program called Skynet to run the entire US Military system. The Terminator, John Connor and Katherine Brewster must race against time to prevent the T-X from successfully completing its mission, and to prevent the nuclear war.Jonathon Mostow (U-571, Breakdown) takes over from James Cameron who declined to take the director's chair. Though Jonathon Mostow does a good job and he remains faithful to the previous Terminator movies, he still does not have the same magic touch as James Cameron. It was good to see various references to previous Terminator movies, but in terms of action it was certainly not going to outdo the previous Terminator movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day certainly expanded on the first Terminator movie, whereas in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines it continues on the legacy by bringing forth new ideas.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in his iconic role as the Terminator. Though Arnold Schwarzenegger was 54 years old at the time of filming, he still has the Midas touch, one-liners and all. It was a thrill to see Arnold Schwarzenegger return as the Terminator. It was also the last starring role for Arnold Schwarzenegger before being elected as the Governor of California.Nick Stahl was uninspiring as John Connor came across as a bit wimpy and was came across as a geek compared to Edward Furlong who had a lot more guts with his character and possessed a strong personality as John Connor, somebody with backbone who had the potential to be a future leader of the human resistance. Unfortunately Edward Furlong was missed as John Connor, however was dropped from his famous role due to substance abuse problems.Kristanna Loken as the T-X did not have the same intimidation factor as the first Terminator and the T-1000, but she was just met the standard as a worthy adversary in this movie. She barely has any speaking parts as well.Claire Danes as Katherine Brewster came across as very mature and was someone that stood up and fought back rather than come across as a helpless damsel in distress. She moves on from her past roles such as Romeo and Juliet (1996) to portray John Connor's future wife and a strong willed second in command.Earl Boen reprises his role in a brief cameo as Dr Peter Silberman from the previous Terminator movies. Though it was only one scene, it was great to see the famous Dr Silberman return in one scene.As previously mentioned some of the action scenes in the movie were not as memorable compared to the previous Terminator movies. The crane pursuit through downtown Los Angeles wasn't bad but didn't exactly outdo the action scenes in the previous Terminator movies which were a classic and kept audiences excited. The climax where the machines take over the Air Force base was the most exciting part of the movie.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was always going to be a hard act to follow compared to its predecessors but it is certainly a worthy entry into the Terminator series. I was also glad that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines didn't have the violence watered down, although it was noticeably less violent. Though Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was not a memorable classic compared to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, it left me satisfied well enough that it was good to see the Terminator blast onto our screens once again.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Four (so far)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the four Terminator movies this is my favorite. I like Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines because it actually tells the story of how the machines takes over. I get that the first two movies are an important part of the story but to me they were a shadowy prelude to this movie.The graphics are just as good, if not better, as the graphics in the second movie. And a hundred times better than the first movie. The premise of this movie is very well thought out, especially when the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) explains that the apocalypse was only delayed not averted. The Terminator says that the apocalypse is inevitable.According to Internet Movie Database movie fans that have rated this movie has rated in on average 6.4 stars. I however, have to give this 9 stars out of 10. I gave it 9 stars because the evil Terminator was a woman this time, and she was hot. Also, there were many great scenes, even the one where the good Terminator has to get clothes. Yes, I know Arnold is naked in this scene and I shouldn't be talking about this, but it is funny that he goes into a local strip club... on ladies night. The Terminator scanning for appropriate clothing is hilarious. However, I did like the evil Terminator looking for clothes more to my liking.The three best scenes are as follows, at least in my opinion.The first scene I liked was the scene in which the evil Terminator (Kristanna Loken) tracks down John Connor's lieutenants, before they become his lieutenants. I don't like that she is killing these people. What I like is that she is so methodical and cold. The best part is when she comes to the animal clinic looking for Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), but finds John Connor (Nick Stahl).The next best scene takes place just after the first favorite. It's the chase scene where John is driving the animal clinic's truck with Kate in the back. The evil Terminator is driving a Terex-Demag AC 160, better known as a crane truck. The good Terminator is driving a motorcycle. The good Terminator is knocked off the motorcycle but ends up hanging from the end of the crane. However, he ends up getting knocked off the crane by a fire engine. The sequence of this scene is nothing short of remarkable.The third and final best scene is when the two Terminators are fighting at the airforce base Kate's father, General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), is commanding and in charge of Skynet. The fight scene is fairly awesome and a little drawn out. There is a breakaway scene that shows Kate and John escaping, Kate grabs a machine gun and shoots a mini-plane robot thing. Kate looks at John and says "what?" John replies, "You remind me of my mother."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 An Okay Sc-Fi Film But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines is a disappointment compared to the sequel that came before it T2 Judgment Day. Terminator 3 is an okay sci-film but flawed in many ways. Director Jonathan Mostow (U571) does a decent job of bringing this movie to the big screen but it could've been a lot better. Some action scenes are cool including a chase sequence early on but the dialgoue at times isn't the greatest which made the movie kind of corny. It's basically the same plot of the first film about a time-traveling terminator whose been sent to protect John Connor from another advanced cyborg except this time it's a woman known as the terminatrix. Whose idea was it to make the villain a female terminator? No offense to Kristina Loken who played the villain because she did do a good job in the movie but I just couldn't buy Skynet creating a female terminator. No offense. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns for the third time as another T-800 sent from the future to protect the soon to be leader of the resistance John Connor. Swarzenegger was born to play The Terminator and does a great job with the role but even he can't help this movie from being a disappointment. His talent and mostly everyone else's is wasted in this third adventure of the Terminator series that's basically the same story of the first two films. It offers nothing really new and besides for some cool action sequences and special effects the movie just isn't that good compared to the other three films. Nick Stahl from Bully and In The Bedroom plays Connor this time taking over for Edward Furlong. Stahl gives a solid performance of an off the grid bum who's running from a destiny he can not escape. Claire Danes from The Mod Squad and Stardust plays Kate Brewster who will eventually become Connor's wife in the future and his second in command. Danes is believable as Kate whose world is turned upside down after she has a chance encounter with Connor. The rest of the cast are good in their roles but this one is the worst of the fourth films in the Terminator series. It's not really that bad as far as the action/fight sequences, special effects, and most of the acting goes it just could've been a lot better at least to me. If you're a fan of these type of films and you haven't seen any other the terminator films yet. I suggest you see either the first one, Judgement Day, or the one that came out most recently Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. Now those three films are worth watching unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Healthy and well executed continuation of the series, not submitting to genre convention while exploring its leads in an impressive manner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to hold up for me, on subsequent viewings. I took to it the first time I saw it, and have since been quite surprised by the level of antagonism most people have toward it. The film is far from the disaster it could have been; it draws on inspiration from the previous two films and rather than aim to go bigger and better, it actually opts to go underneath them ? this, it most certainly achieves. Drawing on the fast moving element of chase and the very bleak atmosphere the first film had, Terminator 3 delivers as a downbeat and briskly paced thriller with a science-fiction twist. It additionally works as a polished action film, something the second Terminator film was, with numerous action set pieces but with additional substance in the form of studies of individuals and their hardened bodies. Unlike the second film, however, which offered hope at the end of the narrative; Terminator 3 sticks to its guns and concludes on a downbeat tone, echoing the first film and setting up what will be a supposed number of sequels.I think a lot of people dislike the film because they're told to dislike the film; almost as if people are frightened of reading too much into the text. Yes, Cameron had no input to its production; yes, the enemy Terminator is a female; yes, Schwarzenegger's 'good' Terminator is a lot less sympathetic and there's a smaller focus on man and machine co-existing, but so what? The film remains an interesting character piece, establishing would-be hard bodied heroes and fleshing them out. On the other strand, it tells the tale of a certain military individual by name of Lieutenant General Robert Brewster (Andrews) and his final developments, along with the United States Air Force, of a complicated new weapons system they inherited from Cyberdyne Systems following their destruction in the second film. Brewster jokingly, but ominously, talks about how he wants to keep humans and their decisions 'in the loop' when it comes to co-existing with machines.The film begins with a now adult John Connor (Stahl), a nobody, an everyday guy whom does some work here and there; drifts on his motorcycle; rues the death of his mother Sarah and sits atop high bridges late at night with a beer, quite possibly contemplating suicide. The first glimpses of this individual goes against the more typical image of an action genre lead: John is weak and a relative nobody, whilst possesses very few skills. He will once again get put through the survival grinder as Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his third innings as his career defining role, is sent back to 2003 to protect him from a more advanced enemy robot named the T-X (Loken), a female super-assassin who is five times the antagonist the T-1000 was in terms of both power and ability. Like Robert Patrick's role, and to a degree Schwarzenegger's in the first film, the film opts for a relative unknown in Kristanna Loken who pulls off her role with the same anonymity and menace as her predecessors.Going through the grinder with John and the T-850 Terminator is Kate Brewster (Danes), the daughter of the aforementioned Robert of high military importance. Kate is the film's secondary study of a would-be hard bodied character; she successfully goes from squealing, screaming veterinarian to miniature Hunter Killer destroyer-come-soldier in what is a moment of realisation by both characters that she is of that material ? those that groan in disappointment at this occurrence are those that have completely missed the study in transition, thus going back to what I say about people being afraid to read too much into it. Much earlier on, she additionally displays a hardened attitude when she outsmarts John, mistaking him for a junkie breaking into the veterinarian hospital, and locks him in an animal cage. Kate advances, emotionally, as she looses those she loves and becomes more weary of the situation.The T-X acts as an interesting element to the film. The filmmakers have not updated the 'role' of the antagonistic robot purely to be different and offer variation in the role. Rather, they have allowed the most powerful character in the entire film to be a woman, something that is relatively unheard of in today's action genre. Equally refreshing is the refraining from turning both the T-X and Kate into objects of desire, forever developing and fleshing out one as the other ponders a woman's role in the new world she been transported back to when she observes a bra advertisement board asking us 'What is Sexy?' For those out for the set pieces, the film includes a few scenes of great action: the initial coming together of the robotic forces and the ensuing escape/acquiring of Kate and John as well as a shootout and consequent escape at a cemetery, during which Earl Boen gets an amusing cameo. The Terminator and the TX have an additional hand-to-hand fight in a public bathroom. The film is, essentially, a tragedy rather than a glorification of violence or a fetishisation of explosions. It documents mankind's inability to come to terms with the weapons they have at their disposal and modernity in general. I find Terminator 3 to be interesting in its own right, and worthy of a place on the mantle amongst the first two, but to echo Sarah Connor's words as she journeys to destroy the Cyberdyne building in Terminator 2: furthering the franchise into the future is 'a venture into the unknown, a making up of history as we go along'. It may yet prove to be futile and a bit of a miss-judgement and that, like judgement day, money-making sequels to established franchises "are inevitable".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Bad As You've Heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with few expectations. Yes, I had been waiting for a long time for it to get made, and after the first Matrix movie, realized that there was nothing T3 could do to wow me special effects wise. All I wanted was a good continuation of the story line mixed with some decent action. And that's exactly what I got. (Which is more than I can say for the Matrix 2 and 3)I think the best change from the last movie to this one is the recasting of John Connor. Nick Stahl did a pretty good job, and it was a hell of a lot better than Edward "I'm Strung Out On Everything In Existence" Furlong could ever do. Claire Danes was good, even with her Laura Bush haircut and Arnold was...well, Arnold.A few minor plot holes aside, I recommend watching this if you are a fan of the first two.</fullReview>

Well he isn't a very good actor and he can barely speak but he has a lot of potential and that's what I like about him in his character. This was a fun and entertaining thrill riding that I deeply enjoyed. Well it wasn't better than the 1st two but I still liked it and T-X was extremely hott!! She was also a kick ass fighter with an incredible body. Go rent this movie and enjoy it.

		<fullReview>...but the fanboys have taken it just a wee far with the hatred for this film.I have been a fan of this series since I first saw the original in 1984 at the age of two. My love for all things Ah-Nuld continues to this day. "Rise Of The Machines" definetly has flaws... but nothing overly glaring in my opinion (with the exception of the whole "talk to the hand" bit).Top notch action (no denying the utter sweetness of that first chase in downtown L.A.), impressive visuals, and a solid story. It may not have alot in the way of character development ... mainly because there's never much time for any of the characters to be sitting still for more than a few minutes.The feeling of this movie is very urgent. Lots of chasing and little to no pausing. Very quick pacing -- even more so than the other films in the series. Characters are ALWAYS in motion.I have been waiting since July 91 for another installment -- and I really believe this is a worthy entry in a great series of films. It may not be as memorable as the first two... but its still much more entertaining than alot of the action dreck that comes from Hollywood now-a-days.The Terminator - 8/10Judgment Day - 9/10Rise Of The Machines - 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comments about Nick Stahl as John Connor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some of the comments here about how Nick Stahl just didn't work for people as John Connor. I just rewatched the movie again on DVD and I think I've figured it out. They tuned out the characters.Think about what kind of life John Connor had to have while growing up - his Mom is in an insane asylum until he's 10/13. So he's part of the foster care system. Then all of a sudden he finds out all the BS that he's heard about himself is true - and it's all with a vengeance. It's not like these activities take place over months - it's a couple of days for everything from T2 and that's it. Then he lives with him Mom in Mexico until she dies.Now he's alone - ALL alone. What kind of life would YOU make for yourself? 17 - you've watched your Mom die from leukemia (which is not a great thing to see in and of itself) - and you're told that when most of humanity is killed in a nuclear holocaust, that you're the leader of the survivors. Think that YOU might be a little bent out of shape and quite possibly not strong enough to take it? Maybe even crawl into a bottle, or just run away from everything?That's what John did - as is shown at the start of the movie. By the time he's hooked up with Arnold in the crypt, he's sick of it. From his perspective, this is an intense amount of pressure to put on someone. You HAVE to live, no matter what. That's why at the end of the movie Kate Brewster (who has also had a REALLY rotten 13 hours, when you think about it - she shows up at the vet clinic at 0530 for what she thinks is a routine, albeit annoying emergency call, and by 1820 hours, she's been beat up, kidnapped, shot at, her fiance is dead, her father is dead, and told she's going to be the wife of John Connor and oh, yeah, she's the one who sent Arnie back in time because John is dead in the future - that's one HELL of a day) and John Connor have grown so much in character from the start of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting return to the Terminator series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 surprises in the strength of its story. Most problems with the film lay not in the script. Where T3 fails to live up to its predecessors is mainly in a visual/technical sense. The lighting, framing, editing and music is not up to the level of T2, visually the film lacks drama and makes one long for the artistry that was created through the collaboration of James Cameron and Adam Greenberg. The films design is also not as striking or convincing as T2. The effects are good if not groundbreaking. The film also lacks the epic feel which it should have considering the subject matter. Unfortunately most of the record breaking budget must have been used settling various legal problems. But despite all this the film is great fun, Arnie is amazing and has some good and surprisingly clever lines. Though the film does lack the epic feel this results in a fast paced film that never drags and really makes you wish it were longer. The main chase sequence and bathroom brawl are amazing to behold. Overall, if the first two get a ten this one gets an 8. See it on the big screen!</fullReview>

T2 was a great movie but couldn't touch the original. The same goes for T3, though I believe it is better than T2. The acting is better thanks to great casting of Nick Stahl and Claire Danes, and the action is phenomenal! The story is even great too, with some new twists along the way. Yep, T3 is a fantastic film and Arnie needs to bring on T4 NOW with the aid of Jonathon Mostow. *** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hype terminates movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but strangely, in the lead-up to T3, I didn't encounter ANY of the saturation advertising. I heard about it: "Hey, have you seen the trailer for T3? That T-X looks sooooo hot!" But somehow it passed me by. The only hype I encountered was in my own mind. And that was mostly concern that it might suck. I was afraid Arnie might be past it. I was afraid the lack of Cameron panache might result in a lame sequel, rather than a great new instalment in a great series. But then I thought: That T-X looks sooooo hot! So I went to see it.And I'm glad I did. This is no epic like T2. But it's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise. It's more reminiscent of T1, in that it's like a low-budget, B-grade sci-fi actioner. With a bit of a brain. And a HUGE budget. My kind of movie.To my mind, the biggest (well, only) flaw with T2 was that Jim unwittingly created a sort of paradox. To wit: No Cyberdyne = No Skynet = No War = No Terminator = No Kyle Reece Time Travel Caper = No John Connor = No End To Cyberdyne = Skynet = War = Machines Win. Oops.T3, in explaining its premise (or justifying its existence) sort of solves this paradox. But in so doing, it creates a new one, concerning John's message to his mother in T1, the philosophy which becomes her driving force in T2. Maybe he was just being cheeky, seeing what crazy things his words might make her do. But then, maybe not.On top of introducing a new philosophical slant to proceedings, the folks behind T3 have expanded the story and introduced new characters, while keeping the cast quite small.The action sequences are AWESOME. One chase, involving a crane, a fire engine and several police cars, is one of the most spectacular (not to mention EXPENSIVE-LOOKING) I have seen in recent times. Mostly because there appear to be few visual effects involved. Not to mention HEAPS of wrecked cars.Arnie may be getting on, but he is still the Terminator. His skin may sag a little, but he's an old model. Surely Terminators get wrinkles. No-one else can punch through a wall like Arnie.Nick Stahl is fine as an older John Connor. I like the way the character is introduced. A lot has happened to him since he helped stop Judgement Day. And he's the worse for it. He starts out a little frazzled, then gets MORE frazzled as the situation escalates. Nick portrays this well.I have to admit, I had reservations about Claire Danes being in this movie, as it's not in keeping with her usual...thing. But she's playing a character who isn't used to being hunted by an evil robot (who is?), so it works out nicely. She plays frightened well.And Kristanna Loken? What can I say? You can keep your Xenia Onatopp and your Mystique. There's a new femme fatale in town. And she's a toughie, too. She has a grenade launcher in her hand! Literally! She can throw ARNIE around the room like a RAGDOLL! How can you beat that? The T-X is a clever combination of the solid T-101 (Arnie) and the liquid T-1000 (Robert Patrick). With boobs. Sheer genius.I went in expecting a lame action movie about an old man in leather. What I got was a surprisingly good (REALLY good) Terminator movie, that left me wanting a T4.Is it inevitable? The future will decide...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very fast paced action plus a good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is a very effective, tightly edited, and polished action movie. You feel that every second of the 109 minutes of this film was used effectively and not wasted. There is very little "downtime". There is always something important going on or being said.A lot has been said about the humor in this movie. Some think it's too much and ruins the dark "feel" that Terminator movies are supposed to have, but others don't mind the humor as much. I'm sort of on the fence on this one. On one hand I find the humor very clever and well done, but on the other hand it seems out of place in a movie that deals with such a dark theme and storyline (the end of the world). But in a way the occasional jokes help alleviate the overall gloomy mood of the film.The movie is also a contrast of two parts: the first hour is full of one liners and gags, but the 2nd half is deadly serious and even depressing.But the bottom line is, the movie keeps you entertained throughout and I think that's the most important thing. It also tells a very crucial chapter in the whole Terminator "saga", that of the genesis of Skynet and the "rise of the machines". It's a story that was begging to be told ever since Terminator 2, and I'm so glad we finally got it and it was executed so brilliantly. The ending was also surprisingly more emotional and touching than I ever expected.Compared to its predecessors T1 and T2, I give T3 a very respectable 8 out of 10. Comparing it to most modern action movies, I give it a 10 out of 10. T3 is a throwback to the glory days of sci-fi action movies of the 80's and 90's. It's filled with one-liners, tells an engrossing story, pays attention to detail, while throwing in a lot of gratuitous explosions and destruction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines", I was really excited... Arnold was coming back! I got really nervous when James Cameron ended up turning down the project, so I was a mixed bag as trailers for "T3" began popping up in late Spring 2003.Last night I saw "T3" at a sneak preview in Georgetown.I was impressed as all Hell. "T3" totally rocked.Everyone knows Arnold is back protecting John Conner from a new terminator. That's right, no T-800 or T-1000, but the T-X. The T-X played by one of the hottest women I've seen in a long time (Loken), is an awesome design indeed: a new terminator endoskeleton with multiple onboard weapon systems coated in liquid metal. Holy crap man! That is one bad ass terminator - I never thought they'd top the T-1000, but they did. The T-X kicks ass.The movie is action packed, a non-stop thrill ride as critics might say. Claire Danes is hot and believable and Nick Stahl surprised me with his taking over of the John Conner role. Hats off to both of them.By the time the credits were rolling and the Terminator theme was echoing through the theater, everyone in there was just like "whoa". The ending blew everyone away - all I can say is wow."T3" is sure to become a classic in its own right.The question remains, will there really be a "Terminator 4"...."Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" gets an 8/10. Top marks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may not be the BEST of all the films that have came out, or as fantastic as T1, and T2. However, it is in fact The Terminator. This film as the usual car/truck chases, explosions, cross fire, Protector/Good Terminator VS Bad Terminator(aka)T-X, a little bit of new excellent effects, the usual excellent terminator make-up, as well as a few classical references to the original movies. The movie also has some classic lines such as "I'll be Back" or in this case "She'll be back." It also gives the viewers a little bit more background of what the Future in the Terminator universe is like (told by Schwarzenegger (aka) Terminator 101), as well as what to look forward for Future films such as Terminator Salvation by explain to John and his future wife Kate what happens in the future, and how the resistance was able to send back the model 101 in the first place.And finally, this movie gives the viewer the opportunity to see what John Conner would be like as a young adult without his mother around to protect him. What is really cool about this movie is that you get to see a new Terminator who is not only stronger, more powerful, and faster, but is also a female. Not to mention of course the whole Female terminator idea is hot. No, it is not the best Terminator film yet to date, no it is not as good as it's previous two films before it, but it is a good film never the less. Yes, It is The Terminator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best finales I personally have ever seen on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most profound childhood memories I will always remember was seeing Terminator 2 on the big screen. The scope of the plot, the groundbreaking effects, and of course ? the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger, than at the prime of his cinematic career ? created a larger than life experience that made me tremble like the little kid I was at the time.Naturally, I was one of those very eager fan boys that looked forward to the third installment of the series upon its release 12 year later, and unlike many of those ? I wasn't disappointed with the final result that unfolded before me on screen. Sure, the story seemed somewhat rushed at times, and the basic plot contradicted the final conclusion of the previous film; but once you get over the initial frustration from this sudden change of arc, you're in for one very intense action ride.While the plot here is similar to that of the previous films ? with one Terminator sent to the past to kill off the future resistance against the machines and the other sent back to protect humanity's last chance ? what's good about this film is that we actually get to see how Judgment Day actually occurs, with the final 10-15 minutes of the film being one of the best finales I personally have ever seen on the big screen. Once you realize that this time its for real, and the events have been set to begin the greatest attack ever set against mankind, you get that tingling feeling back inside ? the one you got upon viewing T1 &amp; T2. This unique and special feeling, and this alone, is worth the perfect 10 I give Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.</fullReview>

Though personally i found the film to be superb. Solid acting, and why has no1 else pointed out , Nick Stahl ( john connor) looks so much like Kyle Reece, his father T-1. so even though its a different actor 2 T-2 ( Edward furlong) i still felt it was John connor, unlike in other series of films where the characters are played by different actors. The affects were great, and the pace of the film was a lot better than Matrix reloaded, which found tedious at points. sorry to mention The matrix, but it is basicly a rip off of terminator, with the added touch of a computerised world. eg THE ONE - John connor - Neo Enemy - the machines - the machines Real world - humans dead, humans deadi wont go on as this is a review for t-3. The only downer id say was the T-X, you dont look at her and think shes a terminator, unlike arnie, back to what hes best at, playing " THE TERMINATOR". People have moaned about there being too much comedy in this film, but come on with 3 billion deaths on the way, you need something to lighten things up a bit, Cameron would not have had the balls to end T-3 like that, he didnt even have the balls to make T-3, so mostow deserves more credit than hes being shown.

Clair Danes isn't so bad even though i don't rate her in anything else.

		<shortDescription>a very fine movie in the best sci-fi series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if we needed another comment, here I go with a brief one.An awful lot of people have written comments panning this movie. I think they are nuts. This is a very fine movie, and a very fine part 3 in the saga. Danes and Stahl are excellent. There is good character development. The occasional humor was excellent. The chase scene with the crane vehicle was superb -- maybe the best chase scene I've ever seen. I've seen this movie at least 3 times, but that chase scene always keeps me on edge and gasping, probably because it's believable. Yes, I know that isn't really what would have happened if the hook had caught on something down in a manhole, but so what? It's a movie for goodness sake. Other critics here have compared T3 unfavorably to The Matrix. Sorry, this movie is far better than the Matrix. Half the time I couldn't figure out what was going on in The Matrix. The fight scenes with the slow motion figures pivoting around are just silly and unbelievable. Furthermore, the basic premise of the Matrix series of movies is unbelievable. The events here in the Terminator movies are much more plausible, like good science fiction always is. The Matrix is more like fantasy, almost like Harry Potter (ugh).No, it's not as good as T2, but so what? It's still very very good.- henry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The T-1000 would Destroy the T-X</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all im a die hard terminator fan i have been since i saw T-2 when i was 5 i saw T3 in theaters i thought it was OK i was expecting something a little better but anyways what i don't get is why they would send something less advanced than the t-1000 the T-x is cool (and hot) don't get me wrong but the thing is an anti-terminator and if she would try to attempt to terminate the t-1000 she would fail because she would shoot him with that ray gun she has and it would go through him and the t-1000 would basically do what he did to the T-800 (arnie) in the end of T2 which is completely F@#K him up so yeah thats what i really didn't like about that movie does anyone else agree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I liked it better than T2. The acting was better, the special effects were par, and the script was better. It hits more than it misses.My only complaint would be the TX, which wasn't as interesting or as well done as the T-1000 (of T2). But Arnold's T-101 was much better this time out, and the movie was much improved by losing the 'punk kid' version of John Conner and Sarah Conner's character.One of the better Arnold movies, and a worthy Terminator sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The T-X</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think one of the best things about about T3 was Kristanna Loken, even if she did have less lines and things to do than the other evil terminators, she still did very very well with what she was given. Personally I think she did a great job. If they make a T4 I hope she is in it but with a bigger role. I also thought that Nick Stahl was quite good. He seemed to come across as quite vunerable though which I wasn't expecting and after a few years on the run you'd think he'd be a little less naive (for lack of a better word). All in all I really loved this movie, I saw it twice in the cinema and would go again if I could. I can't wait for the DVD, I'd like to see some deleted scenes... maybe there were a lot of ones that Kristanna had that were deleted which would explain why she wasn't as scary as the other evil ones. Actually because she had less to do I felt her character more as a "human" than a terminator. She really did try to get her missions done and she did manage to kill the other leaders so she wasn't all bad. And for someone who hasn't done any major body training in a while, Arnie toned up pretty good, but if they get around to making a fourth film... if the timing is going the same way it has been (one a decade) hes going to be more than 65 years old by the time they make it! Claire Danes could have had more of a role... and I really want to know, in the trailer, what's the name of the music right before the end? I think it's the third piece of music to be played (when Kristanna is programming the robot) because I like that piece of music very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes naysayers, it IS better than T2!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They said it couldn't be done. No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Edward Furlong. Arnold well past his prime, both physically, and as a box-office powerhouse. All the early buzz indicated a disaster. But I knew, I felt it in my bones, that this film would be great. Why? Because too many people said it couldn't be done. It's always the way it works. When hype builds a movie up, and everyone is expecting too much (ala Matrix Reloaded), everyone is bound for a letdown. When all hope seems lost, and everyone's expectations are at their lowest, are we then surprised. So thank you all you T3 bashers, you have made me look like prophet! Terminator 3 is not only the best movie so far this summer, it stands head and shoulders above Terminator 2! It actually benefits from Cameron, Hamilton, and Furlong being absent. Camerson has become a Titanic-hugging hacked that peaked years ago. Terminator 1, Aliens, and The Abyss are all masterpieces. He's been on a downhill slide ever since. Sorry Motion Picture Academy, but Titanic sucked the big one. Someone tell me what Linda Hamilton has done besides the Terminator films that is worth watching......I'm waiting.....Thought so. She may have morphed from a whiny waitress, to a female Rambo, but there was nothing else for that character to do. Besides, for all her toughness in T2, she was a much more interesting character in the original. Finally, don't get me started on Edward Furlong. In T2, he was a whiny little bitch that I wished would get killed. He tried to come across as tough, but Furlong is such a bad actor, that he was laughable. T2 also relied too heavily on it's "ooh" and "aahh" fx. Yes they were spectacular and innovative, but it was too cool to be threatening. Now this is not to say that I didn't like T2. I did. Just not nearly as much as the first. Now comes T3 and the series has been given an incredible kick start. Kudos to the director, Jonathan Mostow. It is my opinion that Mr. Mostow is one of the hottest directors working today. His previous films, Breakdown and U-571, both breathed new life into their respective genres, and T3 is no exception. Mostow does not attempt to be Cameron, and the movie is all the better for it. Mostow brings his own style to the table, and the results are spectacular. The cinematography, editing, and pacing are all top notch. And the action sequences? Incredible! There is a vehicle chase at the beginning of this movie (I hesitate to say "car chase" because cars don't really factor into it, unless they are getting demolished) that is awe inspiring. This is what the chase in Matrix Reloaded WANTED to be. It ranks as one of the best chase scenes in movie history. Right up there with The French Connection and The Road Warrior. There is also a brawl between the T-101 and T-X in a public restroom that goes all out. Great stuff. Now what would this movie be without characters? Nick Stahl is PERFECT as John Connor. Now a tortured soul, too torn up by the past to be hopeful of the future, Stahl let's it all hang out. He let's you feel everything Connor does. Hoping for the best, but all the while you feel that fate is going to catch up with you sooner or later. Claire Danes, who I have never been a big fan of, also shines. She is in full Linda Hamilton mode, but better. She is a caring person, but proves that she's tough as nails when the chips are down. Bravo, Ms. Danes. Arnold. What can I say about the man? He may have been away from the character for 10 years, but you'd never know it. Arnold is the Terminator. Now doubts about it. Welcome back Mr. Schwarzenegger, you've been gone too long. Now as for Arnold's nemesis, we have Kristanna Loken as the T-X. Quite simply she, with the exception of Mostow, had the most work cut out for her in this movie. Everyone know what to expect from Arnold. But it is a rule of action movies that they are only as good as their villian. Robert Patrick had the benefit of brand-new CG technology to back him up. While his performance was good, (Especially how he NEVER blinks his eyes while firing a gun. I'd like to see you try that. If you've never noticed, watch T2 and check it out) as I said before, the effects made him more cool than threatening. Now we have Ms. Loken. People scoffed at the idea of a female Terminator to begin with. SO the deck was really stacked against her. Well have no fear, the T-X is here, and she is as bad-ass as they come. Not only can she go toe-to-toe with Arnie, not only can she morph like the T-1000, but she has more than a few tricks up her sleeve. She can reprogram machines, manufature weapons from her arm, and remote control vehicles to really give you a run for your money. She is also one of the most INCREDIBLY beautiul women you will ever see. That adds to her manace, because she has the power of a woman's seductivness on her side, and believe me she uses it. Her beaufiul, icy stare is at once mesmerizing, and terrifying when you realize what is behind those eyes. Way to go Kristanna. Everyone gives their all. The director, actors, and the FX department. But unlike T2, they don't overuse the CG effects. They utilize many styles. GC, miniature work, makeup fx, mechanical effects, and good old-fashioned stunt work. As I said earlier, the chase scene is incredible. Even more so when you realize how much of it was done for real. Simply spectacular. What this movie also has, unlike T2, is the tension of the original film. In T2, you simply dont care about the people. They are only backdrop to the action and fx. Not so here. The makers realized that the characters needed to be as flushed out as the action. That brings the tension level up ten fold. Just like the original. So is it as good as the original? No. But then it couldn't be. So it doesn't try to be. BUT it is a damn great movie, and a big improvement over T2. The best praise I can give it is....BRING ON TERMINATOR 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonathan Mostow is a genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, without a doubt, definitely the best and biggest film of 2003. All of those people who doubted Jonathan Mostow should be ashamed of themselves, I know I am. This film completely blew me away.Arnold plays the part as T - 100 even better than he did the last two times It seem like there is no stopping this man - he just keeps on getting better and better!Nick Stahl portrays John Connor, in the way that you would imagine a young man with so much stress on his shoulders to be like. Jonathan Mostow has to be applauded for bringing this talented young actor into such a big movie for all us young ladies to dribble over.Kristanna Loken, who is a little scary I must admit, is amazing at playing a new, more advanced, terminator model, named TX, who is trying to kill John Connor. She only has a few lines in the film (like six), but I feel that this scares the audience even more as she has to act simply through her facial expressions. Again, Jonathan Mostow has done a great job in casting when he introduced us to this former model.All I have left to say is that the special effects in T3 are the way that special effects should be, they are not fake like in The Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter. Instead they are simply mind blowing, as well as the stunts.So if you are going to see a film this year, I would strongly recommend Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines.</fullReview>

LET THOSE WHO LIKE IT WATCH IT AND COMMENT. i saw this movie before reading the reviews and i enjoyed it.i have lost faith in rotten tomatoes long ago cuz they seem to give poor ratings to decent movies.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a good movie. any sci-fi fan would love it. the environment is great and the acting was good. its good to see Arnold Schwarzenegger stepping up into the lead and doing a good job. he is someone to look out for. Nick Slaht too was great. and i don't understand why some ppl have problems with some of the other characters knowing martial arts and didn't explain how they learned it. i mean comon, this ain't a drama, this is sci-fi and u don't need to waste time talking about silly things like where they learned it from..it spoils the mood of the film. some ppl just wanna say bad things about good movies and find almost non-existent plot holes to look smart but they are anything but that..overall i enjoyed the film and have already seen it twice and this movie deserves to be given a viewing. 2 hours is not really gonna hurt is it?? watch this movie if u are a fan of - Pitch Black, Fight Club..science-fiction movies in general..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The day the future ceased completely to exist...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was starting to like that crappy movie when seeing it (even if it wasn't famous unlike the two first films), but when I saw the end, that was another story my friends... I was totally disappointed and deceived, not to mention that I felt very sick. I had an heartache and I was hurt deeply, cause that nipple-face who is Jonathan Mostow completely ruined the Terminator series with this awful heap of metal scrap. I had convulsions, the strange impression that I lost my balls, my eyes and my head, and even worse: I touched my head to assure that all my hair didn't fall...In this movie, the dialogs are more funny and artificial than the usual, and this time, the actors did a really sickening job. But the most ridiculous ever, it's the Terminatrix when she inflates her breast in the car. Also, we didn't need a sequel, cause in the 2nd movie, Skynet was destroyed in the present and future by the Resistance, and the idea of a stupid super-virus in this film is too cheesy. I even heard that a 4th Terminator film is in preparation, but I think that it will be awful and useless to see, Arnold or not...In two words this movie can give you suicidal tendencies and drive you sicker than plague if you see it, and it deserves 2 thumbs down, 2 middle fingers up and not the least (riddle me this, riddle me that: it has the form of a famous number, it's round and it's between everyone's butt...)To all Terminators fans: don't watch it, cause you will have the same feeling that I had. Or else, watch it with your balls to the wall...Steve Baillargeon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an outstanding movie. I enjoy both action films and comedy films. I couldn't help but laugh at Arnold's robotic comments to us (the inferior human race) as there were so nonemotional and .. well.. robotic. Telling Kate Brewster to (essentially) shutup in the back of the stolen truck had me dying in laughter, since I could imagine the governor saying that to his kids in the backseat of a minivan. Okay, enough of my sarcasm -- this was just a great, nonstop action movie. I didn't see the first, really liked the second, but the third (and I'd guess final, since our lead character is both getting old and in politics) will be the highlight of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this supposed to be good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God. I really don't know where to begin. I guess I should start with the obvious fact that this film was completely unnecessary. Most scenes in the movie seem to have been blatantly lifted directly from the second film so much so that at many times I felt as though I was watching a remake. After sitting through this mess I had a whole new respect for the first two films as being action/sci-fi classics. I have a sneaky suspicion that this "movie" will be one of those over priced blockbuster hopefuls that will be all but forgotten a few years from now. The absence of James Cameron is greatly felt from the opening shot of T3, to its dreadful ending. Although he has been considered controversial because of his constant perfectionism, I guarantee you that the shameful and embarrassing acting as well as the copied storyline would not be found in the third installment had he been involved. Then again, the reason Cameron was not at the helm for this one was because he simply felt there was no more story. Things were pretty tied up at the end of T2, wouldn't you say? There isn't even a proper explanation as to why the events in T3 are even happening.Nevertheless, you just knew a third movie was going to be made and people would be having visions of Terminator greatness on their minds. It's sad to realize that fans of the Terminator films will no doubt be very disappointed (at least I think they will be). There really is nothing good about this movie and it scares me to death to think that if this particular sequel to a very well known couple of movies was this terrible, what does this hold for some of the other announced or planned big money sequels to movie franchises. If Indiana Jones 4, Die Hard 4, or even Mad Max 4 are nearly as bad as this film, God help us all.One more point I would like to stress concerning this movie would be its message/philosophy. Let me get this straight, the main point of the story is that humans simply cannot avoid what is inevitable? This is in absolute contradiction to the second film's meaning of "No Fate But What We Make" in which disaster can be averted if we all just wake up and realize what is about to go down. So in other words, the optimistic ending of the second film is replaced by a complete downer ending in the third film that is just hideous in how weak it is. This is bad, really bad and I have to believe that James Cameron is smoking hot with anger. I am going to try my hardest to pretend that this film (and whatever may follow it) never existed. That way I can appreciate just how entertaining and interesting the first two stories indeed are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is a disgrace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Schwarzenegger for many years, and I have even money on him becoming president at odds 500/1. However, his last good film was True Lies. After this he had made a lot of garbage, probably being topped off with the enigma that is Terminator 3. What do you get when you have a lame script, a mediocre director and a lead actor that is not as hip as he used to be? The answer is a lame film. Another viewer rated the scene where he gets his clothes off a homosexual stripper a good one. I think it was very stupid, and totally destroyed any credibility that the terminator had built up in the first two outings. The rise of the machines and the almost total destruction of human kind is not a subject to me made fun of, and it is very sad that they did not understand this when they made T3. The T3 script is a mess. It is as if the script for Terminator 2 was a vase but it fell to the floor and broke and then a group of retards tried to glue the pieces together. I am a fan of Nick Stahl, and he was in my opinion one of the few that did a good job here. This is just very sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It stinks, and it gives James Cameron a bad name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I forward the review I must tell you that this movie simply gives James Cameron and the terminator series a bad name. I find that all the loud action scenes and partial nudity a bore to me for it does not make the writing material or acting or quality any better. OK, on with the review...Hollywood made an attempt to make another chapter in the sci-fi trilogy of The Terminator. A rise of the machines as they planned to do it, yet they failed to do so. There is no James Cameron in this movie; it's almost like he never made the terminator; which is a shame because he is the true creative force behind the machines as well as his friend who helped write this movie. Anyway, the movie starts out with Nick Stahl speaking his story of the terminators and of such material and judgement day. I will give them credit that they followed the concept of the second one even though they should have been more original. However we do not see the notorious and wonderful Linda Hamilton in this film; which pretty much gives the audience a chance to look at it more negatively. True, they follow the elements of Shwartzennagger and judgement day but this was simply a bad Hollywood attempt at resurrecting this movie from the nineties. They put gigantic loud noises (to cover the audience's mouths from saying: "Hey, WHERE'S THE BEEF) they put big explosions (so the producers could 'eliminate' their problems but failed like they did here) and they put out of place vulgarity huomour (as to change the subject of the critics when they bring up this movie) but if you are to take all that away, and I mean all of it, then you simply get what this movie really is: another failed Hollywood big budget action movie; simplifying nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines follows the 1984 hit Terminator, and the 1991 hit Terminator 2: Judgment Day, two intelligent, well made films. T3 is the complete opposite of Terminator 1 and 2. Terminator 1 and 2 were both intelligent films, with a style and wit that to this day is unmatched. T3 was directed by Jonathon Mostow, a guy who knows how to handle his actions scenes, but a guy who also has no respect for T3's predecessors. Mostow has made some movies in the past, but I've only seen one: Breakdown. Breakdown was a very good movie that fleshed out it's characters and had a distinct feeling to it. Breakdown was a good movie. I liked it a lot. But, back to T3. T3 has some VERY entertaining and very well directed action scenes. But that's the problem. The movie is all action scenes, with no complex merit whatsoever. Though I like the action scenes, I have a strong problem with the way the movie was handled story wise. Jonathon Mostow, like I said, knows how to handle his actions scenes, and I'm sure he likes the previous Terminator movies. The problem is that he has no respect for the complex plot that comes with the first two movies. The first movies had a few holes, but they still managed to explain everything coherently. Terminator 3 does not do that. Jonathon Mostow completely ignores everything from the first movies, there are so many plot holes and questions that are unanswered, like how did Skynet suddenly continue development even though everything was destroyed in T2, and how does (SPOILER) Judgment Day suddenly become inevitable even though in the first films they make it clear that it can be stopped. All of these questions are unanswered, and as I sat in the theater almost exactly a year ago, I noticed all of these problems. When I walked out of the theater, I absolutely despised this movie because it betrayed the first films. I bought the DVD, and I didn't hate it as much. My feelings towards it now are mixed. This time around, a female Terminator, the T-X, is sent back through time to kill John Conner (and someone else, who I wont mention). Again, the T-800 (I call it the T-800 because T-101 is a load of bulls***) is sent back to protect John. Here's another plot hole though: In the ending, they say Judgment Day is inevitable, so why would they bother to send a Terminator back to kill John? John was the one to prevent the war, but according to this movie, the war was going to happen no matter what, so why bother sending them back to kill John? The T-X objective is to 'Ensure the rise of the machines.' If the rising of the machines is inevitable, why would they send her back to ensure it? John couldn't have stopped the rise of the machines because it was inevitable, so why send them back? It just doesn't make a bit of sense. Jonathon Mostow could have also acknowledged a reason just to clear the air, like he could of said the arm that cut off from the T-800 in the first film was found by some people and used that to create the Terminators, and even though finding an arm and making an army of machines from it would be implausible it would still fill some plot holes and answer some questions. Instead, Jonathon Mostow goes down the path of the summer action movie, he loads his movie with nonstop shooting, nonstop explosions, and nonstop special effects, and as much as I enjoyed these fights, explosions, and bullets it still doesn't change the fact that the movie betrayed it's predecessors. The T-X is played by Kristanna Loken, this is probably her first major role in a film. Loken is a hot blonde who had the potential to be a good Terminator but again, because of Jonathon Mostow, she failed. The greatest thing about Robert Patrick's performance in the first film was the fact that he was grim, he had absolutely no emotion in his face AT ALL, he truly embodied the characteristics of a cyborg, and he did one of the most grim performances in film history (in my opinion). Kristanna Loken doesn't do that. In most scenes, when Loken is supposed to show no emotion and not show any pleasure in killing, she does the opposite, and this is because Jonathon Mostow's crappy directing. More than half the time, Loken has a smirk on her face, and when she talks, she has WAY too much movement in her face. Supposedly, Jonathon Mostow liked the idea of having the T-X smirk, so he told Kristana to keep doing it, but Mostow forgets one thing: Loken is supposed to be a machine, one that isn't supposed to smile or anything like that, and sometimes, it looks like the T-X is taking pleasure in killing just by the look on her face, but people know pleasure is a human feeling, and people know machines cant have an human feelings. Robert Patrick made the T-1000 one of the best villains in film history, sadly, Kristana Loken didn't do anything she could with the T-X character, and it's mostly Jonathon Mostow's fault, the guy only knows how to direct explosions and car chases, but when it comes to directing complex characters like machines he fails. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800 (again, I'm not calling it the T-101), and like his performances in the first films, it is top notch. Arnold is able to maintain the same feeling he pulled off in T1 and T2, without really changing the character. Arnold doesn't show emotions, but in T2, he does have emotions, and that's the point of his character in the end, but I guess in this he didn't really need to show the traits he had in the first movie. Arnold has aged over the years, but still proves that regardless of age, he can still be an action star, his performance is good, but in T2 he did a better job, probably because in that movie his character had more depth, more areas to explore like emotions, but in this one, all he has to do is be there and be a machine. In T2, Edward Furlong played John Conner. Furlong was signed on to this when it was announced, but due to drug and drinking problems, he was fired from the project, and Nick Stahl was hired the be John Conner. At first, I thought Stahl was a terrible choice to be John Conner, but it turns out that he actually did a good job at being the character. His acting job wasn't as good as Furlong's, but it was still pretty good. I cant say that replacing Furlong with Nick Stahl was a better idea because Furlong is the one who gave life to the character, but Nick Stahl does give a good performance.When it comes to story, Terminator 3 falls flat on it's ass. Jonathon Mostow knows how to handle his actions scenes and his explosions and all that s***, but he doesn't know how to handle the storyline. When the predecessors to the movie you're doing are Terminator 1 and 2, you need to make sure that the story is preserved, you need to make sure that you fill each plot hole and explain everything, but the Terminator storyline is a storyline that can only be handled by one person: James Cameron. Jonathon Mostow chooses to ignore virtually everything. What he does to make sure audiences don't see these holes is he piles on an avalanche of action scenes, explosions, and guns, and even though I love all these things in movies, Terminator movies are more than just explosions and action. Jonathon Mostow seemed to want to just make his own movie, and just call it Terminator, because this movie has no relation to the first, it simply ignores every plot point and just tries to cloak all the holes with action, action, and more action. There is almost no character development, the pacing is completely off target, the movie is nothing but action.The T-X was once intended to be a male Terminator, and to tell you the truth, it would have worked better that way. Kirstana Loken is extremely hot, but I don't think she fits in the role. It was said that Vin Diesel was considered for the role of the T-X, and to tell you the truth, Diesel would have been an excellent choice, because I think Diesel would have been able to not show any emotion, he would have been able to convey a dark, ruthless nature with the character, and he simply would have fit the role perfectly. Most people say no, they say Vin Diesel sucks, but these people let the popcorn movies he's done overshadow his good performances. In A Man Apart, Diesel did an excellent job at conveying the bitterness and darkness of the character, in Boiler Room his performance was good, and in Knockaround Guys his performance was also very good. Diesel would have fit perfectly as a Terminator, just as long as Jonathon Mostow didn't have anything to do with the movie. Diesel would have made the role work, he would have made the character emotionless and ruthless. He would have fit better than anyone else.Terminator 3 was one of those sequels that nobody really asked for. Terminator 1 and 2 were two of the best films I've ever seen, and Terminator 2 finished off everything leaving no questions. Terminator 3 was not asked for, it should have never been made. The only reason why it was made was for one reason: Money. It's production budget was 175 million I believe, but it only made 150 million, which means it tanked, but a T4 is going to be made, without Arnold most likely, and Jonathon Mostow is supposedly going to direct. It's going to be a disaster, it's going to be a repeat of this. Mostow should be banned from making anything involving Terminator, he has no respect for the Terminator movies, he betrayed them, and he simply didn't care. Most people will say 'Terminator 3 was just supposed to be a summer action movie, it wasn't supposed to be complex, it was just supposed to be fun.' Statements like these are irrelevant, because the Terminator movies weren't ever supposed to be summer action films, they were supposed to be smart action movies with depth, they weren't supposed to be mindless like this. If Terminator 4 is made by Jonathon Mostow, it'll suck ass. If it's made by Cameron, it'll be great. T3 had so many unanswered questions like how did Skynet continue production, how could Judgment Day be inevitable, and how could anyone actually approve this movie without thinking about the complexity and wit of the first two films?Score: 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third entry of The Terminator Franchise is a good decent Action/Sci-Fi flick with flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a rare occurrence. It's a third entry to a universally revered and critically acclaimed blockbuster action film series.I Love Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines but not love as much as I love the first two movies. Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it:One of the reasons I don't love in this movie is because it has plot holes, less Schwarzenegger in it. First 15.minutes he is missing and the song is missing. Schwarzenegger in striptease club is really disappointing and does not fit in to Terminator film. After 15.mins when Terminator was missing he was sent back in time in the desert Mojave you can see on the floor glass. Why is the glass on the floor if it is a desert and not a window? In the desert they aren't any windows or any glass on the floor. How did Terminator so quickly find John Connor in the animal shelter locked up in a cage? Those questions are really bothering me.The plot is awful, Sarah Connor did not die 1997 with leukemia you stupid idiot Mostow she lived that year. In Skynet edition it is even reveled she lived 30.years in the future. The Terminator theme is missing in the beginning of the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the main actor on here not Nick Stahl. I also know if Arnold would get better script he would have made better job portraying Terminator than he did. Killing Sarah Connor in this film was the worst mistake, I counted numerous mistakes in this film that made me angry. Nick Stahl as John Connor had a lot of problems first he told the story wrong he wasn't 13, he was 10 when T1000 try to kill him. He was a reckless, stupid and a drug addict. He let him self get caught in the Animal Shelter by Kate Brewster. In T2 he was so smart and a real genius, even the cops couldn't catch him, in here he was dumb and really stupid. Thing's I love in this movie: Still a Schwarzenegger Classic machine gun firing film,I enjoyed some action scenes in it. Like shootings on the grave yard is a classic.On a graveyard Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) uses a Browning M1919A4 machine gun fitted with a drum magazine as well as a shoulder strap and special side-mounted trigger. He uses the weapon to lay down covering fire on the SWAT officers, and just as in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the damage is limited to the assembled police cars, with the SWAT officers not taking a single hit from the barrage. This scene to me is absolutely AMAZING! Dr. Silberman did return in this movie which is fantastic, even he had a little role, Earl Boen still did a great job in here. 2 Terminators destroy a tow truck fantastic. Fights between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kristanna Loken are amazing and I love it so much. I love how TX eliminates everyone that is on her way and she hunts more targets than just one, like was in T1 and T2, that is why In my opinion Kristanna Loken did a great job as Terminator TX. Story is set 10.years after Judgment Day amazing, I love it. Terminator 3 and The 6th Day were the only two movies I went to see in the theater. There are so many reasons why I enjoyed this movie so much so I rather prefer Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation over new reboot Terminator: Genisys . Terminator 1,2 &amp; 3 are Rated R. Terminator Salvation is Rated PG-13. Terminator Genisys is Rated PG-13 I excepted to be rated R not PG-13 so It suck! . The last good Terminator movie It has flaws, but is hell of a better than Genisys is. It was good acting from Kristanna Loken as T-X which, I think she did a perfect job as new Terminator. T-X is made of liquid metal, but unlike the T-1000, it seems to liquefy when its clones itself, gets severe damage, etc. With the T-X, when it takes small damage like a hit, its body doesn't liquefy. In other words, T-X has more metal like the T-101, but liquefy under certain circumstances. Also, unlike the T-1000, it can form firing weapons such as a flame thrower or small rocket launcher. The T-X can remotely hack into other machines and control them. CGI and special effects are not bad. I love action sequences, chase sequences with the tow truck are really awesome. The fights between Terminator and T-X I mentioned before are amazing. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't a great film, but it is excellent, nonetheless, and the pacing is its greatest strength.The plot: A cybernetic warrior from a post-apocalyptic future travels back in time to protect a 19-year old drifter and his future wife from a most advanced robotic assassin and to ensure they both survive a nuclear attack. The film is more about surviving Judgment Day and surviving T-X. John Connor and Kate Brewster his future wife must life or the human kind will parish forever. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a 2003 American science fiction action film, directed by Jonathan Mostow and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken. It is the third installment in the series.The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Because this film is bashed very underrated, Rated R for strong sci-fi violence and action, and for language and brief nudity. It is the end of the trilogy and for the third ride, I don't think it was that terrible or such a bad film, like people are saying today. I love this film and it will always be my favorite film of The Terminator Trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually a pretty good action flick. The director spends some time on characterization, the chemistry between characters is pretty good, and there are plenty of amazing chase scenes (that crane truck seemed to lose more wheels than could possibly be on one when it crashed!), android action, etc.The real problem with the film is "more of the same." We already had a Terminator movie with a shape-changing robot pursuing a human hero protected by an older model electromechanical robot with a human skin surface. So now the hero is in his twenties instead of his teens. So what. The movie felt more like a reboot of Terminator 2, but without the masterful touch of Cameron. Not to criticize Jonathan Mostow too much: it is well-directed.The gruff "I'm reluctantly getting to like you" chemistry between Nick Stahl (as the human here) and Claire Danes (as his future wife) works well. Comic relief is provided in well-times doses, such as when Arnold Schwarzenegger (the good robot) informs Danes that she will have Stahl's babies in the near future, at a time when she is decidedly in the "reluctant" phase of the relationship. There are also nice cinematic devices, such as the gradual progression from night to twilight to dawn to day during the first big chase. Very expertly done.The movie has a lot of little plot holes, many of them associated with the idea of doing the same thing a third time over. If the machines of the future can send three terminators back, why not even more all over the place? And why is a machine as cold-blooded and efficient as the icy-beautiful Kristanna Loken so inefficient at doing its job? If you need to change from "boyfriend" to "Terminatrix" before you can use your weapon on Dane, just stay "boyfriend," get next to Dane, then wring her little neck! However, none of the holes are absolutely critical to the plot, which sails along just fine to a climax at an accelerator and a US deep cover installation.I'd say for someone not into the Terminator series, this would be a "7" action flick. For someone who adored Arnold and Cameron since 1984's first installment, it'll probably be a 5 for deja vu, seen that done better. So I'll award the average of these scores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines" Rises To New Levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film picks up a number of years after the last feature as we see John Connor (Stahl), future leader and Saviour of the human race, in his mid twenties (I'd guess), living 'off the grid' since the events from the last film (if you haven't seen the previous two films I don't know what the heck you're doing here, but whatever...). Turns out 'judgment day' was not averted, as initially thought at the end of the 2nd film, but only postponed, as Skynet is around in some form, as indicated by the arrival of a Terminator robot, a model T-X played by Loken. It seems now the future is populated by really hot and sexy blonde robots with definite feminine characteristics...homina, homina...soon after we see another Terminator arrive, the muscled one we're more accustomed to, played by Arnold. Seems the T-X model, or Terminatrix Bot has been sent back to target Connor, but if it can't get to him, it's supposed to go after those who would be his lieutenants, including that of Kate Brewster (Danes), whose father, played by Andrews, just happens to be some military bigwig in charge of the program which will eventually become Skynet, the artificial intelligence that will eventually take over the world, exterminating the human threat. Make sense? Probably not...anyway, given this new threat, someone from within the resistance from the future decided to send back an Arnold robot to protect whomever needed protecting, but its task a difficult one given the sophistication of the T-X model, which is essentially an enhanced logic weapons systems cybernetic combat infiltration unit with nanotechnological transjectors inside a titanium battle chassis surrounded by a mimetic poly alloy...whew! So what does all that mean? Well, it can manipulate machines under computer control, tap into communications systems, and produce weaponry from within, including a wicked plasma cannon from its arm, among other things. Things aren't looking so good for John (or the human race, for that matter), but did I mention the Terminatrix is really hot?Given the fact Terminator 2 made as much as it did at the box office, I'm not surprised someone decided to continue on with the franchise, despite the fact the story had been pretty much wrapped up at the end of the second film. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines does try to fit itself within the continuity of the previous two films, and, on the surface it succeeds, but once you start picking at the loose threads, there are inconsistencies (then again, when we're talking about time travel, who's to say what could and couldn't happen?). Now, I'm not going to go through and relate all the bits I thought out of place as I'm sure many have already done so, and done so a lot better than I could have, but I will say if you take this movie at face value (a straight up action film), you'll probably have a lot more fun. There was one bit that really bothered me, though, and that was when John, Kate, and the Arnold Bot were trying to contact Kate's father, who just happened to be secured away in some top-secret military installation. One minute they're driving towards the place and the next they're inside, talking to Kate's father...I suppose the Arnold Bot could have bypassed the security somehow, but it all seemed rather convenient, especially given the circumstances. I did like the whole bit about a widespread virus running through the Internet, where it came from, and its ultimate purpose. The characters in this film seemed to take a backseat to the action, as none are really developed as much as they were in the previous films. Perhaps the filmmakers were relying on the character development already out there from the earlier films, but given so few characters carried over, this didn't work out so well. One of the biggest weaknesses in the film, in my opinion, was that of Stahl's character of John Connor. There seemed to be an awful lot of inconsistencies indicating perhaps this wasn't the same John Connor as was in the previous movie. I'm not a big fan of Stahl (he reminds me too much of Giovanni Ribisi, whom I care even less for), but I thought he did pretty well in the film Sin City (2005). As far as Danes, well, she looked good, but her performance was limited by her role, as it was written. While the plot and the characters may have been half-baked, at least the action was balls out. My favourite bit involved a car chase sequence featuring a gigantic crane truck barreling through city streets, causing massive amounts of destruction. Another great bit was when the two Terminators were fighting each other within the military base, and the Arnold Bot uses a urinal as an offensive weapon. The first time I saw this film and the ending was presented I found myself saying "What the f***?", but, after watching it again last night it did seem to make sense in terms of the story presented. All in all I thought this a great action film, but in terms of a sequel to the Terminator series, it was so-so...I'd agree with Cameron that there really wasn't anything left to tell in the story, but if there's a chance to make money, you know Hollywood will capitalize.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not bad. Not that good either. The third installment of the Terminator franchise, and the first not directed by James Cameron. The change of director doesn't make much difference. As with the first two movies, it's all about style rather than substance, special effects rather than a watertight plot.Plot isn't that bad, however, just kind of formulaic. Performances are so-so. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't there because for the Shakespearean soliloquies but just action scenes and cheesy one- liners, and he does those well. Nick Stahl is badly cast as John Connor - he's no action hero. Claire Danes' performance is the best of the bunch. Then again, she is easily the best actor in the cast. Kristanna Loken...looks good.Overall, not a terrible waste of time. Moves along at a good pace and it's a reasonably fun ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A roller-coaster ride, but a lesser movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 2 had such a perfect ending, but given how successful it was a the box-office it was inevitable another sequel would be churned out. While predictably, this one, directed by Jonathan Mostow, would never be in the same league as the first two, it's still a better film that perhaps was expected.This one goes for balls-to-the-wall action, and on that level it certainly delivers. A visual spectacular, with the highlight being a destructive vehicle chase with the T-X driving a crane. The special effects are cool, though at times a tad too obvious. For about 2 hours, the film does not let up.It becomes clear though, that action and special effects are about all we're going to get. That and silly one-liners. Arnie makes a welcome return - of sorts, though he's undermined whenever scenes are played for laughs. Kristanna Loken is creepily lithe as the T-X, and is perhaps the best reason to watch it. Though little more than a variation of the T-1000, she still makes for a worthy addition to the cyborg killers Skynet keeps churning out. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes however aren't really that likable as John Connor and Katy Brewster. What this film lacks is the presence of someone like Kyle Reese in the first, and the buffed up Sarah Connor of the second. Indeed it's lacking the heart and soul of the first two preferring to toss that aside in favour of non-stop thrills.While still very entertaining for most of it's way, at the climax, it starts to fall apart somewhat, and the final face-off between Arnie and the T-X is pretty weak. The ending however is quite a brave move, a brief attempt to recapture some of the bleak tone of the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Judgment Day is inevitable."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As thrilling as the first two Terminator films were, they made up a rather complete duology. I still always dreamed that a third movie should be made, to take the franchise into thrilling new directions. About ten or eleven years after T2, this film finally came out, with surprisingly little enthusiasm.Outside of James Cameron's hands, it's not quite the same. I can't deny that it's missing a certain charm, or perhaps a certain pathos, that makes the first two films work so well. Regardless, T3 has its share of excitement. The car chase in the opening act, featuring a crane that wrecks a huge number of cars and one whole building, is an excellent and awesome thing to watch. The film maintains really fast pacing with a frequent number of chases and fights. It's also loaded up with quite a bit of silly comedy. I could see audiences loathing the lighter tone of the film, but I think it's a real hoot. Even though these scenes make the film lightweight, it still has serious moments, especially during its final scenes.The film starts off looking quite similar to the other two movies, with two terminators coming into the past, one to kill and the other to protect. It quickly covers thrilling new ground, showcasing a lost and troubled John Connor who winds up literally trapped in some rather amusing situations. When the actual Judgment Day hits, it becomes a mad rush. There's not much room for character or theme development, and when there is, some of the scenes might come off as wimpy (especially in the way John Connor whines and threatens to kill himself in one scene). Regardless, it's a serviceable story with a few surprising twists, even if it doesn't have the same depth or feeling as its predecessors.The film looks slick, with solid photography and editing. Acting is not bad: Arnold Schwarzenegger returns with a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of his iconic character. Nick Stahl does his best to match up with Edward Furlong's portrayal of John Connor; despite being a little unlikable as a character, I think his performance is admirable. Claire Danes and Kristanna Lokken are both fun to watch. Writing is okay; there are a few lines that I wish were expanded upon. This production has plenty of good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects look great most of the time, and a little weak in other spots. Music is pretty good.I'd recommend this as a rental.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still entertaining even if Cameron isn't at the wheel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know that after Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Arnold Schwarzenegger stated that he would not continue the Terminator franchise unless James Cameron was directing. Apparently he did not follow through on his word. Schwarzenegger is back as his metal counterpart to save John Connor once more from being killed off so he can save the human race from Skynet becoming self-aware.And even though James Cameron did not even take part in this film at all, director Jonathan Mostow looks like he put a lot of work into this less appreciated sequel too. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's and feels depressed because he can't do anything with his life. Perhaps the reason was that judgment day didn't happen...yet, but he didn't know that. This time, Schwarzenegger comes back as a modified Terminator, the T-850 to protect Connor from his strongest opponent yet; the T-X. The T-X is played by model Kristanna Loken. Loken makes her character quite believable and lethal at the same time. Although she barely shows any emotion, she looks like she had a good time being her character. Killing victims and all. Loken is part of what makes this sequel work. Even Earl Boen (Dr. Silberman) has an appearance for a brief time to treat the fans of the franchise. The action is still very intense and the violence is still very brutal.The only weak points I see is Marco Beltrami's film score and Nick Stahl. Beltrami does recall Brad Fiedel's theme from the first two films but his rendition gets lost in the softer more sentimental scenes. As for Stahl, perhaps he wasn't the best choice as an older John Connor. His looks don't quite make out as a rough and tough leader. But all around, this sequel still packs a punch.The third terminator film has good performances from Loken and Schwarzenegger. Even if it's missing James Cameron.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3 is it that bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like the public opinion of this film is that it is the worst of the 4 Terminator films. The budget, the production, everything is done big. Almost too big. Many people hate the story because they found it confusing or it didn't make any sense. The reason why I enjoyed this film is because I was able to detach it from T2. It sounds silly to do so because they are part of the same franchise but T2 to me was a global phenomenon. I think that when T2 came out back then, it pretty much caught everyone's eye. So to compare it to a film like that is a pretty tall order. So how do I see T3? The romance between John Connor and Kate Brewster could have been much better, but it was a nice concept, nice to see Arnold back even though he seems to have completely stopped trying to act robotic at all in this one. The concept of the TX a female Terminator that hunts other Terminators is very interesting. The plot with the so called twist ending at the end was not well done, But overall to me this is a film that I call easy watching. This is another film that also had a ton of potential. In the trivia section it is stated that Vin Diesel, Shaq, Famke, and Chyna was considered for the role of the TX. I think it would have been great if they had casted all of them. Arnold would have to defeat each one, and hopefully each one would have a unique special ability instead of cramming multiple abilities into one like they did the TX. So if you keep your expectations low, your getting an average action flick with an A class mega budget, so I had fun with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much fun as these movies are, whatever connection they had to the writings of Harlan Ellison (acknowledged in the credits of the original movie) are gone. Unlike the two previous movies, this one spans only one day. And what a day it is. We have here a total commitment to special effects and explosions instead of any character development or plot. Arnold looks damn good nearly twenty years after the original film, to his credit, and his acting is, well, predictably Arnold. In both T2 and T3, he breaks the machine character in several scenes and uses "human" tones and expressions when communicating with the real humans. Claire Danes' character is never really developed beyond the confused girl and veterinary assistant about to be married to a man she is not quite sure she wants to marry, although there is one fairly comedic scene where John Connor looks at her and says "You remind me of my mother.". Earl Boen reprising his role as Dr. Silberman is priceless, especially when he spots the Terminator. Nick Stahl as John Connor just does not pan out. Edward Furlong in the second movie figured out the true nature of the character when the Terminator explains his mother has been telling the truth. We watch a transition from angry kid to the potential leader of the resistance. Stahl remains the man in denial of his destiny right up to the end. Kristanna Loken never breaks character, she is the perfect Terminator, driven, relentless and uncaring. There are some other inconsistencies, mostly the hit list T-X is following in Los Angeles, which would seem to be unnecessary since LA will be one of the cities wiped out when Judgment Day occurs. But to the credit of the art department, the special effects alone in this film are worth a look. Rated R for nudity, violence, and language, T3 is only collectible if you own the rest of the films and are obsessed with keeping the set intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first two but still worthy of the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its not very often that film sequels can maintain a franchise and from personal experience, films seem to get worse as more sequels are made. This film didn't disappoint. It may not be as good as the original two but it still maintains great acting, the original back plot and a whole new original storyline of its own.I didn't expect this film to be as good for several reasons 1. being the characters are different. Apart from Arnie, the entire cast has changed and it felt a little empty without the actress who plays Sarah Connor. I was a little disappointed that she had been written out but as the storyline progressed, I realised it seemed necessary. The acting in this film was as good as ever and the actors really pulled off their characters.You'd have thought the writers would have ran out of storyline by the third film but they've just proved me wrong. The storyline works well alone, is unique, and fits well with the back plot already in place. If you had never seen the previous films, you'd probably be able to watch this one and follow it fairly easily.However, I have noticed that they seem to be running out of ideas for new Terminator models and rather than sticking to an original action plot, they seemed to have replaced an efficient killing machine for a good looking woman, probably for the benefit of many guys in the cinema, who it seems, this genre is more aimed at. Another problem I had with this film was the rating. The other 2 films had a higher rating which allowed for more to be done in the film. I think this one seemed a bit limited in terms of action scenes.In conclusion, this is a pretty good film which I think works well in the franchise (not like the awful fourth film). I would recommend seeing this film, just don't expect it to be good as the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After nearly twelve years, a third installment was finally made. While certainly inferior, it had so many obstacles to overcome legally and financially that we're lucky we even got a film at all ? and in the end; at least they did the best they could. Arnold looks like he hasn't aged a bit since "T2" and that alone must've been a lot of work. There's an obvious void with the absence of Cameron and Hamilton, and Nick Stahl is a poor recast of Furlong. The T-1000 is replaced with T-X (Loken), a female terminator that is dangerous and sexy, but she can't live up to Robert Patrick's nearly invincible villain. The story is well-written, with a decent attempt at explaining away any holes left in "The Terminator", but it fails to recognize important plot points from "T2". The self-awareness of the filmmakers knowing it's an inferior film makes "T3" an entertaining, fun and even humorous journey. The special effects live up to "T2" and the story's outcome is unpredictable. It's sometimes darker than the first two, sometimes lighter; at some points better, at other points inferior. Earl Boen (Dr. Silberman) is the only other actor, besides Schwarzenegger, to reprise a role.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a sequel comes along 12 years after the fact, it is almost always met with cynicism and scrutiny. Never has the case been truer than with "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines." The fact of the matter is that the two films before it redefined the science fiction genre in their own time, and the question loomed about whether or not a third film was warranted or even logical. Afterall, we saw the Connor clan in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" take down Skynet in its infancy stages, thus preventing Judgment Day, right? To quote the T-800's infamous gun-shop dialogue from the original "Terminator" film: "Wrong."With original creator James Cameron completely out of the picture, director Jonathan Mostow takes the reins with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to his titular role once more before settling in as the Governator of California. John Connor, the future leader of the resistance, is played by Nick Stahl this time around as we follow the character at age 22, with the world on the brink of the nuclear fall-out at the hands of Skynet. As before, a T-800 is sent back to ensure his survival, as well as that of his future wife (played by Claire Danes) while another, far more advanced female Terminator is sent back to ensure Connor is taken out of the picture and Judgment Day goes on as planned.One thing the film is missing for certain is James Cameron's touch. To be fair, Mostow is a thoroughly competent action director, but there's a sense of "been there, done that" with most of the story that makes the proceedings rather stale. You could chalk that up to poor writing, but also because its predecessor leaves the story with nowhere to go. Until it reaches the end, "Terminator 3" just sort of meanders along, waiting to reach that moment where all is redeemed and John Connor finally is forced to accept his destiny. Having said that, though, there are some excellent action scenes to fill the time with therefore the film never gets boring or loses its pacing.The film has been somewhat maligned for its humor, but it's important to note that it's not anymore of a comedy than "Terminator 2" was. Quite contrary, the bulk of the film is rather dark and brooding, and goes a long way in ensuring the correct mood and tone is established. There's also some key imagery in the film that makes it somewhat iconic. One scene early on during John's opening dialogue cuts to an ocean floor lined with human skulls and will send chills down your spine, as will the somber ending, which in the end, makes the film. Overall, "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is definitely a worthy entry in the series, and in spite of its redundancy, manages to entertain as well as push forward the mythology of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the machines.After watching part I and II, I got excited about watching this movie. I'm glad it turned out as I expected and delivered a little more! I cannot tell the story of this movie without spoiling a few things. So if you haven't watched any terminator film, please look away.*START SPOILERS / STORY* John Connor is now a grown man and lives a lonely life. Always on the run and not living in a home. No address and no way of contacting him in any way. This has to do with the events of the second movie. Nonetheless, yet another terminator is send back in time to try and kill him AGAIN. However, this time the terminator is a female! And it seems she's not only after John this time. Once again, a 2nd character is send back in time to protect John. An old friend...*END SPOLERS / STORY* I really liked this movie. It's (in my opinion) a real cinema film though. Mainly because of the large amounts of stunts and explosions. It would be a kick to see this on a huge screen.The story moves not too fast nor too slow. It gives us more information on the Terminator storyline as a whole, as well as a few new plot twists that make this movie interesting and clever.Besides from the action and suspense, the movie also has a nice doze of humor. There's also good dialog and the acting is okay enough. Arnold once again shines as the Tuhminatoh! Sorry, couldn't resist...In conclusion, Terminator: Rise of the machines is definitely a worthy watch. I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most people, i actually enjoyed this movie. It was action packed and fun. However, it's definitely not better than T2 or T1. I will point out though that for the TX being the most advanced Terminator ever built, she didn't seem as much of a villain as the T-1000 from T2 did. I thought that the comedic moments they put in were a little unnecessary to. Overall, if you're just looking for a decent action flick and not expecting this to be amazing, then you should definitely pick this up because it can be enjoyable. However, if you're expecting it to be as good as the first 2 Terminator films, then you're going to be disappointed. It's just an average film, but it can be a lot of fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far exceeded my expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally a second sequel like this would easily be a bomb. Truly, many of the elements of the film do not look positive, right down to Schwartzeneggar playing a different Terminator than the character in the first two films. However, I truly enjoyed watching "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines." This film does not try to fill up the entire story with useless action scenes. Instead, the action sequences are well done and fun to watch. Usually a sequel like this would lack good character development and would not focus on the people in the story enough. I felt there was significant development of the characters here, especially since this film takes place at least ten years after the events in the previous film. This film may seem a little more depressing than the previous two, but it is a lot of fun nonetheless. Schwartzeneggar plays his role just as good as he did many years ago, and I feel this is his swan song to Hollywood. This film has been needlessly criticized, when in reality, there is no reason to expect any more from it. This is a worthwhile and satisfying movie, and I hope that part 4 will pull it off just as well.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wasn't disappointed at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a true Terminator series fan, and T2 in particular is one of my favorite movies of all time. So did I have incredibly high expectations for T3? Well, no.. First of all, Cameron wasn't directing, so that kind of lowered the expectations quite a bit. Secondly, I was even somewhat sceptic about the story they had come up with. How would they explain this with regard to what happened in T2. Well, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The story made sense and whatever questions one might have had about SkyNet and why they keep sending terminators were answered satisfactorily. (Ok, so time travel movies always allow for alternative plots, but hey, it's Hollywood entertainment, not quantum physics) The special effects were top-notch, but then you wouldn't expect less from the sequel to T2, a true milestone in CGI. If anything, this movie was too short. It lacked the "epic" feel of T2. Arnold was good as he always is in the Terminator movies, the others were decent enough I guess. The movie was funny and I enjoyed the fact that Arnold doesn't take himself too seriously. Strangely enough, I noticed that most T2 fans were satisfied with T3 while "ordinary" people (non T2 geeks :-) tended to be more disappointed. I guess it has a lot to do with personal expectations. Well, personally, as a hardcore T2 fan, I enjoyed T3 and I certainly wasn't disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Future is closer than we think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find "T3:Rise of the Machines" to be as good as "T2:the Judgement Day" and way better than the original "Terminator". It is a bit funny as well and I do like the end of it. Afterall, not every movie has to have a good ending, right? I admit, I didn't see it coming. But it has a few flaws. One of them is the dialogue. That could have been done better. There were few other visible mistakes throughout the movie. I think they should stick with Eddie Furlong as John Connor. He was better in his role than Nick Stahl. And I think, in the opening part of the movie where they show John Connor as the leader of the resistance, Nick Stahl's make-up is done rather poorly. It is a sci-fi movie, but it is more real than we realize. True, when the original movie was made 20 years ago, it was all sci-fi, but now... what happened at the end may not be far fetched as we would like to think. Considering how our techology has developed, how the nuclear programs and war fare have advanced.......and how the things stand right now in the world....the future could be closer than we think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I was disappointed, because I certainly enjoyed Terminator 3. HOWEVER, it was evident that this movie was unavoidably derivative of the first two Terminator movies. Fantastic visual effects and a good story, but it certainly cannot top either of the other two Terminator movies for originality. The problem was that nothing new or original was really introduced. `She'll be back', both Terminators coming to Earth in a flash of nudity, all have been done before. Kudos to Stan Winston and the people who did the visual effects for the movie, they are certainly among the best I've ever seen. Just add something new, please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers* Granted that originally I had suspicions as to why they really made a third Terminator, I must admit that I greatly regret waiting until this movie came out on DVD before seeing it. The comments made by MM-39 very much sum up the movie perfectly.  Although -like the first two- you have a terminator/terminatrix sent back to destroy the eventual leader of the resistance, that's about where the similarities end. Reality eventually sets in that the future is set for John, that war is unavoidable. There is no hope of change and John eventually understands the why of this and that there is no running from the responsibility/fate that's his. Though the movie is sci-fi due to time travel, it becomes more believable with the involvement of very modern issues, concerning the threat of a virus infecting the series of networks that connect and in essence control the world's welfare. Skynet, unaware that their creation is the cause of this world wide virus, unleashes it (ironically to destroy this virus). In this, you see the beginnings of the machine wars, with it leaving the dead weight of hopelessness in your stomach, and the final scenes leaving you with the major sense of dread that you felt in the first Terminator. Arnold, reprising his protective role, isn't the fatherly type that he was in the 2nd. Sent back by John's wife/2nd in command of the resistance, he is the cold machine who's sole purpose is to get John and his future wife to safety from the initial attack, while revealing a nasty piece of information to John about his future. All around, I applaud Arnold for reprising this role, since it artfully filled in gaps left by the second movie. So, overall, I'm more than pleased with #3 and have learned my lesson about assuming before seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie legacies are a funny thing. Some work because of the structure of the subject matter, some work because of the profit opportunities. But only a few have been able to pull off lasting success. The one's that have not you can usually spot from the phrase `haven't they got anything better to do' upon release of the sixteenth film. The Terminator falls into that category, and although it as seemingly concluded, it's back for a third time. Money talks as they say. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in one of cinema's most illustrious characters, once again trying to save the world from certain destruction. Judgment Day, the rise of machines, was merely postponed, and now, ten years on, the machines will try again. This time, they have sent there most advanced creation, the T-X (Loken), sexy, sleek and highly affective, to destroy a now adult John Connor (Stahl), and his future wife, Katherine Brewster (Danes). However, the resistance was able to send a lone warrior back through time, the T-101 (Schwarzenegger) to ensure the survival of our young saviours. For a decade, fans were well aware that the Terminator's `father', James Cameron, was not returning. Without him, T3 was never going to be easy. Nevertheless, T3 is, thankfully and surprisingly, damn good. Maintaining the intelligence, compassion, action and multi-layered premise of the first two genre-defining films was always going to be near impossible, but the filmmakers, to their credit, intelligently leave Cameron's oeuvre aside, opting instead for simplicity, which is where the films strength lies. They create a film that keeps the core and shape of the saga, and add enough human emotion, and self-discovery to keep the undertones of the trilogy pulsing, leaving enough room for $170 million worth of SFX, extraordinary chase sequences sci-fi babble, explosions and other action-packed hullabaloo. That's not a bad thing mind you, far from it. The film is a class above your average action flick, and Mostow proves himself quite a deft hand when it comes to action, as well keeping the emotion and drama of the film integral to the film, which he does with trademark poise or flair. As Mostow excels, his cast are something of a mixed bag: on the plus side, Schwarzenegger is again superb, delivering a performance, which is both chilling and extremely tongue in cheek, and newcomer Loken is also impressive as the destructive yet alluring T-X, proving a great foil for Arnie in all departments, and adds a welcome dimension to the trilogy. One the negative side, however, are the young actors: Stahl is badly disjointed, his nice guy persona out of place in the aggressive and loutish role of Connor, and Claire Danes, though at times commendable, is restricted to a clichéd `damsel' role, running around screaming her lungs out and panting loudly.Nevertheless, loud panting noises and nit-picking aside, T3 is really is a treat. Action-packed, funny, beautifully orchestrated, and made with an intelligence sorely lacking from the modern day blockbuster, it's the must see film of the year. And if you don't like it, I think you need your hard drive thoroughly virus checked. ****</fullReview>

T3 had no story and no emotion.For a start, John Connor sure got ugly in twelve years (sorry nick stahl). Secondly I think Sarah Connor would have had to have been shot before she would die.If Fans of T1 and T2 want to continue the ride, forget T3, go and buy the great novels by S.M Stirling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 12 years, i was surprised that a 3rd Terminator movie was actually being made. The Terminator is the classic among action movies. Terminator 2:Judgment Day really stood the test of time to this day, and I believe that it surpassed the original, with a more in-depth storyline and characters, as well as a great performance by Robert Patrick as the liquid metal terminator. Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines takes the series to a whole new level. it has a lot more in common with T2 than #1. in my opinion, i think it was the most enjoyable of the 3. Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly natural at the role of the Terminator as always. Nick Stahl did a good job as John Connor. Claire Danes did a pretty good job introducing Kate Brewster. and it was good to see Earl Boen, who is the only actor besides Arnold to be in all 3 of the films, make an appearance once again as Dr. Silberman. but the one who really left a huge impression in my mind was Kristanna Loken as the T-X. i think her performance is amazing and her character outdoes that of the one from T2 played by Robert Patrick. she should at least get an Oscar nominee for that performance. she's an excellent actress, and i hope to see more of her soon. the movie also had some great action sequences, including the unforgettable one in the cemetery. it's definitely one of the best and most unique action sequences i've ever seen, and i've watched countless action movies, from the low-budget, video-only ones to the smash hits at the box office. i bought the DVD yesterday and it was very interesting to listen to the commentary by Schwarzenegger, Kristanna Loken, and the others. Terminator 3 was definitely a lot better than any other movie i've seen this year, and better than most i've seen in the past several years. it had a good ending that left hinting at another sequel. hopefully Arnold will be back for the main role if a 4th one is ever made, it just wouldn't be the same without him. also, it would be great if they brought back Kristanna Loken to play another female Terminator-she's perfect for the role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Here might be spoilers**Must admit that I didn't expect much from this movie as I took my seat in the cinema. But I was surprised. This is one of very few sequels that I actually liked better than the movies which it followed.Like the previous movies there are very elaborated action and fighting scenes were everything seems to be highly explosive. Well that was expected and the fighting scenes are pretty much what they were in t-2. However, I must say that they actually makes the mandatory car chase a great thrill because of the vehicles use, or specifically the one T-x uses (boy, I must get me one of those). I agree that is clearly noticeable that it is not James Cameron that directed this movie. Instead of, or maybe I should put it, in addition to just being your ordinary action-thriller, this movie also sports a heave element of comedy. And this is what I think really elevates this movie above its predecessors. The comedy-bit is handled very-good so it really enhances the movie instead of destroying the suspense, however I would like to call it action-comedy because of that, it feels more accurate.There are two things that annoys me though. First, why do people that are chased or in any situation were they are in short supply of time keep stopping up, just looking around and being a tourist, why? Second, Kristanna Loken as T-x seemed very much like a robot to me with constantly plain facial expressions. When I saw the movie I thought this was fine, however, when I read the trivia I learned that she had trained in communicating with facial expressions. Odd.Well, I really liked this movie, and if you are looking for a action-comedy you will too... oh by the way, not surprisingly you'll enjoy this a lot more if you really know the other two... 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3 ? The first action movie of the new millennium worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to get a ticket to the Maryland premier of ?T3: Rise of the Machines'. WOW! This is the best action film since the first ?Matrix'. Maryland residents, SEE THIS AT THE SENATOR. It will blow you away.The film works on every level. Good story, acting, action and just enough humor result in a film that lays the 2nd installment to waste. I am personally glad that James Cameron passed on this project. His access to unlimited resources will forever tarnish his filmic vision. Cameron's version of T3 would have been as bloated and worthless as every movie David Selznick made after ?Gone With the Wind.' Jonathan Mostow created a sequel that is true to the original and less than 2 hours long. Yes, the budget was huge for T3, but it works and has the most plausible plot of the three films. After accepting the existence of nearly indestructible terminators, everything else falls into place. Controlled, limited CGI and muted special effects made every sequence believable (note to the Matrix 2 screenwriters ? even though it was really cool, you will never, ever see two tractor trailers worth of Ducatis on the highway at the same time). The action sequences were not to long (hello Matrix 2 writers). The resulting realism fuels total viewer immersion. Suspension of disbelief was never pushed too far. As a result, the audience reacts positively to what was happening on the screen.Less CGI places a greater role on the actors and they did not disappoint. The characters related to each other in a believable manner. There were no huge plausibility issues (John Conner doesn't send his dad back in time to impregnate his mother a.k.a. T1). The writers developed a great ?inevitability of fate' angle to help the story along. Sarah Conner reaches out from the grave to lend support and the annoying psychologist from the first film returns for a cameo. The Terminatrix, who attacks with the tenacity and brutality of a woman scorned, is the perfect foe for Arnold. Arnold's one-liners are nicely spaced, a riot and help balance out the insane barrage of destruction the terminators leave in their wake. T3 also stands on it's own. It needs no help from its predecessors (unlike ?Matrix 3'). The machines rise, as the title suggests, so if there is a T4, it will either be a prequel or take place in the post-human, Skynet world. There is no need for a prequel as T3 provides a perfect conclusion to the `human-controlled' portion of the saga. Don't expect a cheesy thumbs-up, into the smelter T2 ending. The audience I was with applauded the movie as the credits rolled and I was right there clapping along side them. Don't cheat yourself. Find the movie theater near you with biggest screen (the Senator in Baltimore has a 40'one), best sound system (Lucasfilms certified the Senator's THX) and see this movie today! You will not be disappointed. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film surprised me by not being terrible -- I guess that's not saying much, but neither is this movie; it's just trying to blow a lot of stuff up and be a fun summer movie. As far as that goes, it's a success. Considering how many of the basic ideas here were plumbed by the first film, there's also a surprising amount to think about here. Fundamental problems exist, however: for one thing, there is so much carnage and destruction in the first 40 minutes of the movie that nothing which follows after can top it. Loken is not particularly memorable in the way the 2 previous Terminators were, but Stahl and Daines are fine as the new Connors/lover combo. Arnold is his usual self, spiced here with a bit more humor than usual.Worth seeing, but only on an off night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way SF-action should be (beware: spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really glad Arnold Schwarzenegger needed money for his campaign :-) Just like in the other two Terminator movies, Schwarzenegger is casted perfectly as a killing machine from the future. Schwarzenegger's presence in an action movie is usually enough for me to like the movie, but for those of you who disagree, there's still plenty of reasons to go see this movie. From beginning to ending this movie is worth watching. The car chase scene is violent and destructive, the way we like it, same for the fight scenes. The writer is careful not to create any inconsistencies caused by the time travel, and references to the other movies and to a (possible?) future seem to be correct. Indeed, this is not just a 2 bit action film script, no, the story by itself makes this movie worth watching. There's some good jokes in the movie, some funny situations, a running gag with sunglasses and Arnold's way of handling oneliners. This all without interfering in other aspects of the movie, as is usually the case in action films. This is a must-see, but before you see this one, make sure you've seen Terminator I and II.</fullReview>

All of you people have to realize that T2 was 12 years ago - the effects were new, and we hadn't seen this many sci-fi-action movies back then. You have to keep this in mind when you watch this film. Nowadays we're kind of overwhelmed by computer-generated effects, blood, sex, car chases, etc. This can be the reason why we haven't experienced the same "breakthrough-feeling" after watching T3. Think about it.Note: we were also twelve years younger then (compare Star Wars episodes in this context).Great movie, Schwarzenegger is simply the best. Rate: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that Terminator 3 was on the way I had mixed feelings, I was worried that Arnie couldn't deliver a worthy follow up to the previous two Terminator films without James Cameron, I needn't have worried, Terminator 3 is fantastic. In my opininion its the second best of the series, second only to the original, and better than T2. I always felt that T2 was nowhere nearly as good as the original, but the amazing special effects blinded everyone to the fact. In T3 it is an absolute Joy to see Arnold back in his most famous role, he's absolutely fantastic in this film. He looks great too, he's obviously been back in the gym for this one. Director Jonathon Mostow does a great job filling Camerons shoes and the supporting cast are great, the actor playing John Connor is much more likeable than whiney Ed Norton, and Claire Danes gets better and better as the film progresses, but all in all this film belongs to Arnold, the only down point for me was the lack of the familiar Terminator music from the last two films, anyway welcome back Arnie, roll on T4.</fullReview>

However, I'm delighted to say that I obviously know less than nothing as this movie absolutely ruled. Nobody else could play the title role period. Arnies performance was fantastic, shifting from brutal, urinal over the head violence to real laugh out loud comedy with some of the coolest one-liners in recent memory. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes did well in their roles and the director stepped up a gear with some awesome, realistic (ok not realistic, but not 100% CG ala Matrix Reloaded) action sequences. All in all a pretty near perfect summer action movie, roll on T4. Last word however is reserved for the T-X, not only was she well tasty, (damn that long curly hair, always gets in the way)but she gave a convincing performance and more than held her own next to Arnie. Roll on Kristanna Loken in Striptease 2 - Return of the Tease!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unexpected Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the original movie (10/10) and a lesser fan of the sequel (8/10), I was reluctant at first to see T3, fearing that a lesser director than James Cameron might provide a disappointing sequel. I was, then, unexpectedly excited and thoroughly pleased that I changed my mind and decided to satisfy my curiosity about this further inevitable chapter in the saga of John Connor. The movie begins with action and special effects, and continues with action and SFX unrelentingly. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The concept of a female terminator worked well, adding sex appeal and the opportunity for some humour amongst the carnage. The original movie still reigns supreme for its originality, but this is a worthy descendant - 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big, and even cerebral, summer blockbuster as they should be done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 8.4 (out of 10)If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I never would have believed it."Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" (love the subtitle) is lots of fun. It had all the ingredients of a disaster and appears to scream "we are out of ideas and trying to cash in on a popular franchise". Most repellent of those being the complete absence of original series creator James Cameron. Cameron is one of the best action directors working today - he just never makes any damn movies - and in the 12 whopping years since T2 has come out it has pretty much been the standard for big action movies. However, after seeing 'T3' and being surprised beyond my expectations, I'm not 100% sure Cameron's involvement would have made the movie that much better. This time Johnathan Mostow sits in the director's chair. He was another reason I was cautious about approaching this movie. I was under whelmed by his 'Breakdown' and viewed his last "action" movie, 'U-571', to dull to even scrape together a review for.Mostow does a phenomenal job.I can't give the guy enough praise. From his standpoint and from the team or writers assembled to script it 'T3' seems to be the loving work of fans of the original 2 movies. They work hard and meticulously not to screw things up. The end result is a movie that keeps up the spirit and integrity of the first film, but also branches out into being their own vision with it's own ideas for the next entry to the series. It has to be one of the best scripts built by committee for a 2nd sequel I've ever seen. A backhanded compliment if there ever was one, but come on - how often is the 3rd entry to an ongoing series (that isn't a trilogy) been any good at all?Mostow starts out cautiously, opening with John Conner's (Nick Stahl) narration. Before long we meet Kate Brewster, her father and the 2 terminators who will use Los Angeles as their battleground over these characters - all of whom come into play as important figures to the future of the human race. Our villain this time is a terrific original change from the other 2 films. What could possibly be more powerful then the menacing liquid metal Robert Patrick (T2)? A hot babe, of course. Ah, but beyond the human form of luscious Kristanna Loken the "T-X" (or "Terminatrix") is loaded with cool features &amp; abilities - all best left for the viewer to discovery and some of which just about dropped my jaw with their creativity. When she and our obsolete terminator hero (Schwarzenegger) meet for the first time - it doesn't take long before we're neck deep in the action - what erupts is a car chase that rejuvenated my feeling of how exciting and fun car chases can be. The movie makes ample use of the fact that our lead characters are cyborgs. You can run them over, blow them up, rip them apart, pretty much anything and everything and the kitchen sink is thrown in this cocktail of giant machines and entire city blocks are demolished in the process. It is good old fashioned summer ride. The movie is exciting as a big (and I mean BIG) blockbuster actioner (more so then 'The Matrix Reloaded' was) and intriguing as a serious sci-fi movie with a few laughs thrown in when appropriate. Mostow wisely avoids the synthetic look of, say, 'The Matrix' and relegates the film to the earthy, realistic look of the first 'Terminator'. Which makes the action and destruction look all the more spectacular.The performances are pretty solid for a movie like this. It sounds like a cop-out when you say Schwarzenegger has made a career playing a robot, but the guy does it better then anyone. He's returned to form and I consider his slump (Eraser, End of Days, Collateral Damage, The 6th Day) officially over. Nick Stahl also does a fine job. He starts out as the burned out rebel John Conner and before it's over is able to make us believe Conner is gaining the qualities that will eventually lead him to save the human race. This progressive depth is diametrically opposite to Hayden Christensen's hollow, goofball young Darth Vader in 'Attack of the Clones'. Claire Danes is even better. Proving there is life after great TV shows get cancelled, she steps up as the strong female figure the series has been known for. She conveys that sense of sadness, anger and confusion of someone who is having her life turned upside down and in the 3rd act when she picks up a gun and fights back it doesn't seem as patronizing as in other action movies. So put away your preconceptions and go check it out already. It's a big summer blockbuster that loves to blow things up but also has a brain in it's head.And that ending... loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected. *Some spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 1. Great movie, scaringly believable plot... setting standards. Time is immutable. The only reason John Conner exists is because SkyNet tried to terminate his mother in the first place. The machines had no way of knowing that, so they tried anyway.Terminator 2. Still a good movie, better action... plot with more holes than a slotted spoon. We change how things happened, so much so that by the end of the movie we are led to believe that the war never happens. In direct contrast to the standards laid out in the first movie.Terminator 3. Better than both it's predesessors. Action ten times better than the first two combined. The plot? Some of you may have missed it hidden way in there behind all that action, but it was there. Not a whole lot of it I admit, but it was there.*Spoilers here* So is time immutable? No. Is time an easy thing to change? No. What happened in T2 was such a huge event that it shook up the future enough to delay Judgement Day for years. We believe that the loop was broken after T2, but instead we find that the loop has simply changed. But now the war's started, now there's no turning back. The resistance will arise, John Conner will lead humanity towards victory... but not before sending the man he knows is his father back in time to his doom. Will it happen differently? Not at first. Not at second either, John will want to make sure it happens the same way. Only this time round, John knows he's going to be killed before the third Terminator is reprogrammed... he'll be ready. SkyNet doesn't know any different.So what happens next? Simple, John wins the war against the machines, we already know this... and the shattered remains of humanity begin anew. But there's a difference. There are probably a many number of events that could unite all of humanity towards a common goal... and that would be one of them. In this new future... we stand united. We stand as one.This story, is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Action &amp; Villian, Great Ending, Good Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, is in my opinion, very well done. It combines the most intense action sequences that I have ever seen along with some good characters and a pretty well thought out plot. The acting: Overall, I would have to say the acting was good. Nothing great, but good for an Action/Sci-Fi movie. Nick Stahl's performance was fine, nothing to over-criticize. His performance as the older, 20-something year old John Conner has made some fans of the series a little angry at how different his John Conner is compared to T2's Edward Furlong's. First of all, I think they are both good actors and I probably would have rather seen Edward Furlong reprise his role as John Conner in the third film, but Nick Stahl did good. I also tend to agree to some extent the characteristic differences between the two Conners, but the only explanation that I can give is that going through a life-changing experience like Furlong's bad-ass Conner did in T2, can change your personality throughout your life, especially when you know the world is in your hands. So maybe the new Director, who also did a awesome job to fill in for Cameron, wanted the new Conner to act the way he did. Claire Danes was very good in my opinion as Kate Brewster, her first action role. Some critics and fans panned her performance and her character because they said she was just the girl who `screamed at everything.' Well, maybe she did, but at least she brought some of the only emotion from all the actors in the film. Arnold is Arnold. He will never be able to get away from Terminator, no matter what film he is cast in. It will always be compared to Terminator. He is in excellent physical condition for his age (56?). Kristanna Loken was exceptionally villainous as the new T-X evil Terminator, and extremely hot. Many people don't realize how hard it can be to be kicked, punched, and hit over the head (even if it isn't hard) and not flinch. Her face stayed emotionless and calm, exactly how a terminator should act. A few times she smiled, but that only added to her evilness. Although her character isn't nearly as terrifying as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, she definitely added some presence onscreen. The Story: Overall, the story was good. Some stuff evolved from the previous two films and some other things contradicted them. I would definitely have liked it to be a little longer. But I have to say that I liked the fact that Jonathan Mostow took a different approach than Cameron by going straight to the action, and staying there the entire time. That is much different than Cameron's Action, Drama, Action direction from T2. Mostow had massive shoes to fill, and he filled them quite well. I loved the action scenes, because even though a large amount of special effects were used, they weren't the main object in each scene, like in Attack of the Clones. Many people are calling the effects mediocre, and nothing compared to T2's groundbreaking, Oscar-winning effects. Well, he knew he wouldn't live up to the effects, because basically, there was no more ground to break in the Visual Effects world, so he decided to take a different approach to the action scenes. And it paid off, for me at least. There is one scene that is possibly one of the best action-chase scenes that I have ever seen in a movie. All I will say is that it involves a massive crane truck, a Toyota Tundra, a motorcycle, a fire truck, and many `undriven' police cars. Awesome scene, and one of the best parts of the movie. All in all, great movie and if you're a fan of action or Sci-fi, you'll like it. Just don't think too much of it like a die-hard Terminator fan, or else you'll get to confused. ***1/2/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi Must See Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What ever you want to see honey," is what I told my husband. I had no clue that Cameron was not majorly involved in this movie. I knew that Furlong was not going to be on the screen and hated that. I whispered to hubby before the movie, you know if they do a T4, I don't care of Arnold is in next one. That is how low my expectations were for this film.I left the movie going WOW!!! I loved the action. Some action came so fast and so furious that this non computerized brain could not process what it had just seen. Alot of action was hard hitting.One reviewer stated Dane's character was not very credable especially when she locked up John Conner and did not go running for help. I would like to think that this character had some backbone and was a strong person, knowing that she knew him, felt that there was no need to panic, yet. And in the long run that is who she needed to be.Other reviews I have read say there is no story line. I saw that TX (the latest model of terminator) was intent on its mission (ITS - non gender its not human) Like a machine with specific tasks TX took the straightest possible route from point A and point B.One person commented on how they did not like that TX said "I like your gun" while other Terminator models made same comments on objects they were about to take. I assumed that this was the film makers way of telling us how the TX was going remove the cop from its path.As for Furlong not being in the movie, by the end of the movie I felt that the new actor represented John Conner the adult, the scared face warrior of the future.I loved seeing the Dr from T2. I thought it was a nice sentimental touch. (Maybe Cameron-esque)Lastly, The T100 unit (Arnold) was not portrayed as compassionate (for those who have not seen T2 on DVD - there is footage that shows changes made to the terminator allowing him to learn gain a bit of humanity) This was not the same machine from the previous movies and I liked the reinforcement of that fact.While this movie may have disappointed some, I found it completed a circle between the three films and if this is the last of the Terminator movies I think it was well done.And as Dennis Miller use to say... Thats my opinion.. I could be wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a 7 year gap between T1 and T2. And now a 12 year gap between T2 and T3. But is was worth the wait. The Terminator is sent through time to save mankind and John Conner! To do so, he has to contend with the TX, a sophisticated evil terminator that will stop at nothing to do what is programmed to do.Kristanna Loken is the TX, a beautiful but deadly cyborg and only Arnold Schwarzenegger can stop her!The film greatly combines action, drama, and even humor. The humor doesn't fall flat either. The film offers one of the best chase scenes ever filmed, a 7 minute crane chase that will have your jaw dropping and your eyes widened.***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining summer sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been many years since Arnold Schwarzenegger last donned the trademark leather jacket in T2 and with James Cameron not involved there was reason for trepidation but the franchise is back in fine form under director Jonathan Mostow ("U-571"). Another Arnie robot is sent back in time once more to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl, wisely replacing Eddie Furlong in the part) and his potential love interest (Claire Danes in her first action part). Coming back to try to kill them is the T-X (model babe Kristianna Loken). This film features some great action sequences that blow away anything done in the overhyped "Matrix" sequel and it's good to see Arnold back in fine form in the role he was meant to play. The "message" of the film seems to be "you can't escape your destiny" and it attempts to answer the questions posed in the previous films about wether or not you can truely change the future by traveling back in time. The performances are good from the cast, the direction is solid and the stunt work outstanding. I do have a couple of quibbles with the ending, but I can't really get into that without giving away key plot points.. so I'll leave it at this.. this film is a heckof a good time and certainly better than a few of the other over hyped films that we have seen lately.

		<shortDescription>Rise of Arnold...From the ashes of Collateral Damage...etc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Terminator movie machine has risen and it has taken the lives of inferior sequels everywhere! As we celebrate the return of Arnold to a role that defined action roles in the last 3 decades(80's 90's 2k)we also celebrate the successful return of the Terminator franchise as it come bursting out into the limelight once again. I believe the success of this movie not only rests on the $170 m. budget, the solid acting, well choreographed action sequeces but it is also the fact that the promoters, the advertisers and the brains behind this movie did not make the mistake of over hyping it. Too many movies have come before it, kicking and screaming before they hit the screen, raising expectations to impossible heights and then letting everyone down in an unbelieveable way.There wasn't much the T3 team let anyone in on, other than the villan was female and 2 acters weren't returning. Which leads me to my subject. Arnold. He's been lacking these few years, lets not kid ourselves. End of days was no Arnold movie, the 6th day was kinda watered down and so was Eraser. Jingle all the Way and Batman&amp;Robin were jokes. So this is a very crucial movie for Arnold in this particular junction in his career. Hopefully he keeps riding off the waves of success created by this film and becomes more selective about the roles he accepts.T3 is all Arnold. Unquestionably the Arnold of old. We don't just see glimpses here and there like in his recent watered down roles. This is truely, purely, classic Arnold at his best. I am talking about Arnold in his coronation days for Conan, Predator, T2, Commando etc. Arnold Reprises his role well, looks good in terms of physical conditioning, and spits out great one-liners left and right. Speaking of his physique, it is astonishing but really not that surprising for a 55 year old to look that good, because he is after all a multi-time winner of the Mr. Universe contest.So Arnold's huge, the movie is solid, the action is mind blowing, go see it! Don't let others stop you. You owe it to yourself and the last 2 previous movies to see this movie. In my opinion it is the best movie of the summer of 2003. 8 out of 10. Bring on T4.</fullReview>

The second time I saw it, I took my nine year old nephew. He also loved it!It has plenty of action yet still a solid story line. Nick Stahl and Clare Danes were spectacular. You could really 'feel' for their characters. I wanted to give "John Connor" a hug! They both made me imagine what it must be like to go through this experience.When I see a sci-fi flick, it must be made in a way that I 'buy in' to it. Where my logic doesn't constantly take over and say 'that could never happen'. This movie, like the previous Terminators is made so that I sit back and enjoy the movie and forget all the reality stuff.Terminator 3 also leaves plenty of room for a T4. All I can say is, I HOPE they make a T4! I want more! My nephew agrees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This proves there is indeed no fate for the Terminator series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard there was to be a Terminator 3, I was kind of excited. Then I heard that James Cameron was not affiliated in any way with the production, and with no Linda Hamilton to boot, and my expectations were pillaged. The trailers (at least the second one) were impressive, but the film was still destined, or had a "fate", if you will, for disappointment. On the contrary, the film's fate was not disappointment, but surprise. "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is a truly worthy entry in the series. It has a great story, good new characters, and fantastic acting. Nick Stahl, though not resembling Edward Furlong from the second one (but looking a lot like Michael Biehn from T1), is fine as the new John Connor. Claire Danes is also good as a very sudden, yet very important and potent new character. And Arnold is, well, back as Arnold. But thats a good thing. Kristanna Loken is the T-X, a new breed of Terminator, who can shape shift, liquify, and sprout projectile weapons, all in the disguise of a blonde beauty. Needless to say, this element of the story is quite scary. She's actually scarier and nastier than the T-1000. Who would have thought? The movie's written by the guys who wrote David Fincher's "The Game" in 1997, a wonderful movie. This gave the production some hope. The film is very, very action packed. Almost relentless. And while it has its dramatic moments, it doesn't compare at all the the emotional impact of "T2". But that's fine, being from different people. The fact is, this is a true Terminator movie, and you can call the series a trilogy without a splinter. It binds the story and characters together again. And that's what we really wanted, not James Cameron's name in the credits. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The response to this film would be warmer had it not been for the monumentally substantial act of Terminator 2 (hereinafter referred to as T2) that it had to follow. The campy fun of The Terminator (T1) was absent in T2, which took a dramatically dark tone. It was longer, more philosophical, probed many intellectual themes and generally changed the way action films are done, by offering more than just shoot-em-up and car chases.Anyway, I LOVED T3. It brought back a little of the campy fun of T1 while offering a stingingly direct approach to some issues that were dealt with in a more indirect artful way in T2.WARNING - THERE WILL BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW - SEE the film and then come back for the rest of this review.By the end of T2, we really thought that "it was over," that they had taken action to change the future. Here in T3, the T-800 tells an incredulous John Connor "it can't be stopped, it is inevitable." We, the audience, join John in not believing, and hope they are able to stop SkyNet's assumption of control... at the end of the film, the screenplay really is genius, as we join John and Kate Brewster in the numbing realization that, indeed, no matter what they do, judgment day cannot be averted.It's really a funny slap in the face for us sitting in our seats watching this film. Although time travel is currently understood to be at least inaccessible to us at this time, (if not altogether impossible), we all missed something very simply - way back in T1, we saw that the world had been overrun by the machines, and they were losing to the resistance, so they sent a terminator back to kill the mother of the leader. Clearly, judgment day had happened, and the resistance did form, fight, and turn the tide. So, everything in T2 still couldn't avert judgment day...we already knew in T1 that, somehow, despite Sarah Connor's efforts with help from the T-800, the resistance would still have to fight in a post-apocalyptic period to overcome the HKs and T-800 infantry...yet we still wanted to believe the "real story" was about averting it.Now we're seeing that the "real story" will take us beyond judgment day, to the brink of the end of humanity, when a resistance force will be lead by Neo...oops...John Connor (yes, we all see the similarity in themes between these two films...!)In T3, Arnold's acting in the character of the T-800 is really amazing. He tells John (and the audience in so doing) that he is NOT the same "personality" as the T-800 in T2, that they roll off the assembly line (setting up a T4 with MULTIPLE ARNOLDS!!!!)...this T-800 did show some "memory" (zero casualties, keys in sun visor), but that's only because the chip was somehow either retrieved or a copy was not destroyed when they blew up Cyberdine, I missed it specifically).Whatever, this T-800 must relate to John differently than it did in T1 or T2...and Arnold did bring across a sense of distance, very abruptly offsetting the intimacy shared between John and "his terminator" in T2 -- far from a bad acting job, this is sheer acting brilliance, in my opinion!!When Cameron did T1, he may not have realized the franchise he'd stumbled into...T2 was so much more than just a sequel, so much more than just an action movie...and also not the shortest film ever made.T3 was quite short, and ends with a cliff-hanging "stay tuned" not seen since Star Wars, Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back - it's OBVIOUS this installment was just a necessary bridge towards the next installment, beyond judgment day. I suspect Cameron may get back into T4...but even if he doesn't, Mastow did well in trying to carry this franchise forward with a nod to its heritage (like bringing back Earl Boen's Dr. Silberman character - the way that scene was shot shows clearly Mastow knew his audience, I joined the folks in the theatre laughing at merely the recognition of his voice, before his face was finally shown on camera - perfect!)BRING ON T4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully NOT a blockbuster movie (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to some of the other movies released this summer (such as Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk) the hype machine was not running full-bore for T3, in my opinion. As a result, I found myself more able to appreciate the movie's strengths without much in the way of pre-conceived notions getting in the way.Rather than a total deconstruction of T3, I'd rather just mention what I liked about it:1. First and foremost-- the ending. I was worried that T3 would continue with the plot point established in the first two Terminator movies: that the Terminator was sent through time to prevent the awful future from taking place. Not only was this done to death in the others in the series, but was the whole point behind the Back to the Future trilogy (only the result in that series was much more clever). It was a welcome change to see this dealt with in a different way, one that echoes some of the essential pessimism of T2.2. While in general I agree with other comments in this forum that the portrayal of the T-X lacked some of the feeling of menace of Robert Patrick's performance in T2, Kristanna Loken managed to capture and reproduce many of Patrick's mannerisms: the sideways tilt of the head, the eyes looking upward while the head was lowered, etc. It gave me the impression that they both were programmed with the same instruction set.3. With the exception of the pneumatic breast scene (which was basically there for laughs), the T-X did NOT infiltrate and further her goals by means of sexuality-- a departure from most SF movies featuring superhuman females.4. Though there was a different director and Linda Hamilton did not appear, I felt that there was a strong effort made to keep the story consistent with the rest of the Terminator mythos. For example: the tank-like machines that were activated by the Terminatrix also appeared in one or more of the Terminator video games that have been made over the years since T2. I appreciate this attention to detail.All in all, I got my money's worth. It was entertaining but was (blessedly) not a huge, overblown megablockbuster movie. Loud, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3, Rise of the Machines was an awsome movie. The special effects and chase scenes were very cool. Even though James Cameron did not direct this other guy did a good job. Schwarzenegger had a lot of funny one liners. The TX was one thing that was wrong. She did not look very intimidating for a deadly machine. I thing the T1000 was more dangerous.All in all there is not much to say about the movie except that it was an awsome action movie that was definately worth seeing.I give it 9/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely A Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS: Saw the movie and have to say that it was a very pleasant surprise. Not only was it faithful to the concept of the first two movies, but like T2, builds on its foundation and brings new ideas. I particularly liked the concept of fate...John Conner, knowing his fate, yet denying it; the inevitable takeover by Skynet, etc. It also managed to bring in new and exciting action and special effects, as well as building onto the plot and surprising me by taking it in unexpected directions. All these factors make the movie very entertaining, and worth the price, especially for Terminator/Schwarzeneggar fans. Another tidbit that I've been pondering since seeing the movie, is the evolutionary psychology behind all 3 films. The first one came out during the cold war, in which the Soviet Union and the United States were in the middle of a Mexican standoff with a combined nuclear arsenal capable of wiping out human civilization hundreds of times over. The first movie was created within those times, and the message was one in which the human spirit can prevail, in spite of the potential armageddon, and can seek to change a probable future. The second movie, created at the end of the cold war in which detente and diplomacy had achieved a bloodless end to the potential nuclear confrontation that had been hanging over the world for the past two generations, had a different message: one in which man is in complete control of his destiny, and if he is willing to take the risks and make the sacrifices, anything is possible. Now we come to the 3rd movie, and the current world is much different. No longer do we face a potential standoff between nuclear states, but the specter of international terrorists, and the possibility of a nuclear, chemical or biological attack by these ruthless groups, especially in a post 9-11 world, I think has brought back the fear of armageddon again, albeit from a different direction, and I believe this last installment of the Terminator series, reflects that fear. We fear something catastrophic is around the corner, something terrible and unavoidable feels bound to happen, and it is now just a matter of time, so prepare for it. The enemy is not within a single mainframe at one specific location, it is all around us, and unable to be removed. I believe that is the underlying pervasive psychology behind this movie, and as an honest reflection of the times, brings another element of pleasant surprise, and another reason to not miss this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story was only okay, but the action was great, and a terrific plot twist at the conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a really deep story, with great character development, there are probably better movies than T3. But for non-stop action that leaves you riveted to your seat, and interesting twists in the story of John Connor, I think T3 delivers the goods. After reading so many strongly negative reviews, I went to T3 with lowered expectations, and received quite a pleasant surprise. I think Nick Stahl did a credible job as John Connor - I found myself having no problem accepting him as the young adult incarnation of the future savior of humanity. Arnold, although 12 years older, is still THE Terminator (although I felt a few of the gags, such as the star-framed glasses, were silly and inappropriate). And I think Kristanna Loken was good as the T-X; attractive as she was, I think she was sufficiently terrifying. While the movie doesn't develop the characters, it didn't prevent me from sympathizing with and rooting for the good guys. The action scenes were excellent - the first chase sequence was one of the best I've ever seen. And the ending came as quite a surprise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie. Whether this was the end of the Terminator saga, or if there's a T4, I think the movie was a worthy successor to T1 and T2, definitely worth the money, as well as the 12 year wait. 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film avoids all the mistakes of the Matrix: Reloaded. It's brisk,the action purposeful, humorous when it needs to be, smart andwell-written. There is also none of the Matrix oddness (e.g. whenJohn Connor makes a rousing speech, it isn't followed by theTerminator doing some weird dance number). But what really swayed me over to the movie's side, was thewonderfully downbeat ending. It took guts to do this and everyoneinvolved in the film's making should be applauded for theircourage. The late Gene Siskel said that one of the biggestproblems with contemporary American movies were the endings: writers and directors no longer knew how to end them. This movieends right. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! By far the best sequel to a sequel ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost feel guilty for liking this movie so much. Who'd have thought that T3 without James Cameron's involvement could be anything slightly better than average? But T3 is not only a 10 on the "summer escapist movie" scale it is also a 9 on any other scale unless your idea of a great movie is Moulin Rouge or The Hours. Johnathan Mostow has taken the reins from Cameron for a Mach2 gallop. This movie is funny, lighter and as muscular as ever despite its much shorter length. An early chase scene is better than anything ever seen on the big screen (sorry French Connection and Reloaded) and although it is the high point of the movie T3 maintains the steam built up by it-- which I found astonishing. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are very welcome additions to the T-mythos. Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is almost not missed here (her fate is nicely handled) and Edward Furlong's John Connor is not missed at all. Arnold is in fine and, sometimes finer, form. Kristanna Loken doesn't have the acting chops of Robert Patrick, but her TX is an advancement over his T1000. Give everybody credit. The tech credits are as good, if not better, than the last 2 Ts. The real surprise is the story and the writing. On close analysis T3 may seem like a rehash or mismash of the T1&amp;2 and it may not make any logical sense. So what? Count the calories in your next pizza and beer combo. Be a buzzkill. All I know is that I cared about the characters and what was happening to them. I was caught up in the story. T3 is as much fun as you'll ever have at movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whew! That was a relief.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was apprehensive going in. Terminator is one of my favorite franchises and sequels always run the risk of turning out *really* bad. Added to the general "sequel worry" was the fact that Cameron was no longer at the helm. I had no idea who Jonathan Mostow nor Kristanna Loken were. Both blew me away.If you like action movies, SEE THIS! There is a chase scene early on that alone makes the movie worth the price of admission. And the action rarely lets up.With Mostow driving, this Terminator is different from T1 and T2. It is assumed that we know the story line by now so most of the time is given to action and, surprisingly, a good amount of humor. Most of the humor is in-jokes reflecting events in the first two.Loken was great! It's so easy to go wrong with a character like the T-X, but she carried it off great. Facial expressions and body language were both excellent.Stahl was fine in the role of John Connor. It wasn't a strength of the movie but the portrayal really didn't hurt it either.Danes was a weak point for me. The Brewster character looked a bit old to have been a junior high make-out partner with Connor. Brewster also seemed confused as to what type of character she was. One moment she grabs guns and mows down opponents, the next she runs about screaming.The requisite "die you bitch!" line near the end is getting old too. Sgt. Ripley saying it in Aliens was cool and on target. Thereafter it's just a poor rehash.Arnold was, of course, Arnold. This is a role made for him and he carried it with the same style as in the first two. Better really, now that his character has been infused with some humor. Arnold *is* this franchise. Make no mistake, even with the humor, these are terminators. They are deadly, and prove it.Overall, fantastic! I went in prepared for the series to go down a notch but hoping it was at least entertaining. It turned out to be better than T1 and only slightly inferior to the legendary T2.7.5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's "back"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzeneggar's back and couldn't be better in "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines". In this 3rd edition of "The Terminator", Arnold, the good cyborg, is sent back again to protect the future savior of humanity John Conner (Nick Stahl) from a female terminator who is much more advanced than Arnold (and yes, the liquid metal stuff is back) In this movie, it starts out differently. John Conner tells us of what we've missed of his life for the past few years. He's the same guy, still messed up. He has no one, just himself, and he works odd jobs and never gets settled down in one place, he is on the run constantly. Also in this movie, it's not Arnold who arrives to the present first, its the Terminatrix, the female terminator, who arrives first in the present day. She does not know who she has to kill yet, but she has a few possible suspects, and she starts to go on a rampage, killing two innocent people, before discovering who her target is. People won't be amazed by the special effects, we've seen them before ("Terminator 2: Judgement Day") and they haven't really changed. However, this is the most destruction in a movie I have ever seen, Lots of explosians, and a good movie debut by Kristanna Loken, who plays the female terminator. Lots of humor, explosians, destruction, good acting, and nice direction make this movie into the perfect summer sequel that should be a box office smash! ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

The Terminator's self-contained humor, was great. Arnie's ability to make fun of himself is always a good thing, as most actors are unwilling, or unable to do this. I could cite a few scenes, but I won't because of some people, like myself, who hate spoilers. I thought the action scenes were good, and as morbid as this may sound, the execution scenes. The explaination of the formation of Skynet was good as well. Acting was excellent. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best action movie this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others, my family and I went to this movie expecting to be disappointed. Instead, we were pleasantly surprised at what turned out to be an excellent story wrapped in some of the most intense action scenes ever filmed. And yes, Arnold is Back. The "professional" reviews have been all over the map on this one, so two words of caution: (1) ignore any review that mentions Arnold's political leanings or ambitions, since they have nothing to do with this film; and (2) dismiss any comment about this being a "failed franchise", cause it ain't so! The worst thing that the current creative team could have done was try to out-do or copy T-2:Judgement Day, so they didn't. Instead they focused on John Connor, now grown up but incredibly paranoid because he doesn't really believe that the future of the world is secure. Turns out he's right. This is not a James Cameron movie, and in hindsight that's a good thing. This film is completely faithful to what's gone before, but takes us in a new direction which forces John Connor (and us) to finally come to terms with his destiny. The cast here is excellent: Claire Danes is exceptional in a role that could have been a drag on the story in less capable hands. And Kristina Lokken as the T-X deserves way more credit that she's getting from some reviewers: I thought she played the role just right, as a cold, heartless killing machine. The fact that she's an attractive female seems to blind some guys to the fact that there have been very few modern films that show its female leads as anything but conflicted, hapless victim. Like Robert Patrick in "T-2" and Arnold himself, this Terminator is ruthless, deadly and totally dedicated to her mission. The film's climax wisely harkens back to the first film by stripping away the T-X's outer "skin" and revealing the mechanical monster underneath. This girl is pure evil, just like she's supposed to be. The ending itself is completely unexpected, but quite good. I won't give it away here, but you'll find out that the story isn't really over yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*************************POSSIBLE SPOILERS*************************I went in to this movie expecting just another sequel, man was I wrong! This movie surpased all of my expectations. The ending was, I think, the best possible ending for the movie, it completely surprised me &amp; I will not forget it any time soon. The car chase after the vet's was better than The Matrix Reloaded's, which was overrated. Arnold did a surprisingly good job at his 3rd time being the Terminator, many of his lines are humorous without being corny. The T-X was pretty cool but the T-1000 would own her any day of the week except on Mondays because that's the day that he gets the nerve endings in his face disabled because that man has THE coldest face I've ever seen. The few scenes of the missiles launching &amp; landing at the end were also very cool &amp;, to me, gave the movie a better sense of being a reality. I highly recommend this movie, it is truly worthy of the Teminator name.Note: You have to see the 1st two movies before you see this one or else you'll get very confused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little reluctant to go see Terminator 3. I figured that it has been over 10 yeaers since T2 and I didn't think that the franchise would be able to support a third movie. I was WRONG. The movie expands on the history of the series and manages to answer that question of "if we destroyed SkyNet, how is there a third movie?" quite well. Arnold does another excellent job of portraying the stony and unemotional T-800, and Kristanna Loken does an amazing job as the new Evil Treminatrix. Of course the fact that she is a beautiful blonds in a sexy outfit does not hurt the movie either. All in all, this is the first good movie of 2003. I went in expecting a good action movie with maybe a little depth too it and T:3 delivered in Spades. The movies starts Fast and never lets you get back into your seat while manageing not to skip the angst of knowing what the future is going to bring and the fear of having to live up to expectations.I give this movie a solid 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a lukewarm fan of the terminator series. I watched the two previous films before seeing T3, and it really struck me that these films are more about hardcore action then a believable plot. Not so with this film. They brought back much of the writing talent from the first Terminator and it definitely shows. People may complain about the lack of blood in this film, but I think it adds a sense of reality and suspense that it would not have otherwise. There are plenty of explosions and action for the less intelligent, but for once these have been put second to good science fiction. I've seen many films that have not managed this mix well. This film pokes fun at its occasional cheesiness so that we know the writers are sure where it's going. This film has a surprise ending which alone is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I was a bit concerned when I strolled into the theatre to see the latest edition to the terminator saga. But only for a minute. The special effects are some of the best yet, and if I'm not mistaken, didn't the previous two set the bar for their time as well? This was an all around fun movie, with as much destruction and stoic one liners as can be crammed into a two hour movie. Whoever missed James Cameron in this film was also to busy reminiscing to perceive how good this movie really is.Granted, T-X was no-where near as sinister as the T-1000, but you were kept wondering up until the last 5 minutes of the movie how they were going to get rid of her. Now, the ending is exactly what I would hope for. A complete twist, slightly predictable, but exactly as I would like it to be. I will say no more for those who haven't seen it yet. I predict that the nay-sayers will keep a few from seeing this movie at first, but once it gets out how great this movie is, it may be one of the biggest action movies ever.</fullReview>

Absolutley!Since this was just released, I'm going to do my best to write a review without giving much of the plot away.On the surface, there's not much new here from T2. Arnold is back to defend John Connor from a shape-shifting terminator. This one's tougher and sexier than Rober Patrick, but that has nothing to do with this positive review... :)First and foremost, I liked how they continued the story. After T2, I wasn't sure how they could extend the existing plotline while remaining believable. I love the set-up for Connor, the new mission for both terminators, the twists along the way, and the revelation at the end.Furthermore, I was impressed with what Nick Stahl did with the part of Connor. He had some pretty cliche lines to deliver from time to time, but his portrayal made me care about him.Jonathon Mostow has a great eye for action sequences, and has done an admirable job at the very unenviable task of following up a James Cameron classic.</fullReview>

I do admit that I would have liked to see the original John and the a return of Sarah Connor, but I have to say that this new cast has got something new and fresh to add to the series. I don't understand this mess about not understanding the plot or the plot does not have the Jim Cameron surprise flare to it. What?!? How can people say this was not surprising?!? Obviously some of the negative critics were not big fans of the other two movies. The plot was just continuing the story with a nice little twist at the end ( I smell a T-4....hmmm...) When leaving the theater,I wasn't sure I liked it much but now, after thinking about all of the different elements brought to the film, I see that T-3 was quite good (It will never be as large as the other two but very very very close in my mind...). I would give it an 8 out of 10. It was exciting, intense, non-stop action. The dialogue gets a little confusing and Ah-nold still doesn't ennunciate his words but I thought the story was really great. Any fan of The Terminator films will like this one. I do recommend it but MAKE SURE YOU SEE THE OTHERS BEFORE YOU SEE THIS ONE! Oh yeah, for those that do not like all the action packed things, there is a lot of classic humor and a small love story that play into the film. The ending is also sad and tear jerking....umm...yeah :-/ ....go and enjoy the film!</fullReview>

Overall T-3 has a excellent script, great acting by all involved, and the ending was excellent, it made sense, and it was like a punch in the gut. I wasn't expecting too much from this movie and i came away with far more than i ever expected. I liked how a little more humor wasincorporated into this one seeing as how we are dealing with such a heavysubject like the end of mankind and I thought the visuals were excellent. the only negative i have is that some of the car chases were a bit excessive butother than that this is a more than fitting installment into this great science fiction series. 10/10</fullReview>

Claire Danes gave a wonderful performance and the guy who played the John Conner character left us feeling just the way we should about John Conner. The F/X were really good and there were creative twists. But forget the 'splosions and think about what's being said. These movies are warning about technology out of control.

		<fullReview>Lets just say like any self-respecting man I am an extreme fan of the terminator films. From the moment I saw Arnold knock on a door and ask "Sarah Connor?" followed by smashing through it and absolutely going to town on her with a gun to make sure the woman died, I knew I had found that edgy sci-fi gold. The Terminator had it all. Action, cat and mouse games, sci-fi, originality, humor, and above all the ability to make you believe in what you were seeing. Then guess what, a few years later a sequal came and blew it away. Terminator 2 still stands as one of my favorite films of all time. It had everything the first had and then some. Emotion, state of the art special effects (which are now the mainstream), and more. I can still watch that movie over and over. It not only stands the test of time, it created the term "Better than the first!!" Now, years later a third terminator film is being released. Believe me, if you're a terminator fan you should be excited as hell. Not worried. I was able to check out the film last night, and before it began I thought to myself, "If there's one thing I hope they don't mess up, please let it be the FEEL of the other two movies." Jonathan Mostow, I applaud you. I was a fan of your work before but I am extremely grateful you kept this franchise together. I love the way you worked in everything. This is as good a sequal as any and it fits in perfectly with the first two. The acting is top-notch, Kristinna Loken stands out as the baddy. Ah-nuld is back in full form, and the rest of the cast is simply amazing as well. Also, this is by far the funniest film of the trilogy. This movie has it all. The best car chase EVER!!! (yes, it blows away the matrix reloaded), the best fight scenes in a long time (I'm sick of every movie, unless it's the matrix franchise, having bullet-time effects and gravity defying kicks), the best story of the three films. It's all here and it's all amazing. I couldn't find one thing I disliked. It's an awesome achievement. It's a fitting sequal. It's a fun ride. It's a thought provoker. It's a Classic.</fullReview>

But I was pleasently suprised at what I saw! Watch Terminator or more importantly T2 (since it seems that most of this Terminator drew from the T2 storyline). Sit back with a big bucket of popcorn and soda and forget your life for two hours. Enjoy it, it was fun and really entertaining if not a bit thought-provoking!I gave it an 8. In reality, I would give it a perfect 7, but since so many people thought it sucked (since they expected it to be as good as T2), I had to overrate it by 1 star!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailer doesn't do the Movie Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations for this film were extremely low. I thought this movie would give Arnold's career a KO, but it didn't happen! When I saw a couple of the trailers for the film, I thought it was going to be a joke. C'mon Arnold playing a "Terminator" at 55 and coming a from heart surgery a few years ago? I mean Arnold is still in great shape but he couldn't possibly pull it off, right? Wrong! Physically, Arnold showed that he could still pull off the action genre. The only area where he looked aged was in his face (slightly receding hairline and receding eyebrows, along with a few wrinkles.) For a 55 year old man, I would pray to look like him.As for the movie, I truly believe it was the second best film in the trilogy. Let's be real, T2 was probably the greatest action film of all time. T3 came very close to surpassing the previous movie. Along with a solid story, great stunts and special effects, I felt that the movie was money well spent! After the bitterness of watching the Matrix: Reloaded, it felt good to see a an action movie with a decent plot. Granted there are moments in the movie where some scenes and characters are hard to believe, but hey it's the movies!My suggestion, go have great time watching a TRUE summer flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, great summer action flick! Seriously!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big independent film fan and love great scripts and great acting...so this opinion, I believe is coming from a credible place.This movie was a lot of fun! Definitely delivered the action, the witty comments and Arn-old was great! It's possibly the loudest movie I've ever seen and there is a good amount of action!Look, if you come into this movie expecting an amazing script and Oscar-calibur performances, wait until November! This is a July 4th weekend, which means fun, no brain, blow-em-up action flick time! It's not too long, not too short, not too slow, mostly good dialogued film! Much, much better than The Hulk! The action is believable (assuming you've seen T2) and the effects are dazzling!I came into this film today expecting it to be really bad with a new John Conner, a new director, a new vision and an aging Ar-nold! But I was pleasently suprised at what I saw! Watch Terminator or more importantly T2 (since it seems that most of this Terminator drew from the T2 storyline). Sit back with a big bucket of popcorn and soda and forget your life for two hours. Enjoy it, it was fun and really entertaining if not a bit thought-provoking!I gave it an 8. In reality, I would give it a perfect 7, but since so many people thought it sucked (since they expected it to be as good as T2), I had to overrate it by 1 star!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some other reviews of T3 (not necessarily here on IMDB) that are not favorable at all. I just don't understand this at all. Being a fan of the original Terminator and T2 I found the third installment appropriate and extremely entertaining. Every movie has it's downspots and this one is no different but on the whole, T3 was a great movie. The plot was good and consistent throughout, the storyline flowed nicely, the action was amazing and the intensity increased as we got deeper and deeper into the environment. Even my wife, who is not particularly a fan of the Terminator films, enjoyed this one. The characters were well developed and, contrary to some reviews, the acting was quite good. There was a story to follow and it keeps you guessing. There are some obvious conclusions that can be made but for every one of those there's also a surprise. The casting was a concern for me until I saw the film and when I left the theatre I was convinced that they made some smart decisions in their actor choices.I would definately recommend T3 to anyone. People who have seen the original and T2 and anyone who has no clue what Terminator is all about. (Although I'm not sure there are many people like that out there) Definately worth the price of admission... more than once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold Delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, just got back from Arnold's new flick, or perhaps it's not only Arnold's: wonderful to see him finally again sharing the screen with other actors. The film truly delivered, it was action packed, yet, unlike the matrix, the action was remarkably realistic (as realistic as you can go with robots from the future). Arnie was in his old form: fewer lines, more punching, and yes he was funny... Almost all of his one-liners worked with the crowed, and yap, a number of times the theater burst out laughing. The plot was strong, and while it wasn't adventurous by having too many side plots, it delivered, and stayed strong through out the movie.Performances were excellent: John Connor (Nick Stahl) was strong and convincing, Arnie was Arnie , and TX (Kristanna Loken) was hot yet managed to stay scary... The only major actor who I was not really positive about was Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) they tried to replace John's mom with a new face, but I think they should have dropped that personality from the story...Special FX were well done, but not over done... They left off from the old T2, and managed to have the same combination of CGI effects and real effect (i.e. explosions) in a very convincing fashion, quiet amazing... However, while T2's effects were groundbreaking, T3's were just plain excellent...Finally the ending sequence and the twist, were unexpected and positive, and in my honest opinion left the crowed very happy.The movie wasn't as smooth as T2, and probably could best be compared to ease of transition to The Transporter and Bourn Identity, the best recent action films I could think of.Overall the film was a surprise, I expected eye candy, and I certainly got it, but the strong preferences and compelling plot elevated it to the top action film in recent memory. So anyone who can enjoy an action film should see this one!8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3 is way sweet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dude, this movie lives up to the Terminator heritage. In every regard, it ups the ante on classic themes and sequences from the last 2 movies. Even without Cameron, the movie has the same end-of-the-world urgency that made the other two better than the sum of their explosions. The same time-travel/ apocalypse ideas remain well intact and properly advanced. The new chick Terminator is highly evolved from the last with several new tricks and gizmos, and Arnold is completely vintage in his deadpan ass-whoopin'. From an action junkie perspective, there are quite a few parts that max out on damage and gunfire. There's plenty of scenes not even hinted at in the trailer, so you will be intrigued by some of the various developments and moments throughout the film. Finally, a true summer blockbuster worth the time and money. 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold is finally back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold defintely returns, not only to the Terminator series, but to good action movies, from a slump of a few years. When I first saw the trailers for this movie I thought it looked like it was going to bomb, and be terrible, especially without Cameron directing it, and Hamilton not returning as Sarah Connor. Then I started hearing good things about it closer to its release, so decided to go see it on it's premiere night. I was amazed, Mostow had pulled it off, a very excellent Terminator movie the lived up to its name. It didn't have as much as a "dark" feel to it as much as the first two, but it did have everything else. The action, the explosions, and Arnie. A couple of scenes did feel like they were remakes from T2, but other than that it was pretty original. The hand-to-hand fighting scenes between the good and bad terminators were off the hook. It was also nice to see some of the machines from the "future wars" to appear in modern day. Some of them didn't look too different from some of the spy planes that the US military are using today, which was kind of creepy. The ending was defintely the icing on the cake, throwing me for a loop, I never expected it to end the way it did. This movie is better than Matrix Reloaded, and quite possibly the best summer action movie of 2003.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations for this film were extremely low. I thought this movie would give Arnold's career a KO, but it didn't happen! When I saw a couple of the trailers for the film, I thought it was going to be a joke. C'mon Arnold playing a "Terminator" at 55 and coming a from heart surgery a few years ago? I mean Arnold is still in great shape but he couldn't possibly pull it off, right? Wrong! Physically, Arnold showed that he could still pull off the action genre. The only area where he looked aged was in his face (slightly receding hairline and receding eyebrows, along with a few wrinkles.) For a 55 year old man, I would pray to look like him.As for the movie, I truly believe it was the second best film in the trilogy. Let's be real, T2 was probably the greatest action film of all time.

		<fullReview>What can I say, action, action, action! I never thought a movie could have so many action sequences. There is never a point in the movie that i was bored or lost. The movie keeps you going and i was on the edge most of the time with the scenes in the movie. I kid you not, take John Woo and Jerry Bruckhemier and put them together for a movie, this is what you'll have. Except....for one thing, one little thing i must mention is the charecter development. There could've been a little more defintion of explaining of the characters, but if you saw the previous two movies, then there's really no need for the development. This is the only thing i can think of that i could mention. Everything else about the movie was great, Arnold look great for being 55+ years old. When you see him, I think he could do another 10 years of action movies. I may sound crazy, but wait till you see him. The female terminator looks great it's amazing what she can do.I hope this helps some peeps out with what to expect from the movie. I thought it was definitly a great movie and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the decline of the Terminator films, but not as bad as reputed and better than the succeeding two films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Terminator is among the best of its genre, and Terminator 2 is bigger, richer and every bit as fantastic a film, one of the few sequels to be as great as its predecessor (Aliens, Godfather Part 2 and the Toy Story sequels are also noteworthy in this regard). Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is certainly better than the two films following it and it is not that bad a film, but it is nowhere near as good as the first two.It is a bit unbalanced, with some misplaced and clumsily written comic relief that really does jars and there's far too much of it, and while the story is cohesive at least it is too more of the same, with in the first half not having anywhere near enough of the suspense and dark atmosphere (pretty predictable in fact), and some of the monologues ramble on too much, a few almost endless.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a visually well-made film with a nice atmosphere with an appropriate darkness to it, it is slickly shot and edited and the special effects while not as stunning as the ones in Terminator 2 are solidly constructed. Jonathan Mostow is no James Cameron, but he does direct competently. There is a pulsating music score that has the right amount of energy and mysterious atmosphere while being too obvious, and while the script is uneven and not expansive enough with the characterisation it at least doesn't sound stilted and doesn't become so stupid that you're bashing your head repeatedly on a wall. Terminator's one liners are as wry as ever.Regarding the action, it is still thrilling and expensive in look with some high-octane chases and well-choreographed action. While the first half drags and is not very well-written, the story really picks up and becomes more diverting with much more of the dark atmosphere as seen before. The cast are good, with Arnold Schwarzenegger coming off best in the title role, imposing, badness and sometimes amusing, while Kristanna Loken is surprisingly and suitably y poised. Claire Danes does a good job with a not so interesting character, and while Nick Stahl underwhelms sometimes , being a little stiff and dull to start with, he is a decent fit and improves dramatically as the film gets better.All in all, not that bad but vastly inferior in quality to the first two films. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Grammar Issues Beware)If you checked out my latest IMDb review of Dracula II:Ascension I know I teased that Christmas Vacation was going to be the next review but I changed my mind to this one but I'll get to that sooner or latter.With big success in The Terminator a even bigger success was created in Terminator 2:Judgement Day so with all this success a Terminator 3 was going to happen regardless or our liking or not and now that we got it I'm happy about it.I fully heartily respect the opinions of others but I think the major drop down in critical success of this film is invalid and is bent up on people's blind admiration of James Cameron's work and not allowing another person to take on the property.Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines starts out with some effective monologue by John Connor himself and then we are given a buffet of terrific scenes with a stylish first courter of the film with the Terminatix killing off the kid throwing the party and the burger point employee.Then the rest of the film transitions to a lot more substance instead of the style of the first courter of the film with a slow bonding between a frightened Katherine Brewster and a confused John Connor of which has matured greatly after the events of T2 I like that element of the film.The film goes on to have awesome action scenes like the shoot out at the Cemetery and at the Skynet branch.The film's main issue is it's bland,dull &amp; almost complete mockery of the Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator as seen in the film but the Terminatix was cool enough to ease the pain of Arnold's painful profromance of which he certainly made up for with his improvement in Genysis.The film has a bleak and awesome ending for a film of this kind of which could've went for the happy cheery ending of T2 but I admire the chance of the ending of this one.Terminator 2 by a technical level is a better made film but in certain elements T3 outshines T2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look Again - There Are Different Levels To This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly don't understand how so many people can claim to dislike Rise of the Machines, so much, and sometimes I wonder if people are attempting to trash this film, just to show how smart and sophisticated they think they are? To begin with, the CGI special effects found in Terminator 3 are superior to those found in the following two films, and if you're not sure about that, all you need to do is compare the sequence in which the Terminatrix flips the big boom truck in Terminator 3, to the school bus accident scene in Terminator 5. In Terminator 3 we get to see paint fall off as sheet-metal buckles, a wheel falls off the truck in slow motion along with the broken wheel studs, and the frame of the boom truck bends and collapses in a completely believable manner. However, in Terminator 5, the school bus appears to inexplicably twirl and pirouette all over the Golden Gate Bridge, as if the laws of physics have somehow magically been repealed, yet at the same time the passenger compartment of the bus seems to ridiculously stay intact as the bus violently flips, and none of the main characters sustain any noteworthy injuries, or are thrown from the bus! One of the other things that also makes Terminator 3 such a great film is the believability of the characters. When the Terminatrix rips the door off of Katheryn Brewster's truck, Claire Danes uses her considerable acting skills to make you believe that she is as terrified out of her mind as a real person would be under those circumstances! (Nothing like that happens in the following films.) Also, in Terminator 3 the character of John Connor is so far from the gruff talking cutout superheroes found in Terminators 4 &amp; 5, that he is actually so overcome with despair twice in the film, that the Terminator must intervene in order to prevent him from killing himself. Nick Stahl does a passable job of portraying John Connor as deep-seated loner with a lot of personal flaws, and the John Connor character found in Terminator 3 in light years beyond the cardboard John Connor character found in Terminators 4 &amp; 5! It's not Shakespeare, but I think that a lot of people are missing important aspects of this film, and while your watching it, pay attention to the physics found in the CGI effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened to John?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just have one really important question for the filmmakers, what happened to John Connor?? In the second film he was only ten but was a really tough smart mouthed one, the fourth film had an adult tough John Connor that was believable that he was the same boy from T2. The third film however, for some strange reason, casted young adult Connor as a whim. Not only did he look nothing like a strong soldier but he also was mentally destroyed, seriously doubt anyone raised like he was raised would be complaining about be worth nothing or giving up on life. Luckily the fourth movie casted Christian Bale and gave Connor his balls back. That was my main problem with T3, besides how they made it the exact same way as the second one. Fell into the typical thought that if a movie was popular a sequel that's exactly the same plot will be an equal hit; most fans of a film series grows tired if they're all the same in thought. Schwarzenegger is once again great at playing everyone's favorite robot, he's the best part of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film. It wasn't as good as the original Terminator film, but it was popcorn entertainment, and for that reason, it was a decent film.So, for the plot: John Conner, played this time by Nick Stahl, now in his early 20's, is living as a drifter, when all of a sudden, he is once again thrown into the world he tried to forget. A Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, has set out to kill John Conner, while the Resistance decides to send another T-101 to protect Conner. Notice how I didn't put who played the T-101? That's because I don't have to tell you, because we all know who it is. So, while there are different elements to the movie, it is kind of similar to the first two films in that a Terminator comes to kill John Conner (or, in the first movie's case, his mother), and someone, or something, also comes from the past to be the hero of the film. Same old, same old, but it's still entertaining.The actors did a good job. Kristanna Loken was quite sexy as the new Terminatrix who sets out to kill John Conner. Claire Danes is along for the ride as Kate who turns out to play an even more important role in the Resistance than even she realizes. Nick Stahl does a decent enough job as Connor, although he probably wouldn't have been my first pick. And, of course, who must come back to play the character we all know the most, but the Governator himself. Arnold's acting is kind of robotic, and while that seems like a bad thing, considering the fact that he does play a robot, it really works in this film.The one thing that makes me rate it lower than the first two films is that there were quite a number of times in which I actually laughed at some of the one-liners. While they were funny, they really shouldn't have been there. It kind of made me wonder why the film was rated R in the first place to tell you the truth. But, some of them were funny, so I won't detract too much points from the film for that reason.The action sequences though were top notch. This is the reason why I watched the film; I don't watch the Transformers movies for the acting because I know I'll be disappointed. The same thing kind of goes for the Terminator films, although the acting here is quite a bit better than that of the Transformers films. It is the action sequences that you want to see here, and so, if you go into this film expecting it to be about acting and dialogue, you might be a little disappointed. But, if you go in with popcorn entertainment on your mind, you won't be disappointed.All in all, though Terminator 3 by no means attains the pinnacle that was the second and the first movie, it is still a refreshing add-on to the Terminator franchise. An 8/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rise of the Machines" delivered exactly what I expected.It's almost impossible to top the masterpiece that "Judgment Day" represents. The 1991 film has one of the most complex, intelligent, and interesting plots of all time."Terminator III" is half popcorn fun and half tries to continue with the Terminator legacy.There's plenty of extremely good action (all about the vehicles chase and the cemetery confrontation), nice humor (Arnie hasn't lost it!), good acting, and it gives a continuation to the Terminator saga. Die hard fans should be pleased and not try to compare it to part 1 and 2.Sure, it's less complex and sacrifices the complex plot for entertainment, but still it's filled of interesting sequences that will remind you it's a Terminator movie.Arnold is fine on his role. He still knows that it takes to be the Terminator. I didn't buy Nick Stahl's performance. I mean, I don't think John Connor should be represented as an anxious young man who barely demonstrates character. Come on! He's the leader of the resistance! Claire Danes is extremely beautiful and I liked the way her character's life changed all of a sudden in such a bizarre manner. Kristanna Lokken was creepy, effective, sexy as the Terminatrix. Excellent idea! The Direction is great. Pure candy for the eye with dynamic camera angles and a stylish look on it. It captures perfectly the whole machines rebellion.The f/x are spectacular, impressive at some points. Oh money can buy happiness in cinema! The art direction and cinematography is really good but at some points it doesn't feels like a Terminator movie.Still it's a very good addition to the series. We can see the Terminator saga like this: the original that broke standards and started a tendency, the masterpiece that Judgment Day represents, and the pop corn Terminator blockbuster era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Arnold Schwarzenegger destroyed the liquid metal T-1000 at the end of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," the world breathed a collective sigh of relief. Then the monster box-office takings came in and it was decided that SkyNet was far from finished. In "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," those crafty old machines try a different tack. Brawn had its chance to kill Sarah and John Connor and blew it. This time SkyNet send back a villainous creation that will use feminine wiles; the T-X or Terminatrix.The T-X is embodied in the luscious form of Kristanna Loken. Some people had problems with her performance, but she does okay and she's very easy on the eye. Her abilities are good too, she squeals like a fax machine to hack in to the L.A. school computer and track down John Connor and his future lieutenants, she can inflate her chest at will to get out of a traffic fine (and what woman wouldn't love THAT?) and she can go toe-to-toe with Arnold in a scrap (she even emasculates his power by grabbing his testicles which is Arnold's cue to deliver a puzzled expression before she hurls him through the air). She also has an arm that can turn into a laser gun/flamethrower.Her nemesis is also sent back through time and it is our old friend/enemy Arnold Schwarzenegger as a seriously outclassed T-800. Arnie was 56 when he made this film and he had undergone heart valve replacement surgery, so his excellent physical conditioning is remarkable.Arnold, as in the other Terminator movies, arrives back in our time naked. So he heads to the nearest venue to acquire clothes: a strip club. However, this sequence goes too far into comedy, having Arnold demand the clothes of an effeminate male stripper and having him wear silly sunglasses for cheap laughs (his "talk to the hand" catchphrase is sooo late-90s and was already out of date by 2003). Also the forced appearance of Doctor Silberman after the graveyard shootout is a laboured joke and a sop to the fans that doesn't really work.Nick Stahl plays John Connor and he goes through the whole movie looking like he's about to wet his pants. He didn't have the range as an actor to do justice to the role of John Connor (and he was totally unconvincing as an old John Connor in the future war sequence!) What a pity Edward Furlong blew the gig with his drug problems. He was perfect casting for Connor and had a good rapport with Schwarzenegger on screen. Linda Hamilton is sorely missed too.The special effects look slightly ropey because James Cameron isn't calling the shots and pushing for perfection on this one. He would never have accepted the shots of the Hunter-Killers in the future war sequence, they look like something out of a video game. The script also suffers because Cameron isn't involved. The Terminator came to him in a nightmare, so it is his vision he was following completely. He knew exactly how the Terminator universe should look and he really cared about the characters. Other directors in the Terminator series are really just hacks for hire, using the franchise to get a leg up they don't deserve.There are good things about T3; the crane chase, the Terminator tricking John Connor and Kate Brewster into saving themselves and the apocalyptic ending as seen from space which is awesome and unexpected. The protagonists in the other Terminator movies always managed to avert Judgment Day and it was a shock for audiences to see the heroes fail and for the world to be destroyed.The Terminator is such a good story that it would be hard to screw it up. Even Terminator Salvation had flashes of brilliance (only flashes mind!). "Terminator 3" looks better now than it did when it came out. Many prefer it to "Terminator Salvation" as it has things that movie doesn't; a real Arnold, time travel and street battles in a present-day setting. Essentially, it is the end of a trilogy that James Cameron started back in 1984 (Salvation would abandon the structure, main setting and noir look of Cameron's movies). It was also the beginning of the end of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career before he became Governor of California.The action sequences are the best thing about T3. Even though the special effects look a bit ropey and there is hardly any future war in this one, it's still a fast-paced, watchable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 2 was the end to the series. Or so we all thought it was. I can remember as a kid wanting to have a Terminator 3 just because I was so fond of this series. Next thing I know, I enter my first year of college and my wish is granted! Now, people don't like this because of the weak dialog, the contradictions of "no fate.." and other items. As for me, I liked this film as it was a great action film. It also continues the story and it was right to the point. The only thing I knock this movie for is how the story was told. Mostow only scratched the surface with the script and I felt like he needed to have things explained through the character interactions more. Yeah, Robert Brewster runs Skynet. However, Mostow should've had the T 101 explain this as it would have convinced people by shedding some light on the whole story.This film is under-appreciated. The ending is great and now I want Terminator 4 to come out!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audacious adrenaline-laced action sequences, a resolute refusal to take itself seriously, and a surprise finale help the new apocalyptic Arnold Schwarzenegger science fiction epic "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" overcome its flat, formulaic, road show plot with its loquacious pseudo-scientific gobbledygook. No, director Jonathan Mostow's "T-3" doesn't top James Cameron's 1991 classic "Terminator 2: Judgment Day." Although "T-3" lacks the narrative depth and complexity of "T-2," this $170 million sequel based on Cameron's characters boasts more than enough muscle, mayhem, and momentum to make it worth watching though not altogether memorable. Mostow, who directed the W. W. II submarine saga "U-571" and the Kurt Russell wife-napping nail-biter "Breakdown,"calls the shots this time and acquits himself well enough, considering how shallow the John Brancato &amp; Michael Ferris screenplay remains throughout its lean, mean 109 minute running time. Aside from brawny Arnold Schwarzenegger as the protagonist, Earl Boen as Dr. Silverman qualifies as the only holdover from previous "Terminator" movies. Warner Brothers dumped Edward Furlong, whose real-life drunken antics cost him the John Connor role, and the studio replaced him with brooding-looking Nick Stahl of "Bully" and "In The Bedroom." Unfortunately, Stahl lacks any kind of charisma and he shares no chemistry with Claire Danes. For the record, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor has taken the long hike, too.The nuts and bolts John Brancato &amp; Michael Ferris screenplay (their credits include "The Game" and "The Net") picks up the plot about 10 years after "T-2." Leukemia has claimed Sarah Connor's life, and her grown-up son John (Nick Stahl) struggles to blend into the background and lives life "off the grid." He suspects that the future still holds something sinister for him, and he's right. As in "T-2," "T-3" opens with a new Terminator, this time a Terminatrix, the T-X (svelte-looking super model Kristanna Loken of "Academy Boyz"), stalking not only him but also those slated to act as his future lieutenants. Clearly, Mostow and his scribes must have seen Lara Flynn Boyle's mutant bug villainess in "Men In Black 2" and liked the idea. Like Robert Patrick's Terminator in "T-2," this Terminatrix sports a new generation of liquid-metal skin as well as a lethal limb that she can turn into a plasma cannon, stiletto probe and power saw. As villainess go, this bombshell robo-babe is truly bad to the bone! She can crank up parked cars from afar and send them careening off down the road as if they were remote control toys. And she is not out to take prisoners either! This Terminatrix gives new meaning to stereotype about reckless women drivers in an early chase scene when she hijacks a gigantic construction crane truck and demolishes half of Los Angeles trying to run down John Connor. One of those lieutenants on her hit list is mild-mannered veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes of "Brokedown Palace"). It seems that Kate and John shared a romantic moment together back in their high school days. Actually, it was the day before John's foster parents were mysteriously murdered and he vanished without a trace. The coincidences get even better. Now, it also seems that Kate's papa is a three-star general in charge of Skynet, an ultra-sophisticated computerized defense system which eventually out-smarts mankind and sends machines out to kill, kill, kill. No sooner has the action in "T-3" unfolded than things go on the Fritz. Least we not forget, in the middle of all this madness, another Terminator shows up in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger. No, not the same one who died at the end of "T-2," but he is just as obsolete as his earlier incarnation compared with the new Terminator. Nevertheless, Arnold makes life difficult for the Terminatrix. Kristanna Loken makes a terrific Terminatrix, too."Terminator 3: Rise of the Machine" ranks as one of the most physically exhausting movies you'll see. You'll feel bruised and battered, especially after the battle between the two cyborgs in the bathroom. When was the last time you saw somebody tear an entire urinal out of the wall and smash somebody over the head with it? One of my favorite scenes occurred in the police cruiser when the Terminatrix --masquerading as Scott Mason?shoves her fist through the detective's chest and drives the car. Sadly, "T-3" doesn't provide Arnold with near enough clever one-liners as he had as either "Terminator" (1984) or "T-2," but "T-3" still packs a hugely entertaining punch. Arnold's favorite like is "Talk to the hand." Mostow stages a memorable entrance for Arnold. He saunters into a bar during ladies night without a stitch on and insists that the male stripper give him all his clothes. The firefight at Greenlawn Cementery is interesting, too. When Arnold emerges from the crypt carrying the casket like a stick on his shoulder, the image reminded me of the Spaghetti western hero named Django who drags a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Incidentally, Arnold is toting not only firearms but also John Connor. The worst thing you can say about "T-3" is that it is a high-octane, swiftly-paced, straightforward melodrama with little of its predecessor's wit and wisdom. On the other hand, if you relish break-neck action movies with a high quota of slam-bang auto crashes, trigger-happy shoot-outs, and an over-the-top, face-to-face confrontation between two larger-than-life cyborgs titans, you should catch "T-3" on the big-screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 was a positive surprise for me. It has all the essential hard-hitting action and narrative of the first two movies, but does away with the unnecessary emotionalism of the second. Terminator 3 is like T2 with more serious intent. I was particularly happy to see Arnold return to the role where he is ultimately at his best. Additionally the movie introduces a new cast of characters which manages to bring a truly more human element into the film. Additionally the action-sequences, while somewhat over-sized still keep you interested in the movie.What was also a noticeable improvement over the last film is the emphasis on the story which progresses in an admirable but not a hectic pace. Also comedy evens out the film so that it doesn't turn into a monotonous experience. The films visual effects are also magnificent.In some aspects the film will never be as classic as the Jim Cameron original. The soundtrack seems to have receded and I can't say I was attracted to the film's score. This is a bit of bummer since the film is otherwise so excellent. Particularly what I was happy with was the fact that we finally saw what the second movie should have shown us: Judgement Day. The film's climax is the ultimate pay-off to a fan such as me. Terminator 3 brings the glory back into the series even if it can never compete with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Risible machines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People often complain that Terminator 2 was too kid-friendly ? there were too many lame attempts at humour. Well, I've never had a problem with T2, preferring it to the original, but with Rise of the Machines the franchise goes too far. The most gut-wrenchingly awful bit has to be the infamous "talk to da hand" scene. What the hell? The Terminator should have smashed the teller's head into the counter, not sassed him.And the scene that inspires this response is just as bad ? the scene where a naked Arnie (still looking buff and questioning straight men's sexuality) walks into a club and gets 'dissed' by an exceedingly camp stripper. "Woah, bitch, wait your turn," the imbecile says. And then when Arnie asks for his clothes we get the "talk to the hand" line. I don't care how deeply Edward Furlong annoyed you, or how hard you laughed when Arnie tried to express machine emotions, it's nowhere near as bad the series becoming like something you'd see on Ricki Lake.Plus the stripping scene hits the nail far too hard on the head. Yes, we know that as much as he loves groping young ladies, Arnie is overwhelmingly gay, but the homosexuality present in his films should be less overt ? where's the fun if it's handed to you on a plate? Commando certainly wouldn't have warranted repeated viewings or extended analysis if there'd been a scene where Bennett had caressed Matrix's toned ass. And then to further confound matters, there's a moment when, dressed like a leather daddy, Arnie puts on some Elton John sunglasses as 'Macho Man' plays in the background. The Terminator has become a laughing stock.But this moment isn't a one off. At quite a few different points in time, Arnie seems to be sending himself and the film up. There's one bit where he's driving John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) to safety and he tells Danes to "shut up". But the line delivery is tongue in cheek. Who knew that machines could be knowingly mischievous? Another awful moment is when Arnie insists that he's not a robot but a cybernetic organism. Yay, the Terminator is PC now as well. (Next we'll probably get a black Terminator who insists he's a 'cybernetic organism of colour'.) And yet another indignity Arnie has to face is when his system gets corrupted by the TX. He has to enter the William Shatner school of acting ? writhing in pain as he fights against himself. It's a pretty lousy scene.Not fairing any better is the TX ? or the Terminatrix (vomit). She doesn't have the menace of the T-1000, plus she has a goofy machine arm that can spew flames and laser bolts. It's incredibly silly. And while Robert Patrick looked cold as ice and completely insane, Kristanna Loken looks like a bland, mildly bored fashionista ? Patrick subverted the image of a cop, while Loken gets to wear flairs and high heels.Another detail that illustrates how lacklustre Loken's performance is is the way she tilts her head when she controls other machines with her gnarly powers. This cliché has been worn to death. It's something you'd expect to see on a bad TV show, not a massive blockbuster. And although Loken gets to kill children and shoot people in the face, with one notable exception, all her slayings are rather dull. They lack flair. However, at least the exception makes up for it somewhat ? in her only decent killing, the TX rams her fist through a man's chest and drives the car from the back seat; nice! But this aside, the action is rather disappointing. Even the much lauded crane chase fails to get the blood pumping ? it certainly pales in comparison to the storm drain chase in T2. And the TX/T-101 fight is a poor imitation of the fight at the end of Judgment Day and the shootout in the graveyard is a second rate version of the similar scene at the Cyberdyne offices. It just doesn't have the same intensity. And while part of this is due to the fact that the film's too light-hearted, it's also because the film desperately misses Brad Fiedel's score ? the music is completely anonymous.Another problem is that there's far too much obvious CGI. Just take the fight between the T-101 and the TX in the toilets. There are far too many moments when you can clearly see that it's badly rendered computer models that are getting thrown about. It takes you out of the film. And speaking of CGI, why is it that the effects in T2 look so much better than the ones here? The damage that the TX takes isn't as convincing as the hits that the T-1000 takes, the brief glimpse that we get of the endoskeletons are crap and Skynet's vehicles and weaponry are awful. Maybe it's because T2, as pioneering as it was in its use of CGI, used a lot of physical effects too. Here you just feel that the filmmakers have got lazy. (By the way, what's with those crappy pot-bellied tank things? Whoever designed them should hang their head in shame.) About the only thing that works in the film is the ending. It's much better than it has any right to be. But it doesn't erase the crap that comes before it. Rise of the Machines is a poor film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of action and high-tech gadgets, Terminator 3 is very enjoyable - a worthy addition to the Terminator trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 was very enjoyable - it was just like its two predecessors except more modern, high-tech, and with a far bigger budget. Instead of just being a high-tech action flick which forgot entirely about the Terminator plot and only had the characters and situations it invented (and no new scenarios), this film continues the Terminator legacy with a new character (the T-X, who is female and far more high-tech than Arnie), a new plot and the promise of a rather uncertain future for John Connor. It isn't a classic and certainly not the most critically well-received of the Terminators, but it manages to bring the golden oldies into the 21st century and make over $400 million in the process.I have to say this - I enjoyed it. Big explosions, exploding cars and robots and guns (and anything to do with action) are certainly my thing, and this film had no shortage of them. The superbly high-tech T-X was rather squarely acted, but she had cunning and villainy and was a hugely menacing villain. The Terminator himself becomes an ally of John Connor this time round (which most people certainly weren't predicting), and he sacrifices himself to let John Connor and Katherine Brewster live - he is the main hero this time. The ending is surprisingly powerful and meaningful, and ensures that this film is more than just standard action fare - it is part of the Terminator series in its own right and deserves to be remembered as a part of this monumental film legacy.On the whole - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't going to be remembered as a classic, but bad robots, cunning villains and so-called "vital to the Earth" human characters ensure that this film is a Terminator. Explosions and death galore - this is hugely enjoyable. Spiffing! 8/10</fullReview>

We need to overlook some logical mistakes, and then we have here a good film and blockbuster for summer night. There are many actions such as scene with the fire department-car, these are one of the main parts of the film. The plot-line is only support for the show. Regarding actors, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes are average, Arnie plays his standard (like the old times :) and Kristanna Loken as marvelous T-X didn't need some special acting, she did empty face good :). So if you don't have big demands, you will not be disappointed..BTW Kristanna Loken is very cute :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forced to Give It a 9</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*May Contain Spoilers* Okay, on with the review. I find myself compelled to give this movie a 9 for the things I did like in it. I didn't care for the humor attempts in the movie, like Arnold telling the gas station attendant to talk to the hand or whatever, or when he put on those star-sunglasses in the beginning. I think these movies should remain serious, and shouldn't be tainted with stupid humor, but that's just my opinion. Outside of this, I thought the female terminator could have (and should have) been a lot more attractive. Further, I wished that the actor who played John Connor in T2 was used again to make T3. The new guy just couldn't replace the old John Connor (not that the new guy's performance was THAT bad, its just he can't replace the original). The other thing I didn't really care for that comes to mind was how quick the new T-100 terminator got his sass mouth. The old terminator was much more serious, and had to be coached by the then-young John Connor before he picked up his attitude. The T-100 seemed to do this with very little if any provocation whatsoever from John or John's spouse. Aside from that, sex would be good.. between John and his spouse, and it didn't happen. It shouldn't be raunchy or distasteful, but should be passionate and emotional - and done in a way to further the film. Aside from all these shortcomings I saw in the film, (I kind of think there were more I am forgetting), I have to rate this a 9 because it wasn't a non-enjoyable movie, and there were some qualities that I liked to it, such as the twilightzone-like thoughts that come to mind when one thinks about time travel and all the wondefully interesting ideas to play around with that seem to follow the subject around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the first two terminator films I couldn't wait to see the third installment in the franchise that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a hit. T3 lives up to the reputation of the previous movies with more special effects and action sequences than before.10 years have passed since John Connor (Stahl) helped to blow up Cyberdyne Systems and stop judgment day now 23 years old he lives a quiet existence, no credit cards, phone, address or home. He is trying to escape the future and his destiny meanwhile a new terminator called the T-X (Loken) has been sent to eliminate his lieutenants including Kate Brewster (Danes) who will be an important part of the resistance and later become John's wife. But another terminator called the T-850 (Schwarzenegger) has also arrived to protect both John &amp; Kate and ensure their survival. However the terminator informs him that judgment day wasn't stopped and the inevitable will happen , the T-X is also after Kate's father Robert Brewster(Andrews) the original creator of Skynet that's the virus that's infected everything from computers to satellites and when the machines take control chaos follows. Nick Stahl's performance as John Connor was both electrifying and good. Linda Hamilton's replacement Claire Danes delivered a stunning and fearless performance as a future warrior 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awkward But Fun Twist To The Terminator Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time a movie series reaches its third installment the series is considered a disgrace because of the most recent addition. While some fans of the Terminator movies would like to ignore what Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has to say it's still an exciting watch.Unlike the previous Terminator films, T3 puts the focus on big-bang action scenes rather than storytelling. In the regard of its action, T3 is a real thrill ride. From the opening sequence revealing a short but impressive look at the nuclear war to the inevitability set for Judgment Day, T3 serves up a good pace of tension-filled and occasionally humorous action. Not only do these scenes make T3 worth watching multiple times but it also gives the movie the extra points it needs to be above-average, and even a great movie.However, T3 makes compromises a strong story for these impressive action scenes. This will immediately turn Terminator fans off as the previous Terminator films were smart and took the time to develop a strong storyline. While the plot in T3 isn't necessarily bad, it makes a big mistake right from the beginning: Being made in the first place. Since T3 was made it was inevitable that the producers intended for Judgment Day to still happen, it makes the costly choice of taking T2's excellent ending, laughing in its face and tossing it away.With that, T3 is, on paper-a typical action flick with a mixed up plot tossed in. While the idea of making the ending of T2 pointless by its own rules is a big mistake, T3 still comes out strongly for what it is. This is one of the sci-fi movies that comes out as an exception to the standard that action-focused movies suck. Part of this is because that it still holds on to the formula of Judgment Day set by the first Terminator. But this rattles the viewers as T3 teases us with the idea of another Terminator movie that, if made, would be the real Judgment Day movie.So all things considered, T3 isn't a bad movie. In fact, it's actually a great movie as it has some cool and awesome action and does stay true to the original Terminator formula. Just that T3 makes the risk of even being released by toying with T2's ending about stopping Judgment Day that it loses points. Otherwise, T3 is a movie that regular Terminator fans will more than likely enjoy for what it's worth and under the flow movie sequels usually follow.</fullReview>

This third installment Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one heck of a lot smarter than the second film and maybe just as smart as the first, it is much funnier and the acting is better than I thought was possible with Arnold Swchartzenegger(Or how ever you spell it) in a lead roll. It may not by quite as fun as the original but it passes up the second. The screenplay has much wittier dialogue than the films before and the characters are better developed. The direction isn't James Cameron but is still quite good. The visual effects are some of the best I have ever seen, they are fantastic. A lot better than I could have hoped for, watch it.

		<fullReview>I have to say that I was not expecting a great movie with T3 "Rise of the Machines". I was biased, thinking James Cameron was necessary to make it a success, but I was wrong. The Terminator Story has taken a life of its own! It has evolved from the simple story-line of a single terminator trying to kill Sarah Connor to Skynet trying to kill all human life. It is huge and the potential is vast. Arnold Schwarzenegger's presence on screen was incredible. For 55 years old, he is in excellent shape. I highly recommend this movie to folks like me who don't think any movie can top T1 and T2. This movie isn't meant to top it, just continue it, and it does that very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awe. SOME. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday, my friend and I were discussing how bad "T3" was going to be. "Just a shameless chance to make money off a dead franchise," we said. "One more cog in Hollywood's sucky-sequel routine." Of course, being "Terminator" fans, we knew we were going to go see it anyway, good or bad. So tonight, I sat down, leaned back, and waited to be bored.Instead, I was totally blown away."T3: Rise of the Machines" picks up the story of John Connor (Nick Stahl), the protagonist of "T2" and the future savior of mankind. Immediately, from the first words of the film, I knew I was in for something more than just another action movie; another "shameless" plug for a "dead franchise." Rather than taking the usual Hollywood route and placing John in a high profile career - lawyer, doctor, car salesman - "T3" reveals that John is a drifter, aware of his destiny and unconvinced that he is really as safe as we were all led to believe at the end of "T2." Naturally, since this is the third movie and we're only two minutes into the film, we know that he's correct - he isn't safe. Something is going to happen to make John Connor realize his destiny, or else put it to rest entirely.That something is the T-X (Kristanna Loken)- aka the Terminatrix - a state-of-the-art Terminator sent from the future (once again) to destroy John Connor, but with an added twist: she's there to kill his lieutenants as well. All and any who are an aid to John in his future battle against the machines have become targets, including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a girl John knew as a child. Helping to protect John and Kate from the T-X is the inimitable T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a carbon copy of the Terminators that tried to murder Sarah Connor in the original film, and then went on to save her and John in "T2."Nick Stahl turns in a touching and nuanced performance as John Connor. He doesn't want to accept his destiny, but when it rears its ugly head, he falls into the role of hero with ease and aplomb - you can see the emerging leader he will become. Claire Danes, as always, is believable as the spunky but flustered Kate, who spends half the movie believing she's been kidnapped. Arnold Schwarzenegger brings the T-800 to life with the same complexity as in "T2," giving touches of humor throughout the film that sound perfectly natural coming from the unemotional machine. Kristanna Loken is the only weak part of the film - she tries too hard to be a carbon copy of Robert Patrick's menacing T1000 from "T2," and ends up looking like a bad Lara Croft impersonator, scowling under her eyebrows throughout most of her scenes. Whereas Patrick was gifted with a lean body, chiseled features, and bone-chilling, serial killer eyes that made you BELIEVE he could kick Arnold around like a rag doll, it's difficult to imagine this slip of a girl even being able to give him a papercut.Luckily for us, the T-X seems almost an afterthought throughout the film. Most of the storyline is focused around the trio of Stahl, Danes and Schwarzenegger, as they struggle to stop Skynet from becoming self-aware and destroying the planet. But before you start thinking this movie is too cerebral, rest assured, the pacing is fast and furious, full of enough gunfire, explosions and insane car chases to make your eyes boggle. One particular chase scene close to the beginning of the movie - which appears to leave half of Los Angeles in a pile of rubble - is breathtaking in its intensity. It's like the world's worst early morning rush hour traffic, where every other car on the road is LITERALLY out to get you.This movie is rated R for a reason, and that reason is BLOOD. But the violence is given a Hitchcockian twist - a spatter of blood across a picture frame while the sound of a dentist's drill whirs in the background. Your imagination is enough to make you shudder or jump in your seat - director Jonathan Mostow doesn't feel the need to swamp the screen with wanton violence. So while the body count is on a par with the first two films, it doesn't FEEL so violent.I also appreciated the fact that they didn't feel the need to indulge in unnecessary "cheese cake" when the T-X first arrived on the scene. Yes, this film has an R-rating, and yes, the primary audience is going to be young men, ages 18-34, so I was expecting full frontal nudity. But the entrance of T-X is tastefully done, with strategically positioned shadows hiding the "naughty bits." I think Arnold gets to flash more skin than Ms. Loken!Most fun of all, this movie isn't afraid to poke fun at itself and its predecessors. There are moments throughout the film that hint back to events in the previous movies with a tongue-in-cheek playfulness, such as a recurring gag involving the T-800's sunglasses, made so famous in "T2." These humorous moments don't detract from the film - they add to it, by reminding the audience of just why they love the series so much. More than once, the entire theater was laughing or clapping at what was going on onscreen, and you can't ask for better response than that at a movie like this."T3" is just... phenomenal. It's hard to put into words just what is so GOOD about it. All I can say is, if you'd asked me yesterday if I wanted to see a "T4," I would have given you an uncategorical, "NO!" But today, as I sit here, if you were to ask me the exact same question, I'd stare at you and say, "What, you mean you DON'T?" It's THAT good, folks. It turned this cynic into a believer, and it didn't even break a sweat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Worthy Sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Terminator was great, the second was even better, and of course, twelve years later, I had my reservations about this installment of the series. My reservations are now laid to rest.Terminator is an amazing movie from start to finish, blending seamlessly traditional action, stunts, and fine elements of CGI which many times, you don't even notice is there. It successfully advances the plot to new areas, and raises interesting questions, while holding true to the many one liners the series is known for. Add to this a hot new terminator who can make her chest grow at will and get it on with the old T-800 in a bathroom, and you've got a good time on your hands.Terminator 3 gets better as it progresses until it ends with a climactic ending which is both incredible, and shocking. The series can only get better from here, and I have no doubt that the next installment will bring a whole new light to where it's going from here. If I have only one question to raise about this movie, it's where the 175 million dollars went... besides Arnold's pocket that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall a let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for T3 I must admit I was excited, judging by the special effects and the action scenes I thought that this would be a good addition to the series.However after watching the film I must admit I felt overall let down, the film just like Arnie felt old. Majority of the action scenes were good but the film just lacked something, when compared to T2. Even though T2 was made many years earlier the special effects still looked better then this film (except the one scene with Arnie at the end), and also it lacked the darkness, and suspense of the previous films I felt one of the biggest criticism of the film was that the t101 was completely out classed by the new terminator and so you really felt that in every action scene they were going to loose. At least in T2 you felt Arnie had a chance but there was never that feeling in this film. I do realise to some people this might be stupid but the confrontation between the new terminator and Arnie just felt wrong because we all knew Arnie was going to have his a** kicked Also even though Arnie had worked out to get into shape for this film he still looked to clunky and slow (if you can understand that) and I think that made the film less enjoyable overall. You never really felt that Arnie was a terminator just a out dated machine, in T2 Arnie looked (excuse the expression) cool, the scene where he was on the motorbike shooting at the T1000 was awesome but there were no such scenes in this film.Having a female as the terminator was also wrong, it did not feel right in this film There was also to much humour in this film (probably to give the 12a rating) and that was completely unnecessary, who on earth thought that putting Arnie in purple star shaped sunglasses was a good idea!!!!!!!!!! This really did ruin the film because you could never take Arnie seriously after that John Conner was poor as well, in T2 he showed courage and leadership but here he just looked like a wimp you never really believed that this person could be the saviour of humanity, I don't believe this was the actors fault more the direction of the film that made him into this charhachter I do realise I have criticised this film considerably but it's just after seeing T2 and how awesome that was this film did not even come close, however as a stand alone film it is good but if compared to the previous films it then just looks old and outdated</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First it was "I'll be back." Then it was "Austa La Vista, Baby" And now our generation it's "Talk to the hand" Interesting. To be honest I thought they couldn't do it. But I was impressed. The plot made sense. A couple questions here and there. Arnold again? No, uh uh. How many terminators are there that look like Arnold? And he's lost his edge. It's getting kind of scary that he keeps on trying to act cool. For the T-X(can't remember her name), she did a good job considering what parts she was against. No one can compare to Robert Patrick's performance. But she did have a sinister edge. John Conor(can't remember his name), was alright. I couldn't really get into his charactor as much as I did with Eddie's performance in the 2nd terminator. And Claire Danes!? Eww. She's a horrible actress. I didn't mind her too much. But her character was kind of out of the plot. She didn't really fit too well with the trilogy.Nice touch with Dr. Sylberman. I did miss Sarah Conor. But I don't blame Linda for turning it down.over all 6/10. Good movie, just doesn't go too well with the trilogy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines starts in Beverley Hills as a morphing killing machine named the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is transported back from the future, meanwhile in a desert not fat away another killer android named the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) also arrives from the future. They are both in search of future resistance leader &amp; the saviour of mankind John Connor (Nick Stahl), the T-X has orders to kill him while the T-800 has orders to protect him. John himself breaks into a vet's clinic to steal drugs &amp; is found by Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the two become the center of a battle between the Terminator's as one wants them dead &amp; the other not. Then John learns that the threat of Skynet has not been stopped, merely postponed &amp; with the new Judgement Day fast approaching he decides to try &amp; prevent it, again.This American, German &amp; British co-production was directed by Jonathan Mostow (apparently with the likes of Ang Lee, Ridley Scott &amp; James Cameron being asked but turning it down) &amp; is obviously the second sequel to James Cameron's superb sci-fi action hit The Terminator (1984), Cameron himself also wrote &amp; directed the sequel Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) which is quite simply one of the greatest films ever, period. So with two such illustrious predecessors that quite rightly consider solid gold classics how does Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines hold up? Well the script takes the basic concept from Terminator 2: Judgement Day &amp; goes with that, two Terminators sent back from the future, one to protect Connor the other to kill him, Connor trying to destroy Skynet &amp; prevent Judgement Day from ever happening &amp; a parade of big budget set-piece action scenes. Compared to the first two terminator film Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't as good but I still found it enjoyable in it's own right &amp; competing against two of the best films of all time is pretty difficult to do anyway. The makers seem to have changed the character of John Connor &amp; what he was about, from a rebellious &amp; resourceful youngster to a bit of a bland loser, the two Terminator's aren't played as emotionless androids either with both spouting various one-liners &amp; making faces which is alright but doesn't seem right &amp; while the story is fine it's nothing more than a rehash of ideas from the first two &amp; doesn't take the franchise forward at all &amp; by comparison to Cameron's films this is a little soulless. Having said that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines entertained me no end, I loved the new female Terminator (even though she feels like a gimmick), it moves along like a rocket &amp; there are some terrific action set-pieces including an amazing car chase involving a huge crane. There are loads of explosions, fights, shoot-outs, car chases, pure wanton destruction &amp; cool effects to keep me happy anyway. Sure Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't the greatest film ever plot wise but there's enough going on elsewhere to enjoy to make this well worth a watch in my opinion.The CGI computer effects are good &amp; there are some terrific action sequences which is where Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines excels. The crane chase is a real stand-out moment &amp; one of my all time favourite car chases featuring lots of explosions, outrageous stunts &amp; general vehicular mayhem on a grand scale. Despite an 'R' rating in the US this got away with a '12' here in the UK &amp; it does feel a little bit family friendly with the absolute minimum of violence shown which may not be a problem to most but I am a bit of a violence junkie &amp; I missed it since we got violence in spades in the first two. While not as menacing as either Scwarzenegger from the first or Robert Partick from the second film Kristanna Locken is hot &amp; looks totally gorgeous in her red leather catsuit, OK so I'm a shallow male what can I say? I loved any scene she was in &amp; she has a real sexy &amp; dangerous femininity about her although her special powers aren't that much of a step forward from those seen in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. There are nods &amp; gags to the original two films that seem a little forced but are quite fun from Arnie's sunglasses to an amusing cameo by Earl Bohen reprising his role as Dr. Silberman.With a supposed budget of $170,000,000 you can see where the money went with virtual non stop action &amp; flashy CGI effects, you certainly get your money's worth here. The film is well made but doesn't have Cameron's cold &amp; stylish look &amp; I really missed Brad Fiedel's stirring music that has been replaced by a much more forgettable &amp; generic sounding soundtrack. The acting is alright, Schwarzenegger is OK, Stahl is bland, Danes is alright after having replaced Sophia Bush at short notice after a few days filming while Kristanna Locken was cast for her looks &amp; excels in that department at least.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was never going to exceed it's predecessors which in my (&amp; many other's) humble opinion are two of the greatest films ever made but for what it is I really enjoyed it. So sue me. The telly series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008 - 2009) totally ignores the events of this while a fourth film Terminator Salvation (2009) has just opened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Terminator franchise is turning in its grave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doesn't James Cameron's masterpiece, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, have a perfect ending? John, Sarah, and the Terminator manage to prevent Judgment Day by destroying Cyberdyne Systems and melting all the evidence that a Terminator ever existed. There's no way humanity will have to suffer through this war, right? WRONG! According to the professional idiots at Hollywood, Judgment Day is inevitable. Because without Judgment Day, there can be no sequels.Well, the T-101 is back to promote his campaign for Governor! And the memorable characters you fell in love with from the previous installments are?! Well, Sarah Connor's dead. Damn, that's a disappointment. Well, at least we've got Edward Furlong and? no, wait. He's not in it. They replaced him with Nick Stahl. Well, Earl Boen's back as Dr. Peter Silberman! Funny? I didn't remember him being in the third one. Maybe I should pay better attention.Well, anyway, the machines decide it'd be a great idea to make the next Terminator model an attractive blonde. And they also apparently decide to ditch the numbers in favor of the much flashier T-X. You know, it sounds cooler, because the machines certainly care! I was infuriated at the lack of creativity in "Judgment Day is inevitable." Shouldn't you give an explanation as to HOW the exact same thing can be picked up if there's nothing any scientists can start from and the man who created the machines in the first place sacrificed himself to MAKE SURE his research never led to anything? Oh, wait. That would take away valuable explosion time. How silly of me.Speaking of that, there's hardly any action in this movie. Hardly any GOOD action, anyway. There's a pretty cool chase scene in which the Terminator hangs on to a crane driven by the T-X. There's also a scene in which the Terminator blows away the police, but it's effectively ruined by the "Human Casualties: 0" thing. An obvious and pathetic attempt to make the audience believe this takes place in the Terminator storyline.As for story? well, if you ignore the numerous plot holes involving John Connor's age and the completely unrealistic idea of Judgment Day going off exactly as before, only later? the story still sucks. The only interesting plot twist is the idea that the Terminator killed John Connor in the future. Kinda chills you when you hear that, but then you're immediately shaken out of the mood by Nick Stahl's incessant whining.It ends abruptly and unsatisfyingly. It starts off good with the Terminator being controlled by the T-X. John Connor and his newfound love Kate Brewster rush frantically to prevent Judgment Day a second time, and you get a sense that it's going to be an exciting last- minute rescue of the human race. Unfortunately, the movie decides to spit in your face and set off Judgment Day anyway. Wow? the entire point of Terminator 2, and also the main character's goal (apart from being a more annoying son-of-a-bitch than Anakin Skywalker, which was a huge accomplishment on his part) is reduced to nothing. No fate? Screw that, it's inevitable!Terminator 1 was sad because Kyle dies at the end. Terminator 2 was sad because Arnold dies at the end. Terminator 3 is sad because the Termintor series dies at the beginning.</fullReview>

So it's not a bad movie or good movie, it's a middle movie the Bad: The effects look like a cartoon and from a kids show like that green lantern show on go and Cartoon Network, too much making fun of itself and not taking it seriously, it sort of ripped off T2 because 2 terminators ones evil ones good kill each other in the end and THEN WE dramatic ending The Good: The Action with the truck flipping over and the exploding Arnie-Bot into the shed and THE ENDING IS SO SHOCKING AND DRAMATIC and the chase scenes are stunning Don't hate on me if you say it's a great movie. I personally think this movie is NOT garbage and rather just an entertaining popcorn exciting action movie and well I don't think it stands near T2 but rather just in the middle half between The Terminator and half before the terminator so this. T3(half) T1 T3(half) T2. I would recommend it just for entertainment and those who like action and explosions and one liners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TERMINATOR was a monumental classic from the 80's, neatly blending sci-fi, action, and horror. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was an Oscar-winner from the 90's, featuring one of the coolest movie villains in the T-1000. Next in the series is TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. In this one, a female Terminator called the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent back to eliminate all the future leaders of the human resistance. Yet again, another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) comes back to stop her from killing John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) while getting them to safety before Judgment Day. However... Where the first two films felt fresh and original, this one feels a little more run-of-the-mill. There's more of a comedic wit in this one than in the previous two. But still, it feels like we've seen it all before. It's not as bad as some cyborg sequels (*clears throat* ROBOCOP 3), but it's far from anyone's brightest moment. Followed by the excellent and pulse-pounding TERMINATOR SALVATION.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We didn't really need it but it doesn't terminate the legacy of the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron's Terminator films were both masterful slices of science fiction, and one of the best robots in cinema history (Played blankly in the best possible way by Arnold Schwarzenegger) left his dent in popular culture. Terminator 2 had a great ending, so we didn't need a sequel. For 11 years they managed to resist the temptation, but eventually they gave in. James Cameron wisely decided not to return, and some random director (Jonathan Mostow) directs the next chapter, as a different terminator in Arnie's shape returns to protect John Connor and his future wife from another robotic assassin. T3 does a decent enough job and could have been worse. The Terminator films benefit from an interesting storyline about fate and the apocalypse, and a surprising amount of emotion for films starring robots has kept all 3 afloat. T3 has a more distant, but still palpable, emotional core. In terms of action, the film does not disappoint and delivers many a thrilling, explosive set pieces full of well executed explosion heaven.A problem which is the main reason why none of the films got a 10 from me is that the Terminator films are too reliant on chase scenes which can become repetitive. Until the strong final third, the film often feels like an extended chase sequence and peaks too early. There's still a decent plot, but the main characters are annoying and the antagonist is just a blank female version of the T-1000. The CGI doesn't look as ground-breaking as it did in 1992, so she's lame. Plenty of entertainment weighed down by a routine script carries on, until the interesting final act where Judgement Day happens and this twist makes sure the film leaves a better legacy than it might have done. T3 doesn't need to exist, but it could have been a lot worse. Not a spectacular sequel, but still entertaining and not as bad as some other third chapters. It's not another The Godfather Part III.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcome Addition To The Terminator Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a science fiction action film directed by Jonathan Mostow.It features Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken. It is the second sequel to The Terminator.Set ten years after the events of 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the screenplay finds Connor living on the streets as a common laborer. Sarah Connor, his mother, has since died, and their efforts in the second film have not stopped the creation of SkyNet artificial intelligence network. As he will still become the leader of the human resistance, Connor is once again targeted by a Terminator sent from the future by SkyNet. This new Terminator, T-X, is a female and is more powerful than any of her predecessors. To protect Connor, the human resistance sends a new T-101 back from the future.With a reported budget of $172 million, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines starts in high gear and never slows down.It tells the simple yet compelling story of a very old piece of equipment that refuses to go away. Its name is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and, as famously promised, he's back, and at his uncharismatic best, too.Although it never reaches the heights of the second movie, it is a welcome addition to the Terminator franchise.</fullReview>

The introduction of a 'female' terminator adds a unique dynamic to the series which is surprisingly very interesting. The dialogue however has steadily deteriorated and the "she'll be back" and "I'll be back" is beginning to wear a bit thin. The plot is not very engaging and is in fact often predictable - save for the twist at the end. The performances are quite adequate throughout the film and Schwarzenegger fans will not be disappointed. Overall an action packed sequel which does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Connor is now in his 20's, and a female terminator, called T-X or Terminatrix, is after him. Another T-101 is sent back through time to protect John once again on the verge of the rise of the machines.The first, original Terminator redefined action. The special effects were ahead of it's time, and the infamous James Cameron gave us what we wanted; something new. Everything was amazing. Then we had Terminator 2, which roundhouse kicked the original in the face. Everything was improved, from the acting to the action, and takes it's place as the best action sci-fi; ever. Then in 2003, a new director tries to revive the beautiful insanity of James Cameron. And as another review states; a good, but flawed, attempt at reviving James Cameron's masterpieces. And it could not be said better. The film starts out amazingly, I had high expectations in the first place. Then shortly after, you can tell the atmosphere has definitely changed... First off, the director tried feeding the film a slight dosage of humor. It some cases it works but others it is cringe-worthy. The action may considered over-the-top in some cases but the redeeming qualities include the infamous crane scene. Then we have the similarities to it's predecessor. Although not exactly the same thing, many things have noticeably been copied of T2. Example: Why was Arnold the protector of John Connor again? Why couldn't they have added some other mission for him; something original. Nevertheless, it still isn't a big factor to it's score. Then after reviewing it's bad qualities, the film does have it's times where you end up liking it. And then concluding this review, I have high expectations for Salvation, knowing that is has originality and following up to this fantastic trilogy. The Skynet war has just begun. I'll be back. 6/10.</fullReview>

They made two good movies that told a good story and had a near-perfect ending and they should have left it alone. But, Hollywood is all about making money, and for a few million dollars they were willing to undo that ending and create a new one that was rather unsatisfying and makes you look back with skepticism on the efforts of the futuristic characters of the first two movies. I really wish they'd just left it alone after T2 and never made this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third chapter of the TERMINATOR franchise, and it's pretty good with its more modern (the first and second films were made before most of us began making the internet a part of our everyday lives) knowledge and post 9/11 viewpoints.John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now about 25 (?) years old. Sarah Connor has passed away from leukemia and John is sort of drifting through life, just waiting it seems, for the next assassin to cross time and try to end him before the nuclear holocaust takes place.Enter the TX aka the Terminatrix (kind of silly, don't you think? Just because Kristanna Loken's a sexy vixen type?) who is quite well played by the actress, who obviously studied Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick in the preceding films. Like the T1000 in the second film, TX is a liquid polymer advancement on the original 101 (again, Good Arnold).The film is mostly about how TX begins to kill off future soldiers for the Resistance Movement. She succeeds for the most part, but she can't seem to get to John or his friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). While being chased by TX, John, Kate and 101 will find out more about Skynet, and the role Kate's father will play.Though it's a good storyline, this third film doesn't seem as "fun" as the first two, in spite of the stunts, effects, costumes and everything. It just doesn't feel the same. Though Stahl does a good job acting, his John Connor ought to have been much more vigilant by this point, and he seemed to think that just because Judgement Day didn't come in 1997, he was in the clear.</fullReview>

Well, I certainly enjoyed this film. Terminator 3 may even be better than the first two and they were masterpieces.This time around John Connor is in his early 20's. A machine comes from the future to protect both him and his future wife from a female killing robot.The acting is pretty good. I was surprised that Edward Furlong did not come back. But I have to say Nick Stahl impressed me. Of course the great action star Arnold is darn near perfect in his last leading role.The special effects were really great. I liked the fact that some good comedy was added into the plot. I liked the score by Beltrami too.Overall, this is a great film. I wouldn't listen to the critics. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While overall I enjoyed the movie the ending just does not work . in the first two movies the plot was such that "skynet" as housed in a supercomputer that becomes self aware. then nukes the world.in this installment however "skynet" is the internet, IE. it is nothing more then a virus that takes over all the small home computers connected to the internet and becomes self aware, OK this could work. but then to make amends with the previous movies, it still nukes everyone ! the problem is all those locations and computers are skynet itself, in effect skynet would be destroying its own brain in an attempt to destroy the humans. so the the question becomes why would skynet destroys 99% of itself ? it wouldn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines directed by Jonathan Mostow Jonathan Mostow had big shoes to fill when he took on the first Terminator film without James Cameron. Was the end result better than the previous two films? Not at all! Is it still an enjoyable film? Definitely! It might not have the same level of excitement that Cameron provided and Nick Stahl might lack in charisma as John Connor, but with Arnie back, T3 delivers a fantastic climax that it has all been leading up to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it has any right to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so it has neither the trashy vitality of the original Terminator movie, nor the gravitas of Judgement Day - but this belated third installment in the sci-fi action franchise is a great deal better than it has any right to be.Featuring the now adult John Connor living as a drifter, he is pursued by this film's main adversary ? the Terminatrix, played with ice-cool efficiency by Kristanna Loken. While the action and chase scenes are certainly gripping ? with a chase through downtown L.A. being one of the highlights ? the film is initially deterred by a few questionable special effects, and its lack of what made the first two installments so memorable: the diverse plot that touched on the emotions of the characters and audience alike. In addition, the film scarcely takes itself seriously, with a collection of gags and puns that sometimes diffuse the sense of pace.Nonetheless, the tragic final act of the film is bound to pull the heartstrings of even the most die-hard action fan, and gives a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 seemed sort of long and drawn out. I especially hated the ending.Think about the ending for a second...it kind of cancels out the other two movies, doesn't it? There were lots of little things that bad about the movie. Other than the ending, there were no "major" flaws - but the little ones sure do add up. Personally, I missed Sarah Conners presence, since she was such an integral part of the other two movies. And there didn't seem to be much point in having a female terminator. That potentially could have been really cool - but they could have done more with it. Hell, they could have even had some fun with it.Then it occurred to me that my expectations were probably too high. I absolutely loved the first two ones. I grew up watching them, and being excited over them. I'm a lot older now. I guess a little harder to impress, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's back, AGAIN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes the Terminator returns for yet another go-round with the unrelenting machines. He will do some new stuff and a lot of stuff we've already seen, but hey, it's still good stuff.I personally enjoyed this film a lot, it lacked most of the first and second films depth, but it still respectable, especially considering it's the third film in the franchise. My friend and his dad also enjoyed the film, they agreed it didn't match the first two but that it was still a good film. This being the first "Terminator" movie I had seen I didn't know what to expect, I believed this helped me. Too many people compared this to the first two films and expected it to be the same, but it wasn't, it was actually a fairly good film, just not quite as good as the first two fantastic films. Because I had not seen the other two, I was able to see this one as a film and not just a stack up to the first two, thus I honestly believe it was a fairly good addition to the franchise.The T-X (Kristanna Loken) though amazing in concept didn't exactly carry the coldness that T2's T-000 had, the result being, she was not as effective as she should have been. The acting itself wasn't a perfect gem, but it carried the story like it needed too and there was no particularly large flaw in it.The reason that T3 wasn't as good as the previous movies is because it couldn't bear the emotional heavy lifting that its predecessors did. It didn't contain the emotional passion that Linda Hamilton gave to T2 or the gritty strength of Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese from the original "Terminator". T3 does redeem itself though, the ending is one of the most powerful endings to a movie I've ever seen (to the point that it felt slightly disjointed from the rest of the movie). Now I'm not going to spoil it for any viewer who hasn't seen this movie, but the ending of this film is a shocker, especially to fans of the series (Then again with Terminator Salvation out already, most people who haven't seen T3 would have figured it out by now). 7.5/10 Very Good action film, see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Connor (Nick Stahl), now in his 20s, is still targeted for termination. This time his would-be assassin is a gorgeous though deadly "Terminatrix" (Kristanna Loken) sent back to try and accomplish what the last two males could not succeed at doing. The eager Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his third appearance, as yet another friendly cyborg who's hot on T-X's high heels to protect young Connor. After the mind-blowing spectacle that was TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY there was just no way this third film could compete. It also feels very much like a rehash of what we've already seen twice before. But yet it remains enjoyable enough due to Arnold, and even more so thanks to Ms. Loken's sexy yet locked-in version of the ominous female killing machine. I have a real problem with Nick Stahl in this movie, as he looks nothing like Edward Furlong (the kid from T2) and his rather delinquent character as written doesn't seem up to the task that's expected of him in the quickly brewing Rise of the Machines. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost 4 stars.... Almost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd almost like to give this movie 8 stars...but not enough to upgrade my overall rating to 6 stars. The movie had great special effects and I enjoyed the T-X villain, but I felt so cheated by the ending. I also really felt like Cameron should have done more to bring back Linda Hamilton's character. Paid her more, given her more incentives or just written in a heroic role to which she couldn't have said no. Claire Danes is NOT an action star and, while I think she did okay in the role of action star, the movie was handicapped by her whiney presence along with that of the new "John Connor." What I really hated was how the "Good" Terminator character got sent back... or should I say WHO sent him back. The circumstances surrounding it, etc. I really felt, as I said, cheated by so many things in this movie. It leaves you with a very hopeless feeling of the future, unlike T2 in which the viewer was left feeling incomplete but perhaps in a more positive frame of mind. Not a great way to "end" the series if this is, indeed, Arnie's last foray into the Terminator world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T1 and T2 in a blender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with the years that passed between the first and second films, the speculation as to whether or not a third film was going to happen at all was very high. We all heard the conflicting statements of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron. Finally Cameron said he would do it if 20th Century Fox would release it. Obviously that didn't happen and Arnold changed his mind after saying No. The story of T3 is mediocre to average at best and I'll tell you why. To begin with, a lot of necessary exposition is missing. The writers essentially left out a major plot point with the former Cyberdyne Systems and Miles Dyson. Having a situation where Dyson designs Skynet's hardware and Brewster designs the software would have tied T3 a lot more strongly to the franchise. Another thing is what happens to Sarah Connor. This character has basically been the pennacle of the Terminator mythos. If the reigns have to pass from Sarah to John that's fine. But it would have worked better that we see her killed trying to escape after Skynet comes online. Lastly the concept of The Terminatrix. Now just to be clear, I don't mind a woman being a Terminator. What I do have a problem with is the writers splitting hairs trying to differentiate the T-X from the T-1000. Now we could all see the difference between Arnold and the T-1000. But if the best they can do is showing the T-X endo during a copy, then that won't cut it. There are ways to come up with new concepts on something established. Maybe that's where Cameron could have worked some magic. The only two things that worked for me were Arnold's description of what will happen in the future in terms of the war, and the ending surprised me though. It set up the fourth film pretty well. The missing elements Cameron's nightmarish vision and storytelling smoothness are what crippled this film. Not bad, but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Addition to The Terminator Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the production of Terminator 3 was announced, the first shocking news that I found was that James Cameron was no longer going to be the director. The other surprise was that the villain was going to be a female. Yes, it was going to be a female cyborg played by Kristanna Loken. With these two facts known, I was convinced that one ought not to expect anything from the third movie. And then came a ray of hope or was it? Arnold continues with his role as the Terminator. Well, I felt there was something to cheer about after all since it is not easy to imagine anybody else playing the Terminator.When the trailer came out, I saw the clips of Kristanna Loken roaming almost nude in the streets and adjusting herself to look more attractive, I feared that the Terminator 3 was going to converge with the concept of Species movies i.e. a female villain moving around seducing men and eventually killing them. But thankfully, the movie was nothing like that and that was a relief for me, a big one indeed.Finally, the movie was a disappointment for me. Firstly, we start out with a lame script. Improperly placed dialogs, really bad! Arnold says, "She'll be back!" Arnold steps inside a lady's night club completely nude. The first goggles he wears are weird star shaped ones! What are the script writers thinking? Are they making a sequel or a parody? I could not understand! I don't know about others but I surely could not understand why the director and the writer put in what they did! And then we come to Arnold Schwargenneger. He was so convincing in the first two movies. Speaking in a way that was so robotic. That strict tone of voice that indicated near lack of emotion in the first two movies was replaced by a tone of voice that is more anger and frustration. Sometimes, one may feel that Arnold is more like a frustrated soldier who has been sent to do something much against his wishes rather than a cyborg who is programmed to do a task and is free from the very concept of emotion.For those of you who have seen the alternate ending of the Terminator 2 movie, you might realize that this ending does not allow the existence of this movie at all. But even when you choose to ignore the alternate ending of T2 where John Conner has become a senator and the Judgment Day has been prevented, you might not find the T3 as a worthy sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dismal followup to Terminator 1 and 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your a terminator fan then i can guarantee you, you will not like this. If you are not, then consider this an OK movie...worth watching but not anything special. There isn't the same feeling, the same vibe that you get from terminator 1 and 2. In addition the character of John Connor IMO was cast totally wrong. John Connor is supposed to be a badass but instead hes played by a short dweeby guy who seems like hes more relation to flanders then to the John Connor I know from terminator two. I mean how is this guy supposed to save the world?! his 13 year old counterpart from the past could kick his ass! Spiderman, batman, the hulk those guys are more manlier then the john connor cast in this movie! Where is the humor (like in T2 when the terminator was ordered not to kill so he shot everyone in the kneecaps) where is the creativity! Other then that the movie itself was DECENT but very very sad for a hardcore terminator fan. I've watched T2 about 10,000 times when i was nine...I have every line in the movie memorized. I have stalked each and every member of the cast, named my first born John Connor and told him he has to lead the world when its overtaken by machines, rid my house of any and all machines, and vote in every election in accordance to what sarah connor would do. THAT IS HOW MUCH I LOVE THE TERMINATOR. Terminator 1 itself was another great movie. Terminator 3 just lacks the suspense, the good catch lines, the action, the excitement, or any of the other factors that the other Terminators had.If you have time to waste, sure go see it. If you are a terminator fan though do NOT see this movie. It will hurt to much....I have recently had to take on psychiatric sessions just to cope with this abysmal display. Christian bale, now there's a badass to play John Connor.</fullReview>

Cameron gets the props for coming up with the story but the new director and cast didn't do a bad job for the third installment. I view these films in the same manner as Jurassic Park, which is loud, action filled popcorn escape films where for some reason you enjoy seeing people getting eaten or eating the other end of a shotgun barrel.

		<shortDescription>Tacky sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Connor is now an adult, and this time around is played by an actor (Nick Stah) who bears not the slightest resemblance to the John Connor of the second film. Mama Connor is nowhere to be found, as actress Linda Hamilton did not appear in the film for one reason or another -- not that it really matters. Connor quickly crosses paths with an old classmate (Claire Danes, of all people) and soon enough they are running from a female Terminator (Kris Loken). A much smaller and older Arnold is back as yet another T-101 trying to save the young pair. The plot from this point is a virtual carbon copy of the second movie, only with louder explosions and longer chases. You can feel the script forcing and stretching this improbable scenario, especially since the whole Skylab issue was resolved at the end of T2. Director Mostow substitutes CGI-heavy action and chase sequences for any sense of forward plotting. T3 is strictly from hunger. Arnold is simply awful and has no presence. Loken is a joke as a "superior" cyborg, not half as effective as Robert Patrick's shape-shifting machine in T2. Stahl and Danes do what little they can with this ramshackle story. The ending is bizarre and unsatisfying, to say the least. There is one chase sequence involving some rather large vehicles that, at least on TV, should keep the viewer awake for a bit. In the theater, this same sequence had so much CGI in it that I thought I was watching a badly made cartoon. If you catch this on regular TV, you have nothing to lose -- but it would be better if you know nothing about the first two movies. T3 throws away all sense of logic and character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, and in actual fact the second terminator was the best of the 3. It consisted everything a movie that is called "The Terminator" should consist of. It was incredible intense, hardcore, and gripping the entire movie and I loved it. It was actually rated 'R' meaning that there is blood and intensity in the move. The special effects were fantastic. One thing that really caught my attention in terms of intensity was when Sarah Connor broke out of her room and threatened the man with a needle containing oil/poisoin which was already inserted into the mans neck, waiting to be injected. The blood and violence was increbly gripping as well. Not to mention the great acting from all who played in the movie, not to mention John Connor! The things he taught the terminator to help him act like a normal human being was funny and interesting.Terminator 3 was a disappointment in my oppionion. First of all a terminator movie Rated PG13...? Doesn't make sense, and the blood, violence and overall intensity were poor and the acting wasn't too great either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got the DVD version of Terminator 3 from a rental place. I'd seen Terminator 1 before, and i thought that it was okay. I absolutely loved the screenplay, but it raises some serious continuity questions with Terminator 1. For one, when the Terminator says that he killed John Connor because he had relationships with him, that means that the Terminator had to have met John Connor before. He didn't, because he rolled off of an assembly line and a different Terminator had met John Connor. Also, the Terminator was reprogrammed by T-X. by that, it means that he has an okay CPU but has no control over the rest of his "body". However, he still seems to have control of his mouth, because he warned John to get away. He also must've had an override ability, because he was able to shut himself down, when he should have had no control over the circuits, because he doesn't have control of his body!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men and their 'Machines'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Lacks the originality of the first or the thrills of the second, but effective all the same. Third chapters are usually gamble, especially if you have a series that's as successful as the TERMINATOR saga. What started as a hit low-budget sci-fi thriller (in THE TERMINATOR) turns into one of the most explosive and expensive blockbuster of all time (in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY). So what is there in store for audiences in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. Not to terribly much I'm afraid, as the film falls under the category of "been-there-done-that" for most of the scenes. Director James Cameron unfortunately leaves further involvement in this third film, and leaves the directorial reigns (as well much of the TERMINATOR legacy) to action director Jonathan Mostow, who isn't exactly a brand name a director. The new story (helmed by new batch of writers who are everything but James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd).But regardless of its shortcomings, TERMINATOR 3 isn't a total loss as it might have turned out. While he rushes the screenplay for production, Mostow does offer a nicely done batch of action sequences and nifty special effects to keep one busy. There's much action here to satisfy the conventional action fan, be it chase scenes or wild gun-play action (maybe even both in one scene). Arnold Schwarzenegger (before running for governor of California) returns as the ever-present emotionless futuristic cyborg once again sent to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl), now a messed-up drifter, from yet another mechanical creation from Skynet sent to the past to kill him. For a change (whilst not much), the new machine, called the T-X, is takes the form of a chick (played by Kristanna Loken), which is just as unstoppable as its predecessor, other than that there's very little else new nor interestingly unique about this new killing machine. In addition, the big bad machine from the violent future must also protect Conner's would be wife (played by Claire Danes). Their connections with each other? They were classmates once! It doesn't get much more complicated than that, now does it? While the writing leaves much to be desired, and its anticlimax of an ending (of an anticlimax of a sequel by the way!) leaves us wondering why we had to go through the events of this film in the first place. One more thing, the much beloved characters of the ass-kicking woman warrior Sarah Conner is sorrily missed, almost as much as a payoff to the character of John Conner, who is a disappointment here in this film. Still, nonetheless, TERMINATOR 3 is a decent action thriller, packed with action and thrills. Leave our cynicism and brains at the door, it's brainless summer season again, and TERMINATOR 3 is a decent effort of pure mainstream film-making. It's disappointing, but only as sequel.Rating: *** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much of the first sequel; Cameron's absence is a miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Terminator 2: Judgment Day or T2 known to fans introduced computer generated imagery (CGI) effects to scare the living daylights out of people along with bringing character development, great chase sequences, a wicked villain (Robert Patrick as the T-1000), high octane action sequences and making Arnold's character The Terminator a new hero to everybody. And that was all thanks to James Cameron.In 2003, Jonathan Moss (U-571) brings back the hero from the dead along with bringing a new plot to the film. The film still involves John Conner (Nick Stahl) grown up after witnessing the events where he could've been killed by the T-1000. He's a homeless person living on the street where his only survival is his strength and eating off medicine at a local stray pound. His mother Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) is dead so the kid's got nobody else left.Now comes the villain in the movie. In the first movie Arnold played The Terminator going after Linda Hamilton and preventing her from having a son who would be the hero in the future; in T2 the villain was T-1000 killing anybody related to John Conner. Now the villain is not a man but a woman who goes by the name of T-X where her mission is to go after future military workers; she kills teenagers left and right from drive-thru restaurants to parties where her main target is Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) the daughter of a military general. Once Kate and John find out what's going on, they go out in hiding before The Terminator catches them and becomes their guardian.T3: Rise of the Machines is okay fun. The action sequences were the only reason to see this movie, but it feels empty without James Cameron directing the third installment of the series where in each of the movies he directed, something new is always introduced. It's just too much of a repeat to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unnecessary sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that needed to be said and done was done so in Terminator 2. (Quite nicely, I might add.) There was absolutely no need to make enough another Terminator movie, proving that T3 was simply nostalgic masturbation on the studio's part.Terminator 3 is basically one big homage to Terminator 2. There's nothing in T3 that wasn't done (and done better) in T2. Cameron clearly had a better handle on the story than Mostow, who spent the whole movie trying to convince the audience that he can throw down with the big boys. Reality, however, is against him, since T3 is nowhere near as entertaining as T2.With the exception of Arnold, T3 has just about everything going against it. Claire Daines looks very out of place in this movie, Nick Stahl is a horrible John Conner, and the two have little to no chemistry together. The special effects are rather sloppy and the music is pretty mediocre. Even the action scenes aren't as good as T2. It's a twenty-first century Terminator film, but we can only have one expensive sequence (the fire truck)?! The one thing I do like about T3 is the notion that Judgment Day is inevitable. Fate is a time-honored and effective plot device, especially in stories involving time travel. While it doesn't even begin to fill in for the rest of what is lacking T3's plot, at least it provides a somewhat stable backbone.On its own, Terminator 3 is an OK movie. It's flawed, but entertaining. In relation to its predecessors, however, it falls flat on its face. It's obvious that it was simply an effort to restart the franchise and keep the money-hose going.</fullReview>

So they can no longer afford to send expensive liquid metal machines -("Sorry lads but it is no longer cost effective to try and rule the world this way.

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I do NOT hate Terminator 3. In fact I think it completes the story, unless they do a T4(which is unlikely due to the main character's current position in politics) what I do hate about this film is the fact that they changed directors. WHY?!!! No other director can provide the fantasy and the magic that only James Cameron can provide. He came up with the idea for "The Terminator" in the first place! Having a Terminator movie without him is like the Beatles without John Lennon. Now that is out of the way, the action holds your attention like the first two films did. The car chases weren't that as exciting as the 1984 original, sorry. T3 doesn't have the "psycho killer" mystique of T1 or the violent barrage cliffhanger feel of T2, which this movie obviously needs. T3 becomes interesting in which the first couple of scenes in which John Connor's lieutenants were killed one by one in this time. One was a slackjawed pothead executed during a party!! I love potheads you might find on Dude, Where's My Car executed by a stranger with a gun. Thus proving that Terminator 3 is a film that has its moments. It gives very interesting plot twists that no one...I mean no one sees coming. Like the fact that "Judgement Day" couldn't be stopped...(I know this sounds trite)only to be survived. Not only that but Skynet was created by cyberspace all current technology. Which is very chilling that something that lethal can be under our noses without our knowing about it. The action was just similar to Star Wars III but not as epic. To some degree it was comical, not a white-knuckle face off, which a Terminator movie should have to begin with. The ending wasn't that grand, it could've been better. The effects could've grander and in disturbing detail with people burning to a crisp and the full effect of global chaos. In conclusion, this was not a boring movie,this is an interesting one that should've done better.</fullReview>

Too many plot holes, out and out rip offs from the first two films and lack of originality makes me wonder what Arnie was thinking, reprising his role for this joke of a film. This film seems to have focused more on generating revenue than completing a classic film trilogy. There is a complete lack of substance and will only appeal to the lowest common denominator. Those who can't see past the one liners will probably enjoy it. Fans of the first two films who enjoyed the story as a whole and the world in which it took place will be aghast at the rather lame attempt at making a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator I was very thrilling, and so was Terminator II. But for some reason Terminator III was not. What is wrong? Well, the actors (except Kristana Loken) are not very good, but that is nothing new and not very important in a movie of this sort. But in any story there has to be certain well defined rules that must be respected at all times. Any story will be completely ruined the moment elements or events are involved that could never exist or happen in the world of the story. In a fairy tale it is okay to include a hat that makes the bearer invisible. But if a person suddenly begins to make himself invisible without the hat (and without a good explanation), the story is immediately ruined. It is okay that Q equips James Bond with a gadget that only works in fantasy, but the story will be ruined if we can't at least believe that it might somehow be technically possible to make such a gadget. A terminator is supposedly a fantastic machine, and since it is from the future we are prepared to believe it can have a lot of fantastic abilities. But we are not, and should not be, prepared to believe that it can work magic! So since we all know that it takes some mechanical power to activate the brakes, to speed up the engine and to turn the wheels of a car, we also know that some machinery will simply have to be built in to enable a car to be remote-controlled. But this terminator just sticks a thin finger into the instrument board like she might be installing some software into a computer, and - hokus pokus - suddenly she is able to drive the car with her mind! This is by no means plausible, so the story immediately looses all excitement. And besides the car chase with the crane is not interesting, because it is just too incredible that the main characters are not killed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, it's still Terminator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this film till after I saw the first 2 to know what's going on.I think it's cool even if it's done by a different director and produced by Warner Bros.But it still has Arnold as Terminator, still involves a lethal machines, and John Conner future leader of the resistances.This is taken place 9 years after Terminator 2. John Conner is now a young adult. He now lives as a loner, and he made sure his identity and where abouts remained unknown. He thinks he and his mom prevented Judgement day, but he's wrong. The day the machines will take over is sooner than he expected.A new terminator the T-X appears out of nowhere. This time it resembles a young woman. Unlike the T-1000, the T-X is faster, stronger, smarter, and more knowledge than the original Terminator itself. In another area another begin comes back from the future, and you've guess it, another Terminator who is the same model as the previous 2.It was sent back to 2003 to protect John Conner again. John Conner must find a way to prevent Judgement Day from starting, if possible. With the T-X on his trail this will be a fight to the finish.Older Terminator fans might not like this one. But I think it's very good, has action and some funny moments to it. Plus I think the T-X is very hot for a machine. I suggest renting it before buying it, might not be a sequel for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining third entry to the franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the death of his mother Sarah &amp; in an effort to avoid being hunted down once again by another future sent robot, John Connor now lives in the streets of L.A. completely homeless &amp; sleeping wherever he can. When a new killer robot dubbed the T-X is sent back in time to kill him (seen as a woman). While hunting for John, she checks through the phone listings &amp; bumps off all of the people who will be John's top commanders in the war against Skynet in the future. Meanwhile another terminator (ARNOLD SCHWARZENAGGER) who bears the similar look to the robot who protected John from the T-1000 many years prior, is also sent back once again to protect John. When John is caught &amp; imprisoned by Kate Brewster, a veterinarian who catches him breaking into the clinic one night, she learns that they had went to school together. When the killer android learns John is in the clinic, it wages an assault on the clinic in an effort to kill John &amp; oddly enough it wants Kate dead too. Kate is then thrust alongside John &amp; the Terminator himself who must save them both, especially when Kate learns that she is destined to become John's wife &amp; second in command in the future. Meanwhile John learns that Judgement Day was not prevented from ever occurring, but was merely postponed to a future date, the very day they are living in! John learns that Kate's dad an army general, is about to give the go ahead to upload Skynet, after a computer virus is revealed in all internet systems in the U.S. which if allowed to take it's course, could render it's defences weak against possible terrorist attempts. With Skynet in, it will help clear the virus from the system...or so they think. Meanwhile John &amp; Kate try to reach them before they upload it into the worlds computer systems allowing Skynet to take control, but can they stop it in time or is the future already set?TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINE is a fairly entertaining sequel to what has so far been a pretty good kick butt sci-fi action franchise &amp; while it's nowhere near up to par with the first two films, at the very least manages to be entertaining. The difference between this film &amp; the previous entries is the departure of both Linda Hamilton &amp; James Cameron both of whom are now long gone from the franchise (although Gale Ann Hurd does return as executive producer) with the directorial reigns handed over to Jonathan Mostow, who does a fairly good job behind the camera. The stunts here are really impressive as is the robotic creations &amp; explosions that are sprinkled throughout the picture. The film also reveals a nice twist by having Arnie's terminator reveal to John, that it was Kate who sent him back because he had assassinated John in the future &amp; that he was re-wired &amp; sent back on Kate's order to warn John ahead of time. The action is very well handled here as is the car chases &amp; stunts which are very spectacular.Unfortunately the films plot is nothing more tun a rehash of the previous films &amp; despite the introduction of a new kind of robot of a different sex, the android is nothing more than a watered down version of the T-1000 &amp; is nowhere near as menacing or as impressive. The film also has a major plot hole that the film-makers never once brother to answer like, wasn't Skynet destroyed at the end of Part 2? the computer chip &amp; robot arm were both destroyed, along with all computer data that held information on how to make it work, so how is Skynet still here? The idea that Skynet is dwelling in cyberspace is also ludicrous. To be fair to the film-makers, they do at least try to add some things to make the robot seem deadly, such as having it having the ability to morph it's arms into various weapons knives, guns, flame throwers etc. it's ability to shape shift into other people, control police patrol cars, it being able to sniff out DNA etc. But the plot is not advanced any &amp; the film offers nothing new &amp; the film-makers never do answer the question as to why if this creature is able to reconstruct clothing for herself even after it's damaged, does she need to swipe the clothes of another motorist? &amp; many of the action &amp; scenes are swiped from the first two film, such as Arnie fending off an army of swat cops while trying to protect John &amp; the heroine, a car chase taken from the original's climax. Breaking into a government building to prevent Skynet from advancing (seen in T2) The killer android using the phone directory to kill off all the people who will be John's top men in the near future (a plot device used in the original) &amp; the innocent heroine who learns that she will play a big part in the future etc. Heck even Arnie's one liner "I'll be back" is re-used here with a slight twist by saying "She will be back" &amp; despite the films $170 million budget ($70,000,000 more than the second film had) this film for some reason feels cheaper.All in all, while the film's plot could have been so much better than what it was, I will say I rather enjoyed TERMINATOR 3 myself, while the film definitely has it's flaws &amp; while I can certainly understand why many people hated it, I found it nowhere near as bad as what many people were saying it was, I actually found it to be quiet entertaining, just don't go in expecting it to top the first two &amp; you should have fun. The climax leaves a set up for TERMINATOR SALVATION*** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not-as-good Terminator, but at least no Alien: Resurrection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seemed like nothing so much as a less-skilled rehash of the first movie. One long chase, really, with a not-altogether-convincing romantic plot, clever touches that must've played great on paper but thudded on-screen, but with nothing really so offensive to make you angry. A nice, fast-moving B-movie.In the original, things were so much tighter. The old saw where if the audience has to work harder to fill in plot holes than the screenwriters seemed to was in full force. In the original, there was a reason to use a big model for the terminator - tech was lower, and the bulk and armor gave him an advantage. Why a girl? The T-1000 had no problem emulating females, so any kind of infiltration doesn't wash. Why have killer robots in storage with full magazines? Was Skynet the virus (if not, what was it), or the anti-virus that failed (if I just missed it, mea culpa)? In T2, Skynet had a good reason for genocide - it was self-defense against an immediate, clear threat (it woke up to discover it was about to be killed precise for that reason). Here, it was apparently "just evil"... or something?Still, it had a good beat and people were dancing, so I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken, David Andrews / Director: Jonathan Mostow / Producers: Mario Kassar, Andrew G. Vajna, Hal Lieberman, Joel B. Michaels, Colin Wilson / Music: Marco Beltrami / U.S. Distributor: Warner Brothers The movie T3 (Terminator3) ?Rise of the Machines is a typical action-movie. Arnold "Arnie-The Strong-Terminator-Conan-Governator" Schwarzenegger is the T-101 and his antagonist is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. The T-X is called Terminatrix too. The plot is not very difficult to describe. The T-101 has to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Clare Danes) who will be his wife and one of his lieutenants in the future. Ergo, they have to flee from the T-X because the T-101 is an old model. This flight is of course not without any action-sequences. At the end of the film the terminators destroy themselves mutual and the machines take over the world and complete control. John Conner and Kate Brewster can escape in a dugout. Therefore John Conner becomes the leader of the human beings in war against the machines.Terminator3-Rise of the machines is a very good action-movie. There are real stunts and not only computer-animation. This film is really extra-ordinary and absolutely amazing. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the cyber-organism which comes out of the future for a third time. The film is worth watching. There are good special effects and explosions as in other good action-films. The ending of this Terminator-part is very unexpected. It looks like as if there could be a Terminator4. Some say that Schwarzenegger won't be the protagonist in the fourth film, because he is governor. Well, maybe in the fifth film. Somewhere was said that there already exits a script. In my opinion T3 is better than part one, but worse than part two. Anyways, T3 is a film-highlight of this summer (2003) or even this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third part of the "Terminator" series is often bashed for being childish, compared to the first two, but this is not the case. The first two parts of the story were darker, true, and better - for this there can be no argument; but this is still a great action scifi movie, full with cynical humor, jaw-dropping action and very good visual effects. The actors are decent, especially Arnold who is as good as ever. The story is a little bit stupid, because it basically ignores the message of the 2nd movie, but it is enjoyable and entertaining. The final of the film is really great, though. In conclusion - not on the level of T2, but very good indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator, was one of the best action movies ever made, Terminator 2 has more action scenes and more awesome special effects, and then there's Terminator 3. Terminator 3 continues 10 years from where Terminator 2 left off.The acting in Terminator 3 isn't as enthusiastic as in its predecessors. Even though Kristanna Loken is beautiful, she isn't the best actress, but she does add a very robotic attitude to her character. Arnold does a pretty good job, this is one of his last movies from before he went into office. The problem is, his character is more humorous in this movie, and terminators are supposed to be machines with no emotion at all, so that is very out of line for him.There is a killer car chase scene, and an exciting scene towards the end, but when the ending does happen, it is very disappointing as it ruins the entire series.This movie is never boring, and Kristanna Loken is a treat to look at, but the bad script and disappointing ending will make you wish you hadn't wasted your time, so don't bother with this one, see the originals instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Illogical machines?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie, a question came to my mind: how come the machines of the future never have a backup plan? They only ever send one terminator at a time. Wouldn't it be more effective to send back several, so that if one fails the others can go into action? Or maybe they can coordinate in teams.They wouldn't even have to be the most technologically sophisticated - they just have to be in large enough numbers to terminate Arnold's character. The resistance of the future would not be able to send back several "counter-terminators" so John Connor would have a greater likelihood of being killed.I would prefer to see John Connor facing almost insurmountable odds, than to see another Terminator where Arnold goes one-on-one with the latest model only to defeat it through super-"human" will. Of course the sense of fatal danger is undermined by the fact that John Connor must exist in the future to provide the machines with a reason to kill him in the first place [I won't go into time paradox question here or my head will explode]. However, it would provide the writers with a real challenge if they have to figure out how Connor can avoid termination several times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I should write Terminator 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Brancato should not have been allowed to write T3. Although I agree it is an excellent action flick it is still not in the way of the primary formula utilized to produce the first 2 movies and, as such, IMHO, it is far from a desirable work. It is not, however, unsalvageable as far as the remainder of the series goes, although the continuation of the series really does need to take place in the future, and not with trying to explain time travel. Time travel should be left for a fifth movie, the beginning of the circle, as it were, and Skynet should be smashed immediately thereafter, towards the end of the fifth movie, in order to bring the entire series to a close. And, yes, before anyone comments, I AM going to try and do something about him writing the fourth installment. Good evening.</fullReview>

Some the action was good, a lot of it was hokey, the cgi didn't look realistic, it just looked like shoddy cgi. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie the jon connor is turned into some drug junkie in the back of a vet place. This movie wasn't dark, well thought up like the first two, they had plots. This one just tries to rattle off alittle connection from the first two in a 5 minute sequence then off to the rampage. It wasn't entertaining in the least bit, and critics who are fans of the first 2, just ripped this movie to shreds and Cameron to shreds for failing to notify the masses that this movie would be cheesy and essentially a plot spoof of the first two. The girl terminator was silly at times, the comedy was death, anybody who laughed at one joke in this movie I could not possibly forgive or understand the humour. Whether you agree with what I said or not, bottom line is... For all the fans of the first two who analyzed every subplot, event, storyline of the first two, will be very disappointed with this because its a big sell out none of that good stuff from the first two in the third.

		<shortDescription>Why I think Terminator 3 doesn't deliver! - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE Terminator fan. I have seen both the first two movies inside out and backwards. Here is why I do not believe that Terminator three belongs on the same level as the first two. Forgive me if I leave out any information in my arguments and should anyone feel the desire to argue my points, then by all means you're more than welcome. The first thing that got me about the third movie was the emotion both the terminators showed. The terminator was set up as a relentless killing machine that doesn't show pity, remorse or fear, simply systematic destruction. Ironically, during the scene when the terminator is reprogrammed by the T-X he explains to John (rather emphatically) that he is a machine. That line would have been much more effective had it been delivered with the cold, hard apathy we saw in the first two terminators. Another emotional moment for the terminator was the T-X this time. *(This shouldn't be a spoiler but use discretion anyway) Just before the T-X is defeated she shows fear! If the terminator can't cry in the second movie after all he's been through, I find it very hard to believe that this T-X can be afraid.*(Potential Spoilers in the following paragraph) That whole thing with the power cell really annoyed me. In the first terminator, he is crushed under a hydraulic press. He didn't blow up! In the third, they suddenly make it that if he suffers a massive blow to the chest he is in danger of exploding. Further more, I understand that this next comment could be taken as being a little nit-picky, but I believe it has to be said. At the end of the second movie the terminator specifically states that he cannot self-terminate, yet at the end of the third movie he decidedly drops the door on himself and the T-X, knowing it would destroy them both.OK, John Conner is a wimp in this movie. By the end of the second movie he is supposed to be half ready for the war, and before Sarah died, she was supposed to have taught him to be a "Great military leader". How much of this showed in the third now that Judgment day was right around the corner? Also, Cyberdyne Systems was destroyed in the second movie, along with all traces of the terminator. This should have prevented the war. OK, so it never, it only postponed it. *(Spoiler alert) Skynet turns out to be a virus, that becomes self aware, and will construct the terminator (Cyberdyne Systems model 101) based on what? Huh? Military records? How did they get them if Cyberdyne systems was destroyed? Even if Skynet developed this model of the terminator through some kind of cybernetic evolution, he still wouldn't have been developed in the short amount of time they gave in the movie.</fullReview>

The casket of guns and a few other comedic points are good for some laughs. But what this movie suffers from is what makes it invisible and boring compared to the first terminator movies. James Cameron not directing the characters he invented hurts. The presence of Sara Connor is sorely missed. And maybe it because I'm older and harder to please than when Terminator 2 came out (i was like 12 or 13) , or it could be that when it came out CGI special effects were very new and very impressive, now with 12 years, a couple of Jurassic Park movies, Matrix movies, and several hundred lesser movies featuring CGI, the effect no longer seems special and can even seem cumbersome and even downright distracting. All that said T3 will be somewhat enjoyable film though Loken's villain lacks Robert Patrick's utter child-molester creepiness from part 2. But it didn't leave me floored like part 2 did.

		<fullReview>The film is certainly well done, technically. That is, special effects are pretty good. We got a Terminatrix this time, so some more female appeal in it. Also, the quotes are exactly where you expect them (I'm back anybody?). Still, for me that alone just doesn't make for a good movie. OK, the Skynet thingy wasn't a strong point to begin with, but what's all this pseudo-deep blah about the future and all. I mean, come on... a machine telling that 'Judgment Day' (what has this religious term to do with it all?) is 'inevitable' really pushes the envelope too much. A machine would be programmed to say what it says. It cannot 'know' what will happen, not calculate the future (chaos theory anyone ?). Far less in a situation where things depend so much on human decisions. So, what does the movie want to say ? Well, nothing. There is absolutely nothing. Watch out, machines *will* take over ? I think this movie really sends out a very bad message to kids. 'The future will be catastrophic, it can simply be computed and there's nothing we can do about it, so don't even think about trying to change stuff. Things are just gonna happen. It's well known that some of the ultra-conservative groups in the US see some sort of mass-dying as unavoidable. This kind of movies serve to condition audiences to accept this. Maybe that's the message of the film. Other than that, it's not coherent or plausible. 'Jodgment day iss inevitable'. Yes, sure, take it from Arny, it was the last 'Terminator'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the excellent Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, we have a trilogy now, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But unfortunately, the third installment couldn't live up to my expectations after the first two genuine pieces of cinema.In the first part, Arnold was the menacing, unstoppable and relentless killing machine. In the second, Arnold was a protagonist. It's a very good idea from Cameron. Let's see if he can make a good performance on the good side. And he could!What we get from the third movie is having Arnold again as a protagonist, even the same model which he was in T2. Nothing new... But at least it's nice to see him again in his best role.The antagonist is now a female terminator (it's just me, or the name "Terminatrix" is really cheesy?), which is a good idea. Or at least something new. Kristanna Loken is indeed beautiful and her performance is good - but sadly just "good", and not "awesome" or "genuine" as Robert Patrick's in T2. RP was waaaay better.The story was written in a "Come on guys, we HAVE to figure out something to make a new Terminator movie" way. Judgment Day was only delayed? Give me a break! This destroys the whole story of T2, and doesn't offer anything in order to justify this act. So this is rather pointless.The characters are much worse than they were in the previous movies. Kyle Reese was a totally understandable character, someone that the viewer could care about and he was played by Michael Biehn. Sarah Connor was also a character like this in the second - and they killed off her in this. So, we have a new character, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who seems like a ripoff of Sarah. She merges the SC from the first with the SC from the second installment. Nice performance from Danes, but this isn't enough to make the movie good. We have of course John Connor - but the character is completely out of place.The action sequences were breathtaking in the first and especially in the second movie (T2 has the most breathtaking CGI I've ever seen). Now, we've got a car chase with a giant truck (does anybody have déja vu?), lots of bullets, some wrestling and giant explosions. It was done before, nothing new! Only the "hook into the manhole" scene was memorable (the CGI used in that scene was made by hungarians!), but the other parts of the car chase were simply boring. What do we see? Shaking camera, cars going off-road, and this goes on for minutes... The car chase scene in The Matrix Reloaded is way better than this one. The wrestling between the two Terminators were good, however the Burly Brawl in M:R is better - moreover, it's slightly disturbing to see Arnold constantly beating a girl...All in all the movie deserves a 7, because it's entertaining and fun to watch Arnold again (I liked the gay glasses scene...). But apart from this, it's mindless and not even visually adequate enough.I'm not counting "T3: Rise of the Machines" as a Terminator movie. The Terminator saga ends with the closing sequence of "T2: Judgment Day" for me.</fullReview>

The action scenes are world class and the effects, revolutionary in their day, are still pretty impressive. There are some pretty big faults, demonstrated by the poor attempts at humour and personified in the role of John Connor (Edward Furlong), but as a piece of movie making it is a good benchmark. Much of T2 involves the characters trying to avert a war against intelligent machines, which is due to start in 1997. I'm sure I won't be giving away too much when I say that they succeed in preventing the war. The end.So, why a third installment? Well, the rules of Hollywood accountancy dictate that, since T2 made so much money and since Arnie didn't object, even averted wars can get started up again.In T3 we meet up with John Connor again, now in his 20's and living "off the grid". It seems he didn't trust that the machine threat was completely gone, so he is drifting around, using assumed names and doing his best not to appear in any databases. So when the inevitable happens and a new terminator is sent to kill him (along with a now-obligatory "friendly" terminator to protect him) its first mission is to track down and kill all the people who &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; help him in the future. His future lieutenants, as it were. In doing this, the new Terminator stumbles on John's trail and the chase begins.This is not a James Cameron film (the other two were, and so was the 3D short which you can only see at Universal Studios) but he did contribute to the script. I wonder how much input he really had though, because it definitely lacks the Cameron sheen you expect from his own projects. It's just not as tight.The new terminator is a female robot, with some of the abilities of the previous liquid killer but the new twist is that this one can form itself into a variety of high-powered weapons. Whereas Robert Patrick's T-1000 was limited to shaping himself into knives and sharp spikes in order to kill the Connors, the new T-X can whip out a souped-up plasma rifle which could blast a rhino in half. So, all the powers of the last one, plus some extra makes for a much more interesting character, right?Not really. The T-X is not as engaging as the T-1000. Robert Patrick's character had oodles more menace than pretty girl Kristanna Loken. I remember being shocked the first time I saw bullets splat big holes in his liquid body, then watched the holes mysteriously close. The same thing happens again here, but it's a case of "yeah, we had that 13 years ago. What's new?"Well, there's the certificate for starters. T2 was a 15, this is a 12. There's more humour too, unfortunately. Too often the movie tries to get laughs from Arnie's grim cyborg saying lines you wouldn't expect from a killing-machine. Like "talk to the hand". Har-bloody-har. Again, we had that 13 years ago and it was cack even then.There is a nice destructive car chase and the action is well paced, but in the end it all seems rather pointless. Our only hope is that Arnie becomes so embroiled in politics that he can't find the time for another one.I'll give it 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ARNOLD AT HIS BEST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Terminator is BAAAAACCKK!!!! And he's badder than ever. This time, he finds more people who will resists "the rise of the machines". And that T-X? She puts the T-1000 to shame. Her weakness is magnets, and the T-1000's is cold. Wonder what's the next assassin's weakness is? Microwaves? UV rays? Whatever it is this movie is something else. Despite the huge changes: No Sarah Connor, Warner Bros. making it instead of MGM, several different people in the cast as well. But who cares, they still have Schwarzenegger. That's what matters to me. This movie packed a lot of action, a lot of suspense, and a lot of entrigue. The cemetery scene was great, knowing the year Sarah Connor died. The weapons she left behind, and The Terminator carrying the coffin while fending of the cops and the T-X. I don't how the T-X did it with the cleavage enhancement, but that will cost me my life if I asked her. HAHA! This sequel is not bad, and though it was made by another company, the franchise will always be great from time to time. Rating 3 out of 5 stars. 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tolerable, but far short of the originals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS ***T3 is weighed down by a poor script. John Connor is a whiny drifter, reduced to stealing meds from a pet hospital, beaten up by a woman, and unable to escape from a simple dog cage. What happened to the middle-schooler who broke into Cyberdyne, taught a killing machine the value of human life, and actually looked the part of a future resistance leader?The villainess of the piece, T-something-or-other, is a clone of the liquid metal bad guy from T2. Only dumber, and with some implausible new skills, like the ability to change cup sizes.There are plot holes and inconsistencies all over the place. For example, they explain that the Ah-Nold character in this movie doesn't know what the Terminator from T2 knew because it's a different unit. But it still goes out of its way not to kill anyone, as in T2. And if you can believe it, John Connor's biography and the history of the future become even more confusing. Worse than that, there's a revelation that will make you wonder why any of the characters even bother.Having thoroughly established that T3 doesn't live up to its predecessors, let me say it isn't all bad. The major action scenes are comparable to those from T1 or T2. The Governor of California once again plays the machine in his mechanical, but oddly likable way. I can't find fault with any of the actor's performances; they do the best they can.Another reviewer said that T3 should not be considered "canon." If you care about such things, you won't like T3. But if you can accept the film's limitations, and overlook the bad attempts at humor, it's a decent action movie. I gave it 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines isn't as good as the first two, because it isn't as action-packed, it's short, and it's not directed by James Cameron. In this one, John Connor is nearing the time where he must shut down Skynet and stop the machines from destroying humanity. It turns out that a fembot has come back to kill him, and a protector has come. The protector would later go even more back in time, and save him from being killed in childhood, and THEN would die. (see Terminator 2: Judgment Day for more details). Twisted, mixed, and confusing, T3 is the weakest of the series.Grade: 5/10MPAA Rating: RMy Rating: Ages 12 and up (violence, language, brief nudity)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't terminate the first two, but still great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third (and final???) installment in the Terminator trilogy brings events rate up to date and sees the birth of Skynet and the story of judgment day, and the efforts to prevent it. Without James Cameron the film lacks the finesse and tghtness of the first two films, it doesn't have the same feel, and it lacks Cameron's guiding hand. Luckily Big Arnie is on top form giving one of his better performances, probably his best film since True Lies, returning in same same role, albeit as a different Terminator unit from the same series model. This time the enemy is the immensely brutal and advanced T-X, played superbly by Kristianna Loken, who manages to combine sultry seductiveness with ruthless brutal killing seemingly effortlessly.Claire Danes, who does a fine job as Kate Brewster, a vetinary nurse who is unfortunately drawn into the war against the machines, and her performance is first rate. The script is nice, it has a few holes in it but mostly holds together OK, there are a few nice twists, especially the history of Arnie's Terminator, and the rise of Skynet is very nicely explained with a very good showing of 'American generals and politicians as morons' - watch it you'll like it.The let down of the film for me is Nick Stahl as John Conner, who gives an average performance and fails to bring much energy and depth to the character who had great potential and was played expertly by Edward Furlong in T2. In T3 Conner is a lost and selfish character hiding from nothing but himself, and there is no way to connect this John Conner with the young Conner in T2, or the resistance leader he was to become. Eddie's young Conner had a brash rebellious nature and you could see how Conner could become the leader of the human resistance to the machines, but Nick Stahl's portrayal just falls flat and doesn't impress. A nice cameo from the ever brilliant Earl Boen as Dr Silberman makes a nice comedy moment, and the sporadic light comic relief from Arnie makes the film more bearable. A shame that Linda Hamilton didn't wasn't in the film, though the character is included to make a good comedy and quintisentially Sarah Conner moment.Overall T3 is good, it doesn't have the same impact that the original film had, nor the dynamic fast paced story of T2. The film suffers from 'third in trilogy syndrome', where all the best ideas have been put into the first two and the third film is just trying to grind out the idea (see Aliens 3, Police Academy 3 onwards, etc) but everything is saved by Arnie's brilliant performance as the Terminator. Final statements - as a member of the Terminator series, it isn't as good as the first two. Had the first two never been made, or perhaps if this was the second film, not the third, it could have been called great. Its very good if viewed as a separate film, merely good when considered in the trilogy. Will there be a T4 when Arnie finishes his term as governor Terminator? Anything is possible, but judging from T3, somehow someway James Cameron will need to be convinced to work on the project. T1 gets 8 out of ten, T2 gets nine, T3 gets a grudging 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing film, breaks no new ground.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first few seconds of the film, T3 trod the same old ground. Starting with the T's arriving in the "burning bubbles" and continuing on through the overly-long car chases until the dreary ending, this film was almost a clip show of scenes from T2. Worse yet, parts of it were even a parody of the earlier films...for example, the Elton-Johnesque sunglasses Arnold "borrows" from the male stripper. I was bored and dissatisfied with this movie and it came very close to besmirching the memory of the much better earlier films. The female T3 was predictable, and not nearly the shocker it was supposed to be. I think they should have tried an entirely new direction with this movie, but it falls flat and I rank it completely out of the same league as T2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Turn in the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 2 certainly didn't open it self up for another Terminator but 11 years later the series continues. This new chapter is no longer directed by infamous James Cameron, when i heard this i had doubts that this film would be any good. It was now taken over by Jonathan Mostow director of Submarine movie U571 which i hated. So my hopes for this movie where shot. Other things i heard about this movie were that Edward Furlong was no longer attached to this movie which really blew my mind. Who could replace him? I also heard Linda Hamilton was no longer apart of this project which also upset me, but later was corrected. The rival terminator was a female, which kind of threw the terminator off balance but also was different. WARNING SPOILERS: We begin like all the other movies in a future war torn earth where John Connor and others of the human race are fighting for their lives against the machines. Brilliant Opening sequence by the way. We come to present day where John Connor is 20 years old, living off the grid no residence and no legal tender for fear of others trying to kill him. Then we get to the new female terminator played by the sexy Kristanna Lokan. The audience is treated to some nice T&amp;A or the guys are i might add. Then the arrival of the Arnie! , its amazing how this guy looks the same as he did 11 years ago. Same muscle structure and same build. Then the movie takes off and a good pace and good directing. Great action throughout. To fix up and plot holes, this story is almost the same Two Terminators sent back through time one to kill one to protect John Connor played by Nick Stahl, but also there's a new twist. The female "Terminatrix" is sent to kill John's Lutinents since John could not be found and also kill his spouse Catherine Brewster played by pretty Claire Danes. It also reveals how cyberdines project sky net was not destroyed because Catherines father is in charge of the project which is almost complete. The terminator no longer listens to John's commands, but only Catherines. In this film, it starts the War with the machines, thus the title rise of the machines. John realizes that he is no longer going to fight to stop it but go along with his destiny. Also Sara Connor is no longer living she was died from a disease. The end scene is a beautifully tragic in way we don't see a billion people getting blown up. Deff a good addition to the Terminator series. Opening itself up for T4 the future war. Hopefully Arnold will take part in the next series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie isn't made by Cameron thus, I cannot recognize it as true Terminator canon. Cameron was the visionary behind the earlier pictures, he also spoke of a third movie in the mid nineties. I dunno why he's not involved in this one but it shows. Terminator 2 beats this in about every single aspect, T2 had spirit, it awoke emotion and was full of powerful storytelling. T3 is just full of excuses to flash arnie around and blow stuff up. Arnies face mask is a botch job and the computerized effects gleam off plastic-like. The effects are total crap compared to the work done in T2 which even today look spectacular whilst here the effects look flat and unimpressive. Cameron knows storytelling, writing, effects AND individual cast directing, he is a director genius and the Terminator saga pretty much his brainchild, without him and his original Terminator team (including the cast) a Terminator movie is nothing but a meaningless summer action flick. T1 and T2 ruled because they were action films that were also good movies, not just an endless flood of dropping shells and bullets like raindrops...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk to the hand and Arnie will listen.....SPOILERS HEREIN:Not unlike other Terminator movies this third, and seemingly last Terminator flick rocks! When the end of the world becomes inevitable the T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back to the past to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) and his bride to be Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) who happens to be the daughter of the head of the nation's computer defense system which system is trying to get rid of a malicious computer virus with its flawed Skynet program. Before things can go awry with Skynet Connor must warn Brewster's father to not activate Skynet. The couple is chased by T-X (Kristanna Loken) - an extremly beautiful lady who was sent from the future to ignite judgement day. Since there is zero chance of slighting a worldwide attack by machines Arnie chooses to bust jokes and shop wisely at am-pm for Waner Wafers (an austrian speciality) while he is fulfilling his command to protect future leader of the warfare against the machines. Disappointingly to say, but Arnie's fighting scenes with the T-X are for nothing. Eyecatching, but useless for the plot. This time the Terminator does not really have a mission. He is not trying to save the world but trying to extend its existence. Whereas T-X, by the way her real name is Terminatrix, is trying to speed things up.Oh well, the cast is stunning, especially Kristanna Loken, the special effect awesome, the plot ok, the ending sad, and another Trilogy made in Hollywood is complete.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as TerminatorOver the holidays, I had the pleasure of watching Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines. It is an action packed film staring (The Governor of California) Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays the Terminator, Nick Stahl as John Connor, Kristana Lokan as T-X and Clair Danes as Kate Brewster.The film starts out with John Connor who has erased his identity and tries to hide his existence, in fear of being found by another terminator, after the death of his mother Sarah Connor. One day he runs into Kate Brewster who is also going to play an important role in the future of the human beings. After a little while, they're being chased by two terminators. A T-X (played by Kristanna Loken) and a T-800 (the Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger). The T-X is sent to kill a number of people, including Connor and Brewster, and the T-800 is sent to protect the two of them. Suddenly they find themselves fighting against time, to save the humanity from a nuclear war. John and Sarah's objective is to shut down 'Sky Net' which is a high-tech computer system in charge of the worlds Nuclear weapons before time is up.This film is made to look exceptionally futuristic; I think it links in quite a few ways to I.T firstly by having the country's defense system running through artificial intelligence, how T-X was able to hack into the five police cars CPU and control them all simultaneously, and how T-X reprogrammed Terminator to kill John Connor and Kate Brewster.All in all, T3 is a benchmark for 21st century action movies.I'll be back.</fullReview>

I hope that they never make a fourth because then it will totally kill it but it is one of the few that have made it in the so called "good trilogies". Even though there is a different director is stays true to the story and doesn't through too many people off. John Connor is now played by a different character but the actor does a decent job of portraying john. The special effects in this movie were really great and even though you know they are computer animated at times you can't tell because you are so pulled into the movie. This is incredibly action packed as well!(hello, arnold is in it) Anyways, if you are one of the few who has not went and seen this movie please do. You are missing out on an action packed movie.</fullReview>

Then the TX comes from the future to kill Johns comrades in the future cause they cannot find John. After she comes Arnold comes from the future ready to kick some butt. The TX finds John from a blood sample. And chaos and action uncoils. I was loving the fights and all the blowned up cars. So if you have a chance go out and rent this. Its worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Third movies, eh? Not all of them are doomed to be letdowns; "Escape from the Planet of the Apes" was the best of the series after the original, "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors" was the best of the sequels (and, probably not coincidentally, one of the few that Wes Craven had any creative input on), and for the ultimate example of there being exceptions to the rule, look no further than "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." And then there's "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."The first two "Terminator" movies had James Cameron behind them; this one has Jonathan Mostow. Now there's nothing wrong with the boy Mostow ? "Breakdown" proved he can pull off cracking thrillers, and he certainly delivers on the action front here, but the "Terminator" series was always about more than knock-?em-dead action. While he and writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris obey that manifesto here, it's in a different and not necessarily better way for two main reasons; one is that the focus of this movie is more on John Connor here than on John Connor and the Terminator. In the first movie the Terminator and Sarah Connor were equals (sorry, Kyle Reese fans); in the second movie saw them almost as a family unit. This time, it's more about the troubled and older John than the machines, which sounds good in a way, but it just helps add to the general grim, defeatist air throughout the movie. Given that this movie is essentially the "Battle for the Planet of the Apes" of the series, bringing everything full circle, it couldn't really be any other way ? but it would make the movie almost a deadening experience were it not for the reason most people choose to see this movie, i.e. the action scenes.Which brings us to reason numero two-o; the writers spend a lot of time playing riffs on the first two movies, with the big chase scene featuring the Terminator on a motorbike chasing a big rig commandeered by the evil Terminator that's chasing our human hero in a smaller vehicle especially amped up here (and with the nice addition of the evil Terminator remote-controlling several other cars to help out in pursuit), and it would work a lot better if it wasn't just a bigger, brawnier relative of a similar moment in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day." (And we don't get "I'll be back" ? but we do get "She'll be back" and "I'm back.") Arnold ? no last name needed ? is still fine when not required to act too much, and as T-X, the cutest cybernetic killing machine you ever did see, Kristanna Loken is effective and much easier on the eyes than Robert Patrick (though not quite as creepy); good effects help, but Marco Beltrami's score doesn't go with the mayhem as well as Brad Fiedel's did for the first two movies, even though it's more listenable away from the visuals than Fiedel's is. (The best track in the movie is Jerry Goldsmith's music for the C2 Pictures logo.)But Nick Stahl as John Connor is no match for Edward Furlong last time out, or the rest of the cast here; his performance underlines the movie's unbalanced priorities ? when the obsolete Terminator and the super-advanced T-X face off, it's hard not to think this should be the real climax of the movie rather than the finale we actually get. "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is the "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" of the series; some good ideas, nice fidelity to the rest of the series - especially in a moment when John realises that this Terminator isn't the same model that visited him in 1991 - and certainly not a bad movie, but ultimately something of a weak little sister. (And is it really asking so much for a movie in which Claire Danes isn't a misery magnet?)</fullReview>

It was James Cameron wrote and directed both the first and second Terminator movies. Both movies were classics.The main problem is that Jonathan Mostow, director of this movie, fails miserably to imitate the genius style of James Cameron. T3 is littered with bad music, cliché dialog, and terrible editing and cinematography. Mostow is about as mediocre of a director as one can be.Honestly, this movie should have never been made. The Terminator series has been spoiled. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects were good and that Kristanna Loken looked absolutely gorgeous.But that's the problem. The main focus of attention was the special effects and Loken. This movie doesn't have any rememberable dialog like the previous one, nor does it capture the audience's emotions during scenes of drama.Do yourself a favor and pretend that this one never existed at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines cashes in on the expectations. This movie could have been a lot worse. Actually the only big difference to it's two predecessors is that the film's not even nearly as dark as Cameron's movies. It is a bit of a problem, since T1 and T2 were perfect borderline horror movies. Especially the original. T3 doesn't take itself as seriously which maybe would've been nice. That said, I must also state that this movie is not bad as a lighthearter Terminator film. It does play with the same serious issues as the originals and the suspense is very well build this time around too. If I'd be asked weather I would recommend this film, the answer would certainly be yes. Arnold is back to doing what he does best, Stahl and Danes are good in the supporting roles and Loken kicks a** as the T-X. Plus there's that groovy chase sequence which is every bit as admirable as the truck chase in T2.**** ? / *****</fullReview>

I didn't mind seeing this movie but it was a huge disappointment when comparing it to the first two terminator movies. Arnold was OK and had a bunch of good one liners But it was obvious that there was just no script to this one. Where was Edward Furlong? He's the best, the one and only John Connor as Arnold is the one and only terminator, coming back again and again. If you are a terminator fan go and let your brain rest while watching this one.If you are not, just wait until it's on any TV channel at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has the Action and entertainment, but lacks the originality and intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To follow up a great film like "Terminator 2 - Judgment Day" (1991), which is probably the best Action-film I've ever seen, is not easy. To be honest...it's nearly impossible. Especially if your name is Jonathan Mostow and not James Cameron. Cameron is one of the best Action-directors ever, with high quality, brilliant and intelligent Action/Science Fiction-films like "The Abyss" (1989), "Aliens" (1986), "The Terminator" (1984) and the mentioned "Terminator 2" under his belt. When I first heard that James Cameron was not going to be involved in "Terminator 3 - The Rise Of The Machines", I knew that it wasn't going to be a film at the level of it's prequels. And after I saw the first trailers, I prepared myself for an almost mindless Action-film, yet an entertaining one (I'm a huge fan of the whole Terminator concept, so that's enough to satisfy me) that was going to do it's best to overwhelm the fantastic Action-sequences of the two other films. Last summer, when I went to the cinema and watched it for the first time, that's almost what i got....John Connor has erased his identity and tries to hide his existence, in fear of being find by another terminator, after the death of his mother Sarah Connor. One day he runs into Kate Brewster who is also going to play an important role in the future of the human beings. After a little while, they're being chased by two terminators. A T-X (played by Kristanna Loken) and a T-800 (the Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger). The T-X is sent to kill a number of people, including Connor and Brewster, and the T-800 is sent to protect the two of them. Suddenly they find themselves fighting against time, to save the humanity from a nuclear war.That's the story of the film...simple as that. But this story definitely provides almost two hours of good entertainment and "non-stop" Action. Because this is the kind of film you can really describe with the mark Non-Stop Action. I've heard that this movie is the most expensive ever made. And after watching the breathtaking Action and Special Effects of this film, I won't doubt that. The ones who loved the first Terminator-films only for the Action-scenes, shouldn't be disappointed. But the ones who also loved the fascinating and originality of the characters and the whole story and concept, is surely to be (at least) a bit disappointed.This is a much more simple movie, compared to it's prequels, and the Action and the Special Effects has to carry the film on it's own. The prequels had some good character-development and good dialogs to put us deep into the brilliance of the story. This film lacks both. Character-development is almost completely absent. And poor performances by Clair Danes and Nick Stahl doesn't make it any better. They should have gotten Edward Furlong to play John Connor, just like he did in the last film. And the dialogs are minimal too. Much of the dialogs are just silly and doesn't grab me the same way as they did especially in "Terminator 2". Even though it has the most simple story of the three films, there's no doubt that this film could have been as good as the two others, only if they would have done it in a better way. I can see the potential just from watching the beginning and the end of the film.But the film is definitely not going downhill all the way. Kristanna Loken is not only a EXTREEEMLY beautiful and sexy woman, but she sure is doing a good job playing the T-X. She really have that robot-look all over her face and body when she moves and talks, and she's almost as frightening as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in "Terminator 2". And Mr. Schwarzenegger...what can I say? He IS the Terminator. He was born to play a machine from the future, and he is just as good as he was in the other films. As mentioned before, this film has the impressive Action from it's prequels, so it's really giving me the right Terminator-feeling. It also has the humor we saw in "Terminator 2", and this time it's even more of it. So people are guaranteed to be entertained.Over all....I pretty much got what I expected from this film. "Terminator 3 - The Rise Of The Machines" has the trademark Terminator-Action and entertainment, but it lacks the originality and the fascinating intelligence of the other Terminator-films. I know there's a "Terminator 4" on the way, which I doubt would be any better than this one. But one can always keep a little hope that the film will be a worthy conclusion to(in my opinion) the best series of Action-movies in film-history. Until then...just grab a bucket of popcorn and enjoy these two hours of wild, high tech Robot-Action.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that it would be very hard to follow on from T2 , but somehow they managed it and I think that although u can guess whats gonna happen in a couple of the scenes, the plot is still cleverly engineered in that it offers superb action scenes that are enjoyable and there is a nice level of tension torwards the end when u see the machines beginning to rise, I particularly liked one scene where there is a giant machine rolling down a hallway and Arnold suddenly bursts through the ceiling, rips it head almost completely off and uses it's gun's to blast at another machine just yards away, I would recommend this to any Terminator fans as it is a powerful chapter in a thrilling saga</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 tries to be what the first 2 are and fails miserably. The casting is wrong, the story is bad, and they're are some things that just make you laugh in disgust. James Cameron was right not to continue with this. Mostow shouldn't have bothered with this, it should have been left alone after the excellent Terminator 2. It should have been different like a giant war in the future with the machines, not a poor re-make.3/10 Because some of the action isn't that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like action movies very much so I watched Terminator 3. I watched all Terminator series. I watched all series in Movie Theater. Now you know how am I Terminator series fun. I thought Terminator 3 was not exciting and not interesting. I think Terminator 2 is better then that films because, action, friend ship, clear picture, music, and every thing are good. A good point of Terminator 3 is that the woman became an enemy's terminator. I think the terminator is popular of action. But an overture is too long and the story of the second half is not interesting. When I watched that I felt this movie was finishes being halfway. Therefore, I thought this movie was not interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3, "Rise of the Machines" is for me that rarest of films - one that I like less with each viewing. That's not to say that it is without redeeming features - it has for example one of the most breathtaking vehicle sequences I can remember seeing - but the writing is generally more like poor fan fiction than a genuine third installment in the series.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOWOn the whole I don't obsess over details between franchise movies, but the abandonment of "no fate but what we make" in favour of an inevitable Judgement Day counts as something more than a detail. John Connor's newfound fatalism is neither particularly believable in view of his history - after all, he *knows* that JD can at least be successfully postponed - nor is it necessary to the plot, since the core of that was lifted straight from its predecessor anyway. This isn't a new movie, so much as a bad case of "well if *I'd* written T2, *I'd* have done it this way". The relentless series of joky back references don't help either, in a film that seems unable to decide whether it wants to be homage, parody or a new perspective on the Terminator story.Once you start to dislike a movie, the plot holes start to annoy you out of all proportion. How does the T-X's ability to manipulate other computers translate to an ability to remotely control vehicles' steering and transmission? Why was the facility that Kate Brewster's father worked out of on such secure military projects, completely unguarded? Why did he have a private plane there? What happened to the laws of motion (particularly the bit about "equal and opposite reaction") during the cartoonish battle of the Terminators in the washroom? What inspired Connor to fire up the 'particle accelerator' and above all, how the hell did he know how to? How come the T-X, which was so badly affected by the (rather disturbing) external magnetic field from the accelerator that her metal was being stripped from her frame was able to wrench an arm away, form an apparently motorised (i.e. magnetic field dependent) saw with a small blade and damage the accelerator enough to escape? Why was an emergency bunker, apparently designed to protect the most senior members of government in the event of war, fully powered up but completely unmanned? How does Arnie manage to restrain the more powerful T-X with both his fuel cells removed? Eventually you start to ask "why did I just spend the last 100 minutes of my life watching this stuff?"The answer is, just so long as you can disengage your brain and watch it for the spectacle, it's a pretty slick show. There's chases and explosions and a cute, blonde and decidedly female villain and just occasionally those back references are amusing. And at least it avoids the problems of franchises like Robocop, where the main character went from virtually indestructible supercyborg in the first movie to spending more time being repaired than fighting crime in the third. These terminators are still determinedly solid killing machines, even if the film does seem to think it has more to say than is really the case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one line summary says it all. I think a sequel should be more than a continuation of the plot. That is, not only should it be faithful to the previous film(s) in story, but in style, theme, innovation, intelligence, etc.*spoilers ahead*Terminator 3 seems to miss these points and comes out as basically a dumbed-down remake of Terminator 2. The plot is virtually the same: a shape-shifting robot comes through time to kill John Connor and "The Arnold" model is sent back to protect him. Can you say "seen this before"?I don't know who was responsible for the design of the T-X, Mostow or Winston, but I gotta ask: why? Who in their right mind would think that if you stick a glowing endoskeleton inside a T-1000, you'd get a more efficient killing machine? What, pray tell, does the endoskeleton contribute? The T-X can't do half the stuff the T-1K did: melt into floors, walk through barred gates, fly into a million pieces and then reassemble. But man, oh man, how are we to destroy this "deadlier" model? Oh, wait, it was as simple as blowing it up! Kudos on the creativity there. So in the end, the T-X met a death that would only delay the T-1K.It's things like this that insult the true fans of the Terminator films. Whereas T1 and T2 were fact-based science fiction, T3 steps over into live acton comic book world. The T-X can change her robotic arm to become a plasma cannon, a flamethrower, a pizza cutter for god's sake! What is this, Transformers? Or the 60's Batman where he's got a convenient tool for every occasion?In another brilliant scene, the T-X transforms her finger into a long needle, injecting several police cars with some kind of electronic signal (or magic potion) that makes the cars obey her every whim. I know Mostow's not a complete idiot and knows that to control a normal car you need to turn the steering wheel, push the pedals, shift the gears MANUALLY (it's a mechanical process). So the only conclusion I can make is that he considers the average audience too dumb to actually know that. Sadly, maybe he's right. But many fans of the Terminator movies are drawn to it because of the films' intelligence. And that intelligence has always come from Jim Cameron. His design for the Terminator endoskeleton was credible: the joints, the muscles, the eyes; you could sit there and actually believe that such a machine could move, climb, simulate a human. Moreover, you could believe that when covered with flesh, such a machine could techincally exist.But in T3, this same Terminator can get its head chopped off, left connected only by wires and then somehow stick it back onto its body like Frankenstein and move it around in subsequent scenes as if nothing happened. In T3, the T-X can remotely control a car. (But if she can do that, she might as well be able to remotely control a pair of scissors, a bike, or a pistol.)Moreover, if Mostow really was as great of a Terminator fan as he claimed to be, he would not have screwed up such details that an Arnold is a T-800 model 101 (not a T-850, not a T-101). Moreover, he would have studied what it really was that made the first two films great, and that was intelligence and ingenuity, not just explosions, chases scenes, and comic book robots with superpowers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical sequel rip-off, but a GREAT COMEDY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ***I was utterly disappointed with T3. Ok, I'm not a fan of Hollywood, and I pity those who are. But T2 was still special, and Arnold is more than just an actor to me, he's more like a god. But this flick.. If I were Arnold, I would break down and cry upon such a disappointing sequel to his T2, which happens to be one of the best sci-fi flicks of all times.I think IMDB should add "comedy" to the list of genres for this movie. There are some scenes that are typicals of a successful comedy, and there are such amateur, impaired, and purely f***ed up scenes that try to be serious, but just make you laugh your ass off. Maybe a sci-fi flick cannot and moreover shouldn't explain everything in a logical way, but even that wouldn't make me forgive the huge error in this movie: Robots give humanly reactions and face gestures! WTF?!?! And the story is getting weaker and weaker.. I think if they try to make a T4, it'll be pure comedy. So I hope they don't try that, for the sake of not insulting the first 2 movies anymore.Other than that, the things humans say, and the way Terminator answers them is simply hillarious! The dialogues, the questions and answers.. Everything!Claire Danes: Go to hell you asshole! - Terminator : Unable to comply.Terminator appears out of the void and saves the heroes' lives among all the explosions and stuff, and says: I'm back. (Oh really? Are you? I thought you were front.. Blah!)How Terminator catches bullets with his teeth, how Kristianna enlarges her boobs (which I'd like to see in another setting *evil grin*) Give me a break! Those are too cheap even for a Hollywood flick!Briefly, I couldn't stop laughing from the first minute of this movie until the last. And it doesn't offer much other than making you laugh in tears, so it qualifies as a perfect comedy. I had the feeling it would be disappointing like this, so I hesitated to watch it. But I couldn't bear the push, and rented the DVD. Do yourself a favour, and DO BEAR that push! Especially if you've seen T2 and liked it, avoid this one. Everything about this movie is just an insult to T1 and T2.A generous 6/10 for T3, and that's for the comedy part ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action, horrible story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard T3 would hit screens, I was expecting it to be of same quality as previous ones, cause I really liked the first two Terminators. Then I heard Cameron wasn't signed to do it. And when I arrived to the cinema and the movie started, I realised my worst fears were true.SPOILERS AHEADMovie started off with horrible voice-over, which explained the situation, so instead of revealing the story bit by bit with mystery factor (like previous ones), it was spat on our face, ready for mindless action. I actually regret paying so much money for seeing this movie. Action was well done, but that doesn't excuse the lack of story, which seemed to be there only to connect all the pointless actionscenes. It seemed like a spoof of first two installments. Although I liked Arnies performance, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were pretty bad. They didn't connect at all and the part where Kate finds out her fiancee has been killed is really really bad. But don't worry - she'll laugh at it with John in a couple of minutes.NO MORE SPOILERSOnly pleasant surprise was the ending (which I'm not gonna spoil for you). Oh yeah... and T-X is pretty hot ;) Rent it and watch it with friends after a couple of beers. Don't expect it to be as good as previous ones. Good sci-fi has been sucked out of it.My rating - 3/10 (only for seeing Kristanna Loken nude from behind).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much an Epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to think what Terminator 3 could have been. It's a good film but it's not the epic that I wanted and not the epic we expected. When looking back at the first two Terminator's the story for The Rise of the Machines is there for the taking and could have been the best 3rd film of a trilogy ever to be made. What was the first problem was Jonathan Mostow. He has made good films in the past and is a good director but to put the helm in his hands to make a film that had to be better than one of the greatest sequels ever made was very risky and extremely stupid. Only one man could have made T3 the epic it deserved to be and that's James Cameron. I was really surprised he even let the movie go ahead because he must have some say over it as he created the characters in the first place. As far as Arnie goes he was as good as ever in his return as The Terminator. I thought the TX played by Kristanna Loken was alright but she didn't put the fear in you like Arnie did with the original and Robert Patrick did with T2. I think they now know that putting a girl in as the new terminator was a different and interesting idea but when watching it back now it looks all a bit silly really and stupid from the word off. I am not being sexist saying that no girl could be a bad ass TX or something, just not her. The most positive thing to come out of the film is Nick Stahl as John Connor. He is brilliant as Connor and makes you thank Mostow for not keeping with Edward Furlong in the first place. What I didn't like was how long it was on for. For a film about a war between the machines and man you have to lengthen the story and it's characters. If this was a warm up film to what is about to come then that is fair enough but I can't see how another Terminator will get made now Arnie is the Governor of California and his run will go well into his early sixties. It all depends on whether he is feeling like Harrison Ford and ready to jump into any film whether it will be action or drama. If T3 is the closure of the story then it ends on a sour point. I thought of many other ways they can carry it on without him but whether that would work remains to be seen.Would they continue the story without Arnie and the more important thing would it be any good? Even though Arnie is not the best of actors anyway his presence in the trilogy is one of the most important in any film ever made and that is important. The way T3 ends is one of the most original and emotional endings I have ever seen and the more I think about the more it makes you look at how different Mostow and Cameron are as directors because I don't think Cameron would have ended it that way. That's where I love what Mostow did with the end of T3 but I still think it should be James Cameron behind the camera. If they both written the film and Cameron directed then we would have had the best of both worlds but it's not like that and future is still not written as far as The Terminator goes and neither is anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classic series is tarnished...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3's plot is basically T2's without Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Edward Furlong as John Connor and in place of Robert Patrick's T-1000 is the new female Terminator played by the beautiful blond, blue eyed Kristanna Loken.John Connor is now a young adult played by Nick Stahl (the little kid from "Man Without A Face" all grown up and now resembling a young Paul Newman). Sarah's dead and John's a drifter who just wanders around because he's still afraid that a Terminator might come knocking on his door if he sets down roots anywhere. That's when the lady Terminator shows up stark naked, kills a woman and steals her clothes and goes around killing a few of John's future 2nd in commands and then tries to kill both John and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who was a mild associate of his when they were kids. That's when Arnold's Terminator shows up to save the day. Did I mention Kate's dad is a general continuing the Skynet project? Well, basically the whole "you can change your destiny" moral from T2 is smashed into the ground in favor of the "destiny is set" moral because Skynet takes over and destroys the world anyway, thanks to the Internet. But John &amp; Kate survive to lead the resistance.Now this isn't a bad film necessarily, but then again, neither was "Indiana Jones &amp; The Temple of Doom". Like that 2nd Indiana Jones feature, T3 doesn't even come close to being the classic that the first two entries were. Arnold's still fun to watch as the Terminator, Nick Stahl is a more sympathetic John Connor than Edward Furlong could ever have hoped to be, Claire Danes is alright but no Linda Hamilton and Kristanna Loken does the stoic female Terminator bit as well as any other actress can, but ultimately the film is hollow, cheesy and pointless. Despite Loken's efforts, she's never as creepy as the T-1000, and not just because she's a beautiful woman who leads the men in the audience to fantasizing about her (and I've seen some pretty creepy women in cinema in my time). The action scenes are executed competently enough but they lack the slickness of T2 and the raw power of the T1.Ultimately, the only reasons for this film being made were to work the Internet into the Terminator mythology and to get a tall, beautiful blond woman Terminator naked to satisfy all the fan boys who wanted a naked Terminator woman. Well, those fantasies are fulfilled early in the film, when Kristanna makes the classic entrance and starts walking around completely naked, but most annoyingly her magnificent 5'11" figure is kept in the shadows for the most, which isn't fair considering that the original film and this film throw Arnold's butt right in our faces, something no one ever wanted to see except maybe his own wife, Maria. You'll have to look closely to see her derriere just before she kills her first victim. And like all women, Kristanna looks better with her hair down.You know what a more interesting film would have been? Setting the film in the actual future and focusing on the beginning of the Terminators then. Arnold could have played a soldier who is killed by the machines and later his body is used as a model for the other Terminators to follow in as the mold.</fullReview>

I figured out how they would kill the T-X when I saw the damaged energy cell explode in the desert and I never figure endings out. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was much better than the other two yet a little depressing. Ok so what didn't I like, I wish this were made a few years earlier, the whole feel was more ominous and we got to see some more future battles and more cool new machines (T-4 anyone?) 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing sequel to a popular story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Terminator film to be made without the guidance and vision of James Cameron, and it certainly suffers as a result. Novice director Jonathan Mostow is way out of his depth and makes the classic mistake of all forgettable sci-fi films, he focuses on the special effects and action sequences and completely ignores the story.Don't get me wrong, the special effects and action sequences are awesome to watch, but hardly compensate for a very sparse story line. As a result, the film is unbalanced and lacks the emotional core of T1 and T2. The heart of those films were the characters. You wanted them to survive, you wanted them to triumph and you cared about what happened to them. And that brings me to the other big problem with T3, Nick Stahl is appallingly miscast. His John Connor is a small, weedy looking guy with no on-screen presence, no charisma and a very limited acting ability. He was irritating to watch and only served to highlight the superficial nature of the story.Such a pity, because there were some genuinely good ideas that with a skilled director and better writers could have made for a truly memorable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator Three could have been way, way worse than it was. Considering the James Cameron had nothing to do with it, it was a reasonable effort. Not brilliant, but reasonable. It would take someone to really get into the mind of James Cameron to have a chance of continuing his efforts in his place, and as this wasn't done the universe of Mostow's film isn't too synchronous with the universe of Cameron's films. Mostow isn't what could be called an all-round director, he's strong on action but weak on everything else especially comedy, although perhaps the writers need to shoulder some of the blame. The new Terminator wasn't too bad, it seemed like an advanced model over the T-1000, if nothing else. The only real question I have to ask is what was Arnie's obsession with sunglasses? (I did have a laugh when he put on the first pair of sunglasses though, about the only joke that didn't make me groan).T3 didn't tarnish the name of Terminator films as much as Alien Resurrection tarnished the Alien films in my opinion. I hope a fourth Terminator isn't being planned as one extra one is enough, anything extra they make will end up being distributed in large numbers as part of future box sets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off the positives this film has some of the most over the top action sequences ever. Like or loathe this movie it will make you sit back and go wow!! every once in a while. Also despite some of the negative comments i've seen Arnie doesn't do a bad job of reprising his role as the Terminator.The main problems I found with this film is that you never really care weather the main protagonists get killed or not. The whole movie feels like a re-hash of Terminator 2, the movie never stops moving and what interaction there is between the characters is normally conducted during a car chase.If they had added maybe 10mins to the runtime and introduced a couple of slower scenes I feel it would have helped the movie and made the wow! moments more effective. There are some glaring plot inconsistancies between this Terminator 1 and T2 which have been discussed in detail elsewhere. But to be honest this film is not trying to be Citizen Caine, it's trying to be a big dumb action movie and in that respect it succeeds.Overall it's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. It's perfect cinema or DVD rental popcorn fodder. Sit back enjoy the action and don't think too hard and you'll get an enjoyable evenings entertainment, does what it set out to do and no more 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel that had James Cameron been involved in this film, it would have been a different story altogether. I have always loved Mr. Cameron's work and I know that himself and Arnold Schwarzenegger make a good team. When I found out Mr. Cameron was not working on T3 I knew it wouldn't have the same 'feel' to it as T1 and T2 had. T1 had a scary / fearful-like sensation. T2 was the same, where by Sarah Connor, John Connor and the T-101 were running away from the T1000. Good storyline and plenty of plot and action. T3 as soon as it started u could feel it was not going to be the same. The past two Terminator movies started with a future image, the began showing the Terminator arriving. Then seeing the enemy. In this case we saw John Connor's life, the TX arrive cause a stir. The see the Terminator arrive, to then take part in a humorous plot.I loved every minute of the movie because I was excited to see it. But in comparison to the last two, I was disappointed in the storyline / plot.I sure hope there is a T4 or that James Cameron does a remake of T3. His way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERSNah, I'm only kidding, this second Terminator sequel isn't actually that bad to be honest. That said, I have only seen it the once, and can't imagine its thin-even-by-Terminator-standards plot really holding my attention a second time.The original still holds its place as a quite impressive arthouse SF thriller in my opinion. Judgement Day? Well, it depends on how I view it - sometimes it's an overlong moronfest, others it's an exciting FX extravaganza and others it's a soulless, noisy popcorn machine. Certainly the day I posted my review of it to the IMDb I wasn't looking on favourably, though it's clearly superior to this pedestrian follow-up.What plot T3 does have (and with its subtitle "Rise of the Machines" it could arguably be taken to court under the Trading Standards Agreement) seems to be dividing into two unequal halves. Remember those really corny episodes of Knight Rider (okay, all episodes of Knight Rider were really corny, but roll with me) where an evil KITT known as KARR would control Michael Knight's vehicle and turn it against him? Michael would have to stand there arguing with KITT's sense of reason? Even back in the days of David Hasselhoff's 80s perm that was dated, but here we have similar shenanigans with Arnie's battered T-101 under the control of the TX. The other, much larger, half comes directly from a straight rehash of Judgement Day.Unfortunately, this does get rather silly as it means that while the film delivers a reasonable twist, it does yet again contradict itself. The nuclear war will come... no it won't... yes it does. Though this development makes the phrase "I am" possibly the most predictable in cinema history, the nuclear explosions are made to look quite beautiful. Whether this is a good thing or not is open to debate, and maybe with a bit of post 9/11 angst this would have made the film feel relevant, rather than just an old relic trying to relive glory days.Of course, the biggest problem making this an okay sequel instead of one you actually give a toss about is the TX. When a character is so rigidly defined by their sexuality as Kristanna Loken is, then it removes all tension. It's just not possible to be scared when your libido is being forced to work, and even by T2's standards there's an enormous amount of obvious humour, pushing it beyond parody at times. Okay, I did shame myself by laughing at the gay gag, but when it gets to the stage of the TX checking her reflection and squeezing Arnie's balls it's just gone too far. And with her superpowers there to attempt to top Robert Patrick's superb T-1000, we get silliness like her power over other machines and inflatable breasts. If the inevitable fourth film continues to build on this we'll soon have flying Terminators that can assume the form of small rodents.An okayish script is often dumb, allowing for back-slapping cameos by Dr. Silberman, and a nauseating plane scene where Clare Danes contrivedly explains how she used to test fly her brother's. Generally though, while there's the traditional reams of exposition in between pointless explosions, this isn't so contrived, and even offers up intriguing possibilities with the foretold death of John Connor. Commendably, even the paradoxes inherent in the concept are addressed, with Connor (Nick Stahl, quite good) reasoning that their actions may make the T-101 cease to exist.If I really wanted to be nit-picky I could cite the incredibly crude uses of product placement, but instead I'll just ask the question of what new does this sequel bring to the party? The answer is nothing. There is no real reason for this sequel to exist, though it is nice to see Arnie having another hit, when his lower-key successes of late have all been worthwhile (though The 6th Day was a stinker).The lack of usage of the theme and that eerie android sound effect surprise, yet the FX are, naturally, technically the most proficient. However, Jonathan Mostow's leaden direction fails to work them in any innovative way (and why do the Terminators now arrive in a disco mirrorball?), meaning they fail to impress. Combine this with the fact that such effects are no longer groundbreaking, as they were for T2, and it's something of a let-down. Forward to 2004 and we now have Governor Schwarzenegger of California. Was this his half-hearted farewell?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Machines Rise Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was a project that had nothing going for it. Without James Cameron behind the camera (or involved in any way at all), many thought the project was doomed from day one. With a new director, Jonathan Mostow (U-571), a new John Connor, Nick Stahl (Bully), and a story that seemed like a rehash of Terminator 2: Judgment Day it seemed that the naysayers would be right. I am pleased to say that they were only half correct about this film.Ten years after John and Sarah Connor, with the help of a friendlier T-800, were able to stop the T-1000 and Judgment Day, John is in hiding. His fears prove to be well-founded as another, later model terminator, the T-X (the smashingly gorgeous Kristanna Loken), travels back to 2003 with a new mission. In the midst of the chaos, John meets Kate Brewster (Claire Danes of My So-Called Life fame), and it seems that their meeting at this time is not so much coincidence. A T-800 (Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads John and Kate on a journey to learn the truth behind Judgement Day and to stop the T-X.Terminator 3 is not the bomb that many thought it was going to be. Mostow is wise enough to keep the tone and the look of the movie close enough to Cameron's style as to not alienate this film from the rest of the series. He does, however, throw enough of his own flair into the mix that we do not feel we are watching an exact replica of Judgment Day. There are scenes of action in this film that are simply breathtaking to behold. Not thirty minutes into the movie one of the greatest scenes of vehicular mass destruction takes places and the movie rarely lets up until the end. The film begins to border ridiculousness in the action arena when you begin to notice that something blows up every ten to fifteen minutes. Fortunately, however, each and every action scene is a joy to watch.The actors here are all very strong. Schwarzenegger and Loken are both excellent in their parts. Arnold would have had no excuse to not play a perfect terminator; the real worry lay with the ability of Loken, a virtual unknown, to carry such a heavy role. Loken is a real delight as the T-X with her ability to create small moments with only her head and face movements. Nick Stahl is believable as John Connor and does a good job throughout. Claire Danes is decent in her role though she would qualify as the weakest link amongst the cast.The real problem with the movie is the script. As hard as it tries, the story here is nothing we haven't seen from a Terminator film. Its good terminator versus bad terminator premise was carried out to much greater effect ten years ago with Judgment Day. The time-travel aspect and inherent paradoxes therein reach a new level of confusion in this film as both terminators have unnatural knowledge of each other's movements from the very beginning and the audience is left to wonder why this movie needed to be created after the finality of the last film. Also, there is far too much goofiness involving Arnold's terminator. Where Terminator 2 used carefully placed and crafted bits of humor to showcase the small bit of humanity contained within the machine, Terminator 3 uses the terminator as ludicrous comic relief when none is needed. Finally, the much talked about ending is admittedly a little weak and underwhelming in light of the rest of the film.There is no escaping comparison to the two films that came before Rise of the Machines. The first two in the trilogy are true examples of modern classics. While Terminator 3 tries its best, it is by far the weakest of the series. The admirable job done by the cast and crew to ensure this films place in the series, however, is to be commended. With less brains and more popcorn value, this film should satisfy most fans of the action filled saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ending to a mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO SPOILERSIf you want to learn about the ending of this film, go ahead and read some of the other reviews here that contain spoilers. I'll just add my agreement that it was both well-done and fit perfectly with the overall tone of the three movies.OVERALL REVIEWThere are so many plot holes and silly devices that are wholly unnecessary. It seems the director had a certain artistic vision and was going to make a movie to fit that vision, come hell or high water. Some obvious items of stupidity:* If the female terminator (terminatrix?) is such an efficient killing machine, why does she choose to wear high heels which are totally impractical to the business of chasing people down?* If she has such incredible powers to remotely control basic machines, why doesn't she use these powers to stop the very vehicles the good guys are using to get away?* If the magnet is so powerful that it can hold back the super-strength of the terminatrix, how is John Connor able to keep carrying his guns?* Why does Connor seem surprised that the terminator (Arnold) doesn't recognize him from ten years ago? After all, Connor helped destroy the terminator from T2, so he knows this one can't be the same machine, right?Anyway, the movie as a whole doesn't really make much sense. The plot is basically identical to T2, with a few twists to make it interesting. The special FX are good as expected, but really don't have any of the "wow" above and beyond the type of stuff we have already seen elsewhere.RECOMMENDATIONRent it for a rainy Saturday, and definitely watch all the way through to the very-worthwhile ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingenious ending, but overall disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: ENDING SPOILERS!!!If ever there was a project doomed from the very start, it had to be T3. The making of a terminator film without either James Cameron or Linda Hamilton was a recipe for disaster, and even mighty Arnold isn't what he once was. On top of that, the new director is Jonathan Mostow, a man whose only credits thus far have both been mediocre action flicks. And we end up with...A mediocre action flick. Well, that's better than I'd expected.Actually, this whole movie plays like a big piece of self-parody. It is undisputed fact the heyday of Schwarzenegger-style action is over, yet they still keep trying here. Nick Stahl, who has inexplicably been cast in the role of John Connor despite being the least heroic, least imposing, and least edgy actor working today, is a waste of space, and the moment at the beginning that shows him made up to look like his future self is the purest agony. Please Mostow! Cameron picked Edward Furlong and Michael Richards, BOTH of whom were perfect! Is this really the best you can do?When compared to Robert Patrick's cold menace as the T-1000, Kristanna Loken is a waste of space as the T-X. She generates any menace only in the single shot used ubiquitously in the trailers, so it's one long letdown in the theatre. The new terminator's abilities are incredibly badly explained, and they also look stupid. And Claire Danes. I have nothing against Claire Danes. I like Clair Danes. She was great as Juliet, I loved her in The Hours, and she did a great voice for San in Princess Mononoke. But she is not Sarah Connor, nor will she ever be any substitute Sarah Connor awkwardly shoehorned as John's future wife to cover the fact that Linda Hamilton was smart enough to skip this project.The action, as stated earlier, is mediocre at best. Cameron's gift for pushing the envelope is sorely missed. A fetish for big trucks, so subtly worked into the first two, sticks out Arnold's ridiculous new "nuclear cell" here. Mostow tries, and fails, to spice things up with some pointless gore and exposition, but neither works.Now, finally, the good news. When we get to the titular event, which comprises the last act, things improve considerably. With a host of early-model HKs to play with, for the first time, we actually get some action scenes that not only get the adrenaline pumping, but do so an almost Cameron scale. We also see some actual Terminator-style production design for the first time in the film.And then, there's the ending. Total nuclear annihilation. That's a courageous enough act of narrative to make me forgive a lot, and plus, its handling is sublime. Though that's largely because it's done in narration and we don't have to see Nick Stahl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as sharp as the original two films - SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 was probably set to not reach the same heights as the two previous entries. James Cameron, Eddie Furlong and Linda Hamilton were not involved with it - a shame :(. Also - I thought that they rapped the series up nicely at the end of the second film (destroying the last remnants of the Terminators to prevent Judgment Day from happening).... However in Hollywood - when anyone is on a good thing - they will milk it to get a few bucks out of it. Thus a few plot holes were exploited and... surprise-surprise - the machines live on. Terminator 3 opens up with John Conner (now 20-something) who is a drifter - not wanting to be connected to the system. We learn that Judgment Day was only delayed from T2 - not preventing. Of course - they send two terminators from the future to hunt and kill all the future leaders of the human resistance. This film isn't all that bad - I just don't think it reaches the high heights of the first two. Cameron (when making sequels) - tends to follow the same rules of the first movie - while giving it a whole new fresh appeal. Sadly - T3 doesn't feel as fresh as the first two and it tends to bend the rules a bit for its own devices. Nor does the movie follow the basic plot lines of the original two films. The Terminatrix is a good idea (to be female) - but doesn't reach the same levels of brutality as Arnie in the first movie and the T-1000 in the second. Plus - it doesn't feel that radically different from the T-1000 (which was just a pleasure in T2)... all the shape shifting aspects are still there - but she just seems to have a few bells and whistles attached for fun (eg: controlling other machines / can fire off weapons). I don't think they play off the Terminatrix's powers off to full potential - which was a shame. Overall - I don't think it is a bad movie - its just that it tries to be a different movie from the first two - without succeeding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unexpectedly fun and decent sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a lot of negative things about 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' so far, here on IMDb as well as in newspapers and magazines. A lot of (professional) reviewers meant that the film had clearly only been made to cash in some extra money by milking a familiar concept and that it did not live up to the expectations.Although we are all entitled to our own opinions, I must say that I find most of this rather unfair. There aren't many third installments in a series that actually live up to their expectations (there aren't many first-sequels that do either, but T2 - although not as good as the original in my opinion - pulled that one off as well). The main reason for this is that most follow-ups simply try too hard; most producers think that what the audience wants is simply more action, bigger explosions and tougher opposition for the good guys. Therefor this is what we have come to expect and I think it speaks in T3's favour that it was not what we got. Mind you, it's not that the audience is getting less action than in the first two films, the makers just decided not to add to the abundance already there.One of the best things about this film is that it does not take itself too seriously. A lot of the one-liners (inevitable in films of this sort) are puns on the ones from the previous two films, and in some small scenes T3 actually makes fun of the entire franchise thus creating a parody of itself. In a way this puts things back into perspective, saying: "look, we know it's corny, implausible and an exhausted formula, but it's good fun so what the heck."And good fun is exactly what this film is trying to be, nothing more and nothing less, and in that it has succeeded. To the filmmakers' credit the film didn't turn out to be pretentious, they didn't blow it by going over the top and they nicely wrapped up the trilogy plot-wise in the end thus avoiding all the pitfalls you might encounter when completing a series. It seems that the entire crew had a lot of fun making this film and it clearly shows.The only thing I can say to those who have already seen the film and found it 'not living up to their expectations' is that it 'would' have if the studios were truly trying to milk the concept, but that they would probably have found it an even worse film as well. Those who are still planning on seeing this film I would advise to simply not expect anything at all and judge the film on its own merits; as you should with any film you watch.</fullReview>

And this "John Conner" did not really show himself to be resourceful at all---meaning he didn't seem "special" enough to carry on this lopsided fight between humans and machines. Whereas the young Furlong in T2 was maybe the most impressive kid I've seen in the movies--while managing to be utterly real!The twist at the end was indeed pretty cool though. Nice.

		<fullReview>Let me first start by saying, Thank god this movie did not ruin the Terminator saga. For years I've been waiting for this film to arrive, and ever since it was first announced I never had negative thoughts on this movie. After those 3 years of waiting, I must say that I'm impressed by Mostows final product. No, it's not a Masterpiece like James Cameron's first two installments, buts its a worthy sequel. Alot of people have complained that there are too many plot holes, but there are no fewer plot holes than that of its 2 predecessors. The screenwriters and Mostow handled the continuation of T2 well. Don't get me wrong, this movie has its flaws, and YES James Camerons touch is missing, but does that make it a bad movie? No. 12 years is a long time to make a sequel, and based off of how poor some sequels are, I'm glad this one ended up a winner, box-office wise and critic wise. So on that note, congrats Arnold, Nick, Kristana, Clair etc...We now have another worthy entry into the collection of Sci-Fi trilogies. Hell, even bring on a Terminator 4.Rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worthy of the heritage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should never have been made; James Cameron knew this, so did Linda Hamilton, unfortunately for the movie-going public Jonathan Mostow did not. The plot is referential to the vastly superior T2, to the point that the premise is almost exactly the same, aside from the gender of the villain. Arnie saves John Connor, check. Morphing bad guy, check. And so on. The major problem with this approach, apart from the fact that it makes for an unoriginal movie, is that Mostow does not have the justification to do it. He had no active involvement in the production of T2, therefore never earned the right to exploit the ideas of those who were involved.Another problem with Mostow's approach to T3 is his unwitting insistence that more must mean better; a perspective undoubtedly conduced by the $170m budget. Witness the over-exuberant time machine bubbles that the Terminators arrive in - retaining similar effect to the first two films would have enhanced continuity and proved less of an irritating visual distraction. Obviously Mostow has not learnt when it is right to borrow.All the blame for the flaws of this film cannot be lumped on Mostow's shoulders - the scriptwriter should take his weight. Admittedly, there were sporadic witty one-liners, but the major fault was a lack of attempt to capture audience involvement. The whole beauty of T2 was the subtext of the father-son relationship between the robot and the boy; executed so well that what could easily have been a tacky ending really worked. All that the death of Arnie elicited in T3 was a sigh of relief that the film must be reaching the end.A do not consider this film a sequel. Period. 1 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite up to scratch with the first two, but still entertaining(spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the superlative first two "Terminator" films, there seems to be little need for a third movie about the eponymous cybernetic assassin. Yet this is what director Jonathan Mostow has produced, to surprisingly positive acclaim. While this effort is certainly not a classic in the same league as its predecessors, "Terminator 3" is still an entertaining and inventive sci-fi thriller.John Connor (Nick Stahl), once set to be mankind's future saviour, is now a computer hacker in his early twenties who lives on the road by his wits. His mother Sarah (the Linda Hamilton character from the first two films) has died of leukaemia since the events of the last film. Unbeknownst to him, the apocalypse he thought he'd averted several years ago is nearly upon him. And once again he finds himself the target of two Terminators: one out to protect him, the other to destroy him. The nightmare begins again...The film's main strength is its excellent array of action sequences and effects. Highlights include an inventive truck/car/bike chase sequence, a showdown in a weapons factory, a chaotic but oddly eerie shootout in a mortuary/graveyard, and the final confrontation in a desert retreat.The acting is a quite mixed ranging from good to merely adequate. Nick Stahl is good as John Connor, but does not bring enough depth or pathos to the role. Claire Danes is on fine form as his romantic interest, and has a good relationship with her tragic father (David Andrews). Sadly there is a lack of romantic chemistry between her and Connor that leadens too many dramatic scenes.As for Arnie, well, he said he'd be back and he is. Not once looking self-conscious or uncomfortable, Schwarznegger slips very easily back into the role that made him a star. With the actor's recent foray into US politics, this is likely to be his last role for some time. He handles all action and dramatic scenes very well. It is both surprising and endearing that an actor of limited range like Schwarznegger can add depth and substance to what is mostly a one-note part. Kristinna Loken is his new opponent, a T-X who simulates radio signals and whose arms can turn into rapid-firing machine guns. With a lithe figure and menacing stare, Loken has a sinister screen presence.The script here is OK, but nothing special and could have done without the pointless self-referentialism. The story is very good, though, and presents us with an unexpectedly gloomy ending that sets the stage for further films."Terminator 3: Rise of Machines is not perfect but possesses enough action and just enough substance to make it a worthwhile flick.</fullReview>

The second broke new ground with it's CGI but once the "ooh, aah factor" wore off it seems like an above average action movie. The third fall into the same camp as the second without the "ooh, aah factor". While Cameron's touch and Hamilton's &amp; Furlong presence were missed I found Mostow's direction was tight and very fasted paced for what it was (I'd only seen one of his previous films BREAKDOWN, which I really liked).

		<shortDescription>Terminator three or two and a half?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was like many of you who waited, longed and prayed for the third instalment of was, a simply remarkable story exceptionally transferred to the screen by James Cameron. The Terminator (1984) and T2: Judgement Day (1991) will forever be referred to as landmark movies; the first, a dark, graphic, cult horror and the latter, six years later - a visually stunning action sequel which further developed the complex narrative bringing us to a mouth watering conclusion which left those of us, rather sad hardcore fan's, still emotionally attached to our Terminator and begging for a third to be created someway... somehow... We all sat and thought about it didn't we? Countless times after re-watching the T2 we envisaged the third... Somehow, after clearing up the mess in the Steel Factory, some fat, hard hat wearing extra, would find Arnie's Arm and hand it to the Police... a twist and a turn later, and Skynet is a reality once more... Then... What would T3 be like? A war in the future surely? That's what we were all craving for... we had the past...(T1) we had the present (T2) and as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines lands before our drooling tongues... we have... the present again... (strange though, how 1991 seems to reflect reality as we know it, a whole more 'realistically' than our 2003 version.) So the narrative moves absolutely nowhere. A more credible title may have been, 'Terminator 2, and a half' and lets face it, the casting director may as well have brought in the likes of Lesley Neilson as the TX, for all the humour that Mostow thought would lure the sceptical audience members into giving the movie a chance. But I guess with a duo of disillusionment in Nick Stahl - a weak, unconvincing development from Edward Furlong's portrayal of the rebellious John Conner and Claire Danes, a pretty but in no-way, shape or form a replacement for Linda Hamilton's hard, masculine heroine, the audience can do nothing but accept this a parody of the first two.In my opinion, there is no need for such blatant humour in a movie narrative that was originally motivated from a deep conscious paranoia of nuclear war and technological change. T3 should have brought into contention themes that are still relevant and scare us today. We know too much about computer technology to be taken in by idea of 'Software in Cyberspace'.In conclusion I will say that 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' needed to strike a cord with our fears to really polish off the trilogy and those fears breed within the anxiety of 'an unknown FUTURE'.This was, without doubt a terrible, terrible movie whose profits only have the first two instalments to thank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm quite partial to the terminator series, and having been on the ''T2 - Battle Across Time'' experience at universal studios Florida, I was quite confused as why the film makers would wish to under whelm us with this run of the mill action film.It represents a very miniscule step forward in plot. In fact an obvious, boring, idea. Which is think Cameron avoided telling us for a reason. Its blatant that the machines rise. What could have been a great trilogy in cinematic history has been reduced (as with star wars) to a money making get rich quick scheme for the producers.I can't wait to see ''Terminator 15: liquid metal elephant across time to approximately yesterday to pick up the paper because they never got it and it had some coupons that they wanted to get 5 dollars off at the sizzler, I know its a boring story and we used the same one for all the other movies but we have a terminator elephant! come on, you have to come and see this movie'' very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3: This was a terrible, terrible movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was like many of you who waited, longed and prayed for the third instalment of was a simply remarkable story and exceptionally transferred to the screen by James Cameron. The Terminator (1984) and T2: Judgement Day (1991) will forever be referred to as landmark movies; the first, a dark, graphic, cult horror and the latter six years later - a visually stunning action sequel which further developed the complex narrative tale, bringing us to a mouth watering conclusion which left those of us, rather sad hardcore fan's still emotionally attached to our Terminator and begging for a third to be created someway... somehow... We all sat and thought about it didn't we? Countless times after re-watching the T2 we envisaged the third... Somehow, after clearing up the mess in the Steel Factory, some fat, hard hat wearing extra, would find Arnie's Arm and hand it to the Police... a twist and a turn later, and Skynet is a reality once more... Then... What would T3 be like? A war in the future surely? That's what we were all craving for... we had the past... we had the present, and as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines lands before our drooling tongues... we have... the present again... (strange though, how 1991 seems to reflect reality as we know it, a whole more 'realistically' than our 2003 version.) So the narrative moves absolutely nowhere. A more credible title may have been, 'Terminator 2, and a half' and lets face it, the casting director may as well have brought in the likes of Lesley Neilson as the TX, for all the 'humour' that Mostow thought would lure the sceptical audience into 'giving the movie a chance'. But I guess with a duo of disillusionment in Nick Stahl - a weak, unconvincing development from Edward Furlong's portrayal of the rebellious John Conner and Claire Danes, a pretty but in no-way, shape or form a replacement for Linda Hamilton's hard, masculine heroine, the audience can do nothing but accept this a parody of the first two.In my opinion, there is no need for humour in a movie narrative that was originally motivated from a deep conscious paranoia of nuclear war and technological change. T3 should have brought into contention themes that are still relevant and scare us today. We know too much about computer technology to be taken in by idea of 'Software in Cyberspace'.In conclusion I will say that 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' needed to strike a cord with our fears to really polish off the trilogy and those fears breed within the anxiety of 'an unknown FUTURE'.This was, without doubt a terrible, terrible movie whose profits only have the first two instalments to thank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The follow up, to the movie that had already ended. it reminds me about the follow ups to the Matrix trilogy, but never mind.I had no expectations, what so ever, to this film. Comments i've heard was'nt on the supporting side of it.*** Spoilers everywhere! ***It starts out with the same lines that T2 ended with. "There are no fate/destiny but the ones we make for ourself"(or something like it)John Connor is alone, he has no mother anymore, no father. he is on the edge of life... until he gets caught in a dog cage, trying to get awat from a kennel. At the time a female terminator is coming to that kennel to terminate both him, and a woman he knew for a long time ago. Still there is no suspension , there is no meaning of this film you think.Then Arnold comes and saves the day, and they (John, ´T-101 , and she.. that i couldnt remember the name to ) goes on a trip to stop judgment ay from happening. They come to about 5 places, which arent intresting at all, it feels like you've seen everyplace before (Pheraps the trailer?)The time it changes, is when John and the Woman is flying to prevent judgment day, and Arnie's shutting down himself to "save" them. About then you start getting that old T2 "love between human and robot" feeling again. and it continues, when they accept judment day and that a war is coming. Man! its like some energy the movies builded up when it sucks, just been released.But still, it didnt be as dark, exciting as the other ones.So i'll give it a 7/10.See it, its important, if you like T2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After sitting through that mess that was T2 I swore I would try and forget that The Terminator ever had a sequel. Edward Furlong's John Connor made me want to terminate him in T2 with his teenage angst and attempts to be cute, Arnie turned an incredible creation into a cuddly teddy bear although I didn't actually puke until the end and that thumbs up. Well I finally gave T3 a chance once I saw that Edward Furlong wasn't in it and that it wasn't directed by James Cameron (thank God). T3 is everything that T2 should have been, hard hitting, funny, explosive but without the schmalz. It is thought provoking and you genuinely care about the characters rather than just want them to die as quickly as possible (a la T2). Seems that plenty of people here have Cameronitis and won't accept anyone else can make a decent movie of a property that Cameron has done before. Get real folks, Mostow has made a terrific movie and T3 deserves to be judged on its own merits not slammed cos it ain't Cameron. 9/10</fullReview>

T2 was without a doubt in my mind the greatest action/scifi movie ever made and in my opinion the greatest movie of all time.

		<shortDescription>T3 - weakest of the trilogy but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the movie (big screen) I was disappointed 6/10 - admittedly T2 was a hard act to follow. However on seeing the movie again at home it made more sense and I enjoyed it more 7/10 (Terminator 8, T2 9-10).Yeah so it is a CGI and action fest. But care has gone into trying to link the T3 to T and T2, especially John Conner's part in it. How does one come to an acceptance of a prophecy, that one is destined to be the Saviour Of The World? So one thing I thought was credibly done was how Connor (Nick Stahl) and Brewster (Claire Danes) came slowly, kicking &amp; screaming to the realisation and acceptance of their pivotal roles in the future saving of humanity.One major criticism to my mind is the mismatch between Connor and Brewster in apparent age. I suspect this was done in part to make them look like the oddest and unlikeliest of couples, but he looks like barely out of high school, while she looks like in her late 20s (not that I'd kick her out of bed..).As for Arnie and Kristanna Loken (the T-X), well they are after all robots and in the movie unfortunately do not seem to have much character beyond that, contrasting sharply with T2 where Arnie achieves believable defacto father-figure status. In T3, the sense of the relentless pursuit of the T-1000 in T2 is missing, despite her embellished gizmos and supposedly superior mental abilities (little in evidence).In retrospect T2 and T3 seem to be misnamed. The focus of T2 was the T-1000 itself, whereas T3 rushes to and culminates in Judgement Day. Rise of the Machines seems to only be in its most embryonic stage in T3, so the series is left open (I suppose) to a 4th movie where the machines do actually rise and are defeated, though with flagging interest in T3 and a known outcome in "T4" it might be a brave studio who risks it.</fullReview>

When I see the movie I thought it was OK with many funny bits in,but it just doesn't have that Terminator feeling like the other two. I believe the movie would have been alot better if James Cameron directed it. The T-X was meant to be the deadliest Terminator of all but I think the T-1000 was more deadlier from T-2.

		<fullReview>Years where T2 left off, John Connor has no location where he can be spotted, by anyone. At this time, a female terminatrix, the T-X, is sent to eliminate all of the generals of the future war, including John Connor. Another terminator is sent to protect John, and John's old friend, Kate. They travel to the main headquarters of SkyNet/Cyberdyne, and try to prevent Judgment Day and the machines rising.Good sequel to T2, but still isn't nearly as good. The movie is action-packed and has some really funny one-liners, but the story is recycled and has been used twice already. The ending is pretty good, but I wish it was very different (didn't want to include spoilers). Mostow does a good job of directing, but he's nothing compared to Cameron.3.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>does not stand up to its predecessors.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is different to its predecessors in both look and story and while it does not stand up to the first two, I think Jonathan Mostow has done a commendable job. Considering he had to follow up such highly regarded sci-fi films, the outcome is more than acceptable and does not ruin the Terminator name.Much like his previous film Breakdown, Mostow is more concerned with keeping a breakneck pace and the level of tension high at all times. This often comes at the expense of character development and logic, but it hardly matters, as this movie is great fun from start to finish.(Possible Spoilers)Nick Stahl gives a reasonable performance as John Connor, who has now isolated himself from people and lives in fear. We learn that Judgement Day never occurred and was only postponed due to the events in Terminator 2. Now this time a female terminator, the TX (Kristanna Loken), has been sent back in time to stop John Connor from leading the revolution against the machines and another terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent to protect him. T3 principally follows the same plotline as T2 with an increased emphasis on action. The introduction of Clare Danes, as Kate Brewster, adds a strong female presence to the film and it just so happens that the writers found an inventive way to implement her into the story.The action scenes in T3 are the highlight. What is great to see in this time of overblown CG effects is a film that is heavy on real stunts and practical special effects. The crane chase is certainly up there as one the great movie chases even surpassing the CG reliant freeway chase in The Matrix Reloaded.T3 delivers some memorable action scenes, special effects and adequate story. Just as long as you don't expect something that will top its god-like predecessors, you will have an enjoyable ride.7 out of 10</fullReview>

Terminator 2 all over again, albeit with a twist.I was really hoping that this film would be set in the future wars as the first two movies were essentially a chase plot, now we have a third chase plot.The fan part of me enjoyed parts of the film though, such as the t101's battery exploding in the desert, very funny.The story seemed to have a very sudden end to it as well, kinda like a 'don't miss the next part' feeling.

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but it can't hold a candle to T2.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS This is a very well done action film that's really fun to watch. Acting and special effects are excellent, and Arnold is funny as usual. But it actually does disappoint somewhat, because of course Sarah is gone and John is played by a different actor. The guy who plays John does a good job, but he just doesn't seem like the same person. I'm not sure it would have been much better with Edward Furlong playing the part, though, since this installment of the series lacks both the dark and brutal atmosphere of T1 and the emotional warmth and thought-provoking depth of T2. Those hoping for any deep connection between John and his protector in this episode will be disappointed. This is a straightforward action flick that doesn't leave much room for that kind of development. And I do like Claire Danes, she always seems to put her all into a performance, but her character didn't really add much to the story. In T1 and T2, Sarah goes from an innocent young girl to a hardened warrior. Danes doesn't seem to do anything but scream and get knocked around. T3 is fun to watch, however, and the new female Terminator does some pretty cool tricks, though she isn't nearly as creepy as Richard Patrick's T-1000. All in all it's worth renting and even buying, as long as you're not expecting it to top T2, which was a masterpiece and the end of the story, as far as I'm concerned.PS - To those of you who think this was better than T2, please get real here. T2 was more than just an action/sci-fi flick, it was a deeply human story that had something important to say, while T3 is basically just a long, entertaining action sequence. Ok, I'll shut up now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one sequel too many - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think there is an unwritten law about Hollywood that goes somewhat like: "There can be only one good sequel." On most occations sequels rarely surpass the original and I have to say my expectations were pretty high for a second sequel like T3 when I heard about it. After all Cameron has managed to make some fairly good sequels. Then I found out Cameron was not on the job. My expectations dropped. Not that I'm a Cameron fanatic, don't get me wrong - it's just that I had never even heard of Mostow before. Well let's make a long story short: I went to the movies and was at first pretty satisfied with the film. First impression good. However, the more I started analyzing it, the less I liked it. The plot was really just taken directly out of T2 and modified in a way to make it seem like new. Nothing new here, except this time the villain is in female form - that and John is older. By the time we get to the action (not too long) I started noticing how the pace of the movie has ruined it. The makers clearly thought that if there is enough action people forget about the plot holes. They had the inevitable car crashing bashing scene (please, haven't we seen enough of these already, they're in -every- action flick today!) and our heroes were so busy running around they didn't even have time to go over the situation. Character development: totally unbelievable (can't say more, I'd be spoiling). They couldn't make the story hold anymore, and what's worse it's still left open for a fourth episode. The only part about this movie that I really enjoyed was Arnold. He is the sole reason to see the movie. His one-liners and cheesy accent are still worth a couple of laughs. And he does have a few new ones too. All in all, the movie was ok, but that's just it. It wasn't great like it's predecessors. And I'm not going to say Cameron could have saved it, but I'm saying maybe Cameron had a reason for dumping the project. Compared to some other action movies today T3 is actually quite descent, but it doesn't even nearly live up to the greatness of T2 or the freshness of T1. If all you care for is action though, you could do a lot worse. grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came into this movie looking for a post apocalyptic fight against robots. I would have loved for the movie to open with Armageddon. Nope, it was not like that. It ended up being about the pre-apocalypse. Once again Terminator robots are sent to the past to terminate John Conner and his future helpers. In other words this movie is exactly like T2, but the only difference is they chase John 10-15 years later. Instead of trying to kill his mom, they are trying to kill his future wife.That is kind of disappointing. I really would have loved to see John fight the robots in the future. Well hopefully James Cameron will be brought on to direct T4, The final battle.The movie itself was a great action picture. The special effects were awesome. Very memorable was the chase scene involving a crane, a motorcycle, police cars, ambulance, and a fire engine.Question how did the female terminator control the vehicles during the chase scene? A car's acceleration and braking is not computer controlled. In the movie you see the gas pedal being pressed down by the terminator even though she is not in the car.8.5/10 (I only gave a high review because of great special effects), but then again I am the drunken_critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3 = Missing Key Ingredients</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a marketing viewpoint the movie has achieved its objective: The movie is fast and packed with explosions, gore, sexuality, amazing fight sequences, and mind blowing special effects. It is full of the right ingredients necessary to brew up a summer blockbuster. Swearing and explicit nudity is kept down to a minimum. By today's standards, the gore is depicted in such a way that it does not overwhelm the viewer as it did in certain scenes of the previous two Terminator films. It demographically targets a very broad audience. This equals Maximum Profit.This is what it seems that Hollywood is after these days: Maximum Profit.T3 lacks in emotional impact. There is little to no emotional attachment built for the characters including the Terminator (T-800).If you are looking for a profound and moving movie then you're not going to find it here. This is a movie designed for today's 'MTV' audience. It is designed to be fast and full of action. It is not going to touch you the same way the first two movies did. If you go into the movie expecting this then you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

Also, some of things in this movie don't make sense, like how can the female terminator control cars just by touching them? To steer the car you need an outside force, it's not all electronic. Also, how can she control things she can't even see? For being more advanced than the T1000, she certainly didn't seem any more menacing or dangerous to the heroes. There were a few good lines in this movie, and I like Arnold, and for that I give it a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 paled in comparison to the first two T's. The movie was too mechanical (no pun intended). The first two T's had a great story and the second installment gave us continuity. Most of the characters in T3 had changed and I was left trying to adjust to these new people throughout the movie.Since just one of the original characters returns, the movie makers try to create a diversion by way of special effects to distract you from realizing you don't know any of these people.A sequel, by definition, is supposed to be a continuation. Obviously the makers of this movie didn't agree; atleast with continuing with the same people. However, they did agree that presenting a final episode (let's hope) of the Terminator series would surely bring in a big dollar.Like Alien Resurrection, some sequels are better left unseen. T3 definitely falls into that category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty funny action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I have never been a huge fan of the Terminator movies (though I can appreciate the story and the FX) and so I wasn't thrilled about this rental, but....I just HAD to see it for myself. The story is a logical continuation of where T2 left off. Following suit, T3 tops the FX in T2 (the new bad guy is COOL)PLUS it's darn funny!!! I laughed through the whole thing! If you rent the DVD, check out the bloopers reel, it's pretty good!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't say I'm not disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lesson here is simple and useful. If you're watching an action movie where the action hero is just barely awake enough to protect his sweetie, to selflessly throw his body over hers when something blows up, but is too thick and stupid to see something coming that actually has something to do with the story... ...you are watching a chick flick. Like the Mighty Joe Young remake, or Final Destination II. Movies like this are different from Die Hard or James Bond movies, because it's up to John McClane and 007 to unravel the riddle in a mystery in an enigma. Indiana Jones can figure out the bad guy is digging in the wrong spot, so his movie is a guy's movie. Not the case here. If John Connor ever had this ability, he lost it before this movie started or picked it up after it was over. Everything has to be explained to him, while he listens, slack-jawed, then reacts with joy, despair, whatever. He never, ever puts himself ahead of the game, and it's obvious there is a crowd-pleasing rule in place to keep him from doing so.Which would be fine, as far as spur-of-the-moment fun action-adventure flicks would be concerned. But leaving aside the point that this installment arrives after a twelve year wait, there's a huge logical plot hole here. John Crybaby Skywalker Connor is the leader of the resistance and it's worth sending a killer robot back in time, at presumably enormous expense, to rub him out. Why is that? If he gave the resistance life with his resourcefulness, or with his ability to motivate people, T4 is going to have to supply some explanation of how he picked these things up. I would not put my life on the line to follow this man. I would not so much as loan him a couple of quarters to do his laundry.But he's George Washington of the 21st century. He makes the difference between a victorious (or insurmountable) resistance or no resistance at all, and he is shrewd and cunning enough to use time travel to arrange his own conception. It would have taken very little trouble to have him, just once or twice, work his way out of a jam like Michael Biehn did 20 years ago. That would have made all the difference to me.Can plot &amp; character problems completely ruin a movie? Maybe not, and that problem doesn't ruin this movie. But it certainly costs it some points. The time-travel thread in T1 made my head hurt, because I cared enough about what was going on to pursue it. Because of the shabby treatment T3 gave to the story and the characters, it can't ever give me that headache because I don't care that much. I can't say the saga has been ruined, but I can't say I'm not disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No flesh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Terminator series, the robots themselves (sorry cyborgs) are composed of flesh over steel exoskeletons. This movie has the steel but not flesh.It looks good on screen, the stunts are fine, the actors attractive, but there is no depth, just a series of set pieces with loose connections. Many scenes were scripted just to produce references to the preceding films, and otherwise have no place. The movie has "SAFE", written all over it, the kind of don't mess with the formula filmmaking that dominates Hollywood.But they left out part of the formula, and that is emotional involvement. You don't feel for the characters, there is no fear or sorrow or suspense or anything remotely resembling empathy for any part in the film. Jokes fall flat because there is no drama taking place that requires comic relief. Clare Danes' character loses her father and fiance to the new TX with barely a moment's grief. Kristanna Lokken is great to look at but not exactly scary and the scenes of her and Arnold's Terminator character throwing each other around are incredibly boring. Speaking of boring, Nick Stahl's John Conner has gone from disaffected youth to spaced out adult, supposedly hiding behind drugs because he fears the future. It doesn't work.None of it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2003 - the year of GOOD "Third" Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2003 has been a strange movie year. Usually, you don't see a good third movie. Of course there are exceptions..ie RETURN OF THE JEDI, AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of my favorites SUPERMAN III. But then you get your bombs as well..GODFATHER III (I refuse to acknowledge this movie exists), JAWS 3D, HALLOWEEN 3, etc. In 2003, there were several very good third movies -- AMERICAN PIE 3, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, TERMINATOR 3 and in December, LORD OF THE RINGS 3.When I first heard TERMINATOR 3 was being made, I was skeptical. No Jim Cameron, no Linda Hamilton, an unknown actor playing John Connor. TERMINATOR 3 was a pleasant surprise and I would rank it as one of the top films of 2003. Granted Arnie isn't the Arnie of 10-15 years ago, but he still proves to be a top-notch action star. Nick Stahl is superb taking over for Eddie Furlong as John Connor. There are some pretty decent action sequences in here (truck chase, cemetary shootout, etc) but the humor is severely lacking from T2.The ending is a shock. You will never see it coming in a million years. But it does leave the door wide open for a TERMINATOR 4. Let's hope...but let's bring Cameron back for that one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best of the trilogy. Let's hope there's not another decade before the fourth. I'm not normally a fan of big Hollywood blockbusters, not least the high-grossing trilogies of recent years (Harry Potter, Matrix, Lord of the Rings), but there's something about the first two Terminator films I've always liked. Maybe because it's set in the real world, I don't know. When I had the opportunity to see a preview of Terminator 3, I thought I was bound to be disappointed, not least because the director Jonathan Mostow made the appalling U571. But I was enthralled. From start to finish, I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen for one moment. Much of the film is similar to the first two, in that there's an evil Terminator after the good guy with someone from the future to protect them. Cue high adrenalin car chases, stunts, explosions, etc., all done with panache and good humour. But there's more to this movie than its predecessors, more than just simple chasing. There's a bigger picture, about fate, about the relentless march of technology and the naivety of the American military. Quite simply, it's an interesting film. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are believable and have good chemistry, Arnie is entertaining, with some great one-liners and the female Terminatrix blends in without any problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needless addendum to the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fairly entertaining sci-fi action film, but it pales in comparison to the original Terminator movies. It's lacking in artistic direction and the cast is weak. James Cameron is a terrific storyteller and takes care of the minutest of details, but here the events just happen without proper sequencing. Jonathon Mostow is in way over his head. The acting is also a problem. Arnold is good as the Terminator, but Nick Stahl is very bad in the role of John Connor. There's nothing heroic about him at all. Eddie Furlong was a tough kid and you could buy him growing up to be a leader of the humans in the future, but Stahl doesn't suggest anything other than a future 7-11 clerk. Also, there's no Linda Hamilton character, no strong female lead - Claire Danes brings nothing to the table. Kristanna Loken is alright as the T-X sent back to kill John Connor, but she isn't required to do much acting what with the computer animators doing most of it for her. Why did they make this movie? There was nothing left from the second film that needed to be clarified, nothing here clever enough to add to the Terminator myth. It was made only for the sake of money, but with production costs so high, even that didn't work.As a stand alone film, it's OK entertainment. There's lots of action and the special effects are good. There's even some humor written into the script. But when you look at it in the context of "T2-Judgement Day" it's a major disappointment.Thankfully, with Arnold as governor now, we don't have to worry about another sequel. Even these producers couldn't be stupid enough to make a Terminator 4 without Arnold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of the three.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it is my opinion also that this is the worst of all the three films. Although many people might consider T1 was the best, I still think that T2 was the most captivating and well-made of the series. But when I enthusiastically went to the cinema to see this film I was shocked by its complete shallowness, low quality acting and the many cliches that it throws at the public. The most obvious one is the fact that they assigned the post of a killing machine to a hot chick dressed in a sexy leather suit... I am a guy, I don't mind seeing beautiful women but not in a movie that advertises itself as the best in the Terminator series. I'd rather see a huge guy with muscles than a good looking girl. Also I have seen T2 many times but I couldn't stand to see T3 more than once. I hope that out of respect for us they don't make another Terminator, ever. This 3rd part completely killed the series and canceled any of the good impressions that T2 had left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent script. Weak Execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this film 12 years after the great T2, I was hoping to feel as involved in the characters and feel the realism of the action like I did in T2, but I felt nothing, from start to finish. I didn't feel like this was a terminator movie. This was more of a TV pilot to translate T2 into a show for Showtime.The storyline is surprisingly decent, but not very strong and catchy. It ultimately feels conveluted and made up only to make more money and not to continue the story. It's like hiring a soap opera writer to create a sequel to Romeo &amp; Juliet. I liked the "future wife" aspect of the story, and making Judgement Day inevitable just took everything we were told to believe in the second film, and threw it out. So much for the whole moral of "There's no fate but what we make for ourselves". I guess you can't make much more money if you end the series that way, so they ignored it, and squeezed this one out of an orafice.The Connor family that we've grown to care about was suddenly gone, with only a glued-on backstory to explain the changes.The new John Connor has no or little tension in his acting. Nothing about him makes me feel he's real. He starts off as a cliche' depressed teenager. He claims to be a loner, but I just don't feel he's anything more than another hot young face being dragged across the latest magazine covers to sucker us into thinking he's important. We spend little time getting to know Claire Daines, and feel nothing for her.The new Terminatrix is played by some apparent model who does a fairly good job by simply pretending to be Robert Patrick from the second installment. The only difference in her performance from Patrick is the special effects that are done with her. She comes with a flamethrower, a magic internet key spike, and a lack of ability to mimic other people. Personally, I think the T-1000 (Patrick) was a much better villain. He could slip through small cracks and holes to get to his enemy, and couldn't get stuck to a magnet.The whole Skynet headquarters, or whatever you want to call it, looks like a cheap rejected set from Stargate SG-1, as well as the characters and their wardrobe. Nothing about these people are believable, so again, we feel nothing.In some scenes (Endoskeletons in battle, Arnold missing half his flesh, and Terminatrix losing her metal skin on a magnet) the CGI effects are top of the line. They feel real. However the scenes involving the CG Hovercrafts and nuclear explosion of central LA look incredibly fake. You can see the individual circular CG puffs that make up the mushroom cloud. The chrome surfacing on the Hovercrafts look like something from The Lawnmower Man. They look completely untangible, and I don't feel the suspense of their presence. I could see how hard they were trying to convince us that it was real by having a harsh brushed-metal surface, while the previous practical counterparts were just a simple soft polish. You only should use CG where you have no choice. In this case, they believe erasing a few strings from a hovering model isn't as effective to them as replacing the entire thing with unfinished-looking CGI. Also, I'm not in suspense when I'm supposed to fear being crushed by noticeably CG vehicles.The worst problem with T3 in my opinion is the cinematography. It's not horrible DP work, but it doesn't have that "we're involved in the action" feel that the second film had. This felt like we were spectators, rather than players. The lighting didn't feel suspensful. The editing had little rhythm. The choices for camera angles were uninvolving. It's like for each moment of the story, they had to spin a roulette wheel of storyboard angles for the same shot, and whatever the needle landed on, that was the camera angle they chose.Since the script is the heart of a production, I give it more credit than I normally would. 6/10</fullReview>

Mostow has allowed my faith in him to decline rapidly. The biggest mistake of the film is writing off Linda Hamilton and picking up Claire Daines in her place. The thing that is different about this movie from the others is that the others were believeable to a degree. This one just sucked. It goes back and John is yet again in denial that machines exist...hello you saw one a few years back. It basically all plays out too movie-ish....it could have been better and the whole idea of changing there is no fate..to there is fate and you can't do a thing about it was really dumb. NO FATE...come on J. Mostow....did you even watch the other movies????

		<fullReview>This is a great movie, but it isn't as good as the second one was way better. The movie is about John Conner [ Nick Stalh] says he seems safe, but he knows he isn't. So he follows the thing he calls the gride no phone, no address, and ect. Well it turns out there is a new terminator out to kill John this time it is a female. She starts off naked kills a lady with a car, kills a police officer, a guy at a fast food restaurant, and some kids who are drinking beer at some party. We get to meet a new character kate brewster[ Clare Danes] who reminds us of linda hamilton in the first terminator. She is at work one night when her friend is killed by the termitrax the female terminator. John is locked in a cage because he needed some medicine they get out then the non-stop action begins. With a better car chase scene then the matrix reloaded. Arnold is back with a great performance he does it all, such as, kick over the fire truck, shoot these cops that are after them when they find sarah conners cementaery. I am not going to say anyhing else because the movie would be ruined and there would be no point at all for you to be seeing it. overal 3 and a half out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average action flick that embarrasses the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is a pretty good action movie with enough destruction to sustain the movie. But, the movie falls much short of the epic scope which was provided by T1 and T2. Jonathon Mostow does a commendable job of keeping the pacing tight and action high, but does very little with the story line. It is essentially a retread of T2.In addition, I can forgive Mostow for using way too many absurd jokes at the expense of the Terminator in order to get a few chuckles from the audience.(Talk to the hand?!! Elton John glasses?!!)I don't think there could have been a better action movie made than T2. The only man who could have attempted to undertake T3 and make it as good as its predecessors would have to be James Cameron. But I believe Cameron opted out because he knew himself he could not do it and did not want to dissapoint the audience.On the plus side, the movie does seem to get better and better as you progress to the end. The crane action stunt is absolutely amazing. And we have to mention Arnie. The man is and forever will be remembered as the Terminator. The TX again is a passable advesary, but Robert Patrick's T1000 will be remembered as the best villian from the Terminator series.I think this movie is definitely a rental. Not much on the DVD and the flick does not warrant multilple viewings ala T2. I am sure there will be some sort of triple deluxe super edition in a couple of years just in time for Governor Arnie to make a come back in T4 fresh in his Golden years.6/10 /mb</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers)Well I did notice one thing that stands out in this movie. We screwed. All the other movies had a shred of hope. This one admits defeat. Which is unfortunate. I thought the movie was okay, it the 100 some minutes fly by. But then again T3 is horribly short. (with the t2 special edition running over 150 minutes long)There are some odd timeline mistakes. John Conner is quoted as saying at the beginning they attacked him when he was 13. Ouch. Thats gotta hurt. If you watch T2 Robert Patricks keys John's name into the cop car's computer and it clearly states he was born in 1985. And that he was 10 years old. Even on the disc 2 of T3 it says 1995. So I assume that T3 takes place between 2005-2010. Which doesn't seem like the time it's supposed to be in. And why use The Blue Man Group for the credit song. Hey they are weird, but only on video. So so as music.I was a bit peeved they had to kill Sarah Connor off. There wasn't alot of reason to do this. Musta been awfully young for what got her. Other pet peeves. Whats up with coloring the Terminator's teeth? They used to be the color of metal. They are white now. Alot of the future scenes were poorly done. With horrible cgi fakery. I like T1 and T2. T3 is okay, but nowhere near the first two. But probably a keeper. Now all we need is Arnold in liquid metal. o_O6/10Quality: 4/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I entered the cinema for this one very excited at the prospect of the third Terminator film and the first for twelve years. This was Arnold's chance to put his movie career back on track after the near-misses of the last five years or so. I was also rather nervous - I am a big fan of Mr Schwarzenegger, and if the California governership rumours were true (and of course they were), this could well be his last chance to make a huge impact to rival that of Terminator 2. I truly wanted him to succeed, and for the film to be a huge hit. Thankfully I wasn't dissapointed.Spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!When I left that same cinema two and a half hours later (i had entered for the trailers too), I felt a little confused about what I had seen, how good a film it was in itself, and how it rated compared with T1 and T2. One thing though was certain - Arnold was back in a big way and this is his best since True Lies, of which it is a fair equal. The big man himself didn't let himself down with an eye-catching performance, especially as he thrashed the evil T-X around, breaking everything in sight!My main problems with the film were:* there is no ending, simply a "tune into to T4 to find out what happens. This was a shame as both previous films enjoyed a ravishing and conclusive finale.* Arnold's character is not given enough screen time, and too often he is making jokes and comic lines instead of dialogue that sets him up as a believable cyborg. After all, this T-101 should be exactly the same as the T-800 at the start of Terminator 2, with the same fearsome qualities and mechanic responses. Unless he was reprogrammed by John Connor before he was sent back in time, but that doesn't explain why he didn't reprogram the T-101 from T2 on similar lines. Unless he wanted to give his former self a chance to learn what is needed to be done in the future, a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.* It feels like a remake of T2. There's not much elaboration on the plot, other than John Connor being a depressed itinerant junkie, and the introduction of Kate Brewster. Sarah Connor is dead, but i half expected that, her character came full circle at the end of T2 when she shakes hand with the T101. Also the relationship between the Terminator and John Connor is ambiguous most of the time, John is mostly over familiar with it.* The introduction of Kate Brewster, and of her past involvement in the plot of T2, the 'destiny' John talks about, is unwarranted. This messes with a previously perfect film (T2). Also the whole thing of Kate being John's future wife, and of him being killed by the Terminator before Kate sends it back, is uneccessary. You're making T4, why not leave all that until then, where it belongs. Here it just feels goofy. Plus the Terminator should know better than to inform people of their own future, John should have programmed it into him. As any fan of Back to the Future should know!* The T-X, played by Kristanna Loken, just isn't scary. She hasn't got the physical presence to match up with Arnold Schwarzengger, and the use of weaponry rang false to me - why does it need weapons to beat a machine which it is supposedlly far in advance of? She should have been made more menacing, for example the child murder scenes should have been more graphic and disturbing, giving us an idea of the TX's capabilities.* Whenever either the T-X appears to menace the mortal main characters, along comes the T-101 to save them, despite a lot of running around that in my view really wasn't necessary. Plus, with all those prototype robotic terminators, and the ability of the TX to control mechanic things, it really should have been a piece of cake for it to wipte out John and Kate. Feels less plausible than the first two.Apart from these few minor gripes though, I enjoyed the film. Arnold is once again at the top of the action tree, and is well supported by Nick Stahl and Clare Danes, though neither had too much to do in their roles, playing more human characters, with few memorable characteristics. Linda Hamilton is gone, and Kate Brewster character goes from being an innocent vetinary worker to a dead eye Terminator-killing sharpshooter without any discernible character changes in between. She just picks up an AK47 and off she goes.I'm letting the negatives get in the way here, but what I should say is that this has the look and feel of a major action blockbuster, and whilst its not up there with the first two in the series, its light years ahead of the crap we seem to get in cinemas these days. Especially good was the extended car chase that had a 1980s feel, and the 'coffin sequence,' a pure genius scene that I will never forget.All in all, the best film of the year, and on this evidence, if things don't work out for Arnold in Sacramento, he'll be welcome back for the finale of this franchise any day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than T:1, but not half as good as T:2....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't have high expectations for T3 seeing as how T2 was one of the best action movies ever made. But T3 really exceeded my expectations, I was surprised that they actually made a movie worthy of the Terminator name, especially since it's directed by Jonathan Mostow (anyone see U-571?).The movie provides a satisfying completion to the story, yet it still leaves it open for more. I liked Nick Stahl's John Connor better than Edward Furlong, but Kristanna Loken's Terminator wasn't half as menacing or as cool as Robert Patrick's was. I enjoyed it more than T1, but it's still not quite as good as T2. Overall I give it ***1/2 out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the action films this summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summer of 2003 will be known for two things in Hollywood. The year of the sequel and the year that movie titles forced theatre owners to run out and buy more letters for their marquee. Between Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, movie listings read more like a novel than a short listing of start times.Enter Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, the third installment of the Terminator series that sent Arnold Schwarzenegger to stardom and made a household name of James Cameron before he decided to spend his life looking for a shipwreck. In this third time around, gone are Director Cameron, stars Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong, and even liquid metal man Robert Patrick has been replaced. Enter Director Jonathon Mostow (U-571), new John Conner, Nick Stahl (In the Bedroom), Claire Danes (Romeo + Juliet) and new Terminator villain Kristina Loken. Oh yeah, Arnie is back too.The movie begins with a grown up John Conner describing to the camera how he has lived his life since we last left him. He has no address, no phone, no home. Soon, a motorcycle accident puts him in the same room as Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), just as the new female terminator, T-X, shows up with the intention of killing both humans. Ok, enough story, let the special effects begin. Just 15 minutes into the film, we see the new and improved Terminator make weapons with her arm, turn from liquid into human form and show strength beyond the skills of Terminator 2's, T-1000. Even Arnold says that she is an upgrade that has made him obsolete and defeating her will be unlikely. But that doesn't mean we can't have fun along the way.A chase scene through the streets of Los Angeles between a pet clinic truck, a fire engine and a wide load crane was brilliantly choreographed as the Terminator tries to thwart T-X's attempts to kill John Conner and in doing so takes out countless cars, trucks, and even a glass building. T3 might not be as original as the first films, but it does stay true to the timeline and more importantly, it continues the story of the fight against the machines. We find out the fate of Sarah Conner, learn more about Skynet and how the machines took control, we see the first terminators activated and it is revealed that Arnold's character kills John Conner in the future. But who cares. We want to see the two terminators do battle and we are not disappointed. From the first moment that the T-X gets run over by Arnold's truck, to a spectacular fight sequence in a men's room (hey, who wouldn't pay to see Schwarzenegger hit a woman over the head with a urinal?), to the final confrontation at the Skynet lab, the action is unrelenting. There are a few faults with the movie. Nick Stahl could have better cast and there are too many coincidences (John and Kate just happen to be together when the T-X arrives, Kate's father works for Skynet etc.). However, the franchise is kept fresh with an interesting story and loads of humour (Arnold shows up naked at a bar during Ladies Night) and inside jokes (the cat requiring attention is called Hercules). It's even nice to see Earl Boen back as Dr. Silverman for a third time. So it's not a great film. So what. Things go boom and people go splat. Bring it on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than i feared but still not justified *Contains spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moved from another accountFrom the moment I heard this was being made I was cynical, when I heard Cameron and half the cast from T2 were not involved I was apprehensive. Now that it has been I managed to get myself to the cinema in a slightly nervous manner, my worry was that this would ruin the other two Terminator films, well I have watched both since I saw T3 and it didn't ruin T1&amp;2 but I didn't leave the cinema satisfied.Firstly I would like to say that i actually thought Nick Stahl was good as John Conner, one of my worries was that he wouldn't be. The main problem lies with the actual film itself. Secondly, why is it so tongue in cheek? The first Terminator has a very dark, almost horror movie feel to it. Terminator 2 is more of an all out action and there are a few well placed gag's, the odd bit of cheese, but the atmosphere, particularly towards the end is still fitting to the story line. Terminator 3 however is more like a self-parody, filled to the brim with references to the previous two films. The character of the T-101 has, in effect, been transformed into a comedian. I'll admit I laughed out loud a quite a few times, but if want to laugh at a film I'll go see a ZAZ film! This is the Terminator, a ruthless killing machine and when confronted by a store assistant it replies with; `Talk to the hand'! That isn't what the Terminator is about. I noted some similarities to what was done to Freddy Kreuger when Wes Craven jumped from the 'Nightmare On Elm Street' ship, a scary horror villain turned into a comic joke, a merchandising product in effect. By the time Arnie had said his final `I'm back' I had given up. One of my other problems was with the story line. The previous two films were based around the idea that `there is no fate but what we make', I guess that is an idea of James Cameron's. T3 squelches that theory and therefore renders the actions of T2 obsolete, which was one of my big fears. They simply delayed Judgment Day. I also personally don't believe in fate, maybe that was one of the reasons the Terminator films meant (mean) so much to me. Terminator 3 suggests that there is a fate and nothing John or anyone else can do will change the fact that there will be a war between the humans and the machines.There were positive aspects to T3, I didn't hate it so I can be objective here. The action was good, if not as groundbreaking as T2 (too much CGI, but that's a different arguement). John Mostow coped with the direction quite well and I liked the idea of seeing some of the very 1st Terminator models, that was a nice touch. Claire Danes' character showed some (small) signs of mirroring Sarah Conner. And there is of course the possibility that they could make a fourth film based directly on the beginning of the war. Could they cover the war sufficiently in one film thought? I don't think so. But seeing as they made T3 why not go further, there's not much else left to lose. In fact the ending was one of the few saving graces, a nice little twist to an otherwise mediocre affair.To sum up, I don't think T3 should have been made. The world isn't a particularly better place with it and would not have suffered without. I feel sorry that James Cameron's work has been undone by this middle of the road and un-necessary addition to the Terminator saga. I'll finish by saying that this was Cameron's creation, if he had anything else to say HE would have made T3.5/10 for the good action sequences and the first 10 gags.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The moment they approved the script this movie was doomed. Choosing a no-name director was perhaps the biggest mistake as one of the greats like Ridley Scott or James Cameron could still have saved to movie. Lead actors for John and Kate are dull and whiny, but also their characters have just nothing to do in the movie except the whining. There are some nice effects in some parts but most of the time it's just annoying. There's nothing original about it. I'd recommend watching Cypher instead but you'll probably want to see T3 anyway just for the sake of it (just like the creators counted you would). I'm betting there's going to be part 4 in the series as well and it will suck just as bad as Alien: Resurrection sucked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers... What the **** was THAT? I could've sworn I read somewhere that T3 was not complete and utter garbage. Whoever made that claim was completely and utterly wrong because - guess what? - T3 is complete and utter garbage. In a bold nod to originality and inspiration, this movie is about a terminator coming back from the future to kill someone, and being stopped by Arnie. Sounds pretty radical, right? Please, try to stay awake, it gets better. John Connor, who lives "off the grid" (an interesting concept symbolised by his throwing a bottle of Bud in a river) meets his old girl-friend from school, just in time for both of them to get attacked by a naked female Terminator. Unfortunately for the future of mankind, this is a "12" certificate movie, so we don't even get to see her bod. Which might just have alleviated the boredom. Also, that "12" means we cut down on the violence too. Hmmm, a Terminator film with no violence and a boring villain who's nowhere near as sinister or impressive as the ones in the first two. Yikes. T3 is a dull, uninspired, tedious bit of cash-in rubbish of which the governor of california should be mightily ashamed. He probably thinks it great, though. He's wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and Action Pack Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis Spoiler! If you want a movie with a lot of action, Terminator-3 is for you. It is the continuation of the series of Terminator movies by Arnold Schwarzenegger. We have waited 10 years for this one to come to the screen and the wait has been worth it. In T-3, the Terminator is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) from the Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken who is a faster, better, and later robot version than the Terminator. This Terminator looks like Arnold but he is not the exact robot from T-2, however, he repeats many of the same things from T-2 that we love him for, such as `I'll be Back'. The best action scene of the whole movie is the scene with the Terminator ridding a motorcycle after the Terminatrix as she is driving a huge crane-truck down the street and destroying the whole block as she was chasing after John Connor and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) in her van. It is a thrilling and action pack movie that is a must see. There is only one problem; it goes by so fast that you will want more. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have we reached the Terminus yet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want lots of fighting, special FX, CGI, explosions and noise cleverly cocooned in a contrived script that does not stand up to too much analysis then this film is for you. I personally reckon that, if this is the best that Hollywood can come up with, the Terminator formula has been milked dry; new ideas are just too thin on the ground to make this a serious sequel to the previous two movies. Who is to blame....the screenplay author? The director? Probably both. The inevitable one-liners and certain plot elements reduced this to a very tongue-in-cheek action film. Suspension of belief is what Hollywood movies are mostly about but this came as very much of a personal disappointment after the excellent T2. Okay, so we got eye candy in the form of a female Terminator, the T-X. Gorgeous to look at but hardly credible as a character. T2 cast Robert Patrick as the "latest model" terminator because the plot called for the menace to be manifest through superior technology and ability rather than sheer size and brute force. So T2 has a regular guy-sized bad Terminator and T3 then makes the bad Terminator a woman.What can we expect next in the inevitable T4? Maybe an infant Terminator - the TOT?The manner in which T3 ended blatantly left the door open for yet another sequel but this may depend on various factors, not least of which will be Governor Schwarzenegger's busy schedule over the next several years. If they leave it too long they will have to have serious rethink about how to develop the plot to account for Mr Schwarzenegger's advancing years as he is, despite the make-up girls' best efforts, starting to show his advancing years - God he looked old when he delivered that line "I am a machine" - but then he had been in in few fights by then and what we see is supposed to be living human tissue over a metal skeleton.....If there is going to be a T4 I hope to God they get back to decent scripts otherwise they might as well consign the thing to TV as happened to Star Gate (good film, absolutely dreadful series). Alternatively knock it on the head altogether as this particular gravy train looks to be approaching the terminus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Action Movie Facing Unrealistic Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems fashionable for some to critique this movie based on their reaction to the political success of Arnold Schwarzenegger. By using their comments on this film to criticize voters and/or "America" for choosing an actor as governor (California, by the way, is not synonymous with the entire US), they overlook the fact that by slamming a movie for that reason they commit the same error they say they abhor - allowing someone's performance in one field to cloud your judgment about them in another.So, here I critique the the film and not my reaction to Mr. Schwarzenegger's political success - with which I and apparently the majority of real-world US folks have no problem, just for the record. This is a great action film. Unfortunately, it is a sequel to two of the best action films of all time. This unfortunately causes a number of problems that this film handles well, but not perfectly.A major problem is that each sequel becomes less and less original - by necessity. If you are a Star Trek fan, you can't help but notice the same problem. There is too much "canon," too much framework that inhibits the creative process. It gets taken to absurd lengths by some, as they try to point out "flaws" in a character's age at various points in the movies' continuum. These are movies, not documentaries, a fact some who get a little too involved seem to forget.I thought T3 handled the "canon" problem well. Certain changes in the "timeline" established in the first two films but changed in this film are explained away well by the simple device that the events of those films actually changed future "history." Of course, the problem with that is that other things are said to be "inevitable," which does not quite square with "changes." We can let the metaphysicists and fan(atic)s quibble about this, things like that do not disturb the average moviegoer in my opinion.Another "problem" handled well is the immutable fact that actors age between sequels. Now, a robot doesn't age, so if the actor changes appearance, that is kind of difficult to accept. However, I thought that Schwarzenegger carried off his part brilliantly and basically made you overlook the fact that he no longer is in his 30s as he was when he first played the role. There is less raw physicality and more humor and strategic calculation by the character. I like the change, personally, and find the banter a needed relief from the overwhelming somber tone of the series.A third problem is explaining in reasonable terms how the future "rebel leader" becomes a leader at all. T2 established the character as an annoying, basically useless brat. T3 carries the characterization forward in what I felt was a reasonable fashion. I will not give away the ending, but suffice to say that I thought the screenwriters' solution was very neat and believable.A fourth problem is that the "bad Terminators" have to keep getting more and more menacing in order to achieve shock value and conform with certain elements of the storyline. How, though, is that possible when each in turn is about as invulnerable as the writers can dream up? I thought this was the weakest part of the movie. The evil female terminatrix is simply not very menacing, at least relative to the amazing one in T2. One can search for reasons why a female robot was sent back - listen carefully to the dialogue and you will notice who was still around at the (future) time to be doing the sending - but there was nothing particularly original about this movie's villain. I think when people fault this movie, this area is the basic source of their concerns.As for the script, I think it is clever but, as I said above, increasingly constrained by the "canon." Nothing in the movie is completely unexpected, all goes according to (slightly altered) plan. I think the filmmakers made the Schwarzenegger robot more avuncular in reaction to this problem. The device works to a certain extent, but creates an uneasy, conflicting dynamic that tends to undermine the creative tension so necessary for the suspension of disbelief.All in all, a good film, worthy successor to its predecessors and a very worthwhile cinematic experience. In terms of overall quality, though, more in line with a "Godfather 3" than a "Godfather 2." Enjoyable and with several memorable scenes (Arnold firing a gun while carrying a casket, some good chase/fight sequences), but not quite achieving the classic status of the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is sheer coincidence that I saw this film just when Schwarzenneger presented his nomination in the political arena. But not surprising, really, when Hollywood is taking over the Capitol and the trend that started with Reagan's Star Wars shield to protect American innocents from the evil threatening the globe, has been taking new twists and turns. The obsession has a long history, since the invention of the cinema which has played a far greater part in American politics than any other single influence. From Griffith's fascistic Birth of a Nation to milder modes of Star Trek and currently Star Gate. The message is always, "We, the American Nation, know best, and will fight to the death to convert the others to our own way of 'democracy'".T3 is no different, the righteous America defeats evil (even in the form of a very sexy terminatrix). It is as if the collective American ID is trying to invite a catastrophe of immeasurable magnitude beyond the make-belief scenarios of Hollywood. 9/11 will sharpen this paranoia enormously until the whole continent turns into a kind of Howard Hughes. To exorcise this growing paranoia in films like T3 and others of the same ilk, is like holding a tress of garlic against the invisible face of absolute evil.It must not be forgotten that in the Forbidden Planet what destroyed the planet was the uncontrollable ID.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment in the Terminator series is the weakest, but still entertaining. It's very difficult for the second movie in a series to be as good as the first one, much less the third movie. Alien 3 is an example, as well as Alien Resurrection. Both were far weaker than Alien and Aliens, and so it is with this movie. Schwarzenegger is back as the protective robot, facing a female terminatrix: Kristanna Loken. Neither part requires great acting, other than maintaining the same dementia-like affect throughout the film. Schwarzenegger is satisfactory in his role; this time around he becomes a source of most of the film's humor, spouting a succession of tag-lines, each one funnier than the previous one. Some of them poke fun at his lines from the previous movies. However, the "talk to the hand" bit seems way out of character, and seems designed to break up the target demographic more than anything else. Loken is one of many young hottie actresses that are displaying high octane girl power these days. However, she is not nearly as compelling as Robert Patrick was in T2. The reason has more to do with the script than anything else. The movie consists of one action sequence and/or long chase scene after another. The bridging story line scenes verbalize the character relationships rather than allowing them to develop. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes add little in their roles and they could have been played by any other actors with little difference. The ending offers a significant twist, and the hope for yet another sequel. The highlights of the movie are the action scenes, which are ferocious. The best scene involves a chase with an overhead crane vehicle, driven by Loken, pursuing Stahl and Danes in a pickup truck, with Schwarzenegger trying to intervene. A bathroom fight scene, between Schwarzenegger and Loken, is a close second. If the story and supporting characters were stronger, this would be on par with the first two movies. However, there are many movies that consist of weak stories and characters overloaded with great action that are still entertaining enough; this is one such movie. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definetly as crap as ridiculous though I a fan of the first and second episodes. They should broadcast it directly on cable TV or sell in VHS at lower price. I'm a big fan of Arnie even if he's far from Actor's Studio, but T3 is his worst role. Forget this movie and watch T1 again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seem to me that this movie was not big enough (it should have been bigger than terminator 2).Eventhough it was a great movie, to be apart of the terminator franchise it was pretty fogettable. the terminatrix was not as impressive as the t-1000 ( not surprising, robert patrick: greatest movie villan ever). This movies ending was great though (nice and dark), and the truck scene (wicth was very simular to t2) was awesome. Still this movie fails based on the others, Cameron should have gotten invoiled with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Forget everything you thought before, your looking at a trilogy" - Randy Meeks, Scream 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In T3 the new rule laid out in Scream 3 was brought into play, and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. T2 has been one of if not my favourite movies since I was a little kid and I had been looking forward to T3 since then aswell.The story was well written and paced good, the dialogue is a bit on the weak side, but still pretty solid. Every performance in the film was done well enough with the only exceptions being a few of the bit characters.Visually the film is absolutly stunning, the effects all look very crisp, clean and natural which is something of a rare quality in the bullettime style of today.Mostow gave a great effort directing this, personally I feel that Cameron couldn't have come close to pulling this off as he likes to focus his directing projects moreso on the story and actor's delivery of dialogue. Mostow's previous works show that his films have the perfect action and dialogue balance with his projects.Now, into some depth with the story. My only major complaints with the story is definetly just how well the John and Kate characters' pasts connect. It just seemed too cliched, with the whole "lovers from the past reunite" crap from the basic chick flick formula.Sypnosis: If your looking for some deep story here, don't. T3 is just an action packed visually spectacular film to see. It takes the first 2 films in the story and continues the progression (T1 - Drama with action overtones. T2 - action with dramatic overtones. T3 - action) of the series, essentially showing what any future Arnoldless sequels will be like. I really enjoyed the film, and am again hoping for another Terminator movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is just like any other 3rd sequel which has been wrongly done because of its director. Jonathan Mostow just sucked the life of this film, cause James Cameron made the 2 other movies into a humanistic type of movie. This film typically destroyed the Terminator franchise all because of the poor directing and the characters are just freaking stubborn.As well as they did not need to make the third one, since the 2nd movie stopped judgement day. The ups of this film is that Arnie is back for good. Like all the other Terminator blockbusters this had romping action. Unfortunately, in every scene it dies down and goes to useless talk about Brewster and Connor. I do feel bad about this film since it already had the quality of an action blockbuster. Unless it was part of a trio of movies. Still entertaining, but nonetheless poor acting and extremely non- Terminator filming makes this movie a 5/10 in my vote. This movie does suck a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better summer movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *** out of ****.Ok, Terminator 3 is unnecessary but its so enjoyable it makes up for it. It is the weakest of the trilogy and I think a fourh Terminator would not be a good idea. But nevertheless Terminator 3 is one entertaining ride.The story is pretty much the same as Terminator 2. Most critics and fans saw this as a huge flaw. But I did not mind it at all, Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi/action films and I wouldn't mind if the sequel did it again. The acting is mixed. Arnold Schwarzenneger is excellent here, he has this role down. Kristiana Loken is playing the TX, her performance is showing a lack of emotion and having an evil stare, which she does quite well. Claire Danes is fine, but I have never been a big fan of her. However, Nick Stahl terrible, he comes off like a wuss instead of a future hero.The action is quite impressive here. Theres a fight scene between the TX and The Terminator thats fantastic. The only part of the action I didnt like was the chase scene, I found it kind of overblown. Terminator 3 is well-paced and will keep you interested throughout. Some people complain the humor was too much. Some of the humor may be a little much, but I thought some was quite funny. Terminator 3 ranks as one of the better films of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WORST MOVIE THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far, I seem to be the only Terminator fan who was disappointed with this movie!!T3 is just another example of Hollywood changing making a great movie and turning it into a money-making franchise.When I watched this movie, it didn't even feel like I was watching a Terminator movie!!We all know that T1 and T2 were great movies, there's no doubt about that, but T3 was missing that special something that makes a Terminator movie.It missed the great work of James Cameron, the director of the first 2 Terminator movies, and all of his trademarks were gone. The Terminator didn't have any great memorable lines like he did in the first 2 movies. The worst line was "I'm back!!" It was more Arnie saying that he was back in another blockbuster rather than the Terminator!The music was also missing, the great music by Brad Fiedel. The Terminator music was great and this movie just didn't use it at all, another great Terminator trademark missing!!Even John Connor wasn't as big a person as he was before. John Connor was the main reason for the Terminator, without him, the movie wouldn't exist. In this movie, the Terminator doesn't really care for him as much. Their great relationship, as seen in T2, was gone. I think that Edward Furlong should of come back as John Connor as he is much older, i think it would've made more sense and seem more realistic.Overall, I was really dissapointed and I hope they don't make a T4!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and i GOT ONE. Even though there were a lot of things wrong with the movie it was still as good as i thought it would be. The TX was great. good acting as well,from her. The John Connor charcater was well played but compared to his attitude in T2 he was a pretty wimpy. I really liked the way TX could turn and stuff. and the car scene was really cool. I think it took 3 million,to make. Anyway, even though T3 wasn't as good as 2 it was better than the terminator 1. But it was one oft the best movies iv'e seen at the cinema for a long time,despite the lack of music. And of course it has a lot of funny 'n' famous arnie one-liners. To end this i'd want to say they should do a final film, T4 that should not be about John Conner being targated for tremanation,but about the nuclear war. But of course, Connor and arnie should be the stars of TERMINATOR 4 day of the battlepretty cool eh? I could do this for a livng</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, boring, boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this movie (which I was quite much looking forward to) I watched the first parts of the "trilogy" once again to dive into the great dark-futuristic scenario to be able to get this movie the right way. I am not saying that the predecessors were great movies in a sense of intellectually or artistically qualitative films, but they created a really impressive atmosphere and were just good entertainment.This movie is different. The whole background is taken from the older movies, no new ideas. Just action. Action, action, action. All the time. Man, how I was bored. I admit, the special effects were good, but you can't save a movie just with that. The dialogues (the few that there are) are really embarassing, both for the actors (especially Arnold S. who once again shows that he did NOT become famous for his skills as an actor, but for his unvoluntary comic) and for the spectators.If you really want to watch this movie, I recommend that you don't do it without several beers and a good company you can discuss how bad with how bad it was afterwards. The only good point I could find was the (hidden) criticism of the US-defense shield. But that couldn't make up for all the sad rest. Sad. Really Sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy end to the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this isn't as good as the original or T2 but it's still a damned good movie.It's got everything you want from a summer action flick and bags more. You want action? How about a 20 minute chase involving a giant crane, remote controlled cop cars and a vet wagon? Humour? The new TX has a mischievious nature while Arnie's entrance is bordering on self parodying hilarity. How about effects? Top notch, Stan Winston and ILM creating brilliant futuristic battle scenes, superb robotic effects and plenty of pyrotechnics to boot.Acting wise I felt Ed Furlong was missed. Nick Stahl was perfectly amiable as the older John Connor, but I really missed T2's Connor, full of young inocence and cool, his flippant character replaced by a scared, frail older version, who wore a constant frown on his weathered face. Arnie was back and was on great form, he just slotted back into his role as the Terminator as if he'd been doing it all his life. As for the newcomers, Kristianna Loken started off interestingly but quickly deteriated, she wasn't anywhere near as good as Robert Patrick in T2, failing to display the menace that anihilation was just around the corner. And Claire Danes as Kate, while an important character plot wise, did little more than scream a lot and look scared.Still, the best thing about this film wasn't the acting, action or attempts at humour, but the bold, brilliant ending. Without giving anything away I'll just say: IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!There are rumours of more Terminator films in the pipeline, but I for one hope that is untrue. They should leave it be as this perfectly complements the other two films and serves as a terrific final part of the trilogy.Overall a 8/10 for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the first Terminator scary and the second a perfect piece of pop entertainment. The third is just what you think it is: little better than an afterthought. The parts are there: The situation is urgent, The new Terminator is terrifying, and Arnold's bot is milked for even more genuinely funny deadpan, but with a surfeit of choppy action and dearth of any other emotional material, you're left with a movie that doesn't take itself seriously enough to warrant the audience's loyalty. Not to mention the unforgivable lapses in logic and decidedly unintelligent hunting techniques of the new cyborg. The buddy I went with remarked about the lack of pause or reflection that made the previous films relatively moving experiences and I agree; without them, the franchise has devolved into an extended chase sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes up for the disappointment of Terminator 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 2 had groundbreaking visuals. A heartwarming story. And it was extremely disappointing.What? Yes, I am a MAJOR Terminator fan, but T2 trainwrecked the idea behind The Terminator. It attempted to give Arnie a heart. Why? The entire POINT behind the series is that the machines are merciless, ruthless. "They don't feel pain". So why then, Mr. Cameron, did you literally derail the mythos YOU established, with Terminator 2?Terminator 3, however, corrects all this. The Terminator played by Arnie is still the hero, but he doesn't show love or remorse or fear the way the Terminator from part 2 did. This Arnie is much more like the way the original Terminator from the first film was.As for the film itself, it too is a throwback to the original film. Terminator 2, while a great film, was bogged down by it's own pretentious faults. This, like the original, hits the gas peddle and never lets up. It's truly a nonstop thrillride of epic preportions.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What has happened to the awesome terminator story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest im 22 and i remember the time when the second terminator movie was released and it was a mega hit, i was ten at the time but have been seriously interested in films since i can remember. T2 was an awesome movie and ive wrote a review on this page about it. T2 was dark and true to its storyline, the t800 acted like a machine and all its actions and reasons for its actions were well explained. The story in T2 was second to none, it really develled into the hellish nightmare of the nuclear war and the performances from linda hamilton were nothing short of excellent but to know more about T2 read my review this is about T3 which i have to be honest i wanted to be so amazing and true to the first to films but turned out to be nothing more than a money spinner for C2 pictures and schwarzenegger, there was absolutly no storyline or plot there was no character development, Arnie did not play the T800 at all like the other two movies and the attempt of humour in a film meant to be so dark was just pathetic, james cameron made the humour in T2 non self conscious so not to take away the intensity of this all powerfull machine. with all things said T3 has alot of eye candy but overall is poorly acted poorly written and poorly directed. T1 gets 8 out of 10 it looses points simply coz the effects are very dated, T2 gets 12 out of 10 there really is no way in which this film could be better and T3 gets 3 out of ten merely coz of its effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: *** (out of *****)Yes, they're back. The franchise that produced two excellent instalments in the late 20th century has returned. I had high hopes for Terminator 3 before I entered the cinema, mainly because of good reviews, a good trailer and enjoyment of the first two films in the series (which many hold anyway).The build-up is momentous as we begin in the present day with John Connor (now played by In the Bedroom's Nick Stahl) narrating about the current state of affairs. His account reveals that despite the ending of Terminator 2, in which all of us believed that Sarah Connor had prevented judgement day (she hasn't, as we soon discover), he fears for the future and lives with no one knowing who he is or where he comes from. These fears are realised when Skynet sends the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a seemingly unstoppable terminator in female guise, back in time to eliminate him and all his future lieutenants, which include vet Kate Brewster (an underused Claire Danes). Fortunately, John has protection as well, in the form of the now obsolete T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). When a story like this begins unfolding, beginning with a rather fine chase scene, you feel that you're in for something special. And indeed, the elements for a very good film are all in place. For example, the actors, even Arnold, are at their best. Yes, the big man is exceptionally good as the now obsolete T-101. Every one of his lines is either funny or convincing. Kristanna Loken, despite having very few lines, gets her job done effectively, intentionally imitating Robert Patrick at times (I say `intentionally' for the T-X can be seen as an enhanced T-1000 with an endoskeleton and a few more interesting enhancements).The plot's generally thin, but when it does get theoretical, it's generally convincing. Director Jonathan Mostow may not be James Cameron, but he definitely knows how to update the Terminator for the new millennium. Some of T3's action scenes are real stand outs in this year's crowd of summer films, and there are some major new plot developments. But it's here where the film begins to fall a bit flat. These new plot developments are touched on but left unexplored. There are several plot holes and the time shifts are inconsistent. And while there's no doubt that a lot of care was put into the opening chase, the final scenes seemed to be resolved far too easily. The first two Terminator films had open endings that could be conclusions as well as leave room for possible sequels. This one appears to be almost entirely dependent on a T4 (and box office returns seem to have ensured that, but...), especially as the film ends a little too abruptly. If T3 had a little more substance then I could definitely have recommended it to everyone. Still, T3 still offers a good time at the movies in its own right, even if it isn't the perfect summer blockbuster (if you're looking for that, try Pirates of the Caribbean).</fullReview>

The bad point are from the beginning you dont get the feel that this is a terminator movie , no heavy intro etc. It a bit like a bond film without the trademark gun-barrel beginning. I can understand how a new director would like to bring his own twists but this is difficult in a medium such as terminator. I say thumbs up and also i say , lets see a conclusion , a "domination of the machines" that brings the whole thing in a full loop back to the first film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I still think it shouldn't have been made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right then, Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines. From the moment I heard this was being made I was cynical, when I heard Cameron and half the cast from T2 were not involved I began to fear the worst. Now that it has been made I managed to get myself to the cinema, albeit in a slightly nervous manner. My worry was that this would ruin the other two Terminator films, well I have watched both since I saw T3 and it didn't but I didn't leave the cinema satisfied.Firstly I would like to say that i actually thought Nick Stahl was good as John Conner, one of my worries was that he wouldn't be. The main problem lies with the actual film itself. Firstly, why is it so tongue in cheek? The first Terminator has a very dark, almost horror movie feel to it. Terminator 2 is more of an all out action and there are a few well placed gag's, but the atmosphere, particularly towards the end is still fitting to the story line. Terminator 3 however is more like a self-parody, filled to the brim with references to the previous two films. The character of the T-101 has, in effect, been transformed into a comedian. I'll admit I laughed out loud a quite a few times, but if want to laugh at a film I'll watch 'Airplane!'. This is the Terminator, a ruthless killing machine and when confronted by a store assistant it replies with; `Talk to the hand'! That isn't what the Terminator is about. I can't help but observe similarities to what was done to Freddy Kreuger in the ?Nightmare On Elm Street' sequels, a scary horror villain turned into a comic joke, a merchandising product in effect. By the time Arnie had said his final `I'm back' I had given up. One of my other problems was with the story line. The previous two films were based around the idea that `there is no fate but what we make', I guess that is an idea of James Cameron's. T3 squelches that theory and therefore renders the actions of T2 obsolete, which was one of my big fears. They simply delayed Judgment Day. I also personally don't (want to) believe in fate, i like the idea that we make our own successes in life and aren't controlled. Maybe that was one of the reasons the Terminator films meant (mean) so much to me. Terminator 3 suggests that there is a fate and nothing John or anyone else can do will change the fact that there will be a war between the humans and the machines. There were positive aspects to T3, I didn't hate so much as I cant be objective here. The action was good, if not as groundbreaking as T2, John Mostow coped with the direction quite well and I liked the idea of seeing some of the very 1st Terminator models, that was a nice touch. Claire Danes' character showed some (small) signs of mirroring Sarah Conner. And there is of course the possibility that they could make a fourth film based directly on the beginning of the war. Could they cover the war sufficiently in one film thought? I don't think so. But seeing as they made T3 why not go further, there's not much else left to lose. In fact the ending was one of the few saving graces, a nice little twist to an otherwise mediocre affair.To sum up, I don't think T3 should have been made. The world isn't a particularly better place with it and would not have suffered without. I feel sorry that James Cameron's work has been undone by this middle of the road and un-necessary addition to the Terminator saga. I'll finish by saying that this was Cameron's creation, if he had anything else to say HE would have made T3.5/10 for the good action sequences and the first 10 gags.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stale Recipe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever tried to cook something, following the same recipe faithfully, only to have it turn out different every time? Apparently the makers of this movie had no such problems. The standard ingredients are all present, in pretty much the same quantities, from Terminator 2, and voila! the results are startlingly similar, and the plot is similarly half-baked. But this is not brain food. This is a Terminator sequel.Some of the ingredients are better, it's true. Fx have come a long way even since T2, and there has been some attempt at least to spice up some of the chase and fight sequences a bit, with Terminators being dragged through collapsing buildings, crushed under vehicles and so on all pretty convincingly and generally spectacularly. As you'd expect, with so much of the production team's focus on fx and stunts, the story seems even more sadly neglected than previously - like a cake that has been left out in the rain far too long.We're introduced to the T-X (the thoroughly gorgeous Kristanna Loken) and informed that she is an anti-Terminator Terminator. Wow. Impressive. Except, well, she spends an entire movie demonstrating that she is completely unable to take out an obsolete T-101. Show, don't tell, they say, is the rule of good story telling. So why couldn't we at least have been treated to the sight of several Arnie-class Terminators turning up, all to get pulped by this little lady - except of course for our 'hero'? Oh well, missed opportunity there guys, but don't worry, you only spent a few million dollars on your movie, so no great loss.Anyway, this metallic minx battles Arnie (unsuccessfully) across the city, destroying much of said city in the process and these two Terminator models break into into their constituent components faster than a girl and boy band respectively. Arnie gets to fire at the cops without hurting any of them, the bad Terminatrix gets to kill a few people, morph into other people, and check her hair in the occasional reflective surface. The temporal mechanics of the story are about as well-crafted as the prototype Terminators that look like a cross between vehicle assembly line robots and that mechanical monstrosity from the Lost in Space movie. In a final desperate flight, young John Connor and his girlfriend are handed a particle accelerator to effect their getaway and it's all a bit convenient and sloppy in the plotting department. All of which culminates in what is a predictable climax that, I think, badly wanted to be a 'clever twist'. Unfortunately, you can't have a clever twist in a circular plot, generally speaking, because otherwise the ends won't meet.For all the metal flying around, the performances are surprisingly wooden, even from the human contingent. And Arnie, sending himself up, is playing a caricature of a machine and you can almost hear the gears grinding. Or is that your teeth?Only Kristanna Loken escapes too much criticism in this department, because after all we all forgave Arnie the first time out, when we generally thought, hey, he was pretty good in the Terminator, only to realise later that a machine incapable of expression was all he was cut out to play with any degree of credibility. So the jury is still out on Ms Loken's general acting ability, and she certainly has a screen presence that is always welcome.In fact, she is the one ingredient in the Terminator 3 recipe that could definitely be described as yummy. And if that sounds at all shallow, it's probably because I eventually discovered the best level on which any of this unsatisfactory hokum can be enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another beloved TradeMark has been exploited...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does the following two statements apply to you?Terminator - "I liked it alot".Terminator 2 - "I loved it, it excelled in a superior manner."If you answered "yes", then you will not like Terminator 3, and in truth you would be better off not seeing it. By not seeing it, you will preserve the memory of the two previous movies without tainting them. Should you despite this warning choose to view T3, then please note that you will never again be able to view the previous movies without conjuring up the ghosts of T3.Are you thinking "it can't be that bad, this person just didn't understand it"?I too thought along this line when prewarned about it, I imagined that it had to have some entertaining qualities given it being a Terminator movie. Movies like that just aren't all-out bad.I was wrong, I should have listened to the person who warned me.Right about now you are thinking "I refuse to be the only person on the planet to not have seen T3, simply because of a warning on IMDB."Again, if the top two rows apply to you, then you will wish you had listened to this warning.Are you thinking "this person is some kind of pro critic or really picky about movies, I just want to see what happened after T2"?No, I am not a professional critic, and I'm probably not more picky about movies than you. And yes, I sure wanted to see what happened after T2. But you see, you do not get to see what happened after T2, because the people responsible for that excellent script did not touch a page of this movie. It is entirely different. The company which made T2, Corolco, didn't produce this movie. Cameron did not co-write nor produce this movie.T3 is riddled with large caliber logic and story holes, many things don't add up and contradict the "Terminator world". The cast is really ill chosen, the T-X technology a bit too much for me, but the bottom line is that it doesn't have much of a story. Many movies don't actually need one, take "Deep Blue Sea" for instance, great entertainment without the need of a solid story. But the T movies already have a very cool story with, mostly, down-to-earth technology involved. Advanced, but mostly believable, and this goes for design also, the whole "make it look cool" clause from the first T2 book was very appealing to me as I enjoy things which look nice but also look practical enough to pass as a believable design. T3's tech and design is a bit different, clearly shown with both with the T-X and hardware in the 2029 scenes.Let me make it blatantly clear what we are talking about here. This will be fully understood by fans of the Aliens saga. I rank T3 as marginally better than "Alien : Resurrection", a movie which corrupted and devastated the the beloved Aliens saga. This statement will allow you to make your own references. If you liked "Aliens : Resurrection" and thought it to be a worthy follow-up to the earlier movies, then you will most probably love T3. If you on the other hand wish it had never come to exist, then you get an idea of my views on T3.I remember going to see "Alien 3" many years ago, I then expected something even better and more advanced than the prequel before it, I was utterly disappointed due to it not measuring up to my expectations. In retrospect, Alien 3 isn't really that bad, just different. I wish I could say the same for T3. I came to the theatre expecting something bad, due to numerous reviews, the intel of T3's budget problems and a script without Cameron. All of this negativity made me confident T3 would come out on top, seeing how I expected so little of it. But the disappointment was devastating. The worst part is that T3 has become a comedy, a quick action movie with dry jokes and one-liners accompanied with solid special effects. The movie mocks the previous two movies and tries to play the same jokes, whereas it comes out as a sad experience. Even the Terminators aren't really the same anymore, they are much more human, with facial expressions and logics that robots would never apply. The whole "machine syndrome" isn't apparent at all, which is one of the really nice things about T2, this "man beside machine, examining the differences and similarities of her creation."While T2's story was excellent, it had something else, call it "storytelling"; the ability to tell a story in a flowing manner with scenes that logically follow eachother and keeps the viewer interested. This technique is one of the prime things that makes T2 excel and the prime thing that makes T3 crash and burn. The viewer is presented with scenes which appear to be cut together, where most are action scenes and the other scenes are dry humor. Humor will vary greatly between people, but as a preview of what to expect, I must say that a joke which was funny when Joe Pesci said it in Lethal Weapon 3, is certainly not funny 2003.I do apologize for the constant comparisons with Terminator and T2, such references do not belong in a review, but I felt it was needed so everyone reading this can examine my views on the previous movies and compare it with their own views. Without references that one can relate to, a review or criticism is simply an incomprehendable description from which it is difficult to form an opinion on.In truth, I do not want you to see T3. Yes, you will be one of the few on the planet who didn't see T3, but then again you will be one of the few people who has untainted, glorious memories of the first two movies. No one can change that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeds what one might expect from a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story will be familiar to followers of the series so far: a cyborg killing machine is sent back in time from a future where machines rule the Earth, to eliminate John Connor, the future rebel leader and saviour of humanity. At the same time, a ?good Terminator' in the form of a T-101 model (i.e. Schwarzenegger) is sent back with the mission to keep Connor alive for the day when the Skynet system is due to launch its first attack on humanity. This may sound mostly like a tiresome rerun of ?Terminator 2' but apparently, Sarah and John Connor did not prevent Judgment Day in ?Terminator 2' ?they only postponed it! Also, the twist and selling point here, is that this time the ?baddie' is T-X, a female supermodel ?Terminator' which is far superior to the T-101 (?an obsolete model').Of the original main cast, only Arnie is back; Sarah Connor is dead as Linda Hamilton did not want to star in another sequel and Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl to play John Connor. Another new face to the cast is Claire Danes who gives an appealing performance as the suitably bewildered and vulnerable girl destined to be John Connor's wife. With a delay of twelve years since ?T2 Judgment Day' was released, Schwarzenegger's career on the decline and him revisiting the role for a third instalment, there is obviously a lot of pressure on this one to deliver the goods, and it certainly does. Schwarzenegger is key to much of the fun of the film; his delivery of one-liners with robotic seriousness and Austrian accent is superb. As a result, I found the film hilarious in parts. At the start of the film, there is a re-run of two cyborgs being zapped back from the future nude and this makes for one of the funniest scenes in the film where a naked Arnie strides into Ladies night at a bar to be mistaken for a stripper by the raucous attendees. He then steals the stage dancer's leather biker costume before trying on his star-shaped shades ?he off course soon ditches these for the by now familiar and way cooler black shades! A lot of excitement is to be had from the film's action set-pieces and chases and this is down to the relentlessness of the T-X who like her predecessor, can shape herself into another human being and pull herself back together whatever gun you use to shoot at her. Surprisingly, the ending is affecting as it reflects the inevitability of Connor's future role as a leader despite his reluctance to believe throughout. Also, (I actually feel a bit silly for admitting it) I was unexpectedly moved by the scene where the T-101 struggles to override the corruption that the T-X has implanted in his program so that he alternates between conflicting missions of killer/protector of John Connor.I have to admit that I didn't totally get the plot and was a bit lost with regards the references to the Skynet system. However, if you just go with the flow and don't think too much about the story, ?Terminator 3 makes for undemanding entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action movie...*SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to the theatre to see "Terminator 3" I wasn't expecting much. They waited so long to make it and the commercials didn't make it look that great. However, when the credits rolled I was very impressed. It was a very entertaining film with a good story line and ending. I liked it how before The Terminator (Arnold) was crushed he said he would be seeing John again. Thats what I like about the Terminator, it has to deal with the future. Now I thought the fact that judgement day did come in the end was a good idea. They couldn't just copy the end of Terminator 2 so they had to change it. They changed it well. Though in the narration of John Connor John says: "When I was 13 years old" (obviously reflecting on Terminator 2) they had got it wrong. It is clear that it says on the screen of the computer screen that T1000 uses: John Connor 10 years old. I think they people who made the movie were too lazy to actually watch the movie and check so they just got how old the actor was who played John (13). But, this movie did keep my attention very well and I give it an 8/10. It is out of theatres now but I reccomend renting it on video/dvd. Its worth your money...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the first two Terminator movies. The first film is one of my all-time favourites and the second was a near-perfect sequel so I approached this film with a bit of trepidation. Yes, it's true. Terminator 3 isn't as good as either of the first two. The story has some weaknesses and some of the acting (mainly Stahl and Danes) isn't that great. Nevertheless, Arnold is terrific, the action is outstanding (especially the crane scene) and the ending is certainly memorable. I'm glad I took the time to watch it. It isn't a classic, but it was a very enjoyable film nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequal to the very popular terminator series is a good production but lacks the atmosphere of excitement which its predecessor has (Terminator 2: Judgement Day). Even though Rise Of The Machines had a larger budget, the camera techniques used to film this movie was absolutely appauling. However the special effects used in the movie more than made up for that.The performances of the cast were excellent, in particular Arnold Schwarzenegger (T-850, or the model 101), and Kristanna Loken (The Terminatrix).I believe that if James Cameron directed Rise Of The Machines it would have been a better movie.Overall: If your a fan of the Terminator then watch it, and if your not then wait for the rental release."Hasta La Vista Baby!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It couldn't possibly live up to T1 &amp; T2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSAfter the now classic first two films, we have this largely pointless sequel. I fear it was made only for financial reasons and the absence of James Cameroon shows this. After a twelve year wait, I think the makers could have done better than this.My main concern was the lack of explanation as to how Skynet was developed. After Dyson was killed in T2 and his work destroyed, I think we deserved to have a more thought-out development of this "re-birth" of the Skynet AI. The development of Skynet in T3 was rushed and contradicts the time-line we learned in the first films.The overall ethos I so admired in T2 is lacking here. More than anything, T2 gave us hope for the future: that it is NOT in our nature to kill ourselves. Now here in T3 we learn Judgment Day "is inevitable".The absence of Linda Hamilton also made this film suffer. When we learn of Sarah's death it is empty and unsatisfying.While it was a enjoyable "action" film with some good characters and set-pieces, I feel overall the tone and story are inferior to the well loved T1 &amp; T2. The ending was an anti-climax and seems only fit for setting up the possibilities of more and more sequels (probably of diminishing quality).I will finish by saying that in the official Making of Terminator 2 documentary I watched yesterday, T2 was described as "The Conclusion". I rest my case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the creator of the series gone, what is left of an epic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people, including I were very doubtful Terminator 3 would amount to anything, after the departure of James Cameron from the project. Other blows for fans of the series were that neither Edward Furlong nor Linda Hamilton would show up for the sequel and that not even William Wisher (who co-wrote both of the previous films wrote anything for this one). Instead the writers were people of little fame and the director was not too famous as well, only having had a small ?hit' called U-571 in the year 2000 (grossing over 100 Million Dollars world-wide). The only comfort for the doubtful (such as I), was that Mario Kassar (producer of T2) and Gale Anne Hurd (producer and co-creator of The Terminator and producer of T2) were attached to the project as producers. It took a quite a time to cast T3 and it left me with mixed feelings. First it was said that Famke Janssen (the best Bond-girl ever) was to play the TerminatriX, but she turned it down. Then Edward Furlong was not going to be present as John Connor. By then I'd given up hope, that this could ever work. Then they cast Nick Stahl, who I extremely liked in Bully, as the ?new' John Connor and Claire Danes (of Romeo + Juliet fame) was cast as well. This looked more promising, but sold I wasn't. The trailer came along and I liked it pretty much, but still I stayed away from the big cinema and awaited the Terminators arrival at our local cinema. When he came I went, and when I left, I left satisfied.Terminator 3 starts out with a great spoken intro by John Connor and then delves deeply into matter with which all Terminator fans are well accustomed too: Terminators arriving on earth after being sent back in time, desperately in the need of clothes. This is what all Terminator films start with and this though this one does so with a different type of approach. In the first part of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a good one-liner after another and the action scenes are predominant (as they remain for the bigger part of the film). The one-liners are not always funny because of what is said, but because of the way it is said in and the facial expression Arnold makes when he utters the remarks. The action scenes are enormous and nothing short of spectacular (which is something I do not say easily, since I've seen a lot of action on film). This, along with some surprises in the story, are what keeps you on the edge of you seat for the ride and the only thing that could be considered drawback in this film, is the fact that the action sequences are too dominant at times.But what about the times, when there are no action scenes? What about the acting? Well, Arnie was as good as ever in his role as the almost indestructible Terminator (although his last few lines were corny and almost overshadowed his entire performance). Claire Danes did an ok job and Nick Stahl was adequate as the new John Connor. Kristina Loken was ok as the T-X, but at times I felt that more could have done with her. Maybe they could have made more use of her looks and maybe they could have made her act a little less than the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) in T2. But hey, if everything was good, that would be the perfect scenario and hence, the perfect film! Whenever did you see that one?Another drawback of the film manifests itself toward the end. There seems to be a desperate attempt by the makers of the film, to make Arnold say some memorable lines as he did in The Terminator and T2. I hate to say it, but they fall flat and almost ruin the ending. I said almost! Because when you think almost everything is done and the rest of the story is obvious, there is one surprise left for John and Kate (Claire Danes) and this is, what makes the film really worth while. Those last seven minutes or so, when John and Kate are on their own and when once again, there is a spoken part. That part only (together with the spoken intro) is worth the price admission. Really well done! The finishing touch comes with Brad Fiedel's theme, which I so dearly missed in the beginning of the film. Why oh why did they not play it at the beginning as well??? All in all this is good effort and the slightly ?worse' rating in comparison to The Terminator and T2 only stems from Arnold's last one-liners and the fact that this was more of a summer popcorn flick than were the other two.7,75 out of 10post scriptum: expect a fourth installment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delivering plenty of well-staged action and SFX at high speed, nobody could argue that you don't get plenty of bangs for your buck here. But as it rewarms the plot of T2 without any conviction and expects the audience to accept coincidence after plot-pushing coincidence, this adds nothing to Terminator folklore.So a myriad vehicles and buildings are destroyed and countless guns are fired, but there is absolutely nothing here that hasn't been done before(and better) in the first two T's. In fact, there's something sad about hearing Arnie refer to himself as 'obsolete'. For all its apparent energy, T3 - like its once-mighty star - somehow seems extremely tired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It starts off badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts off badly.Call me an old romantic, but I like my Arnie films violent and bloody. Terminator 3 has a 12A certificate. Suddenly I'd worked out how so many under-10s had managed to cajole the cinema's ticket sellers: the occasional head and shoulders that I could see in front of me belonged to the requisite accompanying adult. I had horrible visions that one of the best sci-fi franchises was about to be watered down like RoboCop had been on the dreadful TV series (where the Future of Law Enforcement, rather than shoot between the eyes, prefers so shoot a table leg, which causes an unsuspecting vase to lose its balance and fall on the head of the Bad Guy).Taking over director duties from James Cameron is U-571's Jonathan Mostow (a minus), Nick Stahl takes over the central-character-of-John-Connor duties from Edward Furlong (probably a plus), the Austrian OakT looks good for a man in his 50s and into the mix is thrown John Connor's love interest, Kate Brewster, played by Claire Danes.Plot wise, T3's is essentially the same as T2's. A bad terminator has been sent back in time by the baddies (the machines) to kill the goodies (humans) before they become important future leaders in the future war between goodies and baddies. The goodies have therefore sent back a good terminator (Arnie) to protect the future leaders from the bad terminator.The latest model of terminator is the T-X, played by former model Kristanna Loken and, according to the law of sequels, the baddie is contractually obliged to be more deadly that its predecessor... well, that's the idea. Loken's portrayal of a robot killing machine isn't too bad at all, even though at one point she does resort to making turns 90? at a time, however she is somewhat let down by her terminator. In T2, the top of the range terminator was made of liquid metal (which meant that it was effectively impossible snap in two) and could cleverly change shape to look like anyone he/she wanted. The scriptwriters, not wishing to lose that useful plot device, have made sure that the T-X can do this too. The difference is that underneath the liquid metal is a robot which, although near indestructible, does mean the "terminatrix" does have an Achilles heel. On the plus side, the manufactures have built-in some weapons and what appears to be the entire Maplin catalogue. The latter enables her to hack into and then control any computer. In fact, it turns out that the only thing she doesn't have is a built-in mobile phone or radio; these manufacturers need their heads banging together!Which leads us nicely onto the first action scene. T-X enters into a car chase with heroes by driving 12-wheel articulated crane while remote controlling two police cars and an ambulance and dealing with Arnie swinging from the end of the crane hook. Crashing through buildings, cars exploding, skidding across people's lawns - fantastic! The scene's good enough to overlook the fact that the cars that T-X has hacked into aren't controlled by computer override, but instead by the pedals and steering wheel moving themselves. All that was missing was Michael Knight.It's not just the plot that's the same as T2, so are the gags. Arnie gets to use his catchphrases, we get to laugh at a naked Arnie stealing clothes from a camp stripper in the middle of his act, Arnie likes wearing sunglasses, etc. Make no mistake, the star of the show is Arnie. And he's been given much more to actually do this time round. Almost without exception, this a mistake.One of the great things about T2 on DVD is the extended version where they flick the switch that enables Arnie to learn. Indeed, this would have been an interesting theme to explore. The central theme of T3 is destiny, and that there's nothing we can do to avoid it. Of course, this allows for this sequel, because the rationale is that although they thought they'd successfully changed the future at the end of T2, in fact they hadn't. This is crudely worked into the script. For me, John Connor's and Kate Brewster's realisation and easy acceptance of the ideas of time travel and destiny (including the fate that they're meant to be together) weakens their characters. I think that John Connor's speech would have been better used telling it to Kate rather than to the audience as the opening monologue.So, is it better than T2? No. Of course, that would have been hard. Some things are better (the hydrogen fuel cells, T-X being able to DNA test by licking blood, seeing the wobbly first model terminators), many things are the same (losing the roof of a car by driving under something too low), but too many things are worse (Arnie not measuring body count to one decimal place, the pointless cameo by Dr Silberman, the conveniently-timed failings of the bad terminator, use of liquid metal shape changing special effects, the fact that you only get the signature tune on the end credits and many more besides).Still a bit of a laugh, though. I'm looking forward to T4 already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right then, Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines. From the moment I heard this was being made I was cynical, when I heard Cameron and half the cast from T2 were not involved I was apprehensive. Now that it has been I managed to get myself to the cinema in a slightly nervous manner, my worry was that this would ruin the other two Terminator films, well I have watched both since I saw T3 and it didn't but I didn't leave the cinema satisfied.Firstly I would like to say that i actually thought Nick Stahl was good as John Conner, one of my worries was that he wouldn't be. The main problem lies with the actual film itself. Firstly, why is it so tongue in cheek? The first Terminator has a very dark, almost horror movie feel to it. Terminator 2 is more of an all out action and there are a few well placed gag's, but the atmosphere, particularly towards the end is still fitting to the story line. Terminator 3 however is more like a self-parody, filled to the brim with references to the previous two films. The character of the T-101 has, in effect, been transformed into a comedian. I'll admit I laughed out loud a quite a few times, but if want to laugh at a film I'll go see American Pie! This is the Terminator, a ruthless killing machine and when confronted by a store assistant it replies with; `Talk to the hand'! That isn't what the Terminator is about. I can see some similarities to what was done to Freddy Kreuger when Wes Craven jumped from the 'Nightmare On Elm Street' ship, a scary horror villain turned into a comic joke, a merchandising product in effect. By the time Arnie had said his final `I'm back' I had given up. One of my other problems was with the story line. The previous two films were based around the idea that `there is no fate but what we make', I guess that is an idea of James Cameron's. T3 squelches that theory and therefore renders the actions of T2 obsolete, which was one of my big fears. They simply delayed Judgement Day. I also personally don't believe in fate, maybe that was one of the reasons the Terminator films meant (mean) so much to me. Terminator 3 suggests that there is a fate and nothing John or anyone else can do will change the fact that there will be a war between the humans and the machines.There were positive aspects to T3, I didn't hate so much as I cant be objective here. The action was good, if not as groundbreaking as T2, John Mostow coped with the direction quite well and I liked the idea of seeing some of the very 1st Terminator models, that was a nice touch. Claire Danes' character showed some (small) signs of mirroring Sarah Conner. And there is of course the possibility that they could make a fourth film based directly on the beginning of the war. Could they cover the war sufficiently in one film thought? I don't think so. But seeing as they made T3 why not go further, there's not much else left to lose. In fact the ending was one of the few saving graces, a nice little twist to an otherwise mediocre affair.To sum up, I don't think T3 should have been made. The world isn't a particularly better place with it and would not have suffered without. I feel sorry that James Cameron's work has been undone by this middle of the road and un-necessary addition to the Terminator saga. I'll finish by saying that this was Cameron's creation, if he had anything else to say HE would have made T3.5/10 for the good action sequences and the first 20 gags.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just returned back from the cinema, where I watched the third sequel of the Terminator. Overall, it was not bad, and it was not too good either. Schwarzenegger was ok, the female terminator wasn't bad either, but the thought of her driving the police vehicle remotely doesn't fit right (anyway, she's sexy :-))... The plot is straight, nothing difficult to understand, and I think that the main point is that the dudgment day was inevitable, it was something that could only be postponed for some time... I think that all Terminator and the Matrix movies are on the same track and we must all think about how possible is a world that both these movies show. I just hope there won't be any Terminator 4, to continue from where the third sequel stopped...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to objective about something you love,even when that something is a movie.I saw "The Terminator" when it was released and thought [and still think] it was the best and most original Science Fiction movie i had ever seen."Terminator 2" was a worthy successor with better SFX even though it lacked the darkness and originality of T1.The link between the two was of course James Cameron.And then we have T3,directed by Johnathan Mostow.I have tried to think of something positive to say about T3 but i can"t except to say that its over quickly and marginally less painful than root canal work!In the first scene we see an Aerial HK,obviously CGI and totally unrealistic with even the design changed.Its downhill from there;you get the impression that Mostow had a series of ideas for setpieces and at the last minute had to come up with a story to link them.Nobody acts with any conviction,and Arnold is almost a parody of himself.And the dialogue!"I"ll be back"-"She"ll be back"-"He"ll be back".Need i go on? It hurts to have to criticise ANY movie with Terminator in the title,and i suppose anyone who has never seen T1 or T2 will love this but all i can say is "I hope he"ll not be back"!</fullReview>

She is the one who gives the brightness, you know what i mean. When you look at her, at first scene, you can only sigh. And yes, this movie probably has the best car chase ever(not counting movies about car chases:))</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw T3 today and what can I say but "ughhh" The magic of Jim Cameron was clearly, blindingly missing. T2 was a huge step up from T1. But T3 was a similarly large step back.Where was the imagination that T1 and T2 had. As for the effects. Yes most of them were good but not in the same way as T2 in its day. And where was the music of Brad Fidel. When you think T1/T2 you think of the Fidel march. Its like Spielberg without Williams.Maybe I am getting old or something but this film just had nothing going on. I mean nothing: been there, seen it, done it, ALL OF IT and seen it done equally well or better elsewhere. Like the tooooooooo long truck chase.I guess the core of the problem is I can't think of many directors that could have stepped into the shoes of JC on a gig like this. I guess this is an example of the old adage "if it aint bust dont fix it". It was great and now its not.If there is going to be a T4 (and I now doubt it despite the box office) then Jim Cameron has so be there in the directors chair.And as for Sarah Connor (and my eldest dauhther is named after her). The way one of the greatest female heroines of the last 20 years was killed off. My god what a total and mind numbing waste.Still, maybe I will wake up tomorrow and find that it is all a dream.</fullReview>

BUT as the third installment in the Terminator series there is only one thing to say: "Not good enough"!!!! there where way too many stupid one-liners(in an "ordinary" arnie movie it would be great), but for me it made it completely impossible to take him and the movie serious. one or two funny situations are ok, they where there in T2 as well. but this was way over the top! The first movie where an action thriller, so was the second, (whith the focus on the action) but this sometimes looks like Rush hour 3!!!! which is very very wrong in a Terminator movie!So I gave it 7, but with fewer stupid "funny" scenes it would have been 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie while enduring a terrible headache. Not that I'd want you to jump to any conclusions; it wasn't because of Schwarzenegger. It was because I had seen the sequel to Charlie's Angels(though I haven't seen the original). I might comment on that another time, but just so you know: it's bad.I guess The Terminator is one of this years "hits", at least regarding the popularity. Too bad you can't see it now in California, as Arnold is doing his new act. I feared much before this movie, but I can say my fears have been allayed. It wasn't as bad as it could've been; actually it was rather good. SPOILERSSome might have noticed this(or maybe not): I tend to put that "spoilers" thingy every time and I don't tell when they end. My way of reviewing actually involves few spoilers, but sometimes, for the film's sake, I just have to put some in...and I definitely don't want any trouble with "the big guys" from wonderful imdb. First of all I am impressed by how Arnie has kept in shape! Seriously now, he really does still look like the Terminator we all knew. He cam, he saw, he terminated; that's how I'd call his part. I like Arnold, always have, and I certainly like him more than Stallone or Van Damme. He's just more interesting to watch. All talk very little, but Schwarzenegger did sometimes defy this "custom". He is the symbol of the movies and always will be, though the true center should actually be lain, story wise, on the future leader of the human race: John Connor. Nick Stahl does a good job to look like a desperate man, certainly not at as a leader, but he starts being what he will be towards the end. I liked the idea that the woman is always behind the man: quite was here. Nice Clare Danes, too. Miss Kristanna "TX" Loken was, of course, the "big newcomer". I can't say that I liked her more than the previous terminator. Actually, I liked her less. But if that's what we got, we have to live with her, and I certainly would. The story is somewhat more complex than I expected and the ending really did take me quite off guard. It was certainly the best way the film could've ended so that it would've been good. A "human win all" scenario would've been more disappointing. Story wise it is good. What the main problem is? Somewhat expected I believe: similar scenes involving the terminators with the previous movies. The action was very enjoyable, a lot of cars blown up, a lot of people gunned down, stuff like that, but all in all enjoyable. Good direction I'd say, better than expected. Might have been something else with Cameron, but...this was destiny! Almost reminded me of The Matrix towards the end.Just go and see it. It's a nice flick. If you liked the first two, I don't really see why you shouldn't like this one. A healthy 8/10. Oh, I almost forgot. Did you wonder about the title? Well, if you'll see the movie you might just get your answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. How dare they destroy what had gone before.First of all it seems to have turned into an action-comedy film, at times the humour is almost slapstick, this means that the suspense of the first two has been completely removed. Our new female terminator friend was lacking. I can't quite put my finger on it but I didn't 'fear' this one. What about the action? We were promised spectacular action scenes and I suppose some were quite good but when you're not enjoying a film they tend to get a bit boring after a while.If I was forced to say something nice about this film then I would have to say that the ending is good (and not just because the film was now over) but mainly because it was unexpected. I am, however, a little concerned about the prospect of a sequel. Even though I suppose it would HAVE to be better than this. Now that I've got all that off my chest I'm going to go and sit down and watch the first two installments and try to forget that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines ever happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictably flawed, but surprisingly not without merit. (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up on Terminator movies. Ts 1 and 2 were compulsive viewing for most of the pre-adolescent boys I knew. And, just as 30-year-old Star Wars geeks did when the Phantom Menace rolled around, I braced myself for the devestation that this installment would be a pile of moist slimy garbage.And I watched the credits come up. And I waited. And I listened. Where was it? WHERE? WHERE IN THE NAME OF THE SWEET SISTER OF THE SHEEP WAS THE THEME MUSIC? In my opinion the undisputed greatest film theme tune of all time was missing, and Arnie's name appeared over near silence! I gently weeped into my Starburst.Then the Terminators arrive, yadda yadda yadda, including a female one (ooh! Feel the controversy!), and then some stuff happens in a pet rescue centre that I can't remember, and then for some reason there is a car/lorry/whatever chase that was genuinley painful to watch in it's un-Terminator-ness, and then the Big T was driving in a desert with John Connor and Clare Danes.Now it starts. A minor plot twist in the lorry and suddenly I'm awake again. Then the coffin set piece and the only genuinley funny moment in the film (in the gas station), and my suicidal urges have subsided for now.Some average scenes in the Skynet factory and underground silo with the sketchy but not completely unappealing T-X and Arnie's line "We'll meet again" setting T4 up quite nicely, and then it's over.As the camera pulls out, and the inevitable voiceover intervenes, I look at my watch. That was short. Surely that can't be it? Or maybe I just enjoyed it more than I realise.As it fades to black and the familiar six notes kick in (der der der, der der dah!), a tear springs to my eye, and despite the disappointment of this installment, I can't help but hope he'll be back again soon.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very middle of the road *Contains spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right then, Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines. From the moment I heard this was being made I was cynical, when I heard Cameron and half the cast from T2 were not involved I was apprehensive. Now that it has been I managed to get myself to the cinema in a slightly nervous manner, my worry was that this would ruin the other two Terminator films, well I have watched both since I saw T3 and it didn't but I didn't leave the cinema satisfied.Firstly I would like to say that i actually thought Nick Stahl was good as John Conner, one of my worries was that he wouldn't be. The main problem lies with the actual film itself. Firstly, why is it so tongue in cheek? The first Terminator has a very dark, almost horror movie feel to it. Terminator 2 is more of an all out action and there are a few well placed gag's, but the atmosphere, particularly towards the end is still fitting to the story line. Terminator 3 however is more like a self-parody, filled to the brim with references to the previous two films. The character of the T-101 has, in effect, been transformed into a comedian. I'll admit I laughed out loud a quite a few times, but if want to laugh at a film I'll go see American Pie! This is the Terminator, a ruthless killing machine and when confronted by a store assistant it replies with; `Talk to the hand'! That isn't what the Terminator is about. I can see some similarities to what was done to Freddy Kreuger when Wes Craven jumped from the ?Nightmare On Elm Street' ship, a scary horror villain turned into a comic joke, a merchandising product in effect. By the time Arnie had said his final `I'm back' I had given up. One of my other problems was with the story line. The previous two films were based around the idea that `there is no fate but what we make', I guess that is an idea of James Cameron's. T3 squelches that theory and therefore renders the actions of T2 obsolete, which was one of my big fears. They simply delayed Judgement Day. I also personally don't believe in fate, maybe that was one of the reasons the Terminator films meant (mean) so much to me. Terminator 3 suggests that there is a fate and nothing John or anyone else can do will change the fact that there will be a war between the humans and the machines. There were positive aspects to T3, I didn't hate so much as I cant be objective here. The action was good, if not as groundbreaking as T2, John Mostow coped with the direction quite well and I liked the idea of seeing some of the very 1st Terminator models, that was a nice touch. Claire Danes' character showed some (small) signs of mirroring Sarah Conner. And there is of course the possibility that they could make a fourth film based directly on the beginning of the war. Could they cover the war sufficiently in one film thought? I don't think so. But seeing as they made T3 why not go further, there's not much else left to lose. In fact the ending was one of the few saving graces, a nice little twist to an otherwise mediocre affair. To sum up, I don't think T3 should have been made. The world isn't a particularly better place with it and would not have suffered without. I feel sorry that James Cameron's work has been undone by this middle of the road and un-necessary addition to the Terminator saga. I'll finish by saying that this was Cameron's creation, if he had anything else to say HE would have made T3.5/10 for the good action sequences and the first 20 gags.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know the above comment will seem sacrilegious to those of you who worship T2 but T2 is a very very long way from being the best movie ever made, despite what some of you seem to think. T3 is an average movie with some good action sequences. The dialogue, acting and plot development are all about standard for a no-brainer summer blockbuster. At least we're spared the patronising and clumsy moralising of T2, and thank God the odious little Edward Furlong has been binned. What lifted this film above mediocrity was its surprisingly downbeat ending. In contrast to the vomit-inducing sentimentality of T2, this had quite a creepy finish, and sets the franchise up well for the next installment. Having said that though, it's maybe time to put the series to bed. Arnie's past it, and if his Terminator opponents were to become any more advanced it would just be silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but enjoyable action movie - a guilty pleasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father did not like it. He says it was dull. I would rather say it is dated. In our times, when non-characteristic, sensitive and fallible movie heroes are on the top of the box-office charts (e.g. Spiderman, Harry Potter, Frodo, the X-Men or Neo) this 100% macho point of view seems awfully dated. I know, we have seen Arnold playing this kind of "sensitive hero" (End of Days, The 6th Day, Collateral Damage) and the result was horrible. At least, this time he is back in the form and does what he can. And he is quite good and believable.This film has been late for at least 6 or 7 years. I heard about the fights over the rights but this does not change my opinion. I do not think that James Cameron could have made a much better movie out of this material - probably it would seem to be dated, as well.Otherwise, I have to say it is a hugely enjoyable action movie. I am not a die hard fan of the first two Terminator movies so I was able to sit back and enjoy the ride and forget criticism. The best thing about this movie is that it knows its boundaries: it is nothing else but an entertaining summer action movie with a straightforward, not so subtle opinion about the connection between humanity and technology. I think that everything has already been said about this connection in Stanley Kubrick's "2001: a space odyssey". The special effects are first rate but not revolutionary. But why should they be? This race between the recent action movies in order to create never-before-seen special effects is useless and senseless. After a time the result is laughable. Often the reliable formula can be much more entertaining. And the third Terminator movie belongs to this group.It is also a good thing that the end of the movie is different from the majority of Hollywood action movies - at least it is not a flag-waving finale.But there are disadvantages, as well: I think with the help of much more irony this could be a funnier (and better) movie. Arnold's first scene at the chippendale bar is the kind of thing I think of. Too bad that they did not follow that line. I also expected some character development in the case of human characters. All in all, it can be an entertaining movie if you do not have great expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a bit of heresy: this one was the best of the lot.Some reasons, in brief:1) Minimal requirement for AS to open his mouth; but nice action and makeup.2) The story was well told, despite AS's presence, with all the right notes in the right places.3) The 'female' terminator was great, and more menacing than its predecessor - _because_ she was so dishy.4) Nice mix between the serious and dark, and stuff to grin about. (Could have done without some AS one-liners and the stupid shade-gags.)5) Neat avoidance of gratuitous gore without loss of story-telling effect.6) The development of Kate Brewster from a bewildered - already quite 'competent', but still fairly socially conformist - female into what's going to be a very kick-ass lady was nicely indicated.7) Great end! It promises another movie: the one telling the story about the ultimate victory.8) No resurrection of Linda Hamilton, and9) the absence of the wide-eyed-teenage-boy-wow-! element.10) No unnecessarily 'noble' characters. Just people who do what turn out to be very stupid things for reasons which are perfectly valid to them. (This is known as 'life' and thus believable.)11) The transition for the stereotypical notion of the 'mainframe'/hardware-based Skynet to the 'distributed', software-based kind (a transition symbolizing that from the industrial revolution into the information age) was a touch of genius, and provided a neat rationale for the theme of this movie.Note:If AS becomes governor and canna do T4, it doesn't matter. Actually I hope he won't be able to do it. Stahl and Danes are quite suited to the job. It'll be a different story, but so what? It may be a _better_ story, and, for that matter, it might actually give the whole series a proper closure.I just hope they make the T4 story consistent. It won't be easy to convince me how a few straggly humans defeat a huge army of machines, all of whom operate without a centralized 'command'. The only device that leaps to mind is a virus-disinfectant, but that would be quite unoriginal and wouldn't provide much of a story...Just don't let Cameron loose on this. Please, please, not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3: Marketable Sequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost tradition for each sequel in an entry to slip from its roots and drift more and more into the realms of comedy. It's also tradition for the scope to expand to make it "bigger" and "better." This is most apparent in the horror genre where sequels are in abundance, meanwhile comedy sequels just become more and more mindless. The Terminator franchise also follows this trend.While I'm certainly not against easing up on the tension every now and again with well placed humor, T3 fails to capture the essence of its apocalyptic predecessors and convince me that it is, indeed, a Terminator film. In T2, Cameron managed to maintain the fact we still deal with machines even if our model 101 killing machine is spouting the occasional Connor-taught one liners. While I liked some of the humor, I didn't much care for quite a bit of it but I won't go into detail on which instances bugged me.While I'm not against the film due to the lack of the original talent, either Mostow was too eager to create an homage to Cameron's past entries and cluttered the screen with too much homage and too little film or the studio wanted him to re-create someone elses work. I'll give Mostow the benefit of the doubt because I feel somewhere in T3 there's a truly excellent film screaming to get out, but not a Cameron film-a Mostow film. It feels too much like a fish out of water for me to truly enjoy all the way.Though I have to say, I was happy to find a third Marco Beltrami score that I liked. While Fiedel's original scores were not the absolute greatest scores in the world, Termniator does have a very distinct musical signature to it and a very well done main theme. I won't rush out and buy this Terminator score any time soon, Beltrami does bring an interesting traditional scoring presence to Fiedel's synthetic creations and does follow along in similar veins even if I really didn't like the orchestral rendition of the Terminator main theme, itself.Like the previously released Matrix 2, T3 suffers from action in excess. It has me worried about the future of action films, actually. As action packed and high tech as these chases are, I find myself yawning from boredom along the tail end of them. Let's face it, we've seen all of this before. Different vehicles, different special effects techniques, but we've seen our share of car chases/gun fights/action scenes . . . making them longer is not going to make them more interesting. I wonder what director will be the first to direct the very first film composed solely of one action scene? Hmm.I found myself also making the mistake of asking too many questions like "If the T-X has power over other machines, why didn't she utilize it more?" or "Why doesn't she use her cannon to blow up the good guys right there?" I didn't find the T-X too terribly intriguing since they made her so advanced and so much more powerful than anything the good guys could throw at her - I couldn't see how the film would last more than 20 minutes if she utilized her advantages most efficiently, which, realistically, is how Skynet would program her.The T-1000 concept was a much better idea. He was still very limited, but did he ever take advantage of what he -could- do. He used his mimetic-poly-alloy attributes to the fullest in some of the coolest on-screen displays. The on screen rise of the machines I could have lived without, unmasking Skynet was a mistake because 1) Skynet's explanation was unbelievable and 2) the previously unseen, mysterious entity, now has a face and form. The images of global genocide by atomic weaponry had negligible power - Gary Larson drew Far Side comic strips with the same imagery. The scope T3 went for and how it executed it deadened the total impact. Cameron had it right by keeping things off Skynet, itself, and keeping the rise of the machines isolated to one perspective. He kept the camera down on earth where the war would tug hardest: on everyday people. Atomic detonation from the perspective of orbit shows the destruction of land masses, and leaves the billions destined to die to be written off in an abstract paraphrase where a full thesis is needed - it's the cliffnotes to the novel, and not the words of the artist, himself. Like many sequels, T3 disappointed me because it failed to realize less is more. I didn't hate T3, and I didn't think it sucked. Were it not a part of the Terminator universe, it'd be a decent action flick (and it still is a decent action flick inside the T-universe) . . . but it's the standardized, market-driven Terminator movie that lacks the vision and craft of its predecessors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor sequel to a wonderful series, a joke of a Terminator movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame, this movie started off so well, and with so much promise, despite the concern as to the absence of James Cameron, I thought the plot looked good and Arnie was back.However, it really quickly turned into a joke of a Terminator movie. Not much brooding terror as the Terminator entered the present day again; comic laughs were played for from the outset. Surely Leslie Nielson was due in at any second?Saying that, there were some of the original elements still there, the darkness; the downside to the story; the future twist that was yet to happen and you'd probably never see, and the human moments while the excitement was still thick in the air. Unfortunately, many of these were just swept over quickly in short bursts of dialogue to make way for another huge set piece.Not that the set pieces weren't amazing, it's just that by the end of the film, you feel that it was almost all a collection of set pieces. The audience was hardly given time to digest the shocking revelation from the Terminator, nor did any of the characters discuss it before heading off into the fight again.The other thing that hit me were the completely corny moments, two in particular stand out, the chance meeting of John Connor and his old school chum. How amazing was that considering that John Connor continually keeps moving and never stays in the same place? Then there was the need for the new Terminator to announce her findings of the DNA sampling to absolutely no one, despite the audience having already seen them flashed across her computer enhanced vision. American audiences I assume.In fact, the new Terminator isn't that scary or foreboding, and often she looks clumsy and awkward. Not a patch on the Terminator in T3, in fact none of the characters live up to their predecessors.I have heard talk of more sequels. I can only pray that James Cameron is out there, reading these, having watched the film, and decides he can't let the series be butchered again. Make another one, finish the series off and do it well Mr Cameron!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far away, so close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the Terminator franchise. I think T1 was brilliant, while T2 was an excellent sequel. That being said, I had very low expectations for the T3 film: there was no James Cameron, no Edward Furlong, the trailers were suprisingly unimpressive and I simply didn't think there should even be a sequel, since T2 seemed so conclusive.What I did get was something maybe worse than a bad movie: an unfulfilled potential.The special FX are OK, not impressive, but it should be noted that the bar is extremely high for the FX, so one can't expect to be blown away as easily as in, say, 1991. Kristanna Loken is a good T-X, Claire Danes is a solid addition and Nick Stahl is good enough not to think about Furlong.What surprised me the most is that the story actually made sense. There really was room for this sequel to be made, and the ending really showed that T3 had the potential to be an excellent exclamation point to the Terminator series. However, it didn't go that way. Mostow's direction is simply not suitable for the Terminator atmosphere. Action sequences look as in any recent blockbuster, the jokes simply are out of place and there is no 'dark' feeling the previous 2 movies had. It seems as Mostow simply didn't take this movie serious enough to make it as good as it could have been. In the end, I couldn't say T3 is a bad movie, but it simply should have been much, much better. Let's just say it didn't spoil the franchise for me, and I hope it will stay this way.Arnie, don't make T4. Leave the legends at peace...</fullReview>

The ending was okay I suppose but was it done so that another T film can be made ? I think it was. This vehicle should have finished after the 2nd film and it is now going down the route of other classics such as Jaws, Rocky, Rambo where the original films were really good but Rocky 2 and T2 apart the subsequent sequels just got worse and worse.

		<fullReview>T3 reminded plot wise of T2, Arnold is the good Terminator protecting a male and female from a liquid mental Terminator, you just tact on a not so a happy ending and you have T3. I was disappointed in the lack of effort put into the story line of this movie, they could have done so much with the whole Terminator concept, but yet they reached for so little. If they could not come up with a creative idea for this movie they should have went with something else. The writers should have jumped on the Freddy vs Jason, Alien vs. Predator bandwagon and did Terminator vs. Robocop.The story basically states that the T2 just pushed back the Human/machine war and it was no way of avoiding this outcome. Well, this pretty much gave away the ending at the beginning of the movie, the CG was pretty good as usual, but that's not enough to make a good picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostow's mean machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1991 T2 was a sociological and technological touchstone; CGI came of age, morphing became the subject of water-cooler conversations and a generation of aspiring artists (myself included) augmented pencil and paper with a graphics tablet. This breakthrough paved the way for the Jurassic Park franchise and, perhaps controversially, the Star Wars prequels.Jonathan Mostow (U-571), conscious that the bar was raised too high on T2, saliently leverages James Cameron's legacy and designs a thunderous rollercoaster ride that deftly mixes sci-fi and slasher genre thrills.Kristanna Loken's cyborg candy replaces Robert Patrick's liquid-metal Lucifer (T-1000) in T3. The transforming T-X combines svelte endoskeleton with cool couture. The director utilises the T-X as an object of fetish, and takes satirical swipes at consumer culture. This machine is as vain as the species it intends to eradicate. Loken acquits herself admirably, but never approaches the polite terror of Patrick's pseudo officer.Whilst characterisation is subject to minimalist treatment, Claire Danes (Kate Brewster) and Nick Stahl's (John Connor) chemistry is palpable and poignant.Composer Marco Beltrami (the Scream franchise), whilst referencing Brad Fiedel's motifs, paints a surprisingly rich and evocative score that owes much to Prokofiev and Russian romanticism.This third act inevitably dives into self-parody a la Return of the Jedi. However, whereas that overblown instalment foreshadowed the decline of George Lucas' space opera, Mostow's mean machine - from the vehicular chase to proto Hunter Killers - is determined to entertain in the form of pumped-up popcorn theatre!The hyper violence is tenuously justified by the genuinely affecting denouement, which references, both stylistically and thematically, classic sci-fi of the 20th century. With or without the iconic figure of Schwarzenegger, this instalment promises that there is more to come from the Terminator franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's make one thing clear ; I don't think anyone is gonna ( or not ) see this movie because of a favorable/unfavorable review. This IS Terminator 3. You know what the story's about. You've seen the prequels . You were not born yesterday. Hence this review will mention some specifics of the movie and if you haven't seen it yet , be warned .I went to the theatre with some very simple expectations. I wanted to see Arnie be THE Terminator once again. I figured I was in for some death , chaos and mayhem. You know what? It's OK by me to want some of that every once and awhile. I've enjoyed some very thoughtful, emotional and purposeful films. But now I was in it for all the ' wrong ' reasons. Strangely enough I was rather let down by this sequel .It wasn't just the holes in the script , some of them gaping. Didn't bother me. Way I see it there really shouldn't be a sequel to Part II ; it was too perfect for that. So the only way to link it with this sequel was to blow the script wide open.It wasn't the horrendous error in the casting of Nick Stahl in the role of John Connor either. This young man is simply in the wrong business ; he lacks any trace of personal charisma and charm a Hollywood actor should have. His casting in what is essentially the lead role in a multi-million dollar production is bizarre to say the least. The only time I was satisfied with him being in the frame was when Arnie got his hands around his throat and lifted him clear off the floor. Right there and then, if he would have wasted him the movie would have taken a twist in the right direction and broken through all that was expected from the script. But he didn't :-(Neither was the incredible naivity of the dialogs nor screenplay what blew it for me . You kinda shake the bad impression off when a frightened young woman downs what looks like a menacing small jet with an AK-47; OK so the Russians paid for some commercial exposure too. Why should only the Fins from Nokia be the smart ones and benefit from some ' gray ' advertising?The main sticking points for me ( and boy was I surprised from that ) were actually the only signs of intelligence this movie tried to show.The most obvious was of course the ending. Just as we are ready for the final showdown ,the mother of all battles , a glimpse of the monster itself , there's a tremendous let down with everything ending in a dusted place which looks forgotten from history with some AM radio broadcasts announcing the end of the world. I suppose with this the writers tried to show some originality. Originality is good. I've loved originality in all the mini sci-fi and horror series. But you know what? This is not a one-hour special episode of some TV series. This is a major blockbuster movie with fans of the original storyline and heroes who came to see the End coming as the proverbial Mack truck running clear through the screens. But this film doesn't End. It just fades away like a wounded animal that no one would put out of it's misery.That was the first thought after the film. But something deeper bothered me as well. The sour taste in my mouth somehow expanded in my mind as well. There was a message somewhere in there as well , hidden , lurking.Then it dawned on me ; what's the real difference between the second and the third Terminator ? It's the outlook of the Future. In Terminator II Linda Hamilton conveys a positive message ; Future is what we make of it. But here in the third part there's a much darker message: Future is inevitable. And the Future is the clash with the Machine . The Machine is our enemy and no matter what, it shall one day turn on us. So be afraid. Be very afraid. Dig some holes in your back yard. Stock up on supplies. Get some guns. Cause the reckoning is coming. And it doesn't matter that there are no enemies are left. It doesn't matter that the threat is not there any more ( parallel with the empty, dusted , obsolete nuke shelter ) There's a reason always for keeping a stockpile ready to blow the world up: It's there to be used and we'll use it on ourselves. And if you aren't afraid of the Russians anymore , if the aliens are nowhere to be found then don't worry. Look into your study , into your children's rooms, into your workspace. The Enemy is there , disguised , dormant , posing as a friend. Till it's time for Him to rise and destroy us all. But the Leader will emerge from the rubble with his few chosen saved by the rat holes they have dug for themselves. And he'll gather his few chosen ones and fly the American flag again ( as the tell-tale scene of the future in the beginning goes )Well guess again Mr Director ,Producer and Writer. Cause the flag you have waving there shouldn't stand for fear and an Army of One.Although there's plenty of folk out there who'd like that...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie should have stayed in bed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A string of disconnected (but fun) action scenes loosely bound by some drawn out, uninspired dialog.Having seen the movie some weeks ago it finally dawned on me that the worst thing about the movie was that it included the original terminator.I'm not knocking Arnie at all, rather that his character just didn't seem to fit into the plot particularly well.Weak humour such as the keys on the sun visor is further undermined by errors of fact; since Arnie learned about the keys in the second movie but was then destroyed, how come the third model knows this?The new terminator model was slick and cute with some fun dialog but that wasn't enough to save this tired mess.Hopefully the next installment will have a new director and producer and Arnie will be watching from the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If all action movies were as much fun as this one, perhaps I wouldn't hate the genre so much.I suppose it helps that I'm already familiar with the back story and characters, but I think more important are that it has just enough intelligence, and assumes that the viewer does too, plus plenty of humour and even wit.Fears that the lack of the James Cameron panache would be a severe setback proved ill-founded. It's a great roller coaster ride, but perhaps just a shade less so than T2.And here's something I thought I'd never be saying ... Arnie is so good. His deadpan delivery of some of his hilarious lines is just spot on, and he even makes you feel the confusion of the man-machine faced with moral dilemmas. In fact, in a role that is really just a high tech version of Frankenstein's monster, I'd say he even gives the great Boris Karloff a run for his money.And the ending this time leaves us in absolutely no doubt that Arnie (and the others) will be back.Unless he becomes Governor of California, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Cameron is missing and Nick Stahl/Claire Danes are not the right actors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think T2 is one of the best movies I have ever seen. With anticipation I waited for T3. The movie has a great start and some great and funny ideas. the major problems are tough: Nick Stahl is not a good john connor. He turned into a wussie! He is not that young man with a lot of courage that he was in T2. And back then he was 13 years old! Claire Danes plays a scream queen and I can't beleive that the fate of manking would depend on her. The T-X seems to me not as dangerous as the T2 altough she should be more dangerous, but the T-1000 made a more dangerous impression, hard to say why. The movie lacks also in terms of sound. Sound is 50% of the experience and many action sequences have just no music or not good music, it takes away part of the experience. James Cameron knows very well how to use the sound, Mostow now. What doesn't make sense that this T-800 is not the same as he was in T2, yet he refuses to kill humans, how should he know not to do that? I also think it's stupid of Mostow to show an American flag in the movie. Nothing against USA, but this is a human vs. machines movie, it's the world united against the machines, it's just plain stupid to show flags. But I'm not surprised as Mostow claimed in U-571 that the americans captured Enigma, while it actually were the Britisch. T3 has a good start but becomes more and more boring and not very well layed out. Too bad James Cameron and Edward Furlong didn't participate, I'm sure it could have been way better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years of waiting, it seemed that one of the most magnificent Science fiction movie franchises of all time was set to rest and lay as nothing but a dusty piece of old gold in the treasure chest. Now in 2003, director Jonathon Mostow attempts to pump up the volume as he tries to fit the classic shoes James Cameron was made to wear in the director's chair of the Terminator franchise. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a desperate attempt to revive the all time classic story of war against the machines, once again bringing back big `Arnie' in the role we all love to remember him by. As a huge fan of the previous films I had been waiting for T3 ever since the credits rolled at the end of Terminator 2. With the thick perfect story that ended the second film, how can the generation of film lovers get it all back in 2003. Without a single tone of regret I can say it was all made possible in this years hit movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a worthy sequel that treads carefully on science fiction grounds without trying to be too cocky. Now with use of more enhanced CGI effects, the story can be told with a deeper sense of visionary and style. With a neat plot that pushes the story of it's predecessor further without it seeming ridiculous, fans of the movies can walk out grinning with the fact that they finally know how the whole story ends. It's a charm to once again see `Arnie' in the boots that he was born to wear. He is without doubt the character he plays and never fails to deliver the comic relief and the sheer guts the role brings out in him.The new `Terminatrix' was a daring original touch of careful script work that succeeded in giving something new to the whole Terminator story. The life of our human hero `John Connor' was a story just waiting to be told, and this film gives us that extra insight into the characters dilemmas and fate. `Nick Stahl' gives a worthy performance as the soon to be future fighter, although my mind couldn't help but wish `Edward Furlong' stepped back into the role that made the character so natural and innocent, as well as head strong and courageous. After all said and done, I can't debate which film of the now trilogy stands superior to the other two. `Rise of the Machines' tops it all off with a great climax with even decent potential for another film that could be fantastic. Although I am as satisfied as I am with the result, there still stands the most important question this film continuously resurrects. How would the film had turned out if it's original creator `James Cameron' had once again stepped in to direct and finish a complete trilogy? The answer we'll never know, but while you think about it, check out Jonathon Mostow's vision, it ain't at all bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I had been boycotting this out of principle, since I am such a big fan of James Cameron's previous two terminator movies, but, on a whim and at a bargain price, I decided to see T3.Eh....I don't really know what else to say. The movie was on the verge of being terrible and a huge waste of time, but was redeemed slightly by the ending (and the car chase scene was pretty sweet). Other than that, this movie was lacking in several of the areas where the first two movies succeeded... innovative special effects, tangible suspense, well thought out, purposefully corny dialogue, Linda Hamilton...Anyway, while I wouldn't recommend anyone going out and spending money on this movie, if you happen to have the chance to see it for free, or if it's on TV in the future, and there's nothing else on, it might be a quasi-worthwhile way to spend ~2 hours. If you haven't seen the first two movies, then T3 might even be considered pretty good.... but if you haven't seen the first two movies, your money and time would be better spent renting those, and not really bothering with this one...</fullReview>

The current director has relied more on explosions and special effects than a consistent plot.They have blown it for T4 - just like Aliens 4 was a flop except for the die-hards.</fullReview>

Did Schwarzenegger secretly write it? It really is vacuous and contains pretentions expoused as if by a five year old. There does seem to be some dodgy editing which shouldn't be allowed in a big budget film like this.

I laughed my ass off during most of the movie, especially at moments where I probably should have been in awe of all the action.

We're even forced to see his bulky 50+ aged body in the nude, but the special effects department did a good job making him look in shape. Kristanna Loken doesn't need the special effects job, but we're treated only a couple of seconds with her bare-naked appearance.In fact T3 fits perfectly in the action-comedy genre, so with T4 probably on its way, starring Arnie as the Terminator going for president, they'll have to cast Jackie Chan as his running mate. I'm already looking forward to it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just a rerun of T2 but without the plot or excitement. It is literally one long car chase, the fallback of the terminally unimaginative director. A poor script doesn't help the hapless Nick Stahl while it's left to Clare Danes to bring at least some emotional depth to the film. Arnie does what Arnie does and is no better or worse than usual.Overall, the film lacks the menace and leaness of previous Terminator movies and although the ending is genuinely moving, there really is little point in carrying on the franchise. A poor end to what were some genuinely groundbreaking and iconic movies.</fullReview>

Now ask yourselves...WHY?Was it because of the hilarious 'in-jokes'?Was it the amazingly over-elaborate 'set-pieces'?Was it the witty dialogue and Arnie's constant two-liners?Was it the awful mis-casting/bad acting?Was it the horribly inappropriate music? ...What's that, "NO" I hear you scream?Then why, OH WHY, does Terminator 3 reach down into the big stinking barrel of sequel cliché's in order to try and make this film a success?The plot is as this: Add Terminator 2 minus all the bits that build excitement and tension and you pretty much have it...except 'SPOILER ALERT' the fact they change the concept that you control your own fate, and merely replace it with the exact opposite. I honestly can't go through all the things that are so so wrong with this film, so instead I'll list the things that ARE good... .........So there you have it. That was actually a lie for shock value, in all honesty, there are a couple of nice shots, and despite the third-world countries that could have had their economy sorted by the cost of the stunts, one or two actually come off not looking that bad, despite the constant trails of CGI? Now I like Breakdown, and actually thought this film ?might' be half decent; I wasn't expecting the darkness of the first, I wasn't expecting the bravado mixed with storyline of the second...I just expected...well...something!No decent musical score, Stahl must make Furlong wish he were still higher than a kite, and poor old Arnie. My god he tries, you can see it in his face...but with probably the worst assortment of lines ever constructed for a man who also starred in 'Last Action Hero,' he must've read the script and thought 'Money Money Money.'No Linda Hamiliton, no Michael Biehn, no James Cameron, no Edward Furlong...even Guns N Roses were missed from this...probably worst film of the year. (And no, I haven't seen Gigi yet.)Please avoid, maybe then everyone will completely discount this, and a PROPER third instalment of the Terminator will be made. I for one will have my fingers well and truly crossed. [By the way, I have never once come on IMDB to abuse a terrible film, nor have I jumped on any bandwagons or consulted other people's opinions. I just decided to write this review as a warning for those out there that still enjoy films on a higher level than tripe such as ?xXx' and ?Jeepers Creepers 2.'] On a scale of 1-10 = 5.

		<shortDescription>A good film by itself, but lets down the Terminator series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that this film was going into production a few years ago I was excited at the prospect of another instalment of the Terminator. However when I read that the same basic plot was going to be used (i.e. bad terminator sent back in time to kill John Connor and Arnie sent back too in order to protect him.) and that James Cameron would not be directing the film I started to doubt whether this sequel could live up to the first two.The film begins well enough with John Connor (Stahl) telling how he lives 'off the grid' and how he still feels insecure about his future even though he prevented Judgement Day. This is followed by a stunning CGI scene, depicting the future war between Man and Machine.It is not long before the new T-X arrives. Kristanna Loken plays the part of the T-X extremely well. She combines sexiness with cold-hearted ruthlessness excellently. The problem is that I find it difficult to find a stunningly beautiful woman scary and this was what was missing throughout the entire film. The fear factor and sinister ambience in the first two films was lacking here.Shortly after the arrival of the T-X comes the main man. Arnie arrives looking just as good as he did in the previous two films. He certainly hasn't lost his terminator 'charisma'. Arnie goes in search of clothes and the scene that follows gives the impression that the Terminator, a hardened killing machine has been turned into a bit a joke, especially after he walks out of a strip joint brandishing a pair of star-shaped glasses. Arnie delivers one-liners throughout the film giving it more of a comedic sense. In the first two films the comedy was used not only to relieve tension, but to also develop the character of the Terminator. Arnie's terminator has lost a bit of its 'cool'. In T1 he was evil, T2 he was cool, in T3 he is a joke.The action sequences in the film are second to none. The action sequences definitely live up to its predecessors. They aren't ground breaking, but are certainly highly entertaining Arnie riding a police bike is reminiscent of him in T2. When watching some of the action sequences you get a sense of déj? vu as some are similar to that of T2. A bit more originality would not have gone a miss.After T2 we got the impression that Judgement Day had been avoided. However. This appears not to be the case. The terminator gives a one-line reason why Judgement Day has not been prevented and for me this was not good enough as it left a gaping hole in the plot. If the reason why Judgement Day had not been prevented had been explained properly then in would have added to the plot more. This unfortunately underlines the focus of the film. The focus being on special effects and action rather than on the story and characters.Stahl delivers a competent performance and works well with Danes, who also delivers a good performance. I would rather have seen Edward Furlong reprising his role as John Connor, but Nick Stahl is an adequate replacement. Danes runs around like a screaming teenager in a horror movie in the first half of the movie, but eventually matures into a fighter like Sarah Connor in T2.The final fight between the T-X and the T-101 sees Arnie deliver his final one liner. This probably will not be remembered as readily as ' I'll Be Back' or 'Hasta La Vista.. Baby', but is nevertheless a good line for Arnie to finish on. The final scene sees Judgement Day descend upon the world and leaves the film wide open to a sequel.My final verdict: A good film by itself, but it lets down the Terminator series. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summer movies are about reunions. The cast and creators of a successful movie come back to tell you another tales of the characters you loved so much the first time around. While "T3"only retains one of the original cast and crew, there is still a reunion. It's a reunion between Arnold and the particular kind of fun he brings to his audience.The present for John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now more bleak than his future. The doomsday foretold in the second installment did not come to pass, but John lives piecemeal and constantly on the move in fear that the mechanical demons of his childhood future may come back to hunt him. We know that very game is what we came to see, so we can't blame the poor guy for being paranoid. The machines do arrive in the form of the T-X model (Kristanna Loken) but with John being so hard to find, the T-X has secondary targets to search out. A mechanical protector, a T101 model (Arnold Schwarzenegger), arrives to help protect John and one of his future lieutenants (Claire Danes). Then the chase is fully on because the delayed "judgement day" is now eminent and Arnold's T101 is so vastly outmatched by the T-X. (And also because this is a sequel.)The story is a bit thinner this time out, but few people could be expected to match "Iron Jim" Cameron's fiercely perfectionist filmmaking step for step. However, "U571" helmsman, Johnathan Mostow, is up to the task of keeping the action rolling and pulling the viewer along for the ride. He sets up everything as obstacles for the heroes, including things that are not usually found in action films, such as kennel cages, a particle accelerator and one wildly out-of-control construction crane. While the design of the T-X villain permits her almost every resource the situation demands, Claire Danes bears quite a bit of the missing exposition from John's childhood as well as the burden of frequently being a convenient plot device. However, she does it unflinchingly and helps carry the action forward.Describing the action in any greater detail would be the same as telling everyone in line for the roller coaster the exact number and direction of the turns in the rail. The effects and stunts are all there in cutting- edge glory. This `Terminator' is not as dark as the first, nor as envelope-pushing as the second, but it is a complete thrill ride, and a welcome one in a summer of multiple action failures. It's worth the trip to the theater. Just try not to think too much about it afterwards.7 out of 10</fullReview>

But he didn't and that movie never got made.The films starts with John Connor (Played well by Nick Stahl- he does look a bit like an injured deer for most of the film but he handles the role well and, lets face it, hes 10 times less annoying than Edward Furlong). John is under the impression that judgement day was stopped but his dreams are still haunting him. Then the T-X shows up obviously wanting to kill 'old Jonny boy' and then Arnie turns up and the whole circus starts again. This time they are joined by Kate Brewster (Claire Danes, doing a good job of not stepping on the main characters' toes but still giving a good performance), the daughter ofI may p*** off several people saying this but its very good movie. Everyone seems to rate it next to T2- if its not as good as T2, then its not good. Well actually no. If you like action movies and arent too hung up on the T trilogy then you'll like this.There is a lot wrong with this movie- the jokes border from amusing to, well, embarrassing; The T-X (Kristanna Loken) is nowhere as near as scary (or fun) as the T-1000, and as a result her 'hunt' for John Connor is nowhere near as tense-what made the T-1000 so great was the soulless and brutal way he killed people (John Connor's step-dad. Sword through the head. You guys know what I'm talking about), whereas T-X just seems to shoot people and even then camera cuts away (possibly done to keep the age rating down). When the two eventually meet at the climax, theres not the same tension and you just kind of want her to die and get it over with. Jonathan Mostow had an everest-style mountain to climb when he took this on and making and enjoyable movie was nothing short of a miracle, therefore I cant really criticise him to badly, apart from to say, sadly, hes just no Cameron, and that's ultimately what kills the movie in terms of `T3 vs. T2'. The terminator was Cameron's baby, after all.O.k., now for the good stuff, of which there is a lot. The characters are likeable without being cheesy- Danes knows her place as Stahl's Love interest/sidekick, and Loken's performance is raised by the cool special effects. CGI is used a lot, but to aid the story instead of tell it, and that's The terminator's biggest weapon. As cool as the matrix films were, its always in the back of your head that it was all shot in front of some bluescreen, whereas T3 grabs you because it looks real. It really is a guy hanging on a crane, it really is Arnold throwing a guy through a wall.The story is undeniably cool if a little bleak- and heres a second shocking point for all the fanboys-(WARNING- SPOILER COMING..)I don't think Cameron wouldve had the balls to have had the apocalypse ending- look at Aliens, look at Terminator 1&amp;2, ok key people died, but Cameron could never handle a plot twist or a depressing ending, and that's where Mostow really shines.(SPOILER OVER)Other good points the `arnold on a crane' action scene is as good as anything T1 and T2 offered up, and Mr. Schwarzennegger is easily the best thing about this film- ok his humours crap, and his `emotional' scene with Stahl is uncomfortable, but he is simply `the man'. You cant help but cheer when another car explodes, or when another Arnold one-liner comes out; and that's what makes T3 great- its not genius in terms of quality, its not the best in the series, but it gives you what you want- Arnie blowing s*** up, saving people and saying `I'll be back'. He may over the hill, but I certainly hope he keeps his promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgrace to the Terminator franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3......hmm.I saw this film reluctantly; after learning that James Cameron was not going to be involved, I immediately wrote it off. Being a BIG fan of the first 2 (the first one more), I just knew that this third installment was not going to live up to the excellence of the first 2 films. Well, I was right. Quite frankly, this should not have never been made. Why can't people leave things alone? The Terminator franchise, The Terminator idea, is James Cameron's and he and he ALONE should do these films. It's HIS brainchild, and if he isn't involved, the very idea of doing a sequel without him should be scrapped. But in the end, its all about money, isn't it?With all that said, this movie by itself isn't bad at all. Some pretty good action sequences keep you entertained. I was skeptical about there being a female Terminator, but she was good in her role. As a stand-alone action film, its not bad. But put alongside the first 2 Terminators, T-3 is....well......just 'there'. It's very bland and doesn't have a expand on the story enough to help keep the Terminator franchise in greatness. Essentially, it adds nothing to the saga shown brilliantly by the first 2. This just can't live up to the Terminator name, and has unfortunately tainted the name to some extent. Whose fault is that? Well, it could be the makers of T-3 for even trying to make a sequel, or it could be the first 2 Terminators for being that damn good. Either way, this should never have happened, and I pray to God there isn't a 'T-4'. ** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining film but not at the hieghts of the originals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is a classic case of one film too far, but not because it's an appauling film. In fact, so far it's one of my favorite films this year. It has (obviously) some fantastic action sequences, reasonable plot and some meorable scenes. The reason it's one film too far is because to try and compete with its originals and make just as fantastic film is a very, very tough job indeed. Terminators 1 and 2 were grounbreaking films which truly deserve to be in the top 100 films of all time. Sadly, T3 is not. It lacks the character relationship T2 had, the acting ability of Michael bienh (T1) or Hamilton (who is sadly missed in this film), and the new terminator is not played anywhere near as well as Robert Patrick's menacing T-1000 from judgement day. In short, Terminator 3 is an all-out action, thorogughly entertaining film but with poorer acting, and a lesser plot and script. By all means go and watch it, but don't expect anything particularly special. A great saga overall, but i feel that it's finally Hasta La vista, baby.Jas</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been 19 years since The Terminator; 12 years since Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Arnold has gotten older, movie-technology has gotten more advanced, but how does this affect the third installment to the Terminator-epic...? First of all, I'm not gonna be one of those critical souls shouting that this is a poor movie, cause one thing must be clear: Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is FAR from being poor. The story is still exiting, the special effects are as good as you'd expect, the acting is quite OK. However, T3 leaves you a bit disappointed. There is something lacking despite all the fancy camera-work, the high speed chases, the rough action, basically all the blockbuster eyecandy can't remove the feeling that T3 should have been a little bit...better. While watching T3's two predecessors, there has always been a certain unique atmosphere present; an intense excitement; a sence of impending doom when the Terminator is chasing after it's targeted victim. That very atmosphere was what made both films so very good, together with - of course - very well written scripts, great directing, and awesome soundtracks.T3 has got action sequences which are at times better than the first two movies, with crispier CGI. But that feeling of doom, the terror of the terminator is gone. When Robert Patrick was on screen in T2, you felt an eerie presence of his bad guy-character, the same with Arnold in the first movie. Kristanna Loken who plays the female T-X terminator in T3 is a pretty girl, no doubt about that, but she completely lacks the ability to send out any eerie-vibes what so ever. You just don't feel intimidated by her. Her general performance isn't really good either, and despite the fact that she hardly has any lines, it is all too easy to see that she is no Cate Blanchett when it comes to acting. The rest of the cast do an OK job though, while Claire Danes' "damsel in distress"-character gets a little annoying at times. I love Arnie in this movie, and it's been a while since I did. His latest movies has been quite disappointing, but in T3 you'll find him back in good old-fashioned style. OK, he's not an Oscar-material actor (never was, never will be), but he IS the Terminator!  One of the movies' downfall, is the script. Cause the script for T3 doesn't work as well as the scripts for two first movies did. And while Jonathan Mostow is a talented director (I think both Breakdown and U-571 were good films), he hasn't got the story-telling ability that James Cameron is the master of. Cameron, who directed both the two first Terminator-movies, knows the story better than anyone, and I think he would have been the perfect choice for T3 as well. But all together, Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is an enjoyable action-flick, with some very funny moments as well (Especially the "Talk to the hand"-line from Arnold while walking out of a gas-station without paying for his merchandise). Just a little shame that the movie is not as good you would hope it to be. But maybe a 4th movie will do the series total justice. Atleast the ending sure opens up for a 4th Terminator-epic. I have a feeling that sometime in a not too distant future, Arnie will be back...untill then, I will get out of here!  My score for Terminator 3 - Rise of The Machines: 7/10 (T2, the best in the series as I see it, would get 9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally don't give that much about sequels but I admit from the moment I knew there was a third Terminator to be made, it was the movie I was most looking forward to... And you can tell that it is a useless sequel, you can tell it's a shame a third one is made and all that other stuff but one thing is sure : from all actionmovieheroes there is only one king and that's Arnold just because he doesn't take himself that seriously... This is more comic than Daredevil, The Hulk and other X-Men's... The story itself is so simple : once again a terminator must travel back to the past to protect John Connor (nice role for Nick Stahl) and his forthcoming wife Kate Brewster (a more than charming role from upcoming star Claire Danes). And then there is that other terminator the female one (played by Kristanna Loken) and that's perhaps the only letdown in the film as she looks like your dreambabe but she doesn't have the evil touch, still very funny to watch... The moment I walked out of the theatre I told my friend that T3 is actually a copy from T2 and that's what it is, just the chases and jokes are different, but hey hey...what chases and jokes they are!!! The sarcasm of Schwarzenegger is superb (the movie is full of memorable one-liners) or the images of Schwarzenegger carrying a coffin on the shoulder while having a machine gun in the other hand is just great...and I could go on and on as this movie is directed by Jonathan Mostow (famous for U571) in a very professional way, I really doubt it if Cameron could have delivered a better job... The big problem is that most of the critics wanna slash down the movie but they just can't as this is too brilliantly made and after 12 years Arnie still rules and the last words of Arnie ("We'll meet again") says enough that we will have a T4 if only Arnie won't be president of the US in 2015...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Warning** Contains spoilersI couldn't wait to see this movie and now that I did, I haven't been this disappointed in a really long time. There are numerous plot holes, time line contradictions and scenes where the special effects were clearly obvious. First of all, the movies takes place as if T2 never happened. The whole premise behind T2 was the creation of the machines based on finding the chip and the arm from T1. After their destruction, the movie should have ended. Now, the movie is based off a secret government agency creating machines that are now being taken over by a "virus". The worst part is, after all the effects, all the action and even the humor which could have saved the movie...judgment day still happens?!?!?!?Problem #1- in the movie, Sarah Connor dies in 1997. The problem with this is that T2 was based in 97 and she certainly didn't look like she was on her last leg. Problem #2- The TX was designed to terminate Connor's lieutenants, yet she magically runs into Connor in a situation too preposterous to believe. Lastly, when she does find him, she has numerous opportunities to kill him, but never does. Can't figure that one out. Problem #3- Clearly Connor survived judgment day, as did Brewster. So what was the point of getting them to the bomb shelter when they survived the attack in the first place? Why on Earth make judgment day still happen? My jaw literally hit the floor when the bombs went up and the screen went dark. I was so disappointed. What a waste of time, energy and money. If you haven't seen it, don't bother. If you have, my sympathies.</fullReview>

It was the same basic storyline. At least T2 had the decency to give us the twist of Arnie protecting him from a far superior villain but this was just appalling. Lame jokes, bad performances (with the exception of Stahl), pointless special effects and a rushed ending. What was the point?T3 is just another crappy sci-fi sequel. The people praising it are the ultimate fan-boys, those who similarly praised Attack Of The Clones or Matrix Reloaded, die hard fans who can't admit that their babies suck. If this film didn't have the Terminator title or Arnie starring it would have been straight to video and forgotten about. Utter trash and a stain on the memory of the first two films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely shocking, and funny at the same time.It is pleasing to see that Arnold Schwarzenegger is still able to play the 'Terminator' once again; even after 20 years. I heard silly rumours that Vin Diesel was going to replace him.I am glad that Jonathon Mostow is able to direct this film with the same magnitute as the first 2 chapters. Obviously, viewers have to keep an open mind knowing that James Cameron is not directing.I am happy that the storyline takes a different direction this time, rather than repeating itself; it needed change in order to continue.There are numerous anomolies that many may critisize. Regarding the 3 vehicles that were controlled by the Female Terminator, I personally hoped that more explanation would have been given for this. I'll have to read the book perhaps.Also, strength and agility of both terminators may have been portrayed a little out of proportion to the first 2 chapters. But then again, their abilities may have been bettered due to events that took place in the first 2 chapters.I hoped that some emphasis would have been given to the missing arm, the 'T-800' lost in the steel mill, from the 2nd chapter. Perhaps 'Skynet' would have based all of their 'machines' on its' matrix design.I suppose without the one hundred million dollar budget that James Cameron had, Jonathon Mostow would have had certain limitations.Otherwise, this is a brilliant film. One that you can enjoy, even with your missus.Go see it, if you keep an open mind, you will not be displeased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well we had fun with this cash-quel. The parochial cinema where we saw it almost fell down during the opening 'car' chase (that makes Matrix II look like Tron). There are some well-dispatched twists. And Clare Danes gets screen time, although largely within which to cry convincingly.But it's all done without love, baby. Nic Stahl hasn't prepped his role, looking bewildered more often than not (he's not the same John Connor as in T2 however stretched be the imagination). The surprisingly high number of gags are often quite funny - if you've seen the other two - but you can't do parody in a film like this without selling it down the river. And Kristianna Loken's Terminatrix looks EXACTLY like a soap-turned-primetime drama actress from the UK called Tamsin Outhwaite. That was a leftfield joke in itself until it becomes apparent that Outhwaite would not only have acted better, but been sexier.I'm hoping that Arnie does something positive in California; I feel responsible for the Governance elections, since I certainly didn't benefit directly from buying a ticket to see this film - 4/10.</fullReview>

Had they kept his touch, we probably would have had something. I don't know, a better picture.Second, what's up with all these new characters and their role? The plot was underdeveloped. The female Terminator did her job but it was way too cliched for me. I kept thinking of the Destruction of Eve or something and they always wear red. And third, Now I know Terminator came before Matrix but damn, two sci-fi movies back to back in one summer about humans battling it against the machines just overwhelms me. It should have came before May of this year perhaps. Arnold getting too damn old anyways. I still like him though. He'll always be the trailblazer and one of the greatest action heros of the time.But over all, I just didn't feel it. I don't hold it against you Arnold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we finally are. The long time promised Terminator 3... I was disappointed to hear that Cameron was too busy writing scenario for is Dark Angel crap and earning money from Titanic to do a Terminator 3. Maybe he also didn't want to do it but at least he could have participate or writing the script. (no film from him since 97 he never waited so long for making movie)Because oh my god, the plot is gone. What made the first 2 Terminator such good movies was the plot and the depth of the characters. But this time it's only shallow shells and bad acting (except from both Loken and Schwarzenegger) And where there's a little of plot most of it is incorrect regarding the previous terminator. (and I'm not talking about James Cameron Coda in the never seen before version from Terminator 2)The wrong guy died in T2 and despite all the research and material which both Skynet and the T models are based upon are destroyed, everything is still the same and all the Terminator and Machines just look like the same. the T-101 after making a shooting in a pack of Policemen is checking for human casualties which as no place in the film since it's not the same Terminator John told about how wrong it was to kill people. As for Sarah Connor dying of Leukemia it's not directly a plot hole. But how lame that was ?Now to the good parts.The T-X. Great idea a female Terminator is something they should have done earlier for a simple reason, women are less suspected than men. So the beautiful woman the T-X is would more easily be undercover than the T-101 big muscles with killer face.The Action. Ever present and never boring. They've done a great job with the action scenes. Long but not too long Car chase with a good use of the environment, Short but effective gun fights and the cherry on top of the cake, great fight between both Terminators (too short to me but we cannot have everything we want in a movie).Now about actingArnold Schwarzenegger: The same old good T-101 and it's best role so far. He was better in T2 but still know how to make a good old fashion cold hearted killing machine.Nick Stahl: Laughable, He as nothing to do in this movie even though the plot and the acting parts are really not the thing to focus on. Stahl just did a poor version of the always on the run disturbed guy. If Judgment Day actually happens, with is lack of Charisma and being the leader of the revolution... we're screwed.Claire Danes: (Spoiler) Good actress but average performance she does too much screaming and the line she had were not the brightest. She lose her Fiancé cry a couple of tears then talk about John and her making out with a big smile on her face.Kristanna Loken: Great in the movie. Too bad she has not that many lines. Because her acting as a killing machine is very credible. She brought the cold blooded ice woman to the top. Plus she has many face expression in the movie which makes her part very difficult and yet did those scene to a near perfection.Overall: As an action movie it's a great movie. I gave it 8. If you are a diehard fan from the first two opus you might be truly disappointed. But I took it like a related film not like a sequel which made me enjoy it to the fullest. Fan of action go see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rather unwanted sequel to the sequel of Terminator has limped to the big screen - and whilst its not as bad as it could have been, its certainly not great. Twelve years is a long time to wait for a sequel and T3 feels like T2 warmed over for a kiddie-friendly rating.Ahnult now looks like he's been inflated with a bicycle pump and freshly dipped in wood-stain - he appears to have been freshly varnished and provides a slightly less realistic central performance than the Cuprinol Man. Once again we have to endure his trademarked sense of 'humour', which is about as funny as being forced to sit through 'Patch Adams' at gun-point. Unlike most people moving from a German-speaking country to America, Ahnult's command of English appears to be getting worse. Not for the first time, I wish the film makers would subtitle him - no, I actually wish they'd cast Ahnult in a silent movie, but I can't expect too much.The actors playing John Connor and his wife-to-be are so instantly forgettable that their names won't be bothering major casting directors in the future, (but do expect them to turn up in your local video store 'starring in' movies involving post-apocalyptic kickboxing cyborgs travelling through time).Not to mention which that our best hopes for mankind are so damned brattish that you can't help but root for the machines. On the upside, the new Terminator is very cute and her inflatable breasts are well and truly aimed directly at the teenage male demographic. I have to say that she is perhaps the most attractive way to die since Ellen Barkin did/didn't do it all those years ago in 'Sea of Love', but hasn't someone done the shape-changing unstoppable, liquid metal robot before?The plot - well there might be one, but don't study it too hard - its like one of those 3D illusions that were all the fashion a decade ago - some people claim to see things of wonder, the rest of us just get a headache working out what all the fuss is about. The movie threatens to become interesting only in the last few minutes, but by then you're probably more worried about deep vein thrombosis setting in than the potential end of the World.Oh and can I have a word about the first Terminator machines? Their brutish menace is ever so slightly undermined if you've ever seen 'Short Circuit' - 'Number 5 is ALIVE!'In short - if its a choice between this and 'Hulk' - see 'Hulk'; if its a choice between this and sitting out in the evening sun - slap on some sunblock, after all you won't have long to wait before Blockbuster have plenty of copies of T3 on the shelves.Best wishes,Mike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some questions (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I avoid any movie with a "3" after it's name. But as T-2 was really good and I've heard good things about this movie, I went to see it. After watching the movie, I had several questions in my mind:1) Where did they find this female TX model? C'mon people, it seems she was going to act in Kindergarden Cop but she mixed the studios and came to this film. Unfortunately she's as scary as Powerpuff Girls can be, but lacks the fun of Powerpuff's.2) If TX was so clever, how come couldn't she change Arnie's program succesfully? What? Humanity? Love? 3) How come can our heroes come to the heart of Skynet so easily with a lot of weapons in their hands? Where's the security anyway?4) There can be more questions but as a result this is a good movie (except that ridiculous TX model), a fine sequel to Terminator series.5) Now one burning question remains: Will Arnie be the first US President that showed his butt to everybody in the world?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one sequel that is worthy of the original. It has plenty of action and a dose of humor. If you enjoyed the first two Terminator movies, see this one.Arnold Schwarznegger is a very limited actor. But this is the perfect role for him, the one that made him a huge star. His stiff, deadpan manner would be a drawback in most roles, but as a killer robot he's very convincing.Without the direction of James Cameron, I thought this might not be as good as the other Terminators. But it is. Of all the summer blockbuster movies, this is the best (OK, maybe that's not saying much). Don't expect a masterpiece--just sit back and have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Consider this proposition: a movie that's the second sequel in a franchise now totally dated, a movie that comes a full 12 years after its predecessor - a period in which the main star has aged significantly and lost the level of popularity he had in his salad days, a movie that went through endless hassles in writing and pre-production and was likely to generate interest only in the most rabid fans.how would you expect such a movie to turn out? Entertaining? Witty? (Dare we say) Intelligent? Take heart then, for Terminator 3 is all of these. Its also the perfect adieu to this now venerable series. Full credit for this goes to the team of writers (John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris III and Tedi Sarafian), for the first time the action sequences are not the meat of the film but supplement to a deviously clever script. There are tons of tongue-in-cheek references for Terminator fans to catch (Arnold's trademark entry is given a delicious twist), and a sense of satire is quite evident, but the spoofing never goes overboard and is done in a spirit of affection and respect for the series. There is also a good deal of ironic humor, even a Woody Allen-esque moment with the psychiatrist character from the earlier movies. The action sequences are done with the usual pyrotechnics but seem to have a deliberate Tom-and-Jerry flavor (most evident in the crane chase scene). The film neatly draws in the sparse threads of narrative that fueled its predecessors and steadily powers its way to the climax. And what a climax! Without spoiling it for people who haven't seen the film, I would consider it ironic in the most wonderful sense that a franchise whose worth has mostly been measured in terms of the mindless thrills it offered concludes itself in this surprisingly sophisticated way. I was really quite satisfied with this film, the only nit I have to pick is with the character of the villain, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) which was played out in a very colorless manner.The Terminator leaves us on a high note. Let's hope he doesn't come back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following two of the greatest films of the 80's and 90's respectively was always going to be a difficult task but the director has done a great job - this film delivers in every department. Spectacular action, solid dialogue and great special effects. While not as thought provoking or dark as the previous movies, this is still highly entertaining stuff. Arnie gets back into his signature role perfectly and delivers the one liners with style. Impressively he does not look too old for the role which is amazing considering how long it was since the original terminator movie came out.The story makes pretty good sense and writes its way out the finality of T2's ending nicely. Although the female terminator thing doesn't quite work in my opinion - Arnie getting beaten up by a girl just looks weird if you ask me - the TX is *HOT* no doubt about it. Kind of menacing too at times.All in all, I am impressed. They have spent the money and the film looks brilliant. Thank heavens it is not some cheap effort rolled out as a cash in on the franchise. This is a 'proper' terminator movie and is well worth watching. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is technically well done like most of Hollywood films, and is also entertaining for a young audience. But the film lacks the good story the two previous parts had. Nothing new you haven´t seen before. The major problem in my opinion is the absence of personal charisma and chemistry of Nick Stahl and Claire Danes in their roles. Both performers had shown before their talents in other films but here they are totally wasted, showing a poor character design for their parts. That´s why I consider Terminator 3 a mediocre movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a geek like me, you know stuff about movies before they hit theatres. It's called "the buzz". The buzz was pretty bad on T3. Linda Hamilton and James Cameron didn't want anything to do with it, it was a useless sequel made only for the cash, the online script sucked arse, yadda yadda yadda.Well, booyakasha, did Jonathan Mostow prove everyone wrong. He made a humorous, exciting and at times, even dramatic/epic film. Is T3 a GOOD movie then, I hear you say in amazement? Yes, it is. It is beyond ENTERTAINING. It is GOOD. Depending on how it holds up on multiple viewings, it might even become GREAT.We're heading into Subjectivesville, USA here, but I had an extreme fondness of the two other Terminators (especially T2). I spent summers, every day playing Terminator with my two neighbors (I was 11 back then or something). We took turns on who could be the T-800, John Connor and the T-1000. The concept of the Terminator is (as is Star Wars) a part of my childhood. So there is something about T3 (as with the prequels) that connects deep inside of me. But now that I've seen T3, I can honestly say that, unlike the prequels, it is not a GUILTY pleasure.Arnie is born to play the part of the T-800 (but one does wonder why Skynet keeps building Terminators with Austrian accents) and the stoicine flair he does it with will have you cheering throughout the film. John Connor does not force him to soften up in this one, so it's all 2 TUFF 2 DIE all the time.Nick Stahl is good as the doubting leader-to-be of mankind (though I'd still have preferred Ed Norton). He's sympathetic and likeable throughout, but unfortunately you don't get to see the transformation from alcoholic bum to Great Leader.Claire Danes easily out-acts them all as Kate, John's future wife and second in command. Her reaction to the deaths of loved ones are almost as if she really was breaking out in tears on that set. PAY THIS GIRL MORE!!!Kristanna Loken, my biggest doubt on this film. She can't possibly out-evil Robert Patrick as the T-1000 or even Arnie himself as the bad guy in the first one. She's just so damn hot! Well, to be frank, she didn't. She's not bad or anything, she does exactly what she had to do, but the sense of menace the T-1000 had just isn't there.The story is a real winner. A friend whom I saw the film with fell asleep before the last half hour or so (he was TIRED, not cause it was crap), and if someone would have asked him about the ending, I assure you he could not give a correct answer.So, do I want a T4? Yes, all it needs is Mostow, Stahl and Danes. And I assure you: THEY'LL BE BACK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's Chevy Chase?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd have to agree entirely with sem-2's comments. The Terminator series ended with T2: Judgement Day.This seemed to me to be more like a National Lampoon's version of the first two movies, both of which carried the distinctly darker atmosphere you would expect from a movie that concerns the end of mankind. Arnie spouting off ridiculous one-line gags ("talk to the hand" - please?) and using those dated but "oh so funny" catchphrases throughout the film, gave it a cheesy feel and really takes the edge off. There were simply far too many laughs.Visually, it is spectacular with plenty of explosions, death, destroyed buildings and car chases but the absence of James Cameron really tells - that integrity of keeping some sense of realism even in the most unrealistic of sci-fi scenarios, which he does so well, is completely absent in T3.The loss of Sarah Connor from the plot was a blow. On-screen, she embodied the sense of fear and impending doom for the human race in both of the earlier movies and that was definitely lacking here. It is a shame also that Edward Furlong could not have reprised the John Connor role, if only for the sake of continuity and a sense of familiarity with the character. Taking nothing away from Nick Stahl, who I consider to be a fine young actor (he puts in a safe performance in `Rise of the Machines').Major fans of the first two movies will be disappointed, as I was. However, the film had a lot to live up to, attempting to follow its predecessors and given that I was extremely sceptical before even getting to the movie theatre, maybe I'm being overly critical.If you liked "Starship Troopers" and you're not a Terminator "fanatic" then you will quite probably love this film.As far as I'm concerned, the story of the Connor family and the end of the human race was told satisfactorily in 2 parts.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of both previous Terminator films, I wasn't expecting much from the third. Need I say Alien 3? I was hoping that they wouldn't detract from the true basis of Terminator and they haven't.It keeps the plot and actually fits quite well. There are no "let's tack this on so that we have a plot for the third film" extrapolations, we finally find out what type of machine SkyNet is.It has a touch of humour but nothing that stops it from being a Terminator film. Sometimes you are watching the screen for minutes at a time during the action scenes, not because it's a massive fight, just for the ideas that the characters use to get their own way.The Arnie Terminator is a bit meaner than the one in Terminator 2, less human. The new female Terminator isn't as rubbish as the trailers show. The computer graphics are used sparingly and only where they're needed.John Connor isn't the world leader you expect him to be, but that's because he hasn't gotten there yet. The character seems to follow from Terminator 2 quite well, though.There are no glaring movie-isms... the new technology is pretty and not too elaborate. Computers look like computers, the city like a city etc.All in all, worth a watch for fans of both the first films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>just as i always suspected. Rise of the Machines should never have been made. ok fair enough, the studio has made a profit, so for them and for arnie ($30 million dollars in his pocket and respect to him) and it was in fairness a fairly decent film. but in context with the earlier films The Terminator and Judgement Day, it doesnt even compare.James Cameron wrote Judgement day clearly to have a closed ending, so no sequels could infact be made, and therefore as such we have an immediate hole in the T3 plot. this however i can just about abide.But the constant self parody of arnie's T-800 character erased all the intensity and seriousness for which he was originally created. he no longer is the unstobbable murderous cyborg, but instead a comic figure which audiences laughed at consistently. the for a start it relinquishes any potential intesity the film may have had.also the first two terminator films had schwarzeneggers character as still character which would kill at the slightest opportunity, again this was gone in favour of a more younger audience pleasing character. all well and good, but in context with the this world created by James cameron it does not fit.i could go on forever about holes in the plot and nitpick consistently but i know a lot of ppl have yet to see this. and most probably you will enjoy it. but serious observers of the first two who were enthralled by their brilliance will be disappointed by such a lesser film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's unfortunate that movie opens with an intro that doesn't make much sence. Sure you get some information about judgement day as we all know it's what this movie is about. But after there short intro, you just get thrown into some action scenes with arnold vs Kristanna. And the story is left open for the second part of the movie. A very unfortunate factor according to me as I was sitting there waiting for the story while they were trashing vehicles and blowing up s***.However terminator three makes a good story after and the plot is nice. But try to tell the story of the movie to a friend. For some movies you can talk an hour. You need minute maximum to explain everything with this one. That's why I didn't really like the movie.Terminator is still one of the classics and excellent to see with a nice bag of popcorn.One thing is for sure... Arnold will be back, cause the movie just screams for another sequel. (If that'll be with arnold again as governors don't get too much time to act i guess ;) ).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 has been one of the most anticipated films to have been made in the last decade. The world sat on the edge of it's seat as the time drew nearer to the release date. "Arnie is Back!" "This film kicks ass", i tell ya man i heard it all.That was until I heard that the reason Cameron did not make this film, is because he read the script and felt it was sub-standard. uh oh!Then I saw the film. And i really have to say, a VERY big dissapointment.The film was two hours long, it felt like it was only half an hour. The action, well although special effects play such a huge part, it seems T2's more basic moves were better! And where was the classic music in the opening sequence??The actors, Arnie. Always a pleasure to c him, but not quite the performance he gave previously in T2. John Stahl.....what??? rubbish! surely they could have found someone better! I know edward furlong is in rehab, but i'd rather wait however long it takes for him to come clean and have him in this role, other than anyone else! Everyone else is ok though, T-X did cool.The director, Jonathan Mostow. How many films has he made as big screens?? Not many i'd say. He lacks alot in this film, something like Matrix Reloaded, too much action, less story.The characters. John Connor, well written character, drug abuse, life on the edge, somewhat lost in himself, brilliant writing there. But he did not seem anxious enough to see the t-800 once more. You'd expect more from him. His wife, what is it with hollywood and it's new heroine style? it's lost it's touch! Sarah Connor, deceased. WWWHHHYYY??? she was the heart and soul of this film series, she's a primary character, why did they kill her off?? Disgusting. And then, Arnie. He looked too human to be the terminator, the previous ones took time to learn the ways of the world, he grasped it within five minutes, uh uh, no no no no no, a big slacking. And did anyone notice he was sometimes out of breath "i..am... a.. machine!" okay he's a robot, but the previous ones spoke like computers not humans, not until the end anyway. Mess up!The story, Very sub-standard. The story moves too quickly. You don't have time to grasp it the way the previous films do. When the t-800 talks of Connors future death due to his boyhood experience with the previous terminator's, and how they only post-poned the war, this is a key factor in the story, it needed to be exaggerated more, it wasn't, 30 seconds tops, and your expected to be intrigued. Oh please! Where's the suspense?? The death of sarah connor, told in ten seconds, no intrigueing of the story, no emotion to the audience to say that John has been left to teach himself, it needed more exaggeration, stretch it out a bit more.Overall, the film looked like a spoof, some of it was more funny than scary, the story was not good enough, the action was too fast moving leaving no time to make a lasting impression And why bring in the US government, we've seen enough of them in these type of films!!! They've exhausted themselves.I hope to god the actors, story, and mise-en-scene come together if T4 is ever to be made! James Cameron is needed badly, and if anything, one final blast to finish the story of the Terminator, a film to eradicate the existance of T3. Arnie is ageing now, and politics is heading his way. So ppl had better move fast!Overall mark, to be fair, 7/10, but could have been better by miles!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a summer action film, and if you approach it this way you will enjoy it. I liked it more than the other blockbusters of this summer. For a change there is a coherent story here, with the logic of a Terminator story, but still logic. The film is not too long, it does not have any philosophical pretentions, and you get what you paid for. Action is very well done, effects are first class, though there is no great innovation as in the previous films of the series who were classics of special effects. Acting is decent - playing robots makes the profession easier for Schwarzenegger and his female partner who do not belong to the Nicholson league. The only mis-cast is Claire Daines whose make-up and wardrobe make her look ten years older than her Connors boyfriend and future husband. Action movies fans should wish Schwarzenegger to lose the California race, so that he can make Terminator 4. Otherwise, 'Hasta La Vista...'. 8/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A legit blast from the past - the battle has just begun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* * * ? (3? out of 5)Terminator 3: Rise of the MachinesDirected by: Jonathan Mostow, 2003Let's get right to it, shall we? Is Jonathan Mostow's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines ("T3") bad? Is it what we feared, considering it's primarily a box office vehicle and career savior for a forgotten Arnold Schwarzenegger and completely without mastermind James Cameron's involvement? And does it seriously wrong the two previous? No. No. And no.Not at all. In fact, it's very good. Worth the wait? Yes. Would we rather have had James Cameron's vision still? Of course we would. But T3 is a legit blast from the past evident from the somber and charming opening voice-over by Nick Stahl (as John Connor, bringing us up to speed) all the way to the clever plot twist at the end. T3 holds its very own. Or as Ah-nuld's returning Terminator dryly remarks: "I am nod shidding you."What do we get then?We get Ah-nuld - back and ready, now 55 - slipping seamlessly (physically too) into the one role we must remember to give him credit for. As the twisted steel endoskeleton killing machine, covered in human tissue, the heavy-accented non-actor is a welcome kick in the face.We also get a storyteller with a heart in director Mostow. Operating on a gigantic budget of $170m he wisely remembers that bigger and louder isn't necessarily better. There's a story to be told here. Maybe T3 predictably follows the traditions of the first two (time zone arrivals, introductions, a big chase and a final shootout and confrontation), but Mostow is surprisingly refined in his approach and passes the Cameron-test with ease. T3 has the same texture, the same grit and the same vacuumed atmosphere of despair, making it - okay, in its best moments - slither right in alongside its two predecessors.Sarah Connor is dead and her son and future rebel leader, John, is now a twenty-something drifter, living "off the grid" with no address or phone. Stahl plays both to the juvenile (and, honestly, bad-acted) pop charm of Furlong from T2 and to his own (and Mostow's) idea of an older and emotionally wrecked loner. Amidst the mayhem and inferno, Stahl lends weight with a natural command of what's at stake here: the human race and the integrity of a renowned action franchise. Stahl is an absolute steal. Co-star Claire Danes even brings back fond memories (of Hamilton) from the first one.The same can unfortunately not be said of Kristanna Loken as the new villain(ness), the liquid metal T-X. Don't blame Loken - she's fine when she's on screen even though she naturally lacks some of the spine-tingling intensity of Patrick in T2 (a case of having been there, done that). It's when she morphs into computer effects there's a weird occurrence. 13 years have passed since the last time, but the liquid metal of the T-X - you'd imagine that CG has improved since then - seems strangely more stingy and effects-pasted than the fluent ooze and flubber of the old T-1000 from 1991. Also, the T-X is maybe too much to swallow as a concept: In my review of T2 I questioned the ability of the T-1000 to form human skin and clothing fabric, but here it is completely out of bounds. The T-X can form interchangeable firing weapons (rockets too) with her hands. Well, can the liquid thing - the matter - then generate new matter so that it doesn't "shoot off" its own essence? If so, why not just change into an atomic bomb and go off?The old Terminator flicks were likewise rich on goof-holes, but this does bog T3 down. There are also too many one-liners dating back to Ah-nuld's annoying celebrity traditions, a grand helicopter crash that doesn't spark any intensity and Earl Boen shows up (out of nowhere) as Dr. Silberman purely to generate recognition other than Arnie himself. This is where T3 sticks out like a sore thumb.Luckily, there are more positives than negatives. Stan Winston's gorgeous and glittering silver cyborg designs are a welcome return in these sickening times of CG overload courtesy of over-reaching ambitions by formerly inventive filmmakers (take your pick: Spider-Man, Hulk, Matrix Reloaded, parts of the Lord of the Rings series and the Star Wars prequels). And when Arnie and the T-X slug it out in a kind of robotic martial arts slam dance (destroying an office restroom complete with urinals and toilets), it's an intoxicating blend of adrenaline, mechanical power and sexual energy. You feel the bruises and bending steel. Back to basics fist fighting, bare-bones dogme action at its finest. T3 actually seems like a throwback to the nitty-gritty cinema heyday of rugged stuntmen, breathing explosions and cool editing (a superb job by Neil Travis and Nicolas de Toth). Full of B-movie values and subtle plot-moving stopgaps but operated from a mega budget.Sure, T3 is clouded with zippy CG effects, but the best scenes and set-pieces are for real. You may speculate just where all the money went then. Relax. That's a real street, a real area of Los Angeles, that gets demolished in the gawking crane and fire truck chase that not only bolts out as a shocking display of property damage, but as the most intense and satisfying Armageddon on wheels since William Friedkin's freeway spectacle in To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Leaving CG-drenched stinkers like 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and Driven (2001) in a cloud of Judgement Day dust. The action in T3 is worth the ticket alone.But Mostow's spice of choice is subtlety and the little things add up. Arnie picks up biker gear a third time around while you smile, the technical evovlement of Cyberdyne is displayed but not pondered upon, and I did enjoy the 'heat plus sand equals glass' detail. Nice touch and a perfect example of how well-rounded this sequel was approached by the filmmakers.Mostow effectively marries old and new with a tight and thought-provoking sci-fi story. The ending is a triumph, as Mostow and writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris keep the best for last and almost caressingly open Pandora's Box. An ending for the ages, logically - not just in typical greedy Hollywood fashion - paving the way for another sequel with the actual war of man against machine.T3 is a pleasant Tinseltown surprise and a biggie with purpose. Don't be put off by a non-Cameron Terminator and shy away, or as Ah-nuld simply states in a hilarious scene: "Don't do dat."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of battles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One activity exagerrated. All time it must happen something, to have changes. But, give in the movie some situation calm! It seems me as the message of the movie is until the change is not radical the situation won't be calm. All time confrontation between Terminator and Terminator X. A movie full with violence and as in every movie American the car is a decor inevitable in the races and in the destructions. Really there had a lot destructions. And see what a contrast. T-X all time does demolitions and her face always is same. And not only that, her make - up, hairstyle, charm are always same, not changeable with purpose that the black is good, nice, that who does bad things also that is good thing. Law of the dialectic where the pair is always good.As a conclusion for the movie. The movie would be better if in the movie there had some situations calm, and not all time battles and changes. It needed to exist some balance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Waiting ten plus years for this movie has unfortunately not been worth it. The action scenes are fantastic, Arnie is the terminator!! and the new terminator model TX is great, but it feels so episodic that at the end of the movie you could honestly be waiting for the Eastenders theme tune to play the end. The story is rushed, there's no detail and no back story unlike the first 2. The TX is dispatched so easily, that the whole film just seems like a complete waste of time. Arnie's model is obselete but he still manages to have 1 main fight with the TX and finish her off straight away! Seems like a rush job that took ten years to make!</fullReview>

But I have to say that I didn´t understand much it..the movie for me fails in many things, such as:..Jonh Connor should ´ve been edward furlong, , nick stahl was ridiculous(not him, but he wasn´t fit properly for the role and I don´t like changing actors in sequels for same role)...The movie let us many questions and I would like to somebody answer it:..What happened to the laboratory exploded in T2:..WHAT is the connection between Miles Dyson and the father of Claire?..for me, the way that the history is told in T3 sounds like one neverending story, every time that one terminator is sent to the past it is terminated and: should not the future be changed?...this is for me the message in T2, that the 3 chips were destroyed...the only reason for me to keep terminators being sent to the past is if we are dealing to many dimensions or parallel Worlds...now we have a situation:finaly, Judgment day is arrived..Could have enough space for T4?..I think that is the only reason to save the trilogy...happening in the future(now present)..the machines X humans....humans winning...so, the machines build the ultimate killer machine...a TERMINATOR made by light( i heard that this terminator would be the TX)..this Terminator tries to kill Jonh in the future, but for some reason it fails...so, it is sent to the "many pasts" to bring back all terminators (T1000, TX)...together with it, all these 3 terminators went back to 1984, to kill Sarah( they have, now all informations about her)...it´s up to jonh, arnie and clarie to go back and try to stop them.....what do you guys think...for T3 I give 3 stars in 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vapid, inept B-movie follows up to two A grade classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Terminator' (1984) and `T2: Judgement Day' (1991) and rightfully considered as classics. Absolute landmarks in cinematic history. And while there have been campaigns against making another Terminator movie, for the sake of preserving the franchise, they went ahead and made a third instalment anyway. Not only that, it turned out to be the most expensive movie of all time. And for a film that cost some 200 million dollars, this doesn't live up to the hype. Essentially, `T3' is a B movie ? unadulterated popcorn entertainment. Had it not been a sequel to the franchise, I might have a higher opinion of it. But it is an offence against sense to follow up to histrionic classics with `a B movie'. I think that director Jonathan Mostow was just cowering in the background working with the excuse that it was a B movie, hoping that no one would make comparisons. Well guess what Mostow? They did. No James Cameron, no Linda Hamilton, no Edward Furlong, Michael Biehn, Robert Patrick. The only shred of hope keeping this alive is Arnold Schwarzanegger. And in fairness to Arnie, he does a good job of his character. But it seems as though he is written for laughs given a bunch of jokes to utter- some good, others desperate-and loses the menace and brilliance of his character in the predecessors. Meanwhile, Nick Stahl gives the worst performance in the entire movie and is a very poor trade in for Edward Furlong. His lines aren't delivered with any believability, emotional scenes are incredibly flat and he simply ISN'T John Connor. Claire Danes on the other hand is a good trade in for Linda Hamilton (I can understand why she didn't want to be involved) and her relevance to the plot is believable. Kristanna Loken is absolutely terrible as the menace of the picture. Completely un-intimidating, instead of `Oh no! Look out' this is more a case of `Show us your boobs!' Also in there, Earl Boen jumps in just to say, `I'm here to explain why I'm still a cynic'.The script is shallow and dull, conceived in the most immature style. Sarah Connor is written off in the most ridiculous fashion. `I know, let's give her a disease. Cancer? No, leukaemia!' Luckily, the film clocks in at about 102 minutes, so it's fast-paced enough not to bore. Special effects sequences are okay, but a huge waste of money when the finished product is this mediocre. An insufficient effort that, quite frankly, should never have been made, this is a very poor follow-up. Below average in acting, directing etc. this falls wide of the mark. On its own level, the movie is okay. But comparisons are inevitable and the expensive but brainless `T3' pales. Bottom line: die hard action fans, and those who see `The Terminator' franchise as infallible, only. My IMDb rating: 4.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually wanted more of a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to let you know, I am a die-hard Terminator fan. Have been ever since the 1st movie. I collect the comics and have read all the T2 books by S. M. Stirling (like T2: Infiltrator). I actually wanted more a story than I got in T3. There is no doubt T3 is a great action movie, and who doesn't love the female Terminator? But I guess I did miss the Sara Connor character. In T3, John Connor came across as too much of a wimpy cry baby. The Sara Connor from T2 would have continued to train John on how to survive "Judgment Day". Overall I was a little disappointed in T3. To me it was too short (barely 100 minutes), I wanted a more developed story line (like what was happening in the future and that sort of stuff), and I wanted Linda Hamilton back. I will end up buying the T3 DVD when it comes out, and I can only hope they make a T4, so we can see how the war against the machines really ends.</fullReview>

And I doubt you'll be too surprised to hear that there's virtually nothing else to the film.My favourite bit was the word "Terminatrix" :-)I think I'll wait for the DVD rental copy of T4, it won't be worth the trip to the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T-3 had better not risen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a lot of quite positive critics about Terminator 3 and many positive reviews I thought that maybe T-3 would not be so bad as I had imagined. When it finally was released in Germany I was eager to see it on the opening day. I shouldn't have... T-3 is an average action movie but nothing extraordinary. Judged by its predecessors T-3 is inferior in every respect. T-3 neither has the dark atmosphere of the first Terminator nor the epic size of T-2. Okay, maybe one could not expect that, but at least I expected a serious treatment of the heir. However, the first 15 minutes seem to be a parody on T-2 (as if Jerry/David Zucker&amp; Jim Abrahams had directed the bar-scence) and this really annoyed me. Also, the often praised car chase is not as impressive as the one in Reloaded. But that is not the point. The real problem is, that the Terminator is mocked and ridiculed in my opinion and the T-X seems by far not as dangerous as the T-1000 or Schwarzenegger in T-1. Where Cameron created a dark and dense atmosphere, strong characters + state-of-the-art action sequences T-3 hurries from one scene to the next without spending time on the characters or the story. Well, if you liked T-3 it is okay, but I do not think that anyone who loves the first two installments will be really satisfied with Mostows creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie is back in T3! Will we see him in T4?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It´s not better then T2, and I think its not (much) worse. As others said, the acting, effects, action was ok, but Mostow wasnt the right man for this movie. The T-X was as good as the T-1000 (acting), and Kristianna Loken is not the one to blame if you didnt like T3.Here are just some things:1. When Mostow saw Arnold in the leather jacket he said: Now we´re making a Terminator! Well, I´m very sorry to tell you that, but you were making a Terminator also before that. The movie needs too much time to start! Untill the machine is looking into the screen (this was very chilling to me) it´s OK, but then there are a few minutes really, ugly sh... and nothing hapens. Instead of showing Kate and John so much, that should be shorter and he should show us how Arnie got the gun... Then suddenly the Action starts, too suddenly! I think the composition of the movie is very bad, this is indicated even by the fact the movie is just 1:40 long (and for this Arnie had to pay extra!!).2. Humor is OK, but it was too much! It was funny and I liked it (more funny then Bruce Almighty and Anger Management), but somewhere the director must say: It´s enough!3. My most important point (and why I think the movie is not as good as the first 2 Terminators): In T1 and T2 John Connor is not born or hes not very important to the movie. Through the movie we see a cold fight, with less emotion... T3 has too much of John and Kate and their emotions... Even the Terminator is funny...! John Connor is "The One", the leader of the people, but this is during the war, this here is before it, John Connor isnt so much important here!It seems that Director and Producer must have a T4 in their minds. If it will be without Arnie it is already sh... and not worth of making it! When Arnie will be back (I doubt in this!), then you need a story directly after the war started, in which John Connor wont show us his emotions, but show us why he is so important; it cant be just that he says he´ll take the lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parodies with Alien Series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Terminator series somehow parodies the Alien series. The first two films were amazing pieces of story telling, at different levels. The first one being dark, and edgy. The second to be more mainstream and action orientated. This accounts to both series and the fact that James Cameron is linked as director between these series, is strange also.The difference now is that Alien has made up to 4 sequels, and more coming (so I've heard). Terminator stopped at number 2, till now. Both series had two great starters, and Terminator supposedly stopped at 2, it still had potential to carry on. Hollywood being Hollywood, they decided to do another one. As James Cameron directed both, it would be logical to let him carry the helm for the third time, but he declined. If he declined so would many actors to follow, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, (Though I think they didn't pick him, due to drug offences). Though Arnold Swarzeneggar had to accept for the movie to go ahead, as he was the major star in the last two. Much like Sigourney Weaver in the Alien Series. He had to accept as he hasn't had a hit for a long, long time.Like the alien movies, the standards set were very high, so the next sequel will be hard to impress. For me the third Alien movie, was different and wasn't bad, but compared to the last two it was poor. This is what I feel about Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines as well.The problem with sequels, is that the audience knows the characters now, therefore people make their own judgement on how that character would react. Which may differ to the director. The story: There is now a new model terminator, a T-X (Kristanna Loken)a more advance terminator than T-1000. Who has been sent back in time out to kill John Connor (Nick Stahl), who is now a lot older from the last outing. T-800 (Arny of course) is also sent back to protect him. Basically the same plot from T2, but there is a difference, T-X is a female and a lot more advanced. My opinion of Skynet is that it would be illogical for them to make a terminator that is female, pretty and I thought they would explain the reason, but do not. For me Kristanna Loken plays a good killer, but it just seemed that Hollywood realised that the market in movies, are stronger women. Which has already been experienced in T2. It just doesn't work for me, though I'm not trying to be sexist.I feel John Connor seemed a little weak for someone, who will lead the last human rebellion to victory. Even Claire Danes character was stronger than him.The overall story destroys the message that was given in T2. Well it is still entertaining, certainly a lot more funnier than the last one. Can't believe it recieved a 12A rating in the UK, so I must insist you don't bring in children to watch this, as there is a certain scene that is quite disturbing.C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous fun which does well to continue the legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time. 6 years between the first and second, and now 13 years after the second, the 3rd.In the hype up to production and release, the fervour around this movie centred on the absence of many key players in the previous 2 installments - such as Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick, and, of course, James Cameron. So we have merely Mario Kassar (Producer), Stan Winston effects studios, and of course, Arnie. But to say the new director makes this an inferior movie would be innaccurate. Although there *is* a new feel to this, it's not a bad one. It's just different. Whether you can accept that will decide whether you enjoy this. The story obviously continues on from T2 but I won't give away exactly how it achieves this, because that's half the mystery. Arnie *is* the Terminator - his presence on screen is magic - he has the same 'charisma' as he had previously and still convinces. He's not quite as sympathetic as he was before, because he's playing a different kind of role this time. Kristanna Loken, as the Terminatrix, manages to ooze sexy danger pretty well. Sure, she's no Robert Patrick, and has little dialogue, but she does portray the cold efficient invincible nature of the Terminatrix pretty well. As John Conner, Stahl does a decent, if perhaps slightly uninspired job. He's probably the weakest player. Clare Danes is staple, again nothing particularly special. One aspect of T2 which is enhanced here is the comedy - there are many snappy one liners and humourous moments which serve well to counter the serious theme. The special effects are pretty seamless, and epic as we would expect. But the explosions are a tad overdone. I've never heard a noisier movie in my life. Some of them seemed just a bit unnecessary. As for the story, well it kept me gripped. I missed certain characters and the previous atmosphere, but this still did enough to have been pretty much worth the wait. If you like Terminator you *will* get a kick out of this.(Look out for a cracking cameo from a previous character)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was definitely the most anticipated movie of the Decade. I like millions of others, definitely watched this movie, whether a Schwarzenegger Fan or not.FROM A SCHWARZENEGGER FAN'S POINT OF VIEW I GIVE THIS MOVIE A "FOUR out of FIVE" BUT AS A CRITIC'S ROLE, I GIVE THIS MOVIE A "THREE out of FIVE".And I say:NOBODY,infact NOBODY who is in his/her right sense of mind and who thinks Sensibly, will ever Deny that ARNIE HAS DEFINITELY PERFORMED HIS BEST ON HIS BEHALF and the 56 year old Golden Globe winner was by any means, NOT responsible for the movie being an average "3 out of 5" movie and not a classic masterpiece as we had expected.If anybody is responsible for it then it definitely has to be the Plot of the movie or rather the Absence of It.AND THE OTHER CULPRIT IS POOR DIRECTION provided by Mr.Jonathan Mostow.This movie is a classic example which exposes the GAP OF TALENT between Master Directors like James Cameron,Steven Spielberg, Manoj Shayamalan,Edward Zwick and other Mere Ordinary Mortals like Mr.Mostow here.Mr.Mostow once in his interview SAID : "I am a fan of Arnie and also the Two Classic Prequels made in 1984 and 1991 respectively and I would only create in the 3rd installment what other fans would LIKE to expect or see."Well, Mr.Mostow, as Arnie's one famous one-liner goes : "YOU LIED."Mr.Mostow merely LIFTED EXACTLY everything from "T-2(1991)" and put it in T-3.Unfortunately It DID work.I definitely did NOT expect this movie to be a great Denzel Washington Classic or a Tom Hanks Masterpiece or a Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense(1999)" or a Spielberg's "Schindler's List(1993)" BUT I definitely expected it to carry forward from where it's Classic Prequel had left(the plot).But It was not to be.This movie may have been a major hit but I think everybody should care for Quality over Quantity.Mr.Mostow has missed the chance the TITANIC director had given him. Had this movie been any better,the director would definitely have been showered with accolades,flowers.But not here.This movie merely survives on Arnie's Charisma/Performance and State-of-the-art Visual/Sound Effects and NOTHING more.For me, THE MOST SENSIBLE AND REALISTIC SCIENCE FICTIONAL MOVIE EVER MADE WAS AND IS "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(2001)" BY STEVEN SPIELBERG. NO OTHER SCI-FI MOVIE DESERVES A BETTER RATING THAN "A.I.".AND THAT'S FOR SURE.Mr.Mostow,the great Schwarzenegger and the great James Cameron will SURELY give a Blockbluster Hit in the near future.They are FOREVER but... What About You ?(All those Fans(?) or Critics(?) who are responsible for this funny movie being rated as high as EIGHT, DO NOT deserve to vote merely because they use only Emotional Intelligence. Everybody HAS to utilise Reasoning Power too.)(I request the Respected IMDB Officials for the first time in the period of my long attachment with IMDB, to put my review on the T-3's Main Page if possible...Obviously after deleting this Request Part of the Review ofcourse.)

Where Cameron created a dark and dense atmosphere, strong characters + state-of-the-art action sequences T-3 hurries from one scene to the next without spending time on the characters or the story. Well, if you liked T-3 it is okay, but I do not think that anyone who loves the first two installments will be really satisfied with Mostows creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful, just pointless and unnecessary. Worst Film Score In Years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally saw T3 (and I didn't pay - don't want to help Arnold in his threatened race for Gov!).Brings to mind the whole topic of sequels. Expectations play such a large part. Taken on its own, T3 is an OK mishmash of the first 2 films. BUT, coming after a pair of the most influential SF films of the past 2 decades, it's a big letdown. Especially, considering that this wasn't a quickie B-Movie throwaway like in the old days of THE MUMMY'S HAND, HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, REVENGE OF THE CREATURE, RETURN OF THE FLY etc. There, you're expectations weren't as high (as well as the financial stakes, so sometimes you were pleasantly surprised at the outcome - ESCAPE FROM PLANET OF THE APES or FUTUREWORLD being a prime examples).The money (reportedly over $100M to $150M) is there on screen, but the IDEAS of the first 2 films take a big backseat to MORE Explosions, MORE Action, MORE chases and MORE bad puns. Sorry, but the supposed "wit" I kept hearing about fell mostly flat to me and the audience I saw it with (except for one yahoo who hooted and hollered on cue as if on the payroll of WB). Too much of the script simply plays like a series of "We've got to recycle that" references and a recitation of studio notes to the writers. Boiled down, the film is almost a remake of T2 (the ever changing and expanding future Alternate Universes going along for the ride).Still, I can't say it was truly awful or terribly boring. Just not essential. And, the so-called musical "score" - horrible, clanking NOISE passing as music. In fact Marco Beltrami's (let's name names here!) score is perhaps the worst you will encounter in a major release in a long long time. Not sure why original composer Brad Fiedel was not retained (his TERMINATOR THEME is used under the end credits and sounds like a breath of fresh air after Beltrami's noise pollution!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>different but worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the first two terminator films are classics. so this third installment had a real good chance of ruining the whole effect. but i was actually suprised. although complex, the film actually fits with the story. and it leaves with something to think about as the end credits begin to roll. it's almost profound.it's no terminator 1, how could it be. and it's not even T-2 but i was 12 then, so nothing ever could be. but it is a damn good film. the action scenes are orchestrated just as good as cameron ever could have done. the actors are fair but nothing great. nick stahl proving the best as john conner. i suppose if you step back and look at it, it is different. john conner looks different and in a way, ruins the continuation. arnie now bears no resemblance to himself from T1, which makes it difficult to relate to the past story. but what i really missed. what i really thought should have been in the movie. was that great terminator score. not just the popular one but the theme they use during the chases of T2. if they coulda put that in over the action scenes here, it would've felt more like a terminator movie.but with these flaws, it doesnt stop you from enjoying what's on the screen. a slam bam action film that provides a thoughtful ending to the classic trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What, no twist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any sequel needs a new, fresh, approach to either the story or its characters. Preferably both, of course... T3 lacks this, and is actually nothing more than a transportation to T4. Frankly, I was rather bored. Giving the TX a female gender is not a twist, actually it is hardly even variation, it is just boring. If anything, it is evidence that this Venus/Mars myth, which prevails in our society, is pure nonsense. (In case You had not found that out yet...) T4 has got the prerequisites of becoming another great movie, while T3 is but a story that has to be told in order to get a good basis for T4. This is unfortunate, but perhaps inevitable? Another thing that bothers me is Arnie's apparent personal influence on his own character, i.e. in the script. His ambiguity at the end of the movie messes up the ice cold logic of the plot, inherited from T1 and T2, which is a shame. Once re-programmed, he should act in accordance to that, without remorse. Personally, I would wish that Arnie's character was reduced to a minimum in the sequel(s) to come. The (great) overall story would gain tremendously from that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think a friend of mine who saw it with me put it best: "They knew it was going to be stupid, so why bother with plot?" There's some sort of contrivance about why we're watching Arnie MK III fight a supermodel with CGI powers, but it's even thinner than what we got in the last movie and not particularly worth worrying about (although if you're hellbent on taking this movie seriously, you might ask why the people of the future picked almost the least-effective time possible to which to send their cyborgs). But really, if this movie's about anything, it's about watching cars blow up. The humor's awful and the characters are boring, although if lip-quivering were an Olympic event Claire Danes would get the gold. The movie promises very little, and admittedly, delivers it reasonably well. I have to admit I didn't get too bored, but I doubt the movie would play so well on a TV set at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Won't win any Oscars, but entertaining nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is solid, uninspiring action fare, made highly watchable by it's sense of humour and refusal to take itself seriously. Quite an impressive feat, considering the film's subject matter (the world effectively destroying itself in a frenzy of nuclear missiles!)Jonathan Mostow directs without any pretentiousness, and has, at the very least, created one of the most grandiose and exciting car chases in recent memory. The effects are tremendous, and Arnold is on top form returning to his best-loved character. Some of his one-liners fail to hit the spot, but on the most part they succeed in entertaining, and the way he finds his trademark leather jacket is an unexpected treat.Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are fine in their roles, though I was somewhat underwhelmed overall. Considering the powerhouse performances of the likes of Linda Hamilton in the first two movies, that isn't too surprising.Popcorn fare of a very high quality, Terminator 3 is a weak film when judged as part of the Terminator canon, but in it's own way a real cinematic treat for a Friday evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to Terminator 3 unsure of what I was going to get and came out empressed. Why was I empressed:T3 - James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong = Potential DisasterWith the odds going against him Jonathan Mostow pulled it off, he made T3 without any of the above elements and the end product was really good. Nick Stahl does a great job of taking Edward Furlong's place as John Conner, putting lots of emotion and grit into the part. Claire Danes does a magnificent job as Kate Brewster, also adding some raw emotion to her part. At age 56 Arnold looks as tough as ever as the Terminator proofing age is nothing but a number. Kristanna Loken does well as the T-X, a robot b!tch who just doesnt seem to go away. The storyline was well written and the action sequences were awesome. If you have not seen T3, go see it! But DO NOT compare it to the first two, because T3 was not James Cameron's work. My rating: 8 out of a possible 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very apprehensive about this one for a while...but at the same time, excited. The first two Terminators are pure works of art, in my opinion, flawless examples of filmmaking on almost every level (except for a couple of plot inconsistencies...like it matters though!). James Cameron is a master of story telling, pacing, editing, characterization, and of course, special effects. He is one of the best directors of our time....unfortunately he refused to film the newest installment of the Terminator series, though Jonathon Mostow did do a good job on T3. At any rate, T1 and T2 were incredibly hard acts to follow, so T3 already had larger than life shoes to fill...and for the most part, it fills them quite nicely.T3 literally dives head first right into the action after a short 3 minute or so prologue. I will be honest, though the first hour has a lot of great stunts and hard core action, it just didn't do anything for me. To me, it was all been there, done that from the get go, and felt rushed. Basically, the entire characterization part of the main characters that we loved in T2 was dealt with, in this movie, in about 10 minutes or less, and immediately dives into the same formula...killer robot goes on a rampage killing a ton of people for a reason that is not quite clear at the moment, but will unfold later. Literally, there was no suspense, or buildup, just mindless explosion after explosion. Don't get me wrong, I love a good action film, but with T3, one has to expect more...more substance, more story, more grasping the struggle for humanity...Don't worry, I'm about to go on the great aspects of the film, and there are quite a few to mention...All of my negativity ceased immediately when the second act began. This movie totally blew me away during it's last hour. The plot is finally explained and the story continues, with the central theme being that the ideals that 'There is no fate but what we make' can now all be thrown out the window. Judgement day is inevitable, along with the destinies of future resistance leaders John Connor and his bride to be, Claire Danes. All I will say is that when they take the fight to Skynet is when I was totally hooked until the very end. As for the ending, I was very impressed. A truly appropriate ending that will make you think long after you've left the theater. I thought the ending was exactly what it should have been. Bring on T4!!But, at any rate, T3, though pales in comparison to T2, which was obvious that it would even before it came out, it is a worthy addition to the Terminator saga. Though, it does fail in several areas...for instance, there is almost no charisma between this new Terminator and John Connor, and very little plot time is given to the developing relationship between Connor and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). This aspect alone is my biggest complaint with the movie. T1 and T2 showed how humanity can survive even in its darkest hour, and in T2, there is an irony that the only fatherly love that John Connor ever felt was from a machine. Unfortunately, this theme was not carried on into this installment...the three main characters simply fight to survive and that's about it. Given the circumstances though, it does seem realistic, but that is the fault of the filmmakers because they made the film so short...the true fans didn't want to see a compressed 105 min or so film loaded to the brim with action...we also wanted to see more drama, more character development, more everything that T2 had besides the explosions. Don't get me wrong, the new story is great, the acting is very good, and the action is superb...it's just there was that extra dose of the preservation of humanity that was missing. Also, my next biggest complaint is the lack of a good, hard core, blood pumping soundtrack. Where the hell was it?!? What we get is pure crap, or as for the first car chase scene, practically DEAD SILENCE for about 10 minutes. Remember the cool tracks played when Arnie was on his motor cycle, or when he was fighting the swat team in T2? Man, I was simply aching for a musical score that would somehow TRY to compliment the mood of excitement...instead T3's score manages to surprisingly dull the excitement instead of adding to it. Thankfully, we do get to hear the famous Terminator theme song in all of it's glory, but unfortunately, it is during the end credits. Though the movie is still very good, these two things in particular (or lack there of) are what majorly drag it down. On another note, I thought Kristanna Loken as the TX was pretty good, though not NEARLY as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000, she still looked very cool and very sexy in her breakthrough role...it's just too bad the filmmakers didn't allot a larger running time to allow a better buildup that establishes her as someone we love to hate and fear to dread. So in other words, T3's major let downs are not from overdoing anything, but underdoing way too much.Yeah, that sounds like I'm going back on my praise for T3, but I'm really not...I'm only pointing out frustrations from a true fan of the first two Terminators, just like the same thing Matrix fans can say about the Matrix Reloaded (but that is a much different story). T3 was action packed, had an incredible story that continued the saga nicely, and also added it's own shocking elements, had great acting, good direction, and above all else, Arnie once again in his glorious prime. Arnie fans will NOT be disapointed with T3...though that depends on how much you compare it to T2, which I myself have found myself doing writing this review.Anyway, the sad thing is that now that Arnie is running for governor, I doubt he will be making an inevitable T4 which will most definitely take place in the future. But, this is the installment that everyone is waiting for! At any rate, I loved T3 overall...it was a surprising breath of fresh air during a summer full of high priced stink fests. This is Arnie at his best, and will hopefully revitalize his career...though it is sad to think that this is probably the last time Arnie will ever be in this top form again. Since this is the peak of his comeback, I hate to admit that his career is probably all downhill from here. Then again, who wants to see a Terminator in a wheel chair?I highly recommend T3. Arnie truly did not disapoint in making a quality film, just try not to compare it too much to the other movies and you will enjoy it all the better. I give it a strong 8.5/10 stars, and look forward to it coming out on dvd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Controversial I know, but over the past four days I''ve seen this film 3 times and its grown each time. I'm not a massive fan of the Terminator francise, but i've loved Schwartzenegger ever since I can remember, his recent downfall in ratings and reviews needed to stop and T3 was the perfect way to do this. He provides a performance which is the greatist by any leading man in an action film since? what True lies? I don't know, he conveys power, but also willing to laugh at himself. Does Vin Deisel do this? Does Will Smith command the screen every time he's on it? Arnie has proved with this movie he is a star at another level to the before mentioned actors. His fee he picked up was deserved as it would not have been a movie without him.Arnies not the only good thing about this film don't make any mistake about that. John Mostow creates a vision which no other director has dared do over the past few years, take a high budget film and dare cut it down to under 2hrs, sometimes a long picture deserves its length, The two lord of the rings films could not have been cut down, the size of narrative Peter Jackson is conveying deserves more screen time not less. Lets take other narratives though, the Matrix? it should have been shorter or not made, Hulk undoing was making a 2 1/2 hr film out of such a simple idea, people get bored, and in the end remember trudgeing through endless minutes of dialouge which is pretentious and meaningless rather than the sequences which did inspire awe. I was guilty of this with Hulk myself. John Mostow has broken the mould, he's taken a simple chase story and made it the length it should be, and i'm sorry but the ten minute fight scene between the T101 and the TX p****s on the proverbial parade of any of the 20 minute monster fights in matrix reloaded! You just get bored.Character development is riskey and underrated in this movie thats Mostow and all the other actors taking the limelight.Okay it cost 140m to make, thats a lot of money, and it's fair to demand an exceptional movie. Thats most peoples problem with this film, But this film is a lesson in making films to all the would be action directors and actors, make sure its not to long, unless it needs be, use real explosions and cars whereever you can, and get a star to perform in the movie, a name, who wasn't a little excited when the austrian oaks name fills the screen before the title of the film comes up?For these simple lessons i give this movie 9/10 I give the same to T2 and I give 8/10 to The Terminator. T3 can kick the industry up the arse and show producers that just because it's costing loads it doesn't need hours of screen time and CGI being used to it's death. In an ideal world Arnold and Mostow will have recovered the action genre so the next Bond film is worth watching and the Matrix Revolutions doesn't get the hype of Reloaded. (and Vin Deisel will never work again!)A cult classic.How often do you say that about a $140m film?</fullReview>

(aliens, titanic, terminator 2) and i would think that he kinda thinks of terminator as one of the works of his lifetime, but why does he do such a thing with the terminator movies then? it's just sad... i liked the movie, but i think he just doesn't really like his terminator very much...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*Oops!Knowing the pants reviews this film had been getting and the fact it's a 12A did not bode well, but I had Sunday off and thought what the hell.As a stand alone movie this probably would have been more entertaining. As a sequel to two of the definitive movies of the last 20 years it's a bit of a stinker that manages to waft away the stench a few times but still has the smelly cloud hanging over it by the end.The most irritating thing is when good ideas are taken apart for sequels in the hands of by-the-numbers producers/ script writers et al who take the icing from a glorious cake but fail to realise that you need some marzipan and bit of fruit there too.Prime example is the original Police Academy which was ruined by 7 poxy sequels that patronised the audience and took small pieces known to make us chuckle and did them to death. Great TV series have followed this sorry road with Men Behaving Badly, Drop the Dead Donkey, Miami Vice and even the excellent "V" hurtling down this road with the latter indulging in later episodes having lots of face peeling and lower jaw-detaching, hamster gobbling close ups to distract from the lack of good story.And here...While starting off excellently with the absolutely gorgeous TX appearing naked in Beverly Hills it sets the scene well, particuarly with John Connor's maudlin narration about how he has to live as a "ghost" for fear of being found by Skynet. However expectations wilt the moment that Arnie chances upon a Ladies' Night Bar to retrieve his clothes. The biker's bar in T2 was pushing it but the violence and ruthlessness of the scene plus the fact that it was NOT played for laughs meant that this could be overlooked. The scene where we knew the water skis were sailing over Bruce was when the Elton John shades came out. Bad enough that they contrived to give him his leather jacket in such a messy and shamelessly self-mocking fashion but to then say "Hey lads, we KNOW!" with a totally uneccessary and pointless additional piss-take ruined the last vestiges of credibility this had.You don't laugh AT the Terminator. You don't make fun of him. He's not something to snicker at behind your medium-sized diet Cokes. A similar scene was done with more charm and in the space of 5 seconds in the opening credits of the A-Team. And while we're on the subject...the violence in this for the most part comes across as very A-Team-ish with cars crunched, entire building's destroyed and people thrown into heavy objects without suffering more than a sore head. Arnie's leather seems so stand up remarkably well too, sporting only a couple of nicks and tears after facing more punishment than Tyson's bonse after the Lewis fight.Despite this, some scenes are VERY violent for a 12A. One can only assume that the BBFC's Quentin Thomas is the polar opposite of the rancid James Ferman.The story fails to make sense a few times. If Arnie kills the future John Connor in 2032 AFTER the victory against the machines then how does that fit in? Similarly it is all a little too convenient that John Connor already knows Kate Brewster considering he's permanently on the move and why did John Connor choose as his future lieutenants a bunch of spotty herberts from high school.The much lauded Good Terminator/ Bad Terminator aspect is awful and lasts all of 3 minutes. Rather than having him become the killer from part one for a while he simply has a tantrum and beats up a perfectly good car.This whole thing smacks of lack of thinking and the desire to prop up the career of the future candidate for Governor of California. While Kristianna Loken is equally as good in her role as Robert Patrick was and, despite being 9 years away from his free bus pass, Arnie still rocks there is a lack of any consistent flame here even if the spark is good and strong a few times (firing a machine gun while carrying a coffin on one shoulder just looks so cool).The one stand out moment is the downbeat and depressing ending. The otherwise excellent 28 Days Later was ruined by a falsely upbeat conclusion and I admire the film makers for going the whole hog with this.Not good. The closest comparison I can make is that this is to T1 and 2 what Robocop 3 was to its forefathers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POTENTIAL SPOILERSWhilst the 1st Terminator was a dark subtle matter (and admittedly my favourite of the three), the 2nd moved onto a more mainstream easy watching platform. This film continues on from number 2 &amp; doesn't disappoint.Whilst admittedly it has none of the major thought processes that I'm usually keen on. There's something amazing about just being able to watch Arnie driving around beating people up again.Truth be told, the only thing I have a flaw with this film, and I'm probably the only one, is the T-X. I can't help but feel that whilst Loken (is that the proper spelling of her name?) makes a fair effort, I just can't take her seriously as a threat to mankind. I just feel with a better choice in outfit &amp; without hair tied back in a way which makes her look like she should be wearing a suit in an office somewhere, would have made her more of a threat. In the end of the day though, this just feels like some sort of equal rights idea. It makes me wonder what will happen in Terminator 4 (and there WILL be another). Will they try &amp; combine the first type of Terminator with Arnie's type &amp; create some sort of Terminator Paverotti? Could even create a Terminator Dog or something. Despite all my negatives regarding Loken however, the same concerns were probably made about Patrick's T1000 in Terminator 2. Despite the occasional concerns though, this is still an entertaining film. So back to the cinema for a 2nd viewing I go. Go Arnie Go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the one hand we see the unbelievably harsh and brutal unfolding of events, that remind me of the classical greek tragedies - this is what evokes the emotional attachment to whats going on. Lots of scenes contain a violent conflict that is fought with utmost determination on both sides, and reduce their options and planing horizon to the next few seconds, their immediate vicinity and the people and objects that happen to bet there: the toilet battle, where the ingredients are a few square meters, concrete and ceramics; the crane chase where every appearing object (buildings, cars, front lawns, truck underbellies, manholes) is reduced to its usefulness for any side in the next few seconds; ultimately even the T101 itself, when its fuel cell turns out to be it's most useful property for the next two seconds. And on the other hand ravaging humor delivered not only by Arnold, but every cast member. ("you remind me of my mother"). Haven't seen anything like it, in that respect it was better than T2 (which of course was more original overall since in 1992 the overall plot was new), and every other movie i've ever seen. This is the really outstanding aspect of T3, to have an extremely grave, violent, serious tragic plot that is slammed into the viewers face in just about all scenes, and yet have hilarious humor without taking the bite of the seriousness of it all. Best movie of the year as far as i can see.PS: Yes, T2 had more "new" plot, but imagine there was no T2, then T3's plot would be applauded as much as T2's was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Terminater 3: Rise of the Machines. I really loved this movie. The Terminater was one of my favorite movies of all time. T2, was great, but not better then the first. Robert Patrick against Arnold... NO WAY! TX against Arnold... YEAH! Linda Hamilton turned down T3. She wasn't meant for this film &amp; I didn't miss her for a microt! The new John Connor was perfect. I hated the kid in T2. Great to see Arnold &amp; Earl Boen return for a third round!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 is an excellent movie to watch. It's just as good as the first 2. It has a powerful ending that surprised me. Plenty of action as usual. I think there might even be a fourth one the way arnold was talking in one scene (he said he killed john conner in one scene) unless i didn't understand at all. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnnie 5 is alive!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really enjoyed the movie. The look and feel of it are very much in the same vain as T2, the action almost relentless and some well placed humorous touches add to the enjoyment. One of the acid tests for a good action movie is a car chase. In this case the car/motorbike/crane chase was superbly well crafted and compares favourably with the freeway scenes in Matrix Reloaded and that movie's more sophisticated use of filming techniques. Definitely recommended, you could probably enjoy this without having seen the previous instalments. A note on the ending - I don't want to spoil it but the manner in which John Connor's destiny finally unfolds to become leader of the resistance is very clever. It was nice to see Number 5 from the Short Circuit movies as first generation Terminators in the Air Force development facility - shame it seems he has been type cast though. Finally, I have to say, despite her Swiss army knife functionality, the TX is nowhere near a match for the T-1000 from Judgement Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I heard that a spoof of the terminator films were going to be made I would have been mildly annoyed but it wouldn't be much to get over, I would just not go and see it.But I don't believe this was supposed to be a parody, but if people who make films don't have a good sense of reality they may end up accidentally making spoofs when they should be making films.Now, I know for a fact that a great deal of people like and love this movie, Imdb has given it a high star rating, and I absolutely respect that and other peoples tastes.But we live in a wacky world, and there are many different tastes out there, and if one morning I woke up and the papers read, "pigs excrement has become a staple food and every one on the planet is eating it", even if all the beings in the entire universe were eating it I would not join in.You can have a debate about what makes a good film and what makes a bad one until the sun finally explodes(Approx 5 Billion years from now), but there can be no debate about what makes a healthy film, and this is not it.This is far worse than mere junk food, eating pigs excrement my be some peoples idea of a good time, and as I said I can absolutely respect that but its not mine, and its not healthy. Filling peoples minds with this kind of so called entertainment can only take its toll on ones sense of reality.I like my food lean mean with plenty of GREEN(the Hulk is a healthy film)Its high time people stopped eating pigs manure, you need to be able to tell the difference between a healthy film and an unhealthy one, its like the difference between having terminal lung cancer and having fit and healthy lungs - if you can't make this distinction you better learn other wise you are doomed.Pigs excrement does make for good eating.Thank the great almighty for people like Peter Jackson and Ang Lee(healthy films can be entertaining)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(possible spoilers) The most disappointed I have ever felt leaving a cinema, was upon leaving this film. I was physically angry at the absolute nonsense that I had just watched. Yes it has an incredible opening car chase. Yes the two terminators fighting looks great and yes Arnie is back, but large explosions and pointless chases does not a good terminator film make.There are a lot of problems with this film and I won't bother to list all of them. But the T-X is too large a problem to ignore. Where as Robert Patricks' T1000 was the embodiment of terror in T2, Kristana Loken is about as scary and fear inducing as my Nan. She is appalling and has one expression, that of a slightly cheesed off beautician. She looks stupid when she runs and totally unconvincing when she fights. Robert Patrick, I know is committed to the X-files, but they could at least have got someone who could act or fight.The second problem is Jonathon Mostow, a director who gave us the abysmal and history rewriting U571. OK he manages to pack as many explosions into the film as possible, but what he doesn't seem to grasp is that in the first two films the action is centered around a strong central plot. We care about the characters and the action, when it does happen, is the better for it. Mostow is a person who obviously doesn't understand the word suspense, as unlike the first two films there is no build up, the TX finds John Connor, through Katherine Brewster in a quite ridiculous set piece, inside the first 7mins.The third problem is the script, or lack of, which is just a reworking of T2 with the TX in place of the superior T100. Thanks to this 'script' Arnie is a 'new and improved' joke telling terminator. Every time Arnie open his mouth the line is played for laughs. He parodies himself so much that it totally destroys the sense of foreboding. Its the end of the world for Christ sake its not meant to be portrayed in this happy-clappy contrary way.Had it been just a normal action film, this film would have been good fun. But as a huge fan of the first two films I can't stress enough how frustrated I am. Terminator and T2 were two of the most influential action films ever made, their legacy is apparent in the films produced in the 80's and 90's. A legacy which has been brought to a crashing end by this piece of unimaginative tripe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to start off by saying I love the first two Terminator movies (the second just edges it for me). I also agree that James Cameron is one of the finest action directors around so obviously people are going to judge 'Rise of the Machines' on Cameron's previous efforts. I went to the movie with an open mind having seen both Breakdown and U-571 by Jonathan Mostow. I enjoyed both films immensely and rate Mostow very highly as an action director. I have to say that he has done a terrific job in resurrecting the Terminator franchise. Forget all the negative ' it's just not the same without Jim Cameron' comments. Arnold Schwarzenegger MADE the Terminator films what they are today. Nobody else could utter the immortal 'I'll be back' line as convincingly as Arnie! When he first appears in R.O.T.M, you almost want to cheer with delight. The one-liners are back and are very funny. It's almost a p*ss take of the previous films but not enough to make you groan. (Wait til you see how he acquires his leathers!!!!!) The TX character is OK but not a patch on Robert Patrick's frightening T-1000. I just didn't find a (red) leather clad female that scary although her and Arnie have some great battles. I didn't miss Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor) or Edward Furlong at all. Nick Stahl is very good as the older John Connor and Clare Danes isn't too bad either. **** POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING**** All I can say is go see Rise of the Machines - you wont be disappointed. I would rate this film 8/10. You will not predict the ending (it's right up there with the classic 'Planet of the Apes' finale)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok we all know it's coming. T-4. But not with Mr S. We really don't need much of him. Maybe at the end of T-4. When he's captured and send back in time. That would make the perfect ending and tie it back to T-1. In all I did like this one. My teen kids liked it more than I did. I'd say you need to see it twice! So much go's by so fast you have to miss stuff. I know I did. On my scale I give it 8.5. 10 being best. It does have great effects. While it did have too many inside jokes on the past T movies. I still enjoyed the story line. Would have liked to have expaned on the rise of the machines. Like seeing them attacking government buildings in washington dc, russia and the rest. That would have helped bring in the rest of the word. Nukes fell on us and everybody else seeing the machines of that time in other countries would have been nice. But, enough of what I would have liked to. It was still a very good flick. And I will get it on DVD when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3 - a 'What if' movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first question that came to mind was 'Should I see it?' With no Jim Cameron it seemed a little pointless. However, I had to go have a look. Now that I have, I feel rather indifferent to it. T3 is a high-octane action movie, a great Saturday night popcorn film and lots of fun. And in that respect everything is OK. But next to the other two movies, this film isn't worthy of the Terminator history. T1 was a scary film for me, I saw it when I was still at school especially when Reece tells Sarah that the terminator won't stop till she is dead. T2 was incredible! It kept the essence of T1 without being effected by a bigger budget. These two films had intensity, excellent pacing and PRESENCE. T3 lacked all of these elements. When a terminator in T3 walked or stood and looked at something, you didn't feel their power, and the TX, unfortunately, wasn't intimidating and although the TX had more gadgets that any T model she still seemed inferior to the T1000. Above all else there was no emotional connection to any of the characters including Arnie. The story doesn't jibe that well with the other two films (Didn't Skynet need the Terminator CPU to become aware?) T3 dealt more with fate as where the time travel was a plot device in the other two films rather than a theory to be explored. That's why I will see this as a 'What if' film. A non-official look at what would have happened if everything went wrong. As far as I am concerned T2 ended the story. James Cameron's absence from the T3 production as a whole was more than noticeable(Act 1 blurred into act 2 and before you knew it - it was the end!). At the end of the day you should still see this film as a bit of entertainment, there's nothing wrong in that at least, and although Arnie looks older, his energy hasn't diminished one bit! 6 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one awesome movie. You get an 5 min. introduction to where we are, who's in it and then it all begins. The plot might be a little on the thinner side of what people might expect, but the action, funny antics, that only is possible in the movie because of what became cool in it's preceding movies. The whole strip club scene is hilarious. The new way they use the fact that Arnold is playing a robot also makes for some funny scenes. Then there is the fight scenes and the spectacular car chase. well just mind blowing action made Matrix style... you'll remember it even if you dont want to.This movie is nothing like T1 or T2 and it dose not really matter. T1&amp;T2 is history and they made this third chapter in such a manner that it dose not ruin anything of the past two. You can watch the first 2 and complete ignore the third because it begins a new story line of it's own. You can even watch the third movie without knowing much of the former two.The plot, characters etc may be in the low end of the scale... But dang it was entertaining to watch.. twice :Dblah blah bad English etc my opinion... :]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond and over the protection of John Connor plus Kate Brewster (his future fiancé and co-commander against cyborgs), the film makes clear how and why those machines become self-function to destroy all human rather than repeatedly leave it as the matter of the future and insisting on mad individual fighting as in the first two only. It is an intelligent script despite the last one already showing that the microchip has been destroyed. The film suggests the fact that disaster, tragedy, impact is never avoidable as long as we - human - keep raising our power competition through the destructive technology. Regarding the film content, what I'd like to summarize is it could be the boring repetition, if there is nothing new within it in which the traditional storyline is always used for the dynamic images and narrative for its fans. This is - probably - why the script was created with the emphasis on the new issues in addition to keeping its typical form and content of Terminator which is widely perceived.Further to this, whoever loves the first two made by Cameron may get disappointed with this one while I whose abhorrence towards those feel it is what I have been waiting for. Anyway, I love all of them.</fullReview>

There wasn't a lot of background for those who haven't seen the previous two, but if you have, you don't need it. This movie plays up to all the camp developed in the previous two movies and does it quite well. There are lines that might seem predictable but they are still very funny when delivered, as well as a few new destined-to-be-classics. The mass destruction is so over-the-top that you can't take it seriously, yet it's still exciting. I had a great time at this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Derivative action movie but perfectly entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have to say that I enjoyed T3. It was not a taught B-movie thriller like T1, or a faultless big budget sci-fi classic like T2, but it certainly entertained for 2 hours without getting boring. (I couldn't say the same of the other summer blockbuster I saw recently, "Hulk". I had to see that twice to check I wasn't imagining how BAD it was the first time.)***** contains mild SPOILERS ******T3 doesn't really bother trying to explain why Terminators even continue to exist post the seemingly "final" events of T2, instead it attempts to capture the audience's attention, with the promise of some impressive stunts, action sequences and effects (right from the opening shot of a nuclear detonation), and a large helping of "more of the same".It certainly delivers on more of the same, with some great action sequences (T-X driving the crane was particularly good), nice effects, and constant pursuit of John Connor by a particularly mean, seeming unstoppable (and this time not unattractive) machine (apologies to Robert Patrick!), which again is defeated in an ingenious manner.Where it fell down for me was:1) it lacked the originality of either of it's predecessors, both in terms of plot, and in terms of set pieces (I guess there are only so many ways a machine can bash another machine into a wall repeatedly, but Arnie shooting up loads of cops then do a "000" count of human victims? Surely we've seen that before!) 2) it had a few too many attempts at humour (that is how we spell "humor" it in England BTW), which I think robbed it of the tension of the earlier movies. For ever slice of "talk to the hand" genius, there was a dog line ("I'm back!" was easily the worst).But overall, it was more fun to watch than a lot of blockbusters I've seen recently. I'm not likely to hold my breath for the DVD, but i'd recommend seeing it, just don't expect to be blown away the way T2 would have done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 outdid itself with a winning combination of state-of-the-art special effects and dry humor. There wasn't a lot of background for those who haven't seen the previous two, but if you have, you don't need it. This movie plays up to all the camp developed in the previous two movies and does it quite well. There are lines that might seem predictable but they are still very funny when delivered, as well as a few new destined-to-be-classics. The mass destruction is so over-the-top that you can't take it seriously, yet it's still exciting. I had a great time at this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true TERMINATOR sequel. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I am not the greatest fan of TERMINATOR 2 - JUDGMENT DAY and felt it to be a good deal colder than the original film and one whose action seemed to be more calculated and lacking a little bit in suspense. The other factor which I thought counted against it was turning the Terminator into a good guy machine, which works in some ways, but doesn't in others.Like a lot of other people, I went into TERMINATOR 3 with some trepidation, as I didn't feel that a second sequel was warranted. The fact that a different director was on board also may have counted against it. Well, like everything in life, you can be proved wrong.TERMINATOR 3 is a far more satisfying film and one which returns to the root of the original film to provide a much more fulfilling experience and one that deserves to get the plaudits it has in recent weeks. The style and atmosphere of the film are a good deal more in keeping with the cinematography and design of the original film and director Jonathan Mostow has succeeded in doing with T3 what James Cameron did with ALIENS - making an equally satisfying follow-up film to a classy original.The plot is pretty much the same as the previous films - two warriors from the future come back in time to protect and kill respectively the future of the human race. This time, the enemy is a female Terminator (Kristanna Loken, for my money far more tasty and fetching to look at than Arnie, but then again, I am a red-blooded male who likes lovely and gorgeous women!!). The twist this time is that the target is not only John Connor (this time played by Nick Stahl), but an veterinary worker (Claire Danes) as well. Cue chases, morphing etc and a movie that provides what you would expect.Mostow's direction leans more towards his above-average road movie BREAKDOWN than U-571 and it is nice that a film relies more on story than CGI fx to wow the audience. One of the more enjoyable treats of the summer box-office of 2003.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right I'll say it now - the best was the first, the second best was Judgement day and this new installment finishes in last place. It lacks the dramatic impact, the cool, sophisticated direction or the "feel" of the last two movies. This doesn't however make this film bad, as it was rather entertaining, a lot better than The Matrix Reloaded, or any other films this year(except Whale Rider and Pirates of the ...). The action is pretty relentless, and well done, with great camera work, some pretty violent scenes (for a 12A) and great set pieces - the toilet scene between Arnie and Loken is great, perfect action scene - much better than the overblown rubbish seen in Matrix Reloaded. All of the action is tied together with great special effects, which, while not as stunning as T2 in its day, is great work. Highlights are Arnies face being smashed in, and Loken's character having all her metal come off.  Acting is good, especially from Nick Stahl, who did well to carry on the role of Furlongs John Conner. He plays it with great style and makes us feel that this character has a burden to carry. Claire Danes is okay as Conners girl, yet she lacks depth, and just seems to be shouting and screaming. Oh well. Arnie is really good, he plays the terminator role with ease, yet some scenes he seems to playing a parody of his formr roles as the machine. Also he isn't quite as well equipped in the one liners department, and seems to just get stuff from the prequels. Still overall, he is good, and really doesn't look his age! Lastly, Loken plays the bad guy in this movie, and although she is the worst "baddie" the series has seen (I'll say Arnies first role was the most menacing, T2 had the most cool), she still had lots of impressive tricks up her sleeve. Or cleveage. Her acting was good, menacing and brooding, just like a killing machine should be like. So far so good, good action scenes, consistent acting - whats missing? Other than James Cameron, whose flair is obviously lacking, it's the music. The great theme tune from the prequels is gone, which left me cold in some scenes, and the action scenes lacked some oomph because of this. The music, if included, would have made this movie a little better - more tense. Overall, a good action flick, not as good as the first two masterpieces, but a worthy addition to the series nonetheless. It seems to have been catered for the spoilt brats of the cinema going audience, as it's only a 12A, yet it still had some gruesome moments, and overall is very entertaining.8 out of 10PS Much better than Reloaded!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible subtle spoilers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I feel that Terminator 3 has nothing on the first two movies. However, it is deffinately one for fan boys. The one liners are better than in either of the first. The action sequences are far superior to any of that CG stuff in The Matrix. The plot is satisfactory. Kristanna Loken holds her own, and is deffinately the sexiest killer ever in film. Nick Stahl keeps the dull John Connor role alive. Claire Danes puts on a fairly good performance. Arnie..Well lets face it. Arnie is what we all came for. The Terminator is actually developing a sense of humour; "Speak to the hand!"For a film that has over 200 CGI shots, i was suprised at how little it retracted from the film. As with films such as The Matrix, Hulk, and Spy Kids 3-D, the CGI was not showcased. It simply served as an aid for unperformable stunts and special effects! Has Hollywood gone crazy!? I was shocked to find that ILM had actually tried to cover up their special effects, rather than force them down the audeience's throat.The film moves at a rapid pace, and simply puts the icing on the John Connor saga. The entire story is brought to a close. The T-101 finally reaches it optimal useage. I cannot see there being a T4, for the simple reason that there is nowhere else to take the story. Unless George Lucas gets hold of the rights. Then we will have a series of sequals that actually are prequals, about what is happening at the time of the machine war when the T-101, T-1000 and T-X are sent back in time. There would be three films. The first is when Karl Reece gets sent back, then when the human capture a T-101 and reprogramme it, and finally the birth of John's children. Lets hope not, ay.I think John Mostow was very brave for taking this on. He had alot of people to please, and i think he has done a pretty good job. Obviously the Terminator films would not be the same without Arnie, but Mostow has proved the he can make a good film, U-571 is forgiven.Cannot wait for the DVD, to see if they have any alternate endings. Did I mention that it is far better than The Matrix?9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big fan of the Terminator movies I was in awe of the possibility of a third installment. Although the chance of wrecking those other two great movies was evident I was quietly hoping for another one. As long as James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzeneger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong were involved and they could explain how the machines have made a come-back decently I would be happy. Two out of six just isn't good enough.Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is the biggest disappointment I think I'll ever have in my life. Let's face it we all knew when James Cameron didn't sign up it was going in the wrong direction. I just didn't realize HOW WRONG. The appointment of Jonathan Mostow as director wasn't exactly showing the studio were moving hell and high water to give this movie any sort of chance. Although I hear that the bigwigs cut Mr. Mostow's original T3 to shreds so maybe he isn't THAT bad. Then we hear that Edward Furlong has been forgotten as John Connor because of drug problems. Now I don't know about you but if I were in charge of a major franchise such as The Terminator, I would not change the face of the main character in the third movie. It just cheapens the movie so much and when you go and hire Nick Stahl, a guy who looks nothing like Edward Furlong then your going the right way for a wrong Terminator sequel. Maybe if the studio waited a few months and actually HELPED Edward out then this movie wouldn't be so fake to the real fans. Most of you will know that Sarah Connor isn't in this movie. I don't want to spoil this big surprise that you have already worked out but I'll just say it's a storyline that I would be expecting from a Sons &amp; Daughters TV soap episode, not a multi-million dollar budget action movie.Arnold Schwarzeneger makes his return as the terminator that we all love so dearly. He enters in that chaotic fashion as in the first two films in the big disco-ball thingy. Look at this scene and remember it as this is the last time you will have any sort of love for this movie. Up comes the "I need your clothes" scene. Humour they call it. I can't describe the pain I felt while watching this bit...You'll have to experience it for yourself. Arnold isn't the same here. In the other two movies he was believable and menacing. His acting is truelly dire here and his character doesn't have any connections with the other's at all. Where as in the second he was learning stuff and asking questions in this one he's just...there. Kristanna Loken. She is a mobile phone with legs and a flamethrower compared to the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Her part in the film makes no sense to me at all. Skynet would not think that if the next assassin they send out had boobs it would have any sort of advantage. No...the STUDIO thought that if they had a T-X with boobs they would pull in the male's who are guided by their "other organ" and maybe get a sponsorship deal with Kleenex Tissues when the DVD comes out. The T-X isn't menacing, it isn't scary nor is it big or clever. It's just...there. For your viewing pleasure. Please enjoy while I go throw up into a lucky-bag.Ah...John Connor. Living "off the grid". Now before this movie I was led to believe that he was trained ever since he was a small boy to be a huge commando leader type. Instead we have a puny, moany, cry-baby wuss who I would be able to terminate with an elastic band and a paper-clip. Nick Stahl isn't the same mould as Furlong. He doesn't have that same street cred or charm. He's just...there. Now the storyline between him and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) was pretty interesting but not enough to save this movie. All Claire Danes did in this movie was scream and look horrified. It isn't asking much and well...she delivered. Well done Claire! You have just shown you are able to do the two most useful things a female can do in a male-dominated movie world. Maybe you'll be in the next Scream sequel. *yawn*Now the special-effects were the main attraction of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I'm shure they will be passed off as the main attraction here as well. I just don't see why. The fight scenes were just unbelievable...in a bad way, and the car chase scene although a good idea could have been filmed A LOT better. To me it just isn't good enough. You need a good director, good actors and a good script. All three were atrocious here. People who love this movie will hold the storyline and the apocalyptic ending (yeah you know how it ends) as their two shining good-points. The storyline was pretty good but it sets itself up for a tire-some "I seen this coming a mile away!" ending that doesn't cut it. People have been ending their movies on notes like this for so long I was shure it wouldn't be a surprise to anybody. I haven't even mentioned the score being missing. You would not believe how much this film misses it. I was actually humming the tune to the start of the movie because it so obviously should have been there.Well to sum this movie up, I hated it with all my heart. They ruined the first two classics and have the sheer audacity to set themselves up for a fourth. Terminator fans will have to be given some sort of injection to let their grip be realised from the cinema-seats and the rest...well...they can just sit and enjoy their popcorn, the big explosions and the boobs like they are expected to.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen either of the first two movies at the cinema, I had to see this one, to make up for lost time. I don't think it is as good as the others, but it is as good as can be expected, considering the fact that the storyline had seemingly reached its end in 1991. There are some flat scenes, but these are far outnumbered by the terrific action sequences which make you just sit there in awe at the apparent real-life mayhem caused, particularly in the first set-piece, which must be one of the all-time great carnage spectacles, although I thought the crash in 'Final Destination 2' was pretty magnificent, too. Arnie is back with a vengeance, and somehow his acting, although still very much tongue in cheek, is quite good here. The grown-up John Connor is OK, and Claire Danes is adequately effective, if in the Ist Division to Linda Hamilton's Premier one. However, the main attraction here is the beautifully evil and totally believable Katrianna Loken. Her screen presence is enormous, and she acts with such confidence that it all seems perfectly plausible that the next high-tech generation of Terminators would be women...after all, they are taking over the world, aren't they? The film is worth seeing for the amazing stunts, and to marvel at KL's beauty, which, literally, knocks you out. As I said, if she's the Terminator, what a way to go...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard rumours that this movie wasn't that good so I was getting nervous when I sat down to watch it. I came out extremely satisfied that the movie was VERY good. I won't spoil the storyline but it is so open for a Terminator 4 at the end that I wouldn't be surprised if we see another addition to the series soon. Only problem with that is if they don't shoot the movie soon then Arnie would be too old. Back to the film. Although not as dark as the first Terminator movie, this brings alot of realism to the fact that we are in a nuclear age and the graphic reality of a possible nuclear war. I left the movie feeling happy with the special effects (but Arnie still can't act) but a bit depressed with the ever possible threat of, apart from Terminators running around, the severe threat of our own real life nuclear war. Let's face it the amount of computers that do control our defence systems in this country could always malfunction and any backup system to prevent this from happening could also go wrong as well. Depressed you yet????? Think about it........(Slight spoiler) The budget of this movie was amazing (I have forgotten the actual figure but I think it's around 170 million US dollars) and one can see where they blew alot of their cash, like the first chase scene with a fire truck and a large crane truck through the streets pursing John Connor. Wow that was good. I was expecting more T800's running around in an extended futuristic scene at the beginning and one can only hope that in T4 there will be. I had heard that there was about 10 minutes of T800's shooting at the beginning but T2 had more of that than this one so I was disappointed. I also feel that the UK cinema rating (BBFC) organization must of had a back hand deal from the movie studios to reduce the certification as it's "R" in the states and over here it's 12a. For non UK citizens this means that children under the age of 12 can attend to view but must be accompanied by an adult. (Spoiler) Well for those who have watched it, would you really want a 7 year old to see the scene in the cop car where the TX is controlling the steering wheel through the cops stomach that it just punched through??? Gross!!! This movie should have been a 15 in the UK and shame on the BBFC for not doing so. Watch this movie for serious Hollywood big budget special effect action and see just how depressing they leave the ending - T4 must be round the corner, hopefully Arnie won't be drawing his pension when they get around to shooting it. Make sure the cinema you view this film in has a great sound system as you will love all the explosions and bullets flying around you. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the last 5 minutes ( which are truly excellent ) this has to rank as one of the worst films ever. The first hour is simply t2 with an vastly inferior terminator to the T100 ( budget, morphing costs ). The first 2 movies had well crafted scripts. T3 simply jumps to &amp; from various set pieces leaving massive holes in the plot. Arnie almost places his role as a spoof of the original 2 movies, what where the sunglasses all about???The humour in the original 2 movies played heavily on the complete lack of emotions in a robot(cyborg) and was for the most part very dark.The hole idea around the terminator is that he's a ruthless killing machine ( who taught him not to kill HUMANS in this movie??????? )The movie was clearly aimed at a younger audience to boost revenue. It has all the hallmarks of action movies from past decade ( excessive reliance on gadgets )and is very much a late nineties take on the terminator. It plays very much like a straight to video sequel of a cinema hit ( see dusk till dawn 2&amp;3 )If you like modern chart music and get your kicks form Big Brother you'll love ever minutefor everyone else avoid....</fullReview>

I cannot believe that they did this to the Terminator series, the first film was awesome (easily the best) and the second was quite good for its time. This film feels like they just wanted to cash in on the 'sequels/trilogies' thing going on right now.Some of the special effects were okay, but once again poor C.G.I. (like Hulk) ruined what could of been a great film. None of these people should work in Hollywood again! If they do, don't let them anywhere near sequels/trilogies because they will ruin them, like they have done here.</fullReview>

I don't want to spoil this big surprise that you have already worked out but I'll just say it's a storyline that I would be expecting from a Sons &amp; Daughters TV soap episode, not a multi-million dollar budget action movie.Arnold Schwarzeneger makes his return as the terminator that we all love so dearly. He enters in that chaotic fashion as in the first two films in the big disco-ball thingy. Look at this scene and remember it as this is the last time you will have any sort of love for this movie. Up comes the "I need your clothes" scene. Humour they call it. I can't describe the pain I felt while watching this bit...You'll have to experience it for yourself. Arnold isn't the same here. In the other two movies he was believable and menacing. His acting is truelly dire here and his character doesn't have any connections with the other's at all. Where as in the second he was learning stuff and asking questions in this one he's just...there. Kristanna Loken. She is a mobile phone with legs and a flamethrower compared to the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Her part in the film makes no sense to me at all. Skynet would not think that if the next assassin they send out had boobs it would have any sort of advantage. No...the STUDIO thought that if they had a T-X with boobs they would pull in the male's who are guided by their "other organ" and maybe get a sponsorship deal with Kleenex Tissues when the DVD comes out. The T-X isn't menacing, it isn't scary nor is it big or clever. It's just...there. For your viewing pleasure. Please enjoy while I go throw up into a lucky-bag.Ah...John Connor. Living "off the grid". Now before this movie I was led to believe that he was trained ever since he was a small boy to be a huge commando leader type. Instead we have a puny, moany, cry-baby wuss who I would be able to terminate with an elastic band and a paper-clip. Nick Stahl isn't the same mould as Furlong. He doesn't have that same street cred or charm. He's just...there. Now the storyline between him and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) was pretty interesting but not enough to save this movie. All Claire Danes did in this movie was scream and look horrified. It isn't asking much and well...she delivered. Well done Claire! You have just shown you are able to do the two most useful things a female can do in a male-dominated movie world. Maybe you'll be in the next Scream sequel. *yawn*Now the special-effects were the main attraction of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I'm shure they will be passed off as the main attraction here as well. I just don't see why. The fight scenes were just unbelievable...in a bad way, and the car chase scene although a good idea could have been filmed A LOT better. To me it just isn't good enough. You need a good director, good actors and a good script. All three were atrocious here. People who love this movie will hold the storyline and the apocalyptic ending (yeah you know how it ends) as their two shining good-points. The storyline was pretty good but it sets itself up for a tire-some "I seen this coming a mile away!" ending that doesn't cut it. People have been ending their movies on notes like this for so long I was shure it wouldn't be a surprise to anybody. I haven't even mentioned the score being missing. You would not believe how much this film misses it. I was actually humming the tune to the start of the movie because it so obviously should have been there.Well to sum this movie up, I hated it with all my heart. They ruined the first two classics and have the sheer audacity to set themselves up for a fourth. Terminator fans will have to be given some sort of injection to let their grip be realised from the cinema-seats and the rest...well...they can just sit and enjoy their popcorn, the big explosions and the boobs like they are expected to.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How T3 continues the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of Terminator movies I went to see this movie in the first day is was released. I was really interested to see how such a difficult assignment as creating a new episode of legendary Terminator movies could be done.I remember that I was 14 when I saw the first Terminator movie. For me at that time it was one of the worst scary movies I had ever seen. The last scene when the terminator had only a metal skeleton remaining and it was chasing Sarah Connor in a factory was unforgettable. I don't remember ever being as horrified in a movie.Then at the age of 21 I saw the Terminator 2. That was another ultimate experience in a different way. It followed the dark atmosphere of the 1st Terminator but also showed an incredible action power in a movie that was never seen before. It was similar enough to the first Terminator but at the same time shocking in its own way. The "Arnold's jokes" in the movie became legendary.So, when I went to see this 3rd episode at the age of 32 I was really curious to see how filmmakers would be able to create another part of the very unique Terminators movies. Well, I try not not repeat all the comments that other people have already said here. It wasn't definitely a bad movie but the feeling I got was that it was too much just copying the nice characters and jokes from T2 and didn't have enough fresh ideas. Maybe only James Cameron would have had enough courage to make a completely new kind of film, copying enough from the previous parts but still creating something new. Now as it is, it left a slight feeling that producers just wanted to get profits with the old bullet proof movie format.If I say something concrete on the movie, I certainly liked the new sexy TX character and I have to say that she was so good that even that alone would be a good enough reason to watch this movie. I also liked the Skynet robots that started to rise in the end of the movie. That was slightly touching the atmosphere of the original movies. It was great to see how the judgment day really happened. I also liked Arnold still showing his best action in his 50's. John Connor's character was OK although too far away from the character in T2 to be reliable. The worst thing in the movie was the direction compared to other Terminator movies. Maybe it is just James Cameron's extraordinary skills that made a story flow in the previous episodes but this film seemed more like a row of separate sequences. It was too much repeating the same jokes as seen in T2 and in some sequences this movie was even trying to get cheap credits by making fun of T2 (which I hated).Well, compared to other movies I've seen recently this is certainly worth to watch. It partly feels like a cheap copy of the previous Terminators but at the same time it gives some enjoyable moments for all the true Terminator fans in a new decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a good Terminator fan-boy, I reacted with child-like excitement when I first heard that there would be a T3. That excitement soon turned to disappointment and eventually despair when I learned that James Cameron would not return to direct, and Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong would not reprise their roles as the Connors.But then the reviews started to come in, and I was given hope... but then I remembered feeling the same way about The Phantom Menace and coming out of the cinema feeling like a part of my life had just been stolen. So, I promised myself I would not give in to the hype. I would be prepared for a bad Terminator movie.I needn't have bothered! This film rocks!Okay, so it doesn't top the mind-bogglingly epic all round perfection of T2, but it's still a helluva film, and a worthy addition to the series. The story is a good one, and it fleshes out the Terminator universe in ways you might not expect. It also raises interesting questions about fate vs. determinism that my brain still hasn't fully digested (hey, I just got back from the cinema five minutes ago!), and which provide the perfect excuse to watch the old films just one more time...Nick Stahl is excellent as John Connor. In T2 we saw how Sarah had transformed from a fluffy pink girl into the action queen, hardened by the knowledge that she had to prepare John for Judgement Day. Well, time has had a different effect on her son. Haunted by nightmares of Judgement Day, living in denial about the events of T2, he is forever paranoid that one day the machines will come back for him. His fear has made him weak, and when Judgment Day comes, he doesn't feel ready. Stahl portrays this self-doubt brilliantly, while never leaving the audience in doubt that he really is the one who will lead the resistance.Claire Danes is also good as the woman who finds her life drawn into chaos, trying to make sense of the fact that this unfamiliar path is in fact her destiny. She has just the right balance of human frailty and future-heroine-badassness.Earl Boen makes a welcome cameo, though his role is really nothing more than an easter egg for Terminator geeks. The other supporting actors are good enough in their respective roles, but very little screen time is given to any minor characters.Kristianna Loken isn't nearly as menacing as Robert Patrick was, but then the film isn't really about the heroes vs. the T-X in the way that T1 and T2 were about the protagonists vs. Arnie and Robert Patrick respectively. Certainly, the film needed a Terminator that was different to the original two, and sequel logic dictates that she had to be more dangerous than either of them. She was, but she didn't scare the s**t out of me the way the other two did.Last, but certainly not least, the man himself. He said he'd be back, and he wasn't lying. Arnie's part is well written ? he is not the Terminator that was incinerated at the end of T2, and neither does he follow that Terminator's character arc. I was hoping for more to be made of the 'is he good or bad' plot device that was promised to us, but I guess there wasn't really room. Of course, it was great to have Arnie ? it wouldn't have been a Terminator movie without him ? but at times I felt he was playing the part for laughs, which felt wrong. Even though some of his lines were genuinely funny, I thought that Mostow should have resisted the temptation and kept the tone darker.Naturally, there will be die-hards who will refuse to accept that a new Terminator movie could possibly be anything other than sacrilege, but I would suggest they go see it anyway. The sooner they see it, the sooner the nostalgia will set in and they can feel about T3 the same as they feel about T2 and T1. (Let's face it, T2 was a completely different movie to T1, but we still love it, so give T3 a chance.) Jonathon Mostow has brought the series to a point that if T4 were made, it wouldn't even need a leading role for Arnie, provided that Stahl and Danes are available. (He would have to appear at some point, but as a bad guy. His statement to Connor 'We'll meet again' wasn't so much a promise as a future historical fact ? if you go see T3 you'll see what I mean about half way through.)And there should be a T4. Mostow has proved that even without Cameron, this is a franchise worth building on. (And let's face it, Jimbo seems to have lost his way lately anyway.) There is still a huge story to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3 Death of the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this turkey whit an open and virgin mind. I had managed to avoid all trailers and spoilers and had no preconceptions about the movie. This WAS an important movie and deserved my full first time reaction to it. Sadly this movie is Episode I&amp;II, Alien 4 and Robocop 3 all over again. Atypical Hollywood third act in a brilliant series UNTIL NOW! As you can read from the goofs page and see in the movie some one didn't do their home work and didn't pay attention on the set, reading the script and in editing! Mr. Mostow what have you got to say for your self? This is a pitiful sequel! The plot AND action are SO full of holes that you can use this as a fishing net. The future will agree whit the people who think this is scum. T3 will end up being the almost unmentioned third movie in the DVD box set. Most people will newer even take it out of the box. Why would you want to? Who wants to invite the guy that spoils the party? The premise promises a watch able movie, but the execution fall flat on its face. It manages to fly for about 45 minutes if you excuse the constant "action" bloopers that you are used to seeing in 80's action but this is T3 not Commando 2. All I can hope is that T4 is newer made and they release a dir.cut DVD whit 60 min of new footage (please omit 30 min from the end!) and 20 min of added length. There are only 2 good thins in T3 the new terminator, she is sexy and a nice "robot" and the nasty action in the beginning in the T1 style of "are you Sarah Connor? BANG!" They should have gotten Paul Verhoeven to direct...Please don't buy this DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when atmosphere is lost for mindless action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 had a great potential, but the hopes were just too high. After T2, doing something better would have been a titan's work. Mostow goes for the heavy action style, long car chase, big explosions...but somehow forgets to deliver the kind of atmosphere Cameron could. I do not revere Cameron as a god, but he was better at it than Mostow is.The evil Terminatrix is somehow silly. She has part liquid metal-part solid metal frame, and therefore can be broken just like old Arnie, but unlike THE Patrick's T1000. The machines must have employed a very uncompetent R&amp;D cyborg. Loken is OK, but does not give this "run as fast as you can I will catch you one day" attitude Robert Patrick or Arnie could give us. On the first moments of the action TX is already temporary down and needs to recompose itself...after having been run over by a car and burried under some blocks of concrete...tsktsktsk. Oh yes, and she can control other machines. Other cyborgs, robots or computers, I accept, but cars, trucks and vans, that's silly.Although I laughed at the jokes, they contributed to the loss of atmosphere. They were just too many, and too silly sometimes.If you accept that the story didn't end with T2 (I mean, even if I blew up Microsoft headquarters, put Bill Gates on a box full of C4, we would still see our PC invaded by Windows version 2024, right?), then T3 doesn't make too much nonsense. All they did in T2 was to delay Judgment Day. Ok, I accept that gladly. The end of T3 was quite nicely done and refreshingly surprising, before giving us a "see you in T4" final ending.An average to good action movie, but you have to forget how good was the first 2 movies. In fact, it could almost be a parody.I think Arnie was what put this movie so high in the hype. Arnie IS still in good shape after all. Shame the movie was not up to the quality of Arnie's last action!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it said Certificate 12A - I just knew that this was not going to impress me very much at all. I'm going to keep this brief and I would like to point out at this point that this is my opinion of the film.Terminator 1 &amp; 2 are timeless classics; violent and explosive with a very well thought out and deeply profound story at the heart driving it along - it is that mixture that made them classics. The effects were not over-done, they were charming for their simple look in T1, a look that was greatly complex at the time. The Terminator was cool, he was a monster and you could see why Sarah Connor was afraid of him.Terminator 3 is quite simply, a terrible sequel that spoils the Terminator series. When you start catering for the kids in the cinema then a movie like this loses all credibility and becomes exactly what this movie is - a 'Boom' movie. 'How many elements can we computerise in this movie without actually replacing human beings?' wonders Jonathan Mostow and the people on my hitlist who wrote it and forgot to include a decent story. Talk about grabbing at straws.This movie is NOT a Terminator movie. Cameron's vision and his masterpiece has been spoiled, defacated upon by these movie amateurs who quite obviously do not share that mans fastidiousness and need for perfection. People in the cinema were laughing - LAUGHING!!! Termintaor is not a comedy. And how many people does he Terminate? None!I think the T - X should not have been played by the girl; I think Robert Patrick should have been brought back to play the improved Termintor as he's got an evil and sinister look about him. Arnold - well it can't be done without him, but he needed some juicing up. This is NOT a Termintor movie as I said. This is a kids film with a bit of blood and should never have gone ahead.10 years or so in the making and the biggest disappointment since The Matrix Reloaded.No Story. No Termintor violence. Too much CG!Poor, guys. Very Poor!2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that's the only fault with the movie. There is a stack of rewatchable action but far too much of Arnie from the future knowing everything and so speaking the plot, and cue stupefied reactions from Danes and Stahl. Done last film, to excess, and so despite the top-notch action, this movie feels thin and Avid-edited to the bare bones.This is The Machines Strike Back and does the workmanlike setup job well- and the ending's very ballsy for a summer film. Then again none of the Terminator movies ended particularly happily.Please C2/Intermedia, get T4 going within the next five years and stop cheating the audience- give us the future war (and not just in dreams or flashbacks/flashforwards) which will round off the series nicely- even split it into two. Whatever happens, we can't be waiting another decade for it when the technology for the effects is here now. T4 cannot be yet another retread of T2, please.</fullReview>

He teams up with Kate Brewster (Clare Danes) who is also to have a key part in saving mankind's future, whilst Arnie comes back as a re-programmed terminator to defend them both.For fans of Episodes 1 and 2, Rise of the Machines fills in some necessary history, and does it well. For newcomers, this treat is no money-machine pap growing fat on the name of its predecessors: Terminator 3 is well scripted, well directed, and (as far as such one-dimensional characters require it) well acted. But the thing that really makes it is the excellent pacing and editing that keeps the suspense going through climax after climax. Of course it's still mainstream Hollywood - but, in the wake of so many brainless and nondescript CGI-overloads, this sequel stands and delivers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great second sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching T3 for the first time I thought I would write up my review.T3 kicks off with an introduction by John Conner describing the way he has lived his life since the last installment, this sets up the story without having to reintroduce his character. This allows the action to flow, and boy does it come at you non-stop, watch out for the street chase, unlike another film that I will not mention, the stunts were actually done for real. T1 was an awe-inspiring concept of a story and held no punches with the violence. T2 was an epical science fiction special/visual effects extravaganza. T3 tends to fall in between in terms of violence and visual/special effects with a hint more humour than T3, most of it blatant.The length of the film is shorter than its predecessor to ensure the film never lets up. The storyline is similar to T2 but has other elements added in to ensure that is also interesting.Overall it's a fantastic film in my opinion, it does differ to the other two installments, but this helps to ensure that things don't become stale, although it does fall slightly short of T2 but not much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It completely lacks the cool and sinister atmosphere from the first 2 episodes.Furthermore, the part where the little lady cries "Die you bitch" when the terminator was glued to the particle accelerator caused a lot of hilarity in the theater. The main characters are hardly convincing.The only person starring is miss Loken, being the only person to keep her mouth shut. (Apart from "I like your car/gun").Shame, this is just another action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not as good as T2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly let me start by saying "its about time they made a sequel to 1991's T2, which broke box office records for that year."In my heart, I always knew that nothing would compare to T2. T2 gives me goosebumps when I watch it, it makes me cry. Considering its extremley far fetched, it still has meaning and looks cool.Now T3, I'm not complaining. It was a good movie, enjoyable and the special effects were spectacular. HOwever, it didnt really feel as special as T2. It just seemed like a "movie" nothing extrodinary. In my view this kind of thing had been done before. Back in 1991, it was new fresh and exciting. Although its still exciting, its not new and fresh anymore and I was somewhat dissapointed.ON the other hand, it was good to see Arnie back again. And yes I really enjoyed the fact that the TX was a woman. A very attractive woman, i heard yelps and howls in the cinema when we saw her behind in the begining of the film.Nick Stahl and Claire Daines also do a good job and are believable in the characters that they play. But in my view they could have put them in better surroundings, instead of a small vet shop.The action started off tooo quick and didnt really give the chance for the audience to get to know some of the characters or how arnie exactly found thier location in the first place, he just sort of showed up.Furthermore, there isnt any emotion like there was in T2. Its just like the terminator was there and they didnt really develop any kind of relationship. All in all, i didnt really know what to expect when I went to see T3. I did know however, that it wouldnt have been as good as T2.I do recomend that you go and see it, you wont be dissapointed. But chances are you might enjoy the second sequel better than the third.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, why, why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review fresh from visiting my local multiplex, viewing the latest installment of the Terminator series "T3: Rise of the Machines". I am a huge fan of the first two films directed by James Cameron and can only feel sympathy for Jonothan Mostow in trying to fill those boots. But then I just ask why did he bother? Cameron wrapped the whole story up very well in the sad conclusion of T2, and I can see why he baulked at the opportunity of helming a second sequel. I can see it even more when he read the script for T3. You can only imagine the meeting. 'Hi Mr. Cameron we would like to look at our script for T3'. 'A script for T3. But that was my idea. I thought up the whole thing. Why are you making a sequel to something I ended so brilliantly the first time around?'. 'Yes Mr. Cameron, but there's going to be lots of special effects...and a big car chase...and, er'. This was the biggest problem, although The Terminator and T2 by genre are a horror and a action film respectively, Cameron did convey a convincing moral message about the future of humanity, in his storyline through the relationships of his central characters to one another. This was shown through Reece's love for Sarah Conner (which even transends time) and the most human trait of all being a mother's love for her son, between Sarah and her son John. Apposed to these very human relationships is the cold, destructive, emotionless machine, the Terminator. Unfortunatly these elements had been threwn out in the script for this film, and therefore nothing for the viewer to attach themselves too. As for the cast Arnie was dependably wooden as ever for the role of the T-101 (how he kept a straight face for some of the one liners IS amazing). I haven't seen much of Nick Stahl (played John Conner)before but he seemed wrong for the role (didn't seem to have the street smarts Ed Furlong had in T2) and Care Danes seemed to be confused as to what her role was supposed to be. The one saving grace of this film was Kristanna Loken as the T-X. She stole the film (don't the bad guys always do this?) and looked like she really relished the role, I thought she was a real jewel. Hats of again to ILM, who although not superceding anything the Matrix sequels have done (I'm assuming Matrix Revolutions will blow our socks off), they continue to impress. So overall, I thought T:3 was a bit of a waste of time, and Mr. Cameron will probably be sat smugly thinking 'I knew I was right all along!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bad bad movie, how can anyone say its the best film this year, or one of the best movies ever, or even better than T1 or T2???I'm sorry but I had to commentSome of the acting had me cringing, from Danes, Terminatrix and even Arnie, some of it really sticks in my mindAnd what was with the deliberate bad one liners from Arnie? jeezus, think of some new ones! They had me cringing, noticably (putting my hands over my head in disgrace), not to mention Arnie comming out of the stipping club with his "new shades" (youve been warned) it pained me to see what this film was doing to the other 2Obviously some people will be total suckers for it and think it's funny, but at the end of the day they have turned it into a cheesy kids version of T2, its disgusting. Right lets get this straight, T1, and T2 were serious films, thats what made them so great, T1 was a daaark film, its a masterpiece, T2 was just as good but managed to do it being a blockbuster aswell (and was also dark and serious), T3 aboloshes all of this with appaling acting, lame story, terrible one liners trying to be deliberatly funny, since when were they meant to be deliberatly funny??? Is Arnie trying to win the audience over? "Please like me again, pretty please" Argh its painfullAnd since when was Arnie worth $30 million for this? That has to be the easiest money in history, he did hardly anything in here to desrve it, it wasnt even acting he just muttered some lines in a terminator voice,Also, I did give a monkeys about Arnie and John Conner in T2, but why didnt I give a damn about em in this film? Bad acting, bad script? i dunnoIt certainly lacked a biiiiig something, James Cameron, thats whatOn the plus side, there was some good action, if thats what u want, but all in all I was very dissapointed, and I will laugh at people who say they like this cos they obviously dont know what a good film is, they obviously wont know what good acting is, or a good script,I am now mentally scarred.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUCH better than was expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key to T3 is not to go in with high expectations; think of it as it's going to be like "The Matrix Reloaded". The outcome, at least for me, was that I wasn't disappointed. It is a decent summer popcorn flick that lives up to its predecessors. It's definitely ten times better than the second Matrix in all aspects: storyline, special effects, acting. Yes, sure it could have been better; nevertheless T3 is probably the best action movie of this kind since the first Matrix.Arny was good in his role as hi was in the previous two installments. He was born for this role no doubt about it. The only thing that annoyed me was that he was "programmed" to talk too much. The creators of the movie should've found another way to explain what was happening. Maybe I'm wrong but it just felt a little bit more than was needed. Even the self-parodying lines were too many and not so cool. Moving on to Kristanna Loken (T-X) I'd say she tried her best to fill in the shoes of Robert Patrick who's gonna be remembered forever (whether he likes it or not) with his role in T2 as T-1000. The idea of a sexy terminatrices was a very good indeed, however due to writing limitations the character wasn't explored well enough which brings me to the second problem with this movie. T-X being much more sophisticated and tough to deal with after all was destroyed by our man so much easier than he did T-1000. And what was all this dismantling and screaming at the end. Anyway, I think the best acting came from Claire Danes probably the most convincing one. As I think again Nick Stahl performance was not bad at all. Actually the whole casting was pretty good as were the special effects. The CGI were kept to minimum which was good, very good ... sorry I am having again some flash backs from the CGI in the second Matrix - terrible. Let me get back to T3. I think I can't. I am too upset now.While T3 is not as original and memorable as T1 and T2 classics, it still manages to deliver what is set out to do- a high-budget, cold metal entertainment for the hot summer days. For all the fans of the "Terminator" franchise and for all those disappointed with the second Matrix and just for all of you out there I recommend this movie. The first group won't be disappointed, the second will be relieved and the third, well I just hope you like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the T3 flick a few weeks back and I have to say that it passed the action ratings barnone. As with the storyline, well, I can say that it couldn't have ended in any other way. (spoiler?) The effects were great but the CGI couldve been a bit more polished? Im not a big fan on CGI media especially when you can really tell that its CG. Unlike the fight scene in Matrix:Reloaded where Neo kicked ass in the park. That CG was wayyyyy too unrealalistic.The big disappointment was the script though. You'll find the Terminator to say some sharp remarks more now than previous movies. Too much "I'll be back", "She'll be back", "He'll be back", "I'm back", "We're back"... get on with the movie will you?!Arnold was the great Terminator again and to be honest he looks better now than he was in T2. Although I dont think machines are supposed to age...Rating: 8 1/2 of 100 = MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must preface this review with saying I was never a big fan of the Terminator franchise. That being said, the movie was terrible. I knew going into it that it wasn't going to be the next Citizen Cane, but this movie was missing many fundamental features of a movie. First they relied way to heavily on the prior movies explaining this one. Unless you watched the first two, the movie didn't make much sense. I think Velveeta made this movie, because it was cheesy. All of the silly cliché catch phrases made me wonder if it was on purposed to mock itself or mock us. Arnold should be ashamed of himself for even uttering some of those lines. There was no real plot development; it was more like one giant chase scene(which was very cool). I mean if that's what you're interested in.... That brings us to the end of the movie. It was like a cliff, it just stopped short. And that was quite a romance at the end too. How many guys have heard the phrase `not if you were the last guy on earth,' while trying to pick up chicks. Who would ever thought one of us would actually have to worry about that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold, I am able to remember way back in your career when many saw you as just another idiotic hero who couldn't speak intelligible English, a poor man's Sylvester Stallone, some called you. But your films appealed to me as a child for their raw violence, macho bravado, and the fact that in a supposed democracy, even a man whose only outstanding attribute was his biceps could make it big.Unfortunately, you seemed to forget something around the mid-1990s, namely that your primary audience was young men who loved nothing more than the thrill of seeing how hard you could hit an enemy, or how creatively you could come up with a smart remark after creatively dispatching him. Instead, you began pushing this choice-removing agenda and making your films as family-friendly or ham-fistedly political as possible. The 6th Day is a good example of this - I am one of the millions of people whose life could be substantially improved by the cloning of singular cells.Terminator 3 has me asking how much further you are going to turn your back on the things that made you a star. Few of the things done in this film to protect John Connor or Kate Brewster make any sense, and even fewer manage to satisfy the audience. Do you honestly think that not killing a singular person in this film somehow erases the ultra-conservative's stigma that you've killed more on-screen bad guys than any other actor in Hollywood?But to get away from knocking Arnold and his lack of respect for the audience mindest that made him one of the richest actors in Hollywood for a moment, he isn't the only one showing a profound lack of respect here. The screenwriters in this turkey quite obviously read half of the scripts for Terminators 1 and 2, then thought to themselves "wheee, I can do that!". Unfortunately, Confucious hit the nail on the head when he said that when you only read half of the sentence, you lose all the meaning. Terminators 1 and 2 were famous for pushing how far one could take violence in a film that is approved for teen viewing, but they also had a certain intelligence and moral to the story. Terminator 1 in particular showed us that even the most timid, seemingly useless person can rise to be a king (or rather queen) when given the right circumstances. Not because it is their destiny, or even because they are pushed in that direction, but because they have the good in them to make the right choice at the right time.Terminator 3 ditches everything the other two films told us about how our lives are not dictated or set to a script. Instead, we are told that Judgement Day is inevitable, and that we will kill ourselves for our own feelings of insecurity, no matter what. That's strike number one against the script. The next fatal error is to tell us that Skynet was no physical system at all, but rather a sentient program that is capable of writing its own digital virii to manipulate enemies to its will. Can you hear the screenwriting committee say "hey, we need to make this story more MODERN, more NOW"? Remember when Madonna said that about the theme for Advertise Another Day, and what happened after that? Sometimes "modern" and "good" are two seperate things, guys.The third strike against Terminator 3 lies in the cinematography. Granted, it's a real challenge to be compared to James Cameron and the people he likes to work with in this department. After all, he is the only director who knows how to compose a scene on Super 35 negative that looks the same no matter what ratio you frame it in. But even directors who use Super 35 and quite apparently don't know how to do this, such as David Fincher, can make films that are more pleasant to look at than this. Doesn't anyone know yet that the thing that made Terminator 1 in particular shine was that sheer mayhem was going on in front of the camera (cars going through front walls for instance), but the camera stayed as still as an oak so that one could see exactly what was going on? Well, in Terminator 3, Jonathan Mostow resorts to the tactic of wobbling the camera to keep us confused as to what is going on during key action sequences. Put simply, this is not good enough.I won't get into all the continuity issues between this and the other two films in there series, but I will get into one issue. When Terminator 2 wrapped (and Arnold still had a career), James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd called it the final chapter in the story. As in that's it, we won't be coming back to this again, we'd rather be CREATIVE. Well, fast forward ab out ten years, and Arnold's career is tanking because he has turned his back on what made him a star in the first place. So he goes to James Cameron and moans "puh-lease writer another Terminator so I can keep making films". Cameron told him where to go, but conveniently, Mostow stepped in and said "yeah sure, we'll have a good time wiping our butts on the film that made you the big star you once were".In short, to the writers of this pungent turd, I say shame on you for dragging cinema even further down into the "dumbest buy the mostest" philosophy that the summer blockbuster has been driven by for the last ten years (and yet they say ticket sales are slumping... gee, wonder why). To Arnold, I have the following to say. You are a sell-out, a hypocrite, and you are washed-up. You might call that statement cruel, but hopefully someone will read it to you and you will realise why the same people who made your career sparkle in the 1980s are turning their back on you. Until at least that happens, there is no hope for the intelligent action film. If Terminator 3 proves nothing else, it certainly proves that.On the plus side, however, it wasn't nearly as bad as the committee-butchered Alien 3 that made it into cinemas, but it does stand alongside it as an example of an unnecessary installment in a franchise being slung out to make a quick buck. Both of these films have received a very generous four out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came out of this movie with mixed emotions. The special effects were good, the chases were tense and the backstory of this new Terminator's relationship with John Connor was clever. Still, there was a fatalism throughout the movie that reduced the impact of the ending. The movie essentially says to us, "This is the way things will turn out...things are turning out as I predicted...I was right, this was the way turned out." Not only does this ruin suspense, but it also means that whenever someone dies in the picture, instead of pitying the dead, we shrug and move on. It alienates us from the movie and its characters when we want to feel close, and by the end my reaction to the story paralleled that of the kid in The Princess Bride who screams, "Jeez, grampa, why did you want to tell me this story!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing; Shocking Lack of Originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see T3, just watch T2 again and then add on five minutes worth of plot mythology development. Basically, T3 seems to exist to make money, instead of make money and take us meaningfully forward in the Terminator franchise. Let's see ... Terminator sent back in time to kill John Connor (and a few others, given lip service but no meaning)? Check. Other Terminator (older model) sent back to protect Connor? Check. War between humans and self-aware machines coming? Check. Car chases involving big, destructive trucks? Check. Bar scene where naked Terminator gets clothes? Check. Organization that will unwittingly allow self-aware machines to control nuclear weapons? Check.I mean, what was new? Very little. A minor philosophy change involving fate (Sarah Connor turns out to be wrong after all). A very brief bit of reprogramming that causes a good guy to be a bad guy for a few minutes. Even the fancy new Terminator is very similar to the new one in T2. It has an additional weapons ability and one minor wrinkle where it can control machines, but really, who ever thought a Terminator couldn't do that?That's just the beginning. This movie raises many questions about its own story. For instance, if it is so easy for the machines and humans to send machines back in time, how can this ever end? Why not send a Terminator back to 1961 and kill Sarah Connor as a child? Or kill her parents back in 1930? The franchise really needs to point out that this process is terribly difficult and limited.Also, John Connor knows how he will die. So now that he knows, why can't he prevent it? It's not like it is a random bomb. There is a very specific set of actions that must occur for Connor to die, and Connor himself must OK one of them. So why would he ever do it?T3 is very disappointing, and one of the most crass cash grabs I have ever seen from Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 revamps the legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to get excited about here folks but first let me start by saying right off the bat, this aint Terminator 2 (T2), nor does it come close. Well there are moments but what are sheer moments when you have an entire film, right? T2 is both a stroke of sci-fi and action splendour. There are not many films, old or new, that can match its ferocity and grandeur.Most of the films success must surely be credited to director Jonathan Mostow. You ought to feel so small coming up against a giant like this. His direction was superb. That includes the nicely choreographed action scenes that dominate from start to finish in the relatively short running time. The soon-to-be-famous demolition crane scene elatedly swept me back to the days of T2 and the strength of that film. Though being several years in transition (twelve years to be precise) Arnie is still in top gear. It is as though he was made for these films, robots suite his range as an actor quite perfectly.Score: 3 out of 5, Matt Noske</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh great, flying robot gunships and robot half-tracks. Is this "Star Wars"? And the Terminator battling for his own soul scene was old when Spock used to do it in '60s on "Star Trek". The second half of T3 is as mis-directed as the Terminatix's mission, which keeps changing. Besides the hoary cliche scene where the Terminator is wrestling for his soul, there are several scenes where you can sense the movie go off track: 1) In T2, during the "Hasta la vista" scene, the T-1000 begins to reform right before his prey, heightening their horror. But in T3, when Stahl and Danes have impaled and they assume left for dead the Terminatrix on the supermagnet, they are long gone on some other adventure by the time she begins to free herself. 2) Why does she need a gun to kill her victims when she can shoot electrical bolts? 3) How do the heavily-armed Terminator and the kids enter the secret Air Force base? How does the Terminatrix?So much is left unexplained, in comparison to T2, in which you get to see how the T-1000 stalked its prey. But in T3, the Terminatrix just disappears from the screen for long stretches of talk about "man's destiny" blah, blah. In T3, she and all characters just show up whenever they're needed, miraculously!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 is a great movie. In a way, it's everything a great action movie should be and nothing it shouldn't. It contains some good-ol' fashioned action movie elements like car-chases, explosions, combat scenes, etc. It also contains the mandatory odd humour and romantic undertones. However, just like with any action movie, there are flaws, and since this is a sequel to one of the best action movies of all time, these flaws are perhaps more serious.In all honesty, a third Terminator film should never have been made, even IF James Cameron came on board again.

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 revamps the legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to get excited about here folks but first let me start by saying right off the bat, this aint Terminator 2 (T2), nor does it come close. Well there are moments but what are sheer moments when you have an entire film, right? T2 is both a stroke of sci-fi and action splendour. There are not many films, old or new, that can match its ferocity and grandeur.Most of the films success must surely be credited to director Jonathan Mostow. You ought to feel so small coming up against a giant like this. His direction was superb. That includes the nicely choreographed action scenes that dominate from start to finish in the relatively short running time. The soon-to-be-famous demolition crane scene elatedly swept me back to the days of T2 and the strength of that film. Though being several years in transition (twelve years to be precise) Arnie is still in top gear. It is as though he was made for these films, robots suite his range as an actor quite perfectly.Score: 3 out of 5, Matt Noske</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 is a great movie. In a way, it's everything a great action movie should be and nothing it shouldn't. It contains some good-ol' fashioned action movie elements like car-chases, explosions, combat scenes, etc. It also contains the mandatory odd humour and romantic undertones. However, just like with any action movie, there are flaws, and since this is a sequel to one of the best action movies of all time, these flaws are perhaps more serious.In all honesty, a third Terminator film should never have been made, even IF James Cameron came on board again. T2 pretty much wrapped things up as Cyberdyne was destroyed, thus eliminating any chance of a machine-dominated future. The plot of T3 makes T2's plot null-and-void.

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Of 2003 And By A Land Slide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the garbage I've seen this summer (The Matrix Reloaded, Hulk, and X-Men 2), I was glad to finally see a good movie (Terminator 3). Not only was Terminator 3 good, it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story was great, the Terminatrix was awesome (better then the T-100), the action was intense, the ending was perfect, and Arnold was funny as hell.Terminator 3 is by far the best movie of 2003 and it will still be the best movie of 2003 when the year is over. Even Return Of The King won't beat it and Return Of The King is sure to be one of the best movies ever made.There was one thing missing from Terminator 3 and that was the Terminator music. It was played during the end credits but who know why they left it out during the entire movie. If Terminator 3 has the Terminator music, I would actually say that Terminator 3 was perfect. Getting over this minor fault, Terminator 3 easily made it on to my top 10 movies of all time list. This is saying a lot since 8 out of the other 9 of them are from the 80's or earlier.As much as I love Terminator 3, Terminator 2 is slightly better. Terminator 2 makes it one place higher then Terminator 3 on my top 10 movies of all time list. This is due to it being a longer movie and having the Terminator music played quite a few time through out it. Neither one of these things is a big deal but it helped me decide which movie I liked better.If you haven't seen Terminator 3 already then do yourself a favor and see it right away. If you have seen Terminator 3 and didn't like it then see it again because you obviously missed something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good continuation of the saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Terminator 3 thoroughly entertaining. I was expecting a decent amount of action and suspense and the film delivered solidly. It was very easy to suspend disbelief and let myself get swept on the frenetically paced journey.Arold looks excellent for 55. He appears to revel in this role and delivers his lines faultlessly. He probably won't be playing a Terminator again, so it's great to see him go out on a high.Nick Stahl makes an interesting and sympathetic John Conner while Claire Danes is given a good strong female role definitely reminiscent of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Conner from the first Terminator. As for Kristanna Loken ? she's cool, pretty and nasty.There are heaps of excellent effects and stunts. Once street chase action sequence involving heavy commercial vehicles threatens to take focus away from the story, but ends just before it starts to outlast its welcome.There's nothing brain challenging in T3, and there are a couple of scenes which just don't make perfect logical sense. But the central focus of T3 is not to create high art, it's to create good, slick entertainment. T3 moves at such a fast pace I didn't think about any faults or logic problems until after the final credits. Very smart direction.The only flat bit for me occurred when a character from the previous Terminator films was discussed by Claire and Nick. Too saccharine for my tastes.T3 leaves more than enough room for at least one more sequel (I only hope we don't have to wait another decade). But although the ending is very, very open, I left the cinema feeling greatly satisfied and exhilarated rather than ripped off, as I have felt after viewing some other episodic movies.Best viewed whilst munching on a huge bucket of extra buttered popcorn. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable addition to the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is an enjoyable action film with Arnie looking as good as ever as the Terminator. It's a little disappointing that the film makers couldn't develop the female T-X a little beyond the enemy of the second film, although she can form weapons with her arms she is for all intents and purpose a female T-3000. If I wanted to delve into the flaws of the film I could argue that Arnie's constant insistance that he's a machine with no emotion is undermined near the end by his apparent fight with conscience as he trys to overcome his "evil" programming at the hands of the TX. All in all though as an addition to the series it's pure fun with all the dark forboding that earlier installments indicated e.g. the end of the world as we know it !! ENJOY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My heart goes out to James Cameron. I'm pretty sure he had no control as to whether or not this film would get made. If did have any degree of control then he wouldn't have let this sort of thing happen!There was never any creative call for a third film (unless, perhaps, we have a prequel giving us a run down of events prior to Reese getting sent back, but that's stretching it a bit). It's a pity that such an obvious business decision has reduced a sci-fi classic to a mediocre TV movie (resplendent with terrible acting, a horrible plot and bland characters).Like the latter Jaws films, however, the original only gets stronger with every terrible sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**"T-3" is a straightforward picture, setting the stage in the opening twenty minutes, then propelling its characters into what is basically a chase movie for the final hour and a half. Sound familiar? Well, why mess with success? Although it may sound boring and routine, the movie is neither. The script and pacing are both tight and constantly in motion, leaving no time for boredom.The plot of "T-3" is pretty much the same as that of its predecessors. The machines have sent a new and improved terminator, in this case a stunning T-X played by the smokin' Kristanna Loken, back in time from the future to kill someone who will eventually lead the humans in their fight against the machines. Naturally the humans also managed to sneak back their own terminator, albeit an older model, the T-800. This is of course Arnold Schwarzenegger (although not the same robot as in T-2), and he must prevent the T-X from accomplishing her mission.What separates "T-3" from lighter summer fare such as "Pirates" or "The Italian Job" is the effective philosophy. While not quite up to the high standard of "T-2" or "The Matrix", it still churns the mind with its issues of fate and time travel. Go ahead, try to completely figure out how a machine from the future can go back in time to affect events that ultimately create the machine itself. Despite the density, every event that takes place makes perfect sense both within the movie and within the trilogy.Schwarzenegger is once again at his best, as the simple-minded and stoic T-800. He slides easily back into the character, and even at age 56 is still a perfect physical and vocal fit. Some say that the role doesn't demand much of Arnold, but perhaps he does it so effortlessly that we don't notice. Either way, seeing him back at the top of his acting game is a pleasure, after such mediocre fare as "Collateral Damage" and "The 6th Day".Nick Stahl, no longer "In the Bedroom", fits into the part of a twenty-something John Connor with ease. He provides Connor with the proper world-weariness and gives him grounded logic and street smarts that befit someone who has grown up under his unusual circumstances.Loken, much like Robert Patrick in the second movie, doesn't get to display much versatility, but her icily gorgeous eyes and facial features combine with appropriate body movements to supply the T-X with a chilly and imposing aura. She's not quite as fearsome as Patrick, perhaps because she's female; but her character's unstoppable nature is enough to compensate for that.Claire Danes, in a role that one might not expect to find her, is Kate Brewster. She happens upon Connor at her veterinary clinic, and is properly naive, much like Neo in "The Matrix", as she gets sucked into the tidal wave of action and adventure. The rest of the actors, in mostly little-developed parts, are sufficient to round out the cast.The comedy in "T-3" was an unexpected enjoyment. Much of it was derived from Schwarzenegger's machine mind failing to comprehend various aspects of humanity, verbal and otherwise. Arnold's classic monotone delivery is perfect, both in tone and timing. Other comedic sources included a number of references to the prior films. Some are obvious ("She'll be back"); some are less so (the reappearing shrink). But they are all amusing, providing necessary comic relief for a movie that could easily have been overbearing and overly serious. One other amusing theme is the one-upmanship involved in various stunts and chase scenes. Things just keep getting bigger, and I couldn't help but laugh. "T-3" wasn't bust-a-gut funny, but it consistently induced chuckling from the audience in a number of ways.One of the joys of "T-3" is the physicality of the stunt and fight sequences. Because of the virtual immortality of the two terminators, brutal acts of violence are necessary when fighting them, acts that can't be done to normal humans. There's something painfully (sadistically?) enjoyable about watching someone bashing a foe with a just-ripped-off-the-wall urinal, or seeing a truck slam straight into a building. I found myself constantly wincing, but also grinning at the same time. Seeing someone get the crap beat out of them while knowing the characters won't actually be injured is surprisingly, perhaps frighteningly, engrossing. Additionally, those scenes appear to be mostly stuntwork, not CGI. Contrasting the highway chase scene in "Matrix Reloaded", which is gloriously sleek and jaw-dropping, the car chase in "T-3" is brutal and punishing. In a cinematic time that favors heavy reliance on computer imagery, that honest physicality in stuntwork is extremely refreshing.This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, preferably one with a high quality surround sound system. The theater I patronized was unfortunately lacking in the aural department, as the audio was front-heavy. But I still appreciated the sound. Without being overly loud, the sound effects did their job quite well, providing the proper noises at the proper times. The score was not very noticeable, which means that composer Marco Beltrami did his job suitably. Somewhat surprisingly, the recognizable Terminator theme of Brad Fiedel did not surface until the end of the movie (unless I missed it).The other reason I recommend the theater experience is the bigness of the flick. Like its prequels, "T-3" is simply a large movie. Arnold is big; various vehicles are big; themes are big; everything is done on a grand scale. Plus the picture looks good. With machines as a primary subject, the film is conducive to a slick appearance, and cinematographer Don Burgess ("Cast Away", "Bourne Identity") delivers a gleaming final cut.If you haven't seen the first two renditions, you'll definitely miss out on some of the jokes, and won't have a full understanding of everything discussed, but you can still enjoy the film. I recommend seeing the other two first, but it's not entirely necessary. The presence of Kate, also a newbie to the world of terminators, allows John Connor and the T-800 to explain much of the backstory without seeming dry. Taking a cue from the original, most of the exposition wisely occurs on the run, so it doesn't slow the movie down, but rather fills in the blanks of the plot while still moving forward.Not comparing "T-3" to its predecessors is impossible. This one isn't quite as cultish as the first, nor as dark or ground-breaking as the second. However "T-3" is still a thoroughly worthy and engaging finale (?) to the series.Bottom Line: The issue of fate combined with the spectacular action sequences make this an above average flick. Terminator fans should be pleased too. Worth a big screen viewing and surprisingly enjoyable. Three of four stars for now. Maybe more as it grows on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where will they go next?At the time of writing, T3 has more than made up for its mammoth budget - eclipsing even the record-setting part 2, thanks largely to a reported 30M salary for its leading man - with a considerable box office. It won't be long before the vultures pull at the carcass and find enough sustenance for a part 4, 5 and beyond... But back to 3.The Austrian Oak was in dire need of a hit in the early Naughties, and for many, reviving this particular franchise - if two films constitute a franchise that is - smelled of desperation: haven't we mined this story's potential to the core already? And what of creator James Cameron's complete lack of interest? When your main champion prefers to go deep-sea diving than having anything to do with you, you must have done something wrong...Terminator 3 raised many questions, first of which was: is this even necessary? The truth is: now that it is here, imperfect beast that it is, it is essential. For one, it cleans up narrative issues raised in part two's time travel paradoxes (if you pay attention, Skynet created itself). It also asks interesting questions about choice vs fate, and ends in what is possibly the series most arresting visual moment. It also embraces its throwback nature, not just in accepting its aging star's limitations but in incorporating them to the story, but in its brutal, real action choreography, chiefly a nasty crane-equipped car chase that puts even the computer wizardry of Matrix Reloaded to shame. At the same time, T3 allows itself to partly spoof the original, a point of contention for many, but a refreshingly sober thing for a sequel to do in this day when follow-ups, for some reason, always have to aim for darker (see Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean).Of course, not all is perfect: after Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl is a somewhat uninspiring John Connor, and Claire Danes is given surprisingly little to do. The worst let-down, though there is interesting conceptual work at play there, is the new antagonist, dubbed the Terminatrix by a mocking audience. There is no doubt that after Robert Patrick's glacial T1000, this is a disappointment, and something more chilling, such as a worrying fusing of human and machine, would been not just more interesting, but frighteningly prophetic, a key trait of the saga as a whole. But when Arnold appears on-screen again, a lot is forgotten and more is forgiven.The first two Terminator films are solid 10s, so by that measure this can't compare, and yet, after the disappointing Hulk and the over-hyped and overindulgent Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3 may also well be the most entertaining blockbuster you see this Summer.Nowhere near as good or as clever as its predecessors, but good fun nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess you either love it or hate it ... I'm not a BIG Terminator/Arnie/Clare Danes fan- I enjoyed T2 (didn't actually see T1), but I thought this movie was put together really well. Whilst the focus in T2 was the relationship between the terminator and John, in this movie it was between John And Kate. And to give the actors their dues - I thought Clare played her role really well, she didn't take anything lying down, and she and Nick had a good connection on screen. Spoilers ...I thought she played the role of a future resistance fighter, who is having her life turned upside down, all in one day really well - hell who wouldn't scream, yell and fight back after having your clinic blown up and being chucked in the back of your truck - by two men, one of whom you knew disappeared 10 years ago in dubious circumstances. Nick was great as John Conner, wanting to believe that judgment day is not coming, trying to be optimistic, but never fully letting go of the darker future - I thought he was played with a guarded wariness that seemed to suit the situation. He fought the future, right up until the last moment when he turned off the explosive device.I thought the play on making our own fate and the future being inevitable really interesting. Yes, yes, there are some problems with the time lines - but hey, ITS A MOVIE - enjoy it for what it is .. entertainment, special FX, and interesting storyline. Everyone I've spoken to have enjoyed the movie and I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember T2? , Arnie CSM-801 (Cyberdyne Systems Model 801) says to Miles Dyson that no-one must follow his work, so Dyson drops a piece of the "chip" on the detonator and the Cyberdyne Systems building blows up. The T-1000, The Terminator and John Connor would have dissappeared before Sarah Connor's eyes and the building she was in would have instantly changed to a shopping mall, carpark anything.(Like in "Back to the Future 2" when Marty &amp; Doc leave his girlfriend behind, Marty wants to go pick her up, but Doc says we don't need to as the timeline will change around her.) So Mr Cameron didn't tell us or Miles Dyson that the Hi-Tech chip from the first "Terminator" was sent to Miltary Intelligence, when they finished with it they sent it back to Cyberdyne Systems. Cue T2,Young Tech;"Where did it come from?" Miles Dyson"You know I asked once, know what they said?,Don't ask."(You could take that comment from Dyson that the "chip" and "Arm" came from anywhere, let alone from a hydraulic press from inside Cyberdyne.) The "chips" the military made would have been stamped CSM because they (CSM) still owned rights to the design and the US miltary do not want a lawsuit over it. So the timeline continues, the T-1000 chases the T-801,Sarah and John into the steel-mill then a delayed Judgment Day, the war against machines will happen, they lose so they try time travel to wipe **SPOILER**out Sarah Connor, then John, now his Commanders. If they CSM-101, T-1000, T-X succeed the machines will rule the planet, if not the humans will have their freedom back, but in a desolate wasteland 2029A.D.Terminator 3 is ok, but I missed Brad Fiedel's score during the film. In T2 when John is chased by the T-1000 in that big black tow-truck, you've got a mixture of truck/harley/dirt-bike/shotgun but it's that pumping music that Fiedel does so well it's like musical kinetic energy. If only Fiedel was allowed to score the pick-up truck, crane truck chase it would have raised adrenaline levels as it did in T2.Weapon Systems; T-801 has to find guns, T-1000 knives and stabbing weapons, T-X has a multi-purpose gun built-into arm. Some comments say that the T-1000 is better than the T-X and that the T-801 is to old, seriously if this were real, it doesn't matter which one is after you, If you get caught its game over. T3 on the whole was a blast to watch and I will go see it again.T3 ended leaving it all set up for the Future War against the Machines, so how long till T4 turns up at the theatre?</fullReview>

However, I was extremely saddened as I sat through T3; a typically bad 'sequel film' with a lousy story line, actors going through their paces with little conviction and depending largely upon the success of the original two movies. Virtually all of the effects and action were a rerun from T2. In every respect, one of the poorest and most disappointing movies I have ever watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bottom line: while not as epically cast as 'Terminator 2' nor as low-budget gritty as the original 'Terminator,' 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' delivers precisely what it set out to do -- create high-budget kinetic fun with characters by now so familiar that dialogue is rarely ever necessary -- which is much much more than one can say about almost every other film this summer. (The exceptions, of course, are 'X2,' 'Finding Nemo' and '28 Days Later.') Der Arnold fits his role like finely-cut body-built hand to black- leather glove, and new-to-the-series director Jonathan Mostow injects a very welcome sense of knowing humor into the proceedings. Meanwhile, somehow Nick Stahl and Claire Danes manage to not only avoid the curse of the young-pretty-talented-actor- cast-in-overwhelming-Hollywood-spectacle, but actually ELEVATE the film with their subtle, emotionally grounded performances.8/10</fullReview>

Someone had remarked, in another review, that Loken, as the TX, wasn't as threatening as Robert Patrick(T-1000) and Arnold, and I have to agree with that. While she did have some interesting new weaponry and capabilities and her fight scenes with Arnold were cool, Patrick was definitely more menacing as the T-1000.Overall, I'd say go see it. Makes me wonder if the third installment will have a type of Terminator reunion with both the T-1000 and the TX hot after John Connor and Kate Brewster.:o</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TX not ominous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The deck is stacked a little too much in Arnolds favor in this movie, by that I mean he kicks a little too much butt. In T2 the T1000 is clearly superior to Arnold and the hero's spend most of the movie running from it, rightly so, and Arnold gets his nads handed to him every time they meet.However in this movie Arnold should be even more inferior to the TX, but he is constantly on the offensive, attacking her aggressively and beating her without too much trouble on every occasion. I never felt like Arnold was in any peril at the hands of the TX, all she seemed able to do was hit him with cars and ram his head into walls.Bottom line, the T1000 in T2 was a million times more dangerous, the TX is just another lame robot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat watching this movie I had an inescapable sense of deja vu. All I could think was, "I've seen this movie before." And the truth is I have, only when I saw it the first time they called it 'Terminator 2'. The "liquid metal" terminator? Bad one liners from Ah-nuld? They even reshot some scenes from T2. Such as the classic Arnold clearing an area of police vehicles then doing a scan to compute how many casualties he's caused. (0%)The TX seemed to be doing her best to mimic Robert Patrick's T-1000, and that too is part of the problem. I know the T-1000. I've spent years studying the T-1000. Dear, you are no T-1000. You'd think that since she's supposed to be even more advanced than the T-1000 SkyNet would have been able to make her less "robotic" in her movements and speech. Hell, the way they look at you with glazed, steely eyes you wouldn't need dogs to detect them.All in all the movie proved to be a big disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as good as t1 or t2 but still overpassed my expectations, thinking that this is the 3rd movie in the series and James cameron wasnt directing it i was expecting a blow out, but i got the opposite, i didnt get what i got from the prior films ( got u thinkin bout how the world will end) but i got a great action film and lots of comic relief. The ending was great but although pretty cheesy, but what can u expect from an Arnold movie? Great summer movie with amazing special effects( in my opinion better then the matrix reloaded), go see it, 8 or 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheap (though not monetarily) "sequal" (so the producers say...) to James Cameron's earlier masterpieces. This flic is as lame as ALIEN 3 was. Cameron told it all in the first 2 films - there is no conceivable reason to come out with this 90 minute demolition derby and room/building trashing fest, except that Hollywood, as usual, can't let a very good film(s) go, without cheapening their memories by coming out with some inferior "continuation." This is like every crappy follow -up Disney has put out on direct-to-video. Arnold looks great, but some of his "clever" lines seem desperate. There's no believable chemistry between John Connor and his "future bride". Claire Danes is a very good actress, but she seems wasted in what is little more than a "scream queen" role. Balitrami's score is lame - he should stick to David Lynch films. All in all, a big disappointment from the director who gave us the excellent U-571 and the even better BREAKDOWN. As far as Arnold,he, like Stallone and his endless ROCKY sequals, should know when to quit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold falls short as the machines rise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I feel like the movie was worth the price of admission but I was a bit disappointed. The story was good and it answered all of the questions I had going into the film but where the movie fell short was in Arnold. His movement, facial expressions, and overall speech pattern strayed from that of the previous two films. It seemed to me that the attitude he brought to the character had to be forced out where as the other two films it seemed to come natural for him. At times it seemed as if his movement resembled that of a 70 year old man with a sore back instead of a nearly indestructable cyborg. Maybe I am being overly critical. Being a movie fanatic, I tend to expect more than the average movie goer. I'm sure, however, that I am not alone in complaining about the feeble attempts at comedy (like "she'll be back" and the starred/glittered sunglasses). Moments like that took away from the serious and intense nature that the movie should have displayed. I urge everyone to see this film but I also urge everyone to question how old is too old for an action star and more importantly is it the age of the body or the age in the heart they bring into their work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action without the atmosphere from the previous Terminator-movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold is back as the Terminator, but this time it is not with the same success as the previous.I liked the first two movies, and I also like the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Anyway, I feel that three people really have created the Terminator universe, and these three people are Arnold, Cameron and not at least the composer Brad Fiedel. The last two were missing in this third movie, so I was very sceptical of this one.The movie was entertaining though, so maybe I should not complain, but I was not impressed. Kristanna Loken did an acceptable job as TX, but it was not as good as Robert Patrick as T-1000 or Arnold's previous performances.A thing that I did not like in this movie was that the Terminator was made a bit comical. It was fun to watch some of the scenes with the Terminator where he did some funny things, but it was more like a take-off of the old Terminator. It created a dilemma, I was entertained, but at the same time I was a bit frustrated, that the movie was not serious like the old Terminator-movies by Cameron.Compared to the old movies this movie is not like them. The movie does not have the ideas of James Cameron and the music of Brad Fiedel, I missed them both. A last thing that I missed was Arnold as the Terminator, I did not feel he was a cyborg/robot, maybe he missed the instructions from James Cameron.I may sound very disappointed, but that is not quite true. The action was maybe the best ever filmed, and the story was acceptable. The atmosphere from the old Terminator-movies is however missing, and you will not get the same feeling when watching this one.I would rate it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard that T3 was pretty bad. Therefore, while in Washington, DC, I decided to read the book. It turned out the ending was entirely UNPREDICTABLE, unlike some claimed, and it turned out that the plot was a lot LESS dry than most would blab out. (This is in no means a criticism of others' opinions. I am attempting to state mine.) I enjoyed the movie -- maybe the characters were a little low on fresh ideas, I mean, come on, the plot has been the same for the past two movies now, but the overall message was impeccable. (Basically, what is said at the end of the movie is a strong message.) I enjoyed it. Redundant with older movies? Sure. But this one... gives a new meaning to "hope."</fullReview>

Some may find flaws, but to someone who enjoys a decent thriller that doesn't insult the audience, they were gems.Tonight, I saw part three. It made me realize how great it is that studios are letting bored twelve year olds with too much caffeine write the scripts for nearly every summer blockbuster in 2003, especially this one.I'm honestly surprised that IMDB voters have allowed this to maintain a vote over 7 for so long.

		<fullReview>T3: RISE OF THE MACHINES is not the masterpiece James Cameron would have made it. It certainly doesn't have the resonance that only the master of sci-fi pop can provide. But, T3 does have great action scenes and incredible special effects. And, aside from Claire Danes, its cast that holds up pretty well. Unfortunately, Kristina Loken's T-whatever-she-is cannot hold a candle to Robert Patrick's portrayal of the infamous T-1000. Nor can the picture's musical score compare to the original without Hans Zimmer's heartfelt composition.As a result, T3 is like that kid who got 1400 on his SATS but nobody cares since his older brother scored perfect a year before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I told you, I told you, I told you: T3 ended up being a real stinker! Though even I didn't predict it to be this bad...however, this proves my rule of movie series: either the first (Back to the future part 2, Elm street 2 etc.) OR the second sequel (Scream 3, Lethal Weapon 3 etc.) end up being unable to live up to the original. The only exceptions so far are the Die Hard and the Star wars trilogies. I sincerely hope I can add Charlie's Angels 3, Matrix 3 and Blade 3 on my exceptions list in the near future...But back to T3: the plot is not that bad, but it's so filled with (bad) jokes and plotholes that sometimes you're not sure if this is supposed to be a spoof. At the end we get to some good ol' stuff, like the machines taking over and Arnie vs. the TX, but this is taken away with Arnie fighting with himself- bad idea, bad acting. I strongly believe that the original idea there had Arnie going bad and that the last fight was supposed to be between John vs. bad Arnie, but that this was scrapped because a test audience consisting of 1.000 pot-headed teenagers who had never seen T1 thought it's too dark. Right.In my opinion the end would have also been better without throughout explanations: the pair gets to the basement, find out it's not skynet, figure out Arnie tricked them there to be safe and the camera pans away as they're listening to the end of the world. Dark like (the original) Planet of the apes.I don't know what this is, but it sure don't feel like the other terminator movies. Cameron, Hamilton and even Furlong are solely missed, plus Fiedel's score.So could someone explain me whatta hell is this 7,2/10 rating?? A national inside joke???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one unnecessary sequel to two science fiction classics. Sure, everyone wanted a another Terminator movie, but they should have giving us more than this. James Cameron is no where in sight in this follow up, and is replace with Jonathan Mostow, whose films Breakdown and 'U-571'were tepid at best. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator who returns to protect an adult John Conner from an advance model-killing machine called the T-X played by Kristanna Loken. Every thing that was set up before in Terminator 2 is throng out for the sake of another sequel, and the story is not only incoherent but also down right annoying in certain parts of the film. The T-X is not as advance as the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and not as menacing. You were actually scared of The T-1000, and it gave you a reason to be scared by the way that it could kill at will. The T-X is just poor carbon copy of the T-1000, and not as efficient of a killing machine. The story should have been better and should have been a great continuation of the second movie but in it's journey to be different, it forgot what it should have been. Sure, it's a great time waster but compared to the others, it's a disappointment. The movie was made to capitalize and two much better films and judging by the way the movie ends, they are going to rape those films even further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting to be disappointed as so many sequels do. I was wrong. But, please do bring your best ration of disbelief suspension. I really enjoyed this offering. This was creative and loaded with lots of great, well staged action and developed things along the path the 1st 2 set but better. The plot here had more flesh and it set up an easy run at future franchises. The new Terminatrix is awesome, although I could have stood to see a lot more of her sans the dull brown suit. Her best outfit was the one in her opening scene and she carried it with no small amount of dignity. Arnold was his usual self but with even more class. He did a wonderful job here as the original T almost developing an emotion. The real treat was Claire Danes. What a talent she is. I even like to watch her with her clothes on, a different twist for action films where the females' only usual talent is the cloth hitting the floor. She added a lot to this and I do hope to see her in the NEXT sequel. She could even make it. Of course she is well known as a real actiing talent and she doesn't insult her hosts here, giving a real and poignant effort. I was surprised to see her billed inthis sort of film to be honest. I genuinely began to like her character thanks to her talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I've seen of 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7/21/2003WARNING!! WARNING!! MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS DISCUSSED HERE! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!Still with me? Good."Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is not only my favorite film of the "Terminator" trilogy, but it's also the best film I've seen of this year so far!We all know the "Terminator" story: John Connor is the leader of the human resistance in the year 2029, helping people fight against the deadly machines that try to wipe out humanity after they take over on August 29th, 1997. Connor ultimately destroys the machines, but before he does, the machines send robots back in time to kill Connor before he can become humanity's savior. In the first film, a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before she gives birth to John (later his date of birth revealed to be the year 1985), but it fails."Terminator 2: Judgment Day" took place in 1991, where a 10-year-old John (what? If he's 10, shouldn't it have happened in 1995?) is almost killed by a T-1000 robot (Robert Patrick), but it fails when another Terminator (again, Schwarzenegger, re-programmed to protect John and becomes a father figure to him) helps the Connors apparently stop SkyNet, stops the T-1000 and later lets Sarah help it "self-terminate."The film revolves around 23-year-old John Connor (Nick Stahl), who wanders from place to place and wishes not to be found, for fear that the machines of the future-yet-to-come will try and kill him.Guess what? He's right.Judgment Day wasn't stopped. It was only delayed.The Terminatrix, or T-X (Kristanna Loken), is sent back in time to kill Connor. Since Connor has no connections by an address or phone number, the T-X instead starts to kill his future lieutenants in the war to come one by one. Two of the TX's targets are veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and her father (David Andrews), who has a key role in the activation of SkyNet, the sentient program of the future machines. Kate is particularly important - she shares a past with John, and a future (turns out she becomes his wife, his second in command and the mother of his kids).Later, the Terminator (again, again played Schwarzenegger) arrives in our time after it is re-programmed by Kate to protect her and John in this time (hope you understood all that). Anyway, the Terminator eventually finds them and tries to save them from the T-X, but it also must be careful around the new, deadlier T-X, who can destroy and control other machines as well.The fight scenes and visual effects are nicely done, and cast itself does a good job with their roles. Schwarzenegger, Danes and Stahl give great performances, especially since Danes goes through the most in the film - she loses her father and fiancée, Scott (Mark Famiglietti), to the T-X and does a nice job in the scenes where she's with John. She even takes out a machine with a machine gun while trying to stop the machines (to which John admits, "You remind me of my mother.")Even Loken makes the T-X out to be a worthy foe of the Terminator (though she lacks the creepiness factor of Patrick's T-1000 from "T2").What I especially liked was the lack of gore than what the first two films had (though it has its gross-factor moments, like when the T-X punches her hand through a cop's chest), and the humor. For example: the Terminator arrives in our time naked and arrives at a strip club on ladies' night. He tells a male stripper in a leather jacket outfit to "take off his clothes" so he can wear them. When the stripper says, "Talk to the hand," the Terminator grabs his wrist, nearly breaking it in his grip as he does, and puts the hand to his lips as he says, "Now."There's even a nice cameo by Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, and the plot twists are a nice touch (the Terminator Kate sent back to protect her and John in this film reveals the future Kate does so only after it kills John in the future).But nothing beats the shocking twist ending, when John and Kate learn the grim truth about SkyNet.Anyway, there one, confusing flaw that keeps this film from being perfect. John is 23 in this film, and as mentioned before, he was even born in 1985 and was 13 when he last met the Terminator in "T2". The film also says Hamilton's Sarah Connor was diagnosed with leukemia after the events of "T2", given six months to live but she fought it for 3 years to make sure that on August 29th, 1997, Judgment Day (the day the machines took over) never happened (add to the fact that if "T2" WAS set in 1995, that Sarah would've died in 1998 or so, over a year after Judgment Day's date, and you have more confusion).The time-line doesn't make sense. Had it been done correctly, John would've been about 7 in 1992, 13 in 1998 (one year after the original date Judgment Day would have occurred on) and 19 in 2003. It's best to forget the timeline, and if you're new to the "Terminator" movies, then this gripe may not bother you so much.Still, despite the fact that I found other films this summer to be either EXTREMELY disappointing ("Hulk" and "X2") or just down-right awful ("Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" and "Pirates of the Caribbean"), "T3" was a welcome surprise for me.I yearn to see a "T4", in the hopes that Arnold's famous quote of "I'll be back" lives up to its promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoilers Okay, here's another chance where hollywood could have pulled off a great movie but proves once again that a quality sequel is second to a just producing a sequel.T3 has just been reduced to the status of just another sequel. James Cameron's T2, like Titanic, Aliens and the Abyss are brilliant in their construction. Sure there are minor plot questions but nothing major. Character development and the story was as important as the special effects. Cameron poured quality into T2. It is the quality of a sequel that will stand the test of time. Like Aliens stands the test of time, but Aliens 3 and 4 do not.So what are my complaints? 1) the comedy in the film was wrong and out of place, 2) the film didn't make me really care about the story, and 3) the plot sucks.Here is just a few instances of crappy plot that should have been fixed before shooting began.1) How did a guy who looks like a hobo loaded with guns and explosives, a weightlifter clad in leather bikerwear and a normal civilian-looking girl get into the middle of command and control in a high security military installation. And they can walk around freely. Even though the girl is the general's daughter, they would never get past the first gate. Somebody would at least question the guy with explosives.2) I won't give away the movie here but the TX has a list of people it needs to "terminate". #1 on the list would be John Conner, #2 and 3 on the list would be the girl and her General father. When the TX first arrives here, why does she go looking for the guy working at the fast food place? Then she she goes to where the girl works at 4 o'clock in the morning. I thought these things are supposed to be smart. Somebody on this site already brought up this point, but shouldn't she have went to the girl's apartment at 4am because humans are normally sleeping at that time? Oh yeah, and for some reason Arnold went to the girls work at 4 am too. It must be a popular hang out for terminators.3) The TX somehow knew the John Conner was going to the fallout shelter in the desert. I won't give away anything here either, but I think this is kinda messed up. There way no way for the TX to know this. Especially since Arnold earlier said they needed to hide in Mexico. So... the TX should have assumed that as well. The terminators are supposed to be smart not all-knowing.4) The whole Cyber-dyne/Skynet thing that made sense in the second film gets confused in this one. If you pick up a book and read the first two chapters and the entire story is built around certain facts that are butchered in chapter 3, you are probably going to throw the book right out the window. Maybe I'm just confused on this one but according to T2, without Cyber-dyne, Skynet and the Terminators won't exist. Cyber-dyne was eradicated in chapter 2. Why couldn't we have come up with some alternate explanation for a "Judgement Day" sequel without ruining this "book" in chapter 3.There was many more instances but these just flat out bugged me during the film. Can't someone during pre-production screen these things and say something like, "hey, this don't make sense" or "this story blows"?This would have been a better film if they would have 3 of the Robert Patrick T-1000's and have them sent back for a man hunt to eliminate a list of people. The TX was kinda cool, but the T-1000 was a better advisary. To have the one TX running all over the place and mangling the plot with it, was stupid.More importantly, they also needed to explain WHY does the terminator technology still exists today and WHY skynet still exists and WHY that virus was introduced to the machines of the world. And who created and introduced that virus??? I don't know either and I've seen the film.I think this all boils down to the director who is the man in charge here. Basically it is because Jonathan Mostow was not a great choice for director. He hasn't done anything amazing yet. His only real success so far was U-571, and that was not a great movie either.A director needs to be able to supply us the viewers with more than flashes, kicks, and explosions. We want value for our money. We want a story that makes sense. And we want every chapter (sequel) to fill in more of the pieces of the puzzle for us. We want to love a movie because it has meaning. If it has meaning and value we will go see it more than once, even at $8.50. We will want to own it on DVD. We will want to own the director's cut with added footage in to give us more of what we already love. That's what Hollywood needs to understand and then maybe we won't get crap sequels anymore.Not everything has to be flawless in a movie or its' sequels but we want an offering that does not insult our intelligence like this movie does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really an expert on movies, but I'll say that this movie is Kick Ass. You're right though, the first half was lacking. Too much action; too little story. But I'll never turn down a good knock down drag out exploding crash-bang-booming action scene. It was well done.I would also like to comment on the acting ablities. Nick Stahl, replacing The very cute Edward Furlong as John Connor, was wonderful! I've seen some of his earlier work, but I think he really stood out this time. And, as always, Arnold was spectacular. Admit it... you gotta love Arnold.I did miss Linda Hamilton though. She's one of my absolute favorite Actresses. I've loved her work ever since seeing Stephen King's "Children Of The Corn" where I thought she was just spifferiffic. And, Her performance in T2 was GLORIOUS. I love that movie. I know people are already tearing it apart because it's not James Cameron, but hey, it's cool anyways. It has flaws, like any other film, but I think it's Kick ass. I liked it, darn you, It rocked.</fullReview>

The acting, my god I haven't seen any acting as worse than this. It makes Star Wars: Attack of The Clones have good acting.

		<shortDescription>The best film I've seen of 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7/21/2003WARNING!! WARNING!! MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS DISCUSSED HERE! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!Still with me? Good."Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is not only my favorite film of the "Terminator" trilogy, but it's also the best film I've seen of this year so far!We all know the "Terminator" story: John Connor is the leader of the human resistance in the year 2029, helping people fight against the deadly machines that try to wipe out humanity after they take over on August 29th, 1997. Connor ultimately destroys the machines, but before he does, the machines send robots back in time to kill Connor before he can become humanity's savior. In the first film, a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before she gives birth to John (later his date of birth revealed to be the year 1985), but it fails."Terminator 2: Judgment Day" took place in 1991, where a 10-year-old John (what? If he's 10, shouldn't it have happened in 1995?) is almost killed by a T-1000 robot (Robert Patrick), but it fails when another Terminator (again, Schwarzenegger, re-programmed to protect John and becomes a father figure to him) helps the Connors apparently stop SkyNet, stops the T-1000 and later lets Sarah help it "self-terminate."The film revolves around 23-year-old John Connor (Nick Stahl), who wanders from place to place and wishes not to be found, for fear that the machines of the future-yet-to-come will try and kill him.Guess what? He's right.Judgment Day wasn't stopped. It was only delayed.The Terminatrix, or T-X (Kristanna Loken), is sent back in time to kill Connor. Since Connor has no connections by an address or phone number, the T-X instead starts to kill his future lieutenants in the war to come one by one. Two of the TX's targets are veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and her father (David Andrews), who has a key role in the activation of SkyNet, the sentient program of the future machines. Kate is particularly important - she shares a past with John, and a future (turns out she becomes his wife, his second in command and the mother of his kids).Later, the Terminator (again, again played Schwarzenegger) arrives in our time after it is re-programmed by Kate to protect her and John in this time (hope you understood all that). Anyway, the Terminator eventually finds them and tries to save them from the T-X, but it also must be careful around the new, deadlier T-X, who can destroy and control other machines as well.The fight scenes and visual effects are nicely done, and cast itself does a good job with their roles. Schwarzenegger, Danes and Stahl give great performances, especially since Danes goes through the most in the film - she loses her father and fiancée, Scott (Mark Famiglietti), to the T-X and does a nice job in the scenes where she's with John. She even takes out a machine with a machine gun while trying to stop the machines (to which John admits, "You remind me of my mother.")Even Loken makes the T-X out to be a worthy foe of the Terminator (though she lacks the creepiness factor of Patrick's T-1000 from "T2").What I especially liked was the lack of gore than what the first two films had (though it has its gross-factor moments, like when the T-X punches her hand through a cop's chest), and the humor.

John is 23 in this film, and as mentioned before, he was even born in 1985 and was 13 when he last met the Terminator in "T2". The film also says Hamilton's Sarah Connor was diagnosed with leukemia after the events of "T2", given six months to live but she fought it for 3 years to make sure that on August 29th, 1997, Judgment Day (the day the machines took over) never happened (add to the fact that if "T2" WAS set in 1995, that Sarah would've died in 1998 or so, over a year after Judgment Day's date, and you have more confusion).The time-line doesn't make sense. Had it been done correctly, John would've been about 7 in 1992, 13 in 1998 (one year after the original date Judgment Day would have occurred on) and 19 in 2003. It's best to forget the timeline, and if you're new to the "Terminator" movies, then this gripe may not bother you so much.Still, despite the fact that I found other films this summer to be either EXTREMELY disappointing ("Hulk" and "X2") or just down-right awful ("Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" and "Pirates of the Caribbean"), "T3" was a welcome surprise for me.I yearn to see a "T4", in the hopes that Arnold's famous quote of "I'll be back" lives up to its promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard great reviews about this movie, I wasn't terribly sure whether they should have made a 3rd installment to the already successful "Terminator" movies. After watching this film, this is the opinion that I have: this movie doesn't even compare to the brilliance that was the first two movies. Despite Nick Stahl and Claire Danes doing a great job as John Connor and Kate Brewster, I thought their storyline way way too soft. Arnold Schwarzenegger was good in his role as the T-800, however he looked as if he didn't have the same interest in playing the role. This T-800 lacked the character that he had in the previous movies despite the notion that he's coming back as different models. I thought that Kristanna Loken was weak as the TX-Terminatrix, not even close to being as sinister as Arnie was in the first movie and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in the second movie. It's plainly obvious that she was chosen for the role to entice males into watching this movie and also maybe to show that women are strong etc. I'm a woman and I wasn't impressed by her at all, a man should have played the villain or better yet Robert Patrick as a stronger terminator model.Don't expect anything like the first two installments, the only thing that stuck to true terminator style was the truck scene. Other than that you wouldn't even think you were watching a "Terminator" film.Truly disappointing....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not exactly up to the excellence of the first two films I do think this is a worthy sequel to this franchise. Story has John Conner (Nick Stahl) now in his 20's who is basically a drifter and he is still haunted by the events that took place a decade ago. One night in Beverly Hills a new terminator appears (Kristanna Loken) and it takes on the appearance of a beautiful woman and its mission is of course to find Conner. Conner is hiding out at a veterinarians office and early one morning Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) who works there comes to work and finds John. Turns out the two of them went to high school together and suddenly the terminator T-X shows up. Meanwhile, in the desert the older model of terminator appears (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his mission is to make sure John and Kate survive Judgement Day because their children will become important in the future. The old terminator saves them both and there is a very destructive car chase that involves police cars, fire trucks and a big crane. They go to a funeral home in the desert and find the coffin of Sarah Conner which is full of weapons. Kate's father is an Air Force officer named Robert Brewster (David Andrews) and he is in charge of a top secret program that involves this countries weapons system. Its the key to Judgement Day and the three of them race to his installation and try and stop the impending destruction. This film was directed by Jonathan Mostow who demonstrated in "U-571" that he could handle a difficult assignment like this. Its not quite up to the first two films and one reason would be the special effects. T2 gave us effects that would change the way films would look. This one does not, but its not that these effects are bad. Their not! But at the same time they're not ground breaking. And Loken as the terminatrix just doesn't come across as we would expect. She is so beautiful and I found it symbolic that she entered our time by emerging out of a Beverly Hills shop window! Its symbolic because she has the look of a mannequin. T2 didn't make Robert Patrick a huge star and I doubt that this will for Loken either. But this still is a very exciting and entertaining film. One thing that this film did was to make sure Schwarzenegger act like a cyborg and not show human emotions. T2 had one glaring flaw in it that still makes me angry to this day. Its at the end of the film where he tells Edward Furlong "I'm sorry". Sorry? He's a cyborg! He doesn't feel emotions. And in this film that mistake does not happen, thank god. I was so relieved by that. The film sets up itself for another sequel and it does so with a dark ending that was more in line with the first film. It didn't come across to me as a silly and contrived ending that was only put in for money purposes. I think a continuation is essential and the ending is believable as far as this story is concerned. Arnold has his trademark "One liners" throughout the film and in one humorous scene actor Earl Boen reprises his role as Dr. Peter Silberman and along with Schwarzenegger he is the only actor to appear in all three films. The first Terminator was a brutally dark and brilliant film and the second was a very interesting story with ground breaking special effects. This film is not up to those two but it is a worthy sequel that is never boring for one second. On a simple level, its just plain fun to watch Schwarzenegger in these films. One of the most indelible characters in movie history. Lets see T4!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sequel That Is Action, And Not Much Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of the Terminator movies, and when I first heard they were doing a third, I couldn't help but be disappointed. Strike One. Then the news hit me that James Cameron opted out on this movie. Strike Two. Then I actually saw the movie. Strike three, Hollywood sucks!First, there is almost no resemblance between T3 and its predecessors, plot wise. Here there is enough plot to satisfy your typical big-budget summer movie. Yet there were enough continuity and plot holes that I felt empty myself. I've had bowel movements more satisfying than the plot of this movie, which absolutely destroys the beauty of "There is no fate but what we make for ourselves." But for the masses, this is the movie of the summer. It's all action and forced humor. The entrance of Arnold was not entertaining, nor was him using "Talk to the hand." Ick...Acting...well, it wasn't as bad as "Battlefield Earth" but it wasn't good either. Kristianna Loken is a pretty face, and she is nowhere near as frightening and creepy as Robert Patrick. But he also had a score that made him creepy. Arnold is back to what he did well once, but that is no longer there. Here, he tries to channel the Arnold of T2, and fails. Nick Stahl wasn't a bad choice, and continuity wise, I'm glad they chose him instead of Edward Furlong. Furlong just doesn't have the charisma or brooding sense that Nick Stahl brought to John Connor's role. Claire Danes, forgettable, just like the minor characters that pop up here and there.The humor...wasn't funny. Trying to make Arnold into a comedian is nearly as bad as making Gimli a comedian. It doesn't fit, it isn't funny, and most of all, it made me want to vomit. The action is where this movie shines, and that's it. The car chase is phenominal. The fights between the TX and the T800, uh, T101...??? (it was T-800, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 in the previous films) are very cool. All in all, the action makes this movie. For being an all-round disappointment for me, it was entertaining. But now my dwindling faith in Hollywood has vanished. No more lacklustre sequels with no plot and all action. 6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those people who say that there's no plot - go back and watch the film properly. There is a good story which culminates in the very last scene. The gags weren't half as bad as I expected them to be and those little moments of comic relief were necessary, 'cause the rest of the film was pretty damn serious.It's a very good continuation of the Terminator story and it's a brilliant movie when you keep in mind that it's part 3!Yes, this film is a bit different. Not that much different. Did I miss Linda Hamilton? No. Did I miss Edward Furlong? Hell, no! Did I miss James Cameron? --- Hm, there's a certain emotional factor that Cameron would have inserted during the whole film, instead of just the ending.Anyway, especially for a follow up of an all time classic, I will give it 10 / 10 stars.There's one major plot hole ... but you can ignore that easily.Go watch it.Btw. the chase scenes are better than the one in the Matrix. Here, things get crushed for real. A lot. :)My 2003 cents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How would they justify another installment of the Terminator franchise after the ending of the 2nd movie? Not unlike to what they did to reactivate the Alien series, they did come up with something that makes sense in a strange way. The setup remains the same as in JUDGMENT DAY, with the T-100 out to save John Connor's life. Some of the action sequences even look alike, but I guess with two machines after each other, endless chases and destructions of complex buildings are the only thing you can do. Terminator 3 is a fun movie that'll entertain you through its entire running time, but that you will probably have forgotten the moment you leave the cinema...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 wasn't an awful movie by any definition of the word, but it wasn't great either. As a stand alone action film it was very good. The action was frenzied and satisfying, and the special effects tremendous. Were it to exist without the compelling lore that T1 and T2 built before it, though, it would be merely average.The TX (the female terminator) was uninspired and boring, and was never alarmingly dangerous as the previous two villians were. She simply didn't scare you, she never seemed unstoppable - which is what the movies were always about when it came to the bad guy: a relentless killing machine that simply can not be stopped, that will never stop, until you are DEAD! Sorry, she wasn't that great. She didn't even look all that great - pretty average looking for a leading female in today's film. And we all know that she was picked to entice young males.....One great highlight of the film was the humor. This movie really made me laugh out loud a few times (as it did the entire audience). Arnold was as good as he ever was, and really looked great for an old guy. You can tell that he loved making this movie.In the end, the plot was as solid as it could be, considering that almost everyone knew what was going to end up happening. The action was killer, as was the special effects. But, it didn't live up to it's mythos. The Terminator is supposed to shock and scare you; the Terminator is suppose to intimidate the audience. The TX did anything but.....8 out of 10 - I would give it a 7 (maybe even a 6), but I realize that it's just an action flick, and you can't expect the world when it comes to that genre. Besides, it's an Arnold movie, and Arnold is the man!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad a movie, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I didn't look at my watch during the movie, so it couldn't have been a bad movie. I actually quite enjoyed the movie. If I really like it? Quite frankly, I don't know yet. It certainly is a very different movie that T2 was, but so was T2 compared to T1. All in all, it was an action packed movie but somehow I missed a real flow. It seems we were just taken from one scene to another, with bits and pieces missing between them. T3 was not as well edited as T2 was but then again, some of the scenes cut from T2 were quite important for the flow of the movie as well.A few things quite annoyed me in T3. For example the car chase. Sure action movies and logic are not really very compatible but I just can't understand, how such an advanced machine as the T-X with it's high level AI, could chase John Connor in a huge crane, with the cranes arm wreaking havoc all over the place? I mean the choice of vehicle was quite good as it is tough and everything but the crane knocking down walls and pulling up cars would slow the vehicle somewhat down. It just doesn't feel right.What I did like, was some of the references to the past, like when John Connor said, that he had to train the T-101 all over again or Dr. Silverman's short appearence and his reaction to Arnie.All in all, T3 was certainly worth the ticket and it will undoubtedly end up in my DVD collection but I'm not really sure yet, where it will rank in the three Terminator movies so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this film would be hard to follow in the footsteps of 2 prior outings, but I had hopes that it could re-kindle the awe I had as a child when seeing T2. This film had nothing worthy of it. The acting was rather bland and uninspiring, the dialogue lacked punch and the hunour was quite corny (even though I laughed a few times). This film lacks the drive and dark edge of the prior two films. In fact it didn't seem to add or build up to anything significant at all. It seemed like a re-work on T2. To excuse the plot holes and actors that did not reprise their roles we were given new information, which changes the way you view T2 from now on.The inability to connect with the characters makes it less appealing aswell. They were too jokey with one another which lowered the suspense of the dramatic moments. The part where John Conor puts a gun to his head and threatens to pull the trigger made me cringe and laugh at the same time.An unnecessary addition to the series. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discrepancies and SPOILER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! This may contain spoilers! Read at your own riskSince when did John Connor become such a wimp, crying, despairing and self-doubting? For those who've watched NGE, you could say he's suffering from Shinji Ikari Syndrome, though to a much lesser extent.In T2, when the T-1000 hacks into the police computer database, he looks up John Connor. The date of birth says February 2nd 1985. And Schwarzenegger's Terminator says that 35 years in the future, John reprograms him. In a later scene, John says he is about 45 when that happens, making him 10 years old in T2. Yet in T3, John's voiceover at the beginning of the movie says that the T-1000 struck at him when he was 13. Since John was born in 1985, if T2 was set when he was 13, then the year must be 1998 (1985+1398), one year after Judgement Day occurs, although in T2, Judgement Day has not happened yet as they are so trying to prevent it. That makes John 10 and not 13!There are Arnie's one liners which is the movie's grace. But `unable to comply,' `irrelevant', `subroutines', all sounds very Star Trek-ish. But the age-old line `come with me if you want to live' isn't in the movie, which was disappointing. Another disappointment was how fast the movie was, all the T-X trying to kill John and Kathryn happened in the space of one day.I also didn't like the ending with the beginning of the end of the world. It leaves it so incomplete, especially with John's looming and inevitable death by Schwarzenegger's Terminator playing on his boyhood feelings. Hopefully there will be a T4 with a much happier ending. But the introduction of Kathryn Brewster, and all the Lieutenant killing plots show that the franchise is all going downhill.I wish, however, that I could pass this on to the writers of T3 but I don't know how, if anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated. They should get the ages right, at least in my opinion.</fullReview>

Totally unnecessary and not funny.The T-101 is not very likeable in this movie, being a thug one minute and a jokester the next.The meeting of John and his little friend Kate. Totally unbelieveable. I think someone dropped the script here.A robot with laser guided missles cannot hit John and his little friend Kate. Please!The Good:Great action scenes &amp; special effects.Plot is actually believable here and advances the story a bit further which I didn't think was possible. We actually get to see into Skynet and see the start of Judgement Day.I think if they could have made a better terminator, this movie would be REALLY good, but it kind of takes a away from the movie a bit when I see something less then the T1000.Overall, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold's back.... again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold's Terminator comes back in time again to thwart Skynet's attempts to change the future... again. The first sequel, T2, had great special effects, but unfortunately that was all it had going for it. The premise was good, but the story execution was poor, the acting substandard, and was plagued by an annoying John Connor character who had you wishing he'd get killed even before the movie ended.This third installment has great special effects and I think they even improved on some things. 1. It would have been better if they could have come up with something different in the story and still make it good, but that's pretty hard to do. So it seems like this time they didn't take themselves too seriously, and even poked fun at themselves in some ways. They rehash some of the previous movies one-liners, some with a twist ("She'll be bhack!"), and throw out some new ones. But they kept in check and didn't let it get lampoonish. 2. The totally liquid metal terminator of T2 made for some great special effects, but being totally liquid metal was stupid. Not taking into account the improbable physics involved, you had the feeling that if Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn't the hero, his butt would have been stomped way in the beginning of T2. This time, the evil terminator has a solid skeleton frame with a liquid metal skin, and that's a lot easier for the viewer to swallow. 3. The action is tremendous! And I think that's what they tried to spend most of their focus on, instead of getting to bogged down in a dramatic story that they had no hope of making work, as happened in T2. True, they had to do the obligatory dramatic scenes as the characters get to know each other and try to deal with their situation, but without too much time being spent on it. I think it was a wise choice.The only really dumb part of the movie (and it was really stupid)was when the evil terminator supposedly infects several motor vehicles with a virus, enabling her to remote control them. I don't think you even have to be an auto mechanic to know just how impossible that is. It looked cool, but it was still massively stupid.I won't give away the ending, (you can read other reviews for that)but it had a nice plot twist in the end. It didn't have that trademark James Cameron touch of making you think just when the movie is over, there's a finale waiting around the corner. The story could have been better, but I think the director did a pretty good job with what he had to work with. In the end, I was entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appropriately, many large trucks haul the terminators and co through this movie. I say 'appropriately', because this movie contains an inordinate amount of holes which such vehicles could drive through.Clearly, Cameron had sewn his movie shut with no intention of a sequel. We all remember him saying 'T3 without me!' some years back. Like Alien3, the allure of $$ drove the writers to open up what the creator wanted shut. Most people couldn't care less about this sort of thing, but to me it makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief.T3 lacks continuity from the characters of its predecessors. This John Connor to me just doesn't fit - he's wimpy, seems to have forgotten what he did in T2, and doesn't have the hard edge he had in T2. The absence of Linda Hamilton, or perhaps any strong human character, diminishes the entire human/robot dynamic.And while the humor in prior T* movies stemmed from plausible situations that a terminator would run into, you can see right through each of the staged jokes in T3. You find yourself laughing, but it feels like 'Airplane' humor.But in spite of all this, T3 certainly gave me a couple hours of entertainment. I can't get enough of robots destroying things, quite honestly. Yes, as an engineer I cringe each time I see how easily the movie sidesteps such issues as the weight of a Terminator, the need for amazing amounts of friction between their feet and the ground, and how a clearly visible metallic backpack buckle somehow ignores magnetic forces.So, while I clearly enjoyed the entertaining action and eyecandy, I missed the depth of the T* films which transcended a cheap action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit I went into this movie with modest expectations. I anticipated a shoot-em-up action flick. And I was not disappointed in any way. The action in this movie is very good. The sounds and sights are awe inspiring in some scenes. What really got me in this movie was the ending. I won't give away any details, but I was pleasantly suprised by a very non-Hollywood ending. Admitiedly, the climax of the movie was a little tepid, but what happens after that was kind of suprising. It was not entirely positive. However, Terminator movies have always had somewhat melencholy endings. In T1, we had to watch Kyle die. And in T2, the Terminator gets lowered into lava. This movie has a similar sad point, but its a different kind of sad point. It does however, fit with the movie, making it seem that much more real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very beginning gives you a clue - there is no theme music, no fancy intro, nothing - straight into the film. At that point, it recycles a lot from the previous movies, though in fairness, trying to be funny. It was cute - but, well, it was not that funny.The script for the play was likely the first draft on a napking of the treatment. Very thin, probably a few pages long. The story, very linear and predictable. While the new terminator is sexy-scary, we are never in actual fear for the lives of our heros or the success of thier mission. The ending twist was nice, but too late to save the film.There was not any 'wow' in new special effects or action sequences like there was seeing T2 - so there was some dissapointment there. More like Terminator 2.01, without the good story.Arnolds work is ok, but thin. Too much reused from other films.</fullReview>

I enjoyed the great Crane/street/car chase, and the brawling between Blondie and Ahnold is terrific. Don't bother trying to follow the timetravel conventions here, it's convoluted and why bother?

		<fullReview>The problem with some movies that are extremely successful and then have numerous sequels is that they run out of ideas. What is the plot here? Bad robot gets sent back in time to kill social misfit who becomes great leader, good robot gets sent back to protect social misfit who becomes great leader. Lots of noise, explosions, chases and computer-generated violence in between. If more than $1.98 was spent on the script, they got ripped off. My dog and my photocopier could have written this movie.I can understand the tendency to do this however. It's simply business. They have a sure-fire formula, just plug in anything and it works. They have Arnold, who is arugably the greatest unsophisticated action star ever. If you need someone to clear everyone and everything out of your way, or arguably to put your state's fiscal house in order, nobody does it like Arnold. They added a Nordic ice princess in Kristanna Loken, who is beautiful and completely unemotional as she engages in all manner of mayhem. Can she act? Who knows? Who cares? Then they throw in all the bells and whistles and they have a movie that should make piles of money throughout the world.The one criticism I have is the love story. Stahl and Danes have zero chemistry, have no appeal, nothing interesting. The notion that these two people could run the night shift at the Burger King, much less save the planet is laughable. If they are supposed to rescue the planet, my money is on the machines.There is one truth about the Terminator series. As long as Arnold is willing to keep on keeping on, they will continue making them, because he's just a money-making machine.</fullReview>

She made the Mortal Kombat series, and she knows how to fight and etc. And I guess she did an excellent job as the lethal T-X. You guys are just used to the villains being guys, on the T series.. and when it comes a girl, its a bit weird, but she did pretty well. And it's got some beautiful action scenes. Jonathan Mostow also with a solid and direct direction, give us straight to the action, since the beginning til it's end. Worth watching! 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always loved ah-nuld and the Terminator movies, so I was a bit concerned when a lot of critics kept saying "T3 isn't this or isn't that." But that's what I get for listening to critics. Maybe T3 isn't that heavy into all the sci-fi techno-babble, or all caught up in some deep philosophies - but that's ok with me - they can save that for the Critics' beloved Oscar-worthy movies. What you get is a straight-forward fight-for-survival action movie on a grand scale. At 56, Ah-nuld still kicks almost everyone's ass, John Mostow(sp?) did a fine job of keeping up the pace while injecting a good level of humor at the right times, and everyone else seemed to give it their all. Don't apply the Oscar-Meter and go and have a good time at a good action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I absolutely loved the first Terminator and thought the sequel was one of the best sequels ever made (outside of "Godfather II"). Arnold was born to play this role and seems to enjoy it. However, the act is a bit tired now - and Arnold is looking a little wrinkled for a robot. Anyway, decent story with Nick Stahl ("In the Bedroom") as a 20 something John Conner and the always wonderful Claire Danes as the female fill in for the not present Linda Hamilton. I am really glad Danes is acting full time again. Although it has been almost 10 years since her TV breakout, she is just now coming in to her own as an actress. "The Hours" and "Igby Goes Down", along with this performance show she is trying to find her niche. Very skilled and not bad to look at, the next few roles are crucial to her career as either a star or character actress. I just hope she continues to produce quality turns. Model Kristanna Loken is the T-X, or Terminatrix (get it?) who is after John Conner. A far more powerful and efficient killing machine than Arnold, but somehow she continually falls just short. Not sure how director Johnathan Mostow ("U-571") lucked into this gig, but at least he doesn't muck it up. This is just a story that has had its day and should be appreciated for what it gave us. Let Arnold run for office and let Hollywood move on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different flavour of Terminator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reportedly, Linda Hamilton stated that this story 'had no soul' that the other two possessed. After seeing this movie, I get the feeling that it was intentionally darker than the previous two but also more machine-like in execution as well.This film felt cold and heartless. The acting was straigthforward and the dialogue pretty much flowed but it felt like it was indeed missing Cameron's touch. What upset me most was that Arnold's acting was too human and less android-like. Why? It seemed they sent a terminator with more prior interaction than ever before. Why is he so aware and expressive in times of stress? Doesn't make sense to me.All in all, the movie had dazzling effects and kept my attention throughout as an action movie should. The ending was a little unsettling but sensible enough. Honestly, if the next installment isn't the last then I'll be joined by many as seeing this great series exploited by the petty, greedy few trying to make a quick buck by ruining a decent premise! If you're interested, go to you local comic shop and see if you can secure a copy of 'Terminator : Burning Earth' series (from the defunct Now comics label) painted fully by the masterful Alex Ross. A definite must see, it should give you a possible clue as to what might happen next.</fullReview>

High Art it isn't, but the action is as good as it ever was and the warning against over-reliance on computers and machines is made again and made well. I came in with high expectations and wore a smile for the duration of T3. $10 to completely forget reality and lose oneself in cinema is money well spent.

		<shortDescription>For me the series goes from best to the worst (but still good!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a definite return to form for Arnie and his first box office hit (maybe, depending on the drop off) and critical hit since ironically his last outing as the T-800, in T2. Yes True Lies was a box office hit but critically the response was very mixed, although fairly good in Britain. This is also his best since True Lies, it has more in the way of story but the action doesn't quite come up to Jim Cameron standard (little does!).Before going on about the strengths of this film I'll comment on the weaknesses. The film has a lot to live up to, and in the end fails to live up to the first two films, while it is still a worthy sequel. Some of the significant weaknesses are the fact that the story is not as interesting or clever, it doesn't have as much character development, although in John's case it does however the other roles are weaker than Sarah Conner and previously Kyle Reese. There is only one prominent 3 dimensional role. As I say Claire Dane's role as Kate Brewster is underwritten and subsequently she is wasted, for instance her fiance is killed by the TX and it has little effect on her, it is not touched upon and is forgotten within five minutes, then the developing relationship between her and John gives her an air of coldness. The thrills lack the excitement and punch of the first two, which is not to say they aren't exciting, but hey its up against Jim. The final action scene is the weakest of all three films and is semi rehashed from the first film. The main problem is that the humour of the film is not as subtle as number 1 or two. It seems that as the franchise has moved along the humour has increased, but here it is bordering on spoof.Another key problem is that Arnie no longer is the head of the movie, he doesn't command the screen like he used to, and his role seems to be that of the Terminator doing an impression of the Terminator, funny as it is to see him send himself up slightly, the humour is far to overt and corny. There doesn't seem to be a need for Arnies character in this one (in terms of the way it is written rather than his overall impact in the story, he still has to save them but aside from that his presence is solely about laughs), the TX is a great adversary and once again Arnie plays protector but his role still wasn't 100% pivotal. T1 and T2 with no Arnold and they would be half of what they are, he held the movies together, his role is written with so much comedy involved that he seems like a caricature, it thankfully doesn't affect his dramatic moments too much though. Some other problems are the disappointing impact of Arnies change from good to bad, this could have been much more exciting, in the end it is very brief and lacks punch. Also the future war scenes that gathered much fan interest before the films release are very small and no more than the first two films, I would liked to have seen more because the idea excited me, that is not too big a problem though as it is bound to happen in the next instalment. To round it off into one sentence, it doesn't feel like the Terminator films that Jim Cameron weaned us on! Also Beltrami's score isn't as memorable as the synthy resonance of Brad Fiedels scores. The score seemed fairly cliched and not as inspirational as some of Marcos other work.Okay my disappointments out the way, and I was a little disappointed at the film considering the early reviews suggested it was going to be very, very good, I found much to enjoy. John Connors role is good and Nick Stahl plays it well, in fact he holds the movie, and this is vital considering the minimal scripting of the other characters, mind you the major focus on him is warranted of course. The action is good, a little over hyped maybe, such as the supposed 15 minute car chase that must have been 5 at most. Even though the film doesn't seem like a 200 million budget there is still plenty of bang for your buck. The TX rocks. Kristanna Loken looks amazing and she looks like a bad ass bitch, she has made a great movement of her own for the TX. She overdoes it at times but she really steals the movie and steals Arnies thunder. The script is pretty good, especially compared to most actioners, it does suffer from some bad dialogue but even the classic first two films had its moments, what action film doesn't? Of course one of the main things was that it was great to see Arnie back in a big action movie kicking some ass, delivering zingers (that were very Commando, very True Lies, a bit too hokey for the Terminators, but still funny) and handling large weaponry, who else but Arnold could walk out with a coffin full of weapons on one shoulder and a large calibre weapon in the other hand and single handedly wipe out a squad of police vehicles. With a 150 (at least) plus gross under his belt he now will have better options open to him rather than pap like Collateral Damage. There are smiles on the faces of Ah-nuld fans once more with his first truly decent film in nearly ten years (I don't care what critics say True Lies was the dogs bollocks in terms of mindless fun). T3 will be a worthy edition to any action fans DVD collection, and despite Mostow perhaps overstretching himself, going from a 40 million to a 200 million budget production, he is still looking like a top new director coming through, although as its only his third big film in 6 years he needs to accelerate the releases. Most definitely a worthwhile sequel but it falls far short of the first two. Bring on number 4 baby. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines: 8/10At last, the movie I had been dying to see was released in Australia. Having seen the first two Terminators, but having forgotten most of what happened, I only had a vague idea what to expect. I liked the twist early on, which takes the story in a different direction than what the trailer may have suggested. This is everything an action junkie could want. It has great explosions, good battle scenes (way better than the overhyped fights in "The Hulk"), but also has a good storyline. The comedy wasn't as intrusive as I thought it might be, and was pretty well timed. A lot of it was acceptable because it featured Arnie running off believable, but still comedic robot lines (although there were exceptions, the craziest being "TALK TO ZE HAND!"). The female Terminator was BADASS, just relentless in her search, and NOT the blatent addition of sex appeal that she might have been. Without spoiling anything, this movie had one of the best last quarters in any recently, and the ended was almost mind-blowing and perfectly set up the next (and possibly last) installment of the series. As for the acting, it all seemed fine to me. Kristanna Loken was perfect as the T-X, and I liked the way she never "broke character" and threw off some stupid line. Arnold Schwarzenegger was as you'd expect - he can't act very well, so this role is perfect for him, where he can BE a robot, rather than unintentionally acting like one . Claire Danes was fine as Kate Brewster, though replaceable. My favourite role was Nick Stahl as John Connor, he was really good and convincing. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action Sequences are too bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron is a GREAT director of action sequences. In T2, the action sequences were VERY meticulously done. For example, when John Connor (Edward Furlong) flees to the LA flood channels on a motorcycle to escape the T1000, James Cameron focuses his Camera on the obviously exhausted and perplexed John Connor, who FEELS he is safe, but James Cameron then performs his magic and let's the audience HEAR the semi truck squealing its wheels and then BAM!, BOTH the audience and John Connor are shocked to see the truck leaping off the bridge at a close proximity to John Connor. In effect, James Cameron creates DRAMA in his action sequences which makes the audience ENJOY the action despite its foregone conclusion.In the T3, there is no drama in all of its action. EVERYONE knows John Connor will live and T100 will prevail over the more sophisticated TX. The challenge is make it interesting to the audience despite the obvious. In this, the T3 fails.I saw this movie as a high budget action adventure with a nice plot, but nothing more. It certainly doesn't compare well against the T2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Third installment to the Terminator franchise takes place when John Connor is in his early twenties and preparing for the rise of the machine empire. An obsolete cyborg model is sent from the future to protect Connor and a veterinarian from a newer, far more advanced, and much more lethal model during an impending nuclear war. The formula that worked so effectively in the 1984 classic wears thin here, but it provides enough explosive action scenes and cheesy one-liners to be entertaining if you buy into it, otherwise it's pretty forgettable. Schwarzenegger is in good form, Stahl convincing as the new hero, Loken a sexy and lethal addition as T-X. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what most people say about Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, that it is too dependent on special effects, it is still a good film. Of course the acting is not of Oscar quality, but the film is of a sci-fi genre and nobody expects it. While T3 has many special effects, it does have an excellent storyline and plot, especially considering Cyberdyne was destroyed in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film adds an element that was in the original Terminator but not in the sequel: the relationship between two characters, John Connor and Kate Brewster, much like that between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. This adds an extra dimension to a film which would be without much emotions. Overall, it is a film worth watching. For Terminator fans, this completes the trilogy with Judgment Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERTAfter the slimy abortion that was Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, my wife had a dickens of a time convincing me to take in ANY more summer action sequels, including T3, even though we're both big fans of the first two films. Eventually, she won me over, and I'm glad she did. I enjoyed T3--even though it's merely good and not nearly as great as its predecessors.There was a lot to like here. I liked the two young leads, and found both characters' development from what they are at the start of the film (John Connor's a mess; Kate Brewster's a mousy vet) to what they are at the end (future leaders of the anti-machine resistance and soon-to-be lovers) wholly believable and deftly accomplished. I especially liked the irony of how it took a machine--one of his future main enemies, a Terminator--to make Connor accept his destiny as leader of the resistance to those very machines.I also thought the downer ending was incredibly gutsy for a summer action movie. The heroes don't win! Well, eventually they will, we're told, but that's not what we're SHOWN. And Arnie--how can you not love the Teutonic Titan in the role he was born to play? Favourite line: "I'll drive." --delivered to a group of shocked firefighters. And it's extremely well-paced, especially once the threat of Skynet's activation comes into play.Nonetheless, the film has some serious problems, most of them revolving around the bad guy...uh, girl. The Terminatrix was the weakest element here. First, the obvious: as an actress, Kristanna Loken is a good model. She has nowhere near the screen presence of Arnold or Robert Patrick. When Loken flatly delivers the uninspiring "I like your car/gun" lines, you can't help but recall Robert Patrick's wonderfully creepy "Say...that's a nice bike...", not to mention Arnie's immortal "I'll be back."Second, the concept is weak: she can form advanced weapons with her hands? So what? The previous villains in this series were viscerally terrifying: the unstoppable, scowling, hulking Arnie in T1, who got scarier as his skin came off and that metal skeleton got revealed; and creepily friendly Robert Patrick, shape-shifting his liquid metal body into those ugly, brutal "stabbing weapons". Third, T3 showed some lazy, sloppy work on the part of the writers when it came to our villainess. It's a bad sign when I get those "What the f...?" moments DURING the movie. Here's a couple of examples of what I'm talking about:1) Kate's hiding, terrified, breathing AUDIBLY, in her vet clinic, and Terminator Barbie CAN'T HEAR HER?!? Come on, she's gotta have some advanced auditory sensors, and infra-red to boot. My wife suggested the T-Barbie got distracted by John Connor's presence, and realized how ridiculous that was as soon as she said it. Hey, she's a super-advanced COMPUTER, I THINK she can MULTI-TASK. Simple solution: Kate just happens to hide behind a big, noisy fridge. You've got a technically savvy audience here, guys; don't insult our intelligence.2) John, Kate, and Arnie are driving away at the end of the early, nearly-interminable chase scene. T-Barbie watches them go, the back end of their Toyota truck in her sights...uh...HELLO?!? I thought this chick could form advanced weaponry, but she can't pick off a TRUCK at 200 yards?!?3) T-Barbie goes right through the super-accelerator control room without noticing it's turned on or figuring out (super-computer, remember? Advanced AI?) what its powerful magnetic field will do to anything METAL once it reaches full power. And Arnie says she's smarter than he is?All in all, if I had a choice as to which of the three Terminators I'd rather go up against, I'd choose this ineffectual little minx any day. Fortunately, about half-way into the movie the nebulous Skynet becomes the true villain and its impending activation creates the real suspense.T3 does end up being a largely intellectual exercise, which is remarkable for a summer action movie, granted. But it wasn't as emotionally compelling as I'd hoped. First, Sarah Connor/Linda Hamilton deserved a BIG death scene where she gave her life for John. (And the mother-in-law-to-be-with-biceps-of-steel-and-an-uzi stuff would have been fun!) Second, when John Connor accepts his destiny, you should want to stand up and cheer. Instead, I was left walking out going, "Well, that was interesting..." It's good, even satisfying, but not great. You can't help wondering how Cameron would have done it better. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I entered the movie theater prepared for the worst. How could I not be? I had seen both previous Terminator movies, and if the steep drop-off between the smart and decidedly unnerving original and the dull overblown action sequence of a sequel was any indication of how the new film promised to be, then I expected nothing short of what I actually saw- nearly 2 hours of absolutely gratuitous mayhem. Script, acting, plot holes, logic- all of these took a backseat (or were stowed away in the trunk) to what was more or less one very long action scene after another. That isn't to say the action scenes aren't worth watching. In fact, they're so good that about a half hour into the movie I forgot that normally necessary film elements like meaningful dialogue or characterization were entirely lacking, and managed to thoroughly enjoy the whole experience. Any one expecting, or at the very least hoping for (as at least one viewer was) the darkness or profundity of the original, please look elsewhere. But if you want to see special effects that aren't glossed with the polished sheen of a video game (Matrix 2), and like sitting on the edge of your seat for two hours, then buy tickets for this movie. Unlike Ang Lee, who attempted (unsuccessfully, I think) to create a blockbuster/art piece, the director of Terminator 3 made a blockbuster that doesn't try to be anything more than a jaw-dropping, heart-palpatating, wholly mind numbing chase/kill/hide/kill-some-more type film. Bottom line: Expect nothing from this film, and you'll have a wonderful time.</fullReview>

Nick Stahl whose took a part to play John Connor from Edward Furlong whose a having a problem with drug, Nick Stahl took that part and play it with well and also Claire Danes that she plays as Kate Brewster whose will be Mrs. Connor in future.overall this is a good movie a bit funny, lot of action sequences less talking and more destruction so i give this movie 9/10 . </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though Cool, Still Loses Cameron's Grit and Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines where the `good terminator,' played vitally low-key by Arnold Schwarzeneggar, carries the man he is protecting in a coffin through a cemetery as he is ambushed by the police. This scene is undoubtedly the most important in depicting the nature of the runty third installment in The Terminator saga: The future `Judgement Day' that has been manifested throughout these films is soon to come. That known, it is easy to understand this film's plot. The end is near and John Connor (Played by Nick Stahl, but previously Edward Furlong in 1991's T2: Judgement Day), the man who is to lead the revolt against the machines that will take over humanity, is found by a futuristic killing machine sent to protect him. What this terminator is up against is a new breed of Terminator: a femme fatale who matches brawn with beauty as she seductively kills her way to John Connor and his future spouse and co-leader Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). Her mission: to terminate John, his spouse, and their future military force team. This certainly is a summer for movie sequels, including X2: X-Men United, Matrix Reloaded, and Tomb Raider: Cradle Of Life. So far I have not been let down, nor am I growing tired of seeing sequels. T3, although disappointing, is exciting as it is true to the previous films. It gives lots of interesting explanation to the events that were discussed and feared. This film does suffer, however, from a general tameness. One problem with this movie is the character of John Connor. Although given a suitable performance by Stahl, the character does not seem like a matured version of the irritable thirteen year-old we last saw in T2. He seems to lose his delinquent edge as he leads an `off-the-grid' life to evade any terminators. Personally, I was looking forward to seeing maturity in his testy side as well. I think it is necessary for the character. Another reason this movie does not live up to its predecessors is that it does not have the dark and creepy vision. This is, obviously, because of the switch in direction. This film, directed by Jonathan Mostow (U-571), is much more surface with its scares. We do not see the trademark build-up of tension that the director of the first two, James Cameron, masterfully delivers in some now-classic scenes. An example of this is in the first film. John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) hides from Arnold Schwarzeneggar's `bad Terminator' under a desk. It is a scene that lets us put ourselves under that desk and `feel' the terror of an unstoppable force coming looking for us. Rise of the Machines relies on immediate action for thrills, which truly is less exciting for the audience. Arnold does another great job as the robot with a slight hint of humor, and something struck me as I was watching T3: how close to home the story is for him. Arnold truly has something in common with his Terminator character in this one: they have both become obsolete in a way. Arnold is no longer on top of the action scene as films like The Matrix are outdoing his popularity. He needs to reclaim his status as a top action hero. The terminator he plays in T3 needs to prove he can still take on the modernization of new and advanced robots that pose a serious threat. Coincidence? This summer's newest sequel is exciting as we are taken into a world that is hours away from a foretold apocalypse, but is nonetheless tame in comparison to the vision of the originals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK movie on its own weight, but not enough weight to carry on the Terminator Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Previews didn't really wet my appetite to see this movie, but I just had to know what they did to continue the Terminator Franchise. The film started off on the right track but quickly took a detour. It lacked the proper mood and style of the first two films had and definitely lacked the punch. Storylines seemed to be thrown together and loose ends were tied up with sloppy knots (if they were even tied up at all). The acting in the film made up somewhat for the poor writing. Arnold's lines may seem a bit corny these days, but he still kicks ass and you can't have a Terminator film without him. Nick Stahl did a decent job, but I wonder why they couldn't get Eddie Furlong. The Terminator X was kind of cool, but you can't beat the T1000 or Arnold's character in the first Terminator. Claire Daines was a good addition to the movie. Linda Hamilton's character is missed in this movie too. All in all, if you like action with flat emotions behind it, it's not a bad movie. But it was a horrible injustice to what its predecessors built. The only intriguing event in the movie came with the ending scene. As good as it was, it was not good enough to save this film and continue the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End Of The World As You See It Comes Only At Dawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night and loved the laughs *and* the humour (one notes the difference is only at our expense). "T3" is unique for having the meanest bitch ever (um, the antagonist or bad guy sees us first and hates being known to you) at once getting back up harle after harle (a "harle" is a narrow escape felt but badly) and bent after bent (you figure that one out soon enough). The effects are riotous! I never laughed so hard at the decay fromwith. Anyway, the semi-moral here is the future I told you to forget of (well done) is now being refocused as the past that plagues us firstly. We wake to new each day and fear losing what we have to it yet again. Fear that only. I never see the day that doesn't hurt us for being and having been. Lose it to your wonder. You don't have enough of anything to make it count. That is the movie's message: Leave it to be and on each day forget. As an afterthought, thanks millions for Arnold once again approaching the hapless skin-naked for clothes and carrier and then bearing no fruit. The Elton John glasses were hilarious and that "talk to the hand" line well-placed. I honor this. PPS: The male lead is son of actors Chris Stone ("The Fog") and Dee Wallace ("E.T.") - the kid "The Howling" made? Yup.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard they were making 'Terminator 3' without James Cameron (the first two's co-writer and director) I immediately knew that this movie wouldn't come close to the the perfection that was 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day', a movie that in my mind is one of the greatest films ever made. So I put that out of my mind. But as the film neared release, I gained an excitement I didn't think would generate from the film. I became excited about it. It looked good. And while I didn't really think about it as the movie was being made, I had suddenly felt that this movie would be good enough to be recognized as a true edition to the franchise. Even with new writers and a new director. And my feeling paid off. While not as good as 'T2', the film is very impressive in its own right. Questions about the sequel were being answered. Like, why would more Terminators come back? Haven't we seen all there is to see? It even put new insight into the story of John Conner. I honestly didn't care what he was up to since the second movie, but now I did. Most importantly, it doesn't dwell on what the first two flicks did, which was 'Terminator chases heroes, heroes run away'. It propelled the story forward. The action was top notch and had one kick ass chase scene (every summer movie does nowadays, so it's a task to produce an exciting one). My favorite part was the T-X. The new Terminator in town, played by the beautiful Kristanna Loken, who's powers are far more advanced then previous Terminators. She played a big part in me enjoying the movie. While I'd like to highlight why, that would be spoiling it. Nick Stahl does a very convincing job at taking over the role of John Conner that was vacated by Ed Furlong. And the new addition to the pack, Kate Brewster (Clarie Danes) holds her own to make her character likeable and interesting. To be frank, I didn't think she'd have anything to bring to the table, but she proved me wrong. Overall, I was very pleased with all involved for making a worthwhile sequel, 12 years after the last movie was released! Keeping audiences interested, with such a gap in the story was a daunting task. But they delivered in spades. Even James Cameron was pleased with the result (and he hated Alien 3, he made Alien 2). So he isn't just saying that. The movie leaves open for a Terminator 4. As long as they continue to move forward with the story and not just repeat past gimmicks, I'm sure it will be good. To conclude, I love this film, and like it better than the first but not the second. I hope to see more of Kristanna in other movies...if you know what I meanRATING: *** out of ****</fullReview>

Still, unfortunatenot to see Edward Furlong, although Nick Stahl was good andLinda Hamilton was sorely missed. However, the action was justgreat and the film was so much more exciting that any action flickI'd seen in years - because it was pure popcorn and escapism, nohidden agendas or deep subtleties - just straight, solid well-madeentertainment and that has been lacking for a while (not theentertainment, just the well-made part!).

I think T3 separated itself from the plot and made up crap that was never meant to be in the series.Oh yeah, and Dr. Silberman makes a cameo in the movie... just long enough to ask Kate Brewster if she thinks the terminator is real, and then a fight breaks out, he sees the terminator again and goes running off into the background like a scene from Benny Hill. 100% Pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first heard that the third installment of the Terminator series was without James Cameron, and Linda Hamilton i wasnt expecting much of a installment.The first two films are both science fiction classics, and it is hard to match that. The movie is about John Conner(Stahl)who is living in complete isolation or "off the grid" as he calls it. Who ends up in a weird way reuniting with an old friend Kate Brewster(Danes). Soon after there meeting Kate an John find themselves in a race for there lives aganist the TX(Lokken), who is the most advanced killing machine yet, however help is not far off. The T-800(ah-nold) soon comes in an saves the day. Now with the verge of skynet taking over John, Kate, and Terminator must try an stop Judgement Day(again). The movie is filled with wall to wall action, with a chase seen like none you have ever seen. The acting is very good all around. Nick Stahl does a good job of a young man having trouble accepting his fate, Clare Danes does an excellent job of the girl who at first is lost an scared but turns out to be a kick ass help. Arnold is still very effective at being the buffed up Terminator, An Kristanna Lokken does a good job as the very lethal TX. James Cameron's direction is missed, but Jonathan Mostow does a fine job of handling it. All in all T3 measures up to be a worthy entry in the Terminator franchise, what i thought would be crap turned out to be a good action film that doesnt miss a beat. ***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most unrealistic detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I enjoyed this movie immensely. It was no Terminator 2, but I am a huge fan of any Terminator movie. Here are my 3 contributions-1. EVERYONE seems to be addressing the issue of John Connor's age discrepancies. Yes, it makes no sense that John was born in '85 and blew up Cyberdine at age 13 (making it 1998) and is now in his early 20's. It's a detail that should be overlooked. James Cameron had a great idea for a movie- what was he supposed to do, wait several years so John would be old enough to be a punky young teenager, or make the movie in the early 90's and have John a 7 year old boy? Movies are made to entertain. If movies were based on ONLY fact, they would be dull. And if you are going into a movie about time traveling robots, you have to check some of your cynicism at the door.2. I really want there to be a Terminator 4. It could wrap everything up and show the humans defeating the machines. It would be hard to do, because the actors have aged, but how cool would it be to incorporate all the time traveling missions? Show John sending Kyle, show John reprogramming and sending a T800 to protect himself as a 13 year old, and show what happens with the Terminator eventually killing John and then being reprogrammed by Kate to come back to 2003? The whole thing with John being killed by the T800 was really left open, maybe for a sequel. Why would Kate send the exact robot that killed John back to protect him? It seems almost like you're asking for trouble. If a machine killed my spouse, the last thing I would want to do would be to use that machine in a way that would help me in any way. I would want it destroyed as soon as possible. Perhaps Kate was left with no choice. Or perhaps she didn't even know that the T800 she had captured killed John. All things that are left for a part 4.3. Finally, here is what I found to be most unrealistic about the film. I haven't seen anyone else comment about this. Why would John Connor, a young man who lives more or less like a bum and apparently works construction, KNOW HOW TO OPERATE A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing about this film I wanna point out is how difficult it must be to follow up on two already perfect films. It must be a task that can keep any script writer and any director awake at night.This film is brilliant! Alone it stands out as totally brilliant, but seen in the aspect of it's two processors it has more than a little bit of a hard time following up and keeping appearances.The choice of casting Nick Stahl was John Connor is not a very bright choice - sure could do a lot worse, but also a lot better. Casting a female model(?) to play the evil Terminator looks a little lame. I would much rather have gone with Juliette Lewis or someone else of her character. She is too clean cut and too faceless, somehow.Anyway, STILL a way above average film. I'd give it 8.5/10 still, but then again I might be biased caused I was raised with these films and in my eyes they can NEVER be bad</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many things bothered me about T3, which to describe would probably take more than a maximum of 1,000 words. One little nitpick really stood out for me, however, and seems indicative of everything wrong with the movie. T3 insists upon John Connor's being 13 years old and in the 8th grade during the events of T2. I went back to my DVD, and he is clearly identified during T2 as being ten years old. I was willing to let that go, and say it wasn't really a big deal, but then I realized there's a bigger problem. The original Terminator film clearly and unambiguously takes place in 1984. John Connor is clearly and unambiguously born in 1985. Judgment Day, before the events of T2 change the course of the fictional history, was clearly and unambiguously going to take place on August 29, 1997. (T3 still accepts that date as correct, with the whole gratuitous leukemia thing, which I won't get into). It took me all of a few seconds to see what was wrong with this picture. If John Connor was conceived in 1984 and born in 1985, he wouldn't turn 13 until a year AFTER the world was destroyed by a nuclear holocaust. The world looked in pretty good shape in T2 considering, huh? And if Sarah was supposedly diagnosed with cancer three years before 1997, John would have been nine years old -- younger than he originally was during T2, while Sarah would probably have been in Pescadero.Why is this important? In the course of sequels, things are going to get tweaked to make the new movie work. Certain things may get re-written or reinterpreted. But the anchoring dates of 1984 and 1997 are basic and important facts about the world the Terminator series is set in. The filmmakers were paid incredible amounts of money to make this film, and either couldn't be bothered to do simple math that an elementary schooler could do, or they did do the math, and decided to arbitrarily ignore it, to make a change that really has no pay-off and adds no meaning to the film. I paid $5 to see this film. They're getting back millions. And I offhandedly know more about the world of the film, and care more about it, than they do. This shows a casual contempt for anyone who cared enough about the first two movies to actually bother paying attention to the plot. The exact same people whose money they anticipated taking when they decided to make another sequel in the first place. This isn't a movie with any meaning: it's a cynical cash cow.</fullReview>

There are very few lengendry directors and James Cameron is one of them.And so i always knew that no matter how hard they try, T3 will never be what it would have been if James Cameron had made it.The story is pretty much the same as t2 if not for the ending. Arnie is back and does his job perfectly. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes work well together. Kristanna Loken is a very sexy women but just not scary enough. Robert Patrick's T-1000 is the scariest terminator of all time and all others will only be derivatives of his performance.T3 is a neat effort but it still is just an 'effort' at re-creating James Cameron's magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was of the school of thought that this film was going to be terrible. Arnie was too old; Jim Cameron wasn't on board; Nick Stahl was in Disturbing Behaviour! These are the sorts of things an ordinary movie could not get over.T3 is not ordinary.The action sequences are spectacular, even more so because they are (take note Wachowski's and Lucas) REAL! Obviously some CG effects were used but it wasn't entirely CG (which might have worked for Neo) and that in itself was a treat.The director builds a real sense of pressure and a real sense of style right up until the decidedly non-Hollywood ending, which even its predecessor did, the direction is just on the right side of post-modern irony and the performances (bar one) are great.This leads us nicely onto the big man himself... Mr. (Governor?) Schwarzenegger is now 56 years old, he first played the T-100 in 1984 and he has progressed through the years into a different actor to when he started. All in all a tough assignment! He manages to just make us believe he is the T-100 again, it's amazing. I forgot he was Arnie; all I knew was that if he wanted to he could have snapped John Connor's neck like a twig (good thing if Edward Furlong was involved).Just for fairness though I must point out what I thought the weak link was Kristanna Loken, now before anyone starts I have nothing against models-turned-actors but in this case Miss Loken should have kept her mouth shut and her legs waxed. She is just not Robert Patrick, she doesn't ever have the sense of malice that he managed to put into the T-1000 and for that she fails.Anyways that's my quick review; I do recommend you go see the film when it comes out over here you really won't be disappointed</fullReview>

This film doesn't have subplots, it has drive bys. I'm actually ashamed that my money contributed to the inevitable decision to make another crappy sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first heard that the third installment of the Terminator series was without James Cameron, and Linda Hamilton i wasnt expecting much of a installment.The first two films are both science fiction classics, and it is hard to match that. The movie is about John Conner(Stahl)who is living in complete isolation or "off the grid" as he calls it. Who ends up in a weird way reuniting with an old friend Kate Brewster(Danes). Soon after there meeting Kate an John find themselves in a race for there lives aganist the TX(Lokken), who is the most advanced killing machine yet, however help is not far off. The T-800(ah-nold) soon comes in an saves the day. Now with the verge of skynet taking over John, Kate, and Terminator must try an stop Judgement Day(again). The movie is filled with wall to wall action, with a chase seen like none you have ever seen. The acting is very good all around. Nick Stahl does a good job of a young man having trouble accepting his fate, Clare Danes does an excellent job of the girl who at first is lost an scared but turns out to be a kick ass help. Arnold is still very effective at being the buffed up Terminator, An Kristanna Lokken does a good job as the very lethal TX. James Cameron's direction is missed, but Jonathan Mostow does a fine job of handling it. All in all T3 measures up to be a worthy entry in the Terminator franchise, what i thought would be crap turned out to be a good action film that doesnt miss a beat. ***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I enjoyed this movie immensely. It was no Terminator 2, but I am a huge fan of any Terminator movie. Here are my 3 contributions-1. EVERYONE seems to be addressing the issue of John Connor's age discrepancies. Yes, it makes no sense that John was born in '85 and blew up Cyberdine at age 13 (making it 1998) and is now in his early 20's. It's a detail that should be overlooked. James Cameron had a great idea for a movie- what was he supposed to do, wait several years so John would be old enough to be a punky young teenager, or make the movie in the early 90's and have John a 7 year old boy? Movies are made to entertain. If movies were based on ONLY fact, they would be dull. And if you are going into a movie about time traveling robots, you have to check some of your cynicism at the door.2. I really want there to be a Terminator 4. It could wrap everything up and show the humans defeating the machines. It would be hard to do, because the actors have aged, but how cool would it be to incorporate all the time traveling missions? Show John sending Kyle, show John reprogramming and sending a T800 to protect himself as a 13 year old, and show what happens with the Terminator eventually killing John and then being reprogrammed by Kate to come back to 2003? The whole thing with John being killed by the T800 was really left open, maybe for a sequel. Why would Kate send the exact robot that killed John back to protect him? It seems almost like you're asking for trouble. If a machine killed my spouse, the last thing I would want to do would be to use that machine in a way that would help me in any way. I would want it destroyed as soon as possible. Perhaps Kate was left with no choice. Or perhaps she didn't even know that the T800 she had captured killed John. All things that are left for a part 4.3. Finally, here is what I found to be most unrealistic about the film. I haven't seen anyone else comment about this. Why would John Connor, a young man who lives more or less like a bum and apparently works construction, KNOW HOW TO OPERATE A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so incredibly awesome and I want those who are about to see it to remember that this movie is a continuation of Terminator 2 only years later, and so all the characters and story lines have been already set up. The problem people have with this film is they don't understand that this a continuation into the saga, and not a new beginning. All the elements of character they are looking for can be found in the previous Terminator films.The new begining and revolution that we need see will be in the next film because it should take place in another time era. Oh by the way, if Arnold is not in the next Terminator film (feature role!) then I recommend we boycott it.But T3 was excellent! Go watch it with this attitude and you'll have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some major spoilers in this comment. I left Terminator 3 feeling depressed, but that's a good thing. The story affected me just like the first one did.I was sad when Sarah Connor, pregnant, drove off into the desert with storm clouds building. I was also sad with the closing moments in this one, nuke missiles in pretty arcs coming down on the earth. It reminded me of the problems I had with the second movie. I didn't like Edward Furlong. His pleas to keep the Terminator alive in the end didn't sound convincing, like some boy whining. I like Nick Stahl better. But I do agree with others' opinion that the movie misses a strong character like Sarah or Kyle. It's a downer ending. After spending $170 million I think it's brave of them to keep it that way. On the other hand, it also opens the possibility of a T4, so maybe it's not brave but rather cunning of them. Mostow is pretty good. When John drops the beer bottle and that starts a segue to the future, when John rides the motorcycle and we barely see his face, or when they arrive at Crystal Peak and everything seems so dated, so "Dr. Strangelove" or even "Colossus, the Forbin Project" and finally, when I heard those last few lines, "it was software, there was no core". The movie won me over. I like this, maybe even better than the second one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched all three of the Terminator film today (July 9,2003), and found it quite impressive with the ending of Terminator 3, I didn't expected it. But I noticed that the writers made a mistake with John Connor's age, during Terminator 2, he was 10, if you watched the opening when the T-1000 (Robert Patrick)looks up Connor, John in the cop cars it has just acquired it says age:10 Date of Birth February 28,1985. So he was 10, not 13! But other than that there wasn't any large mistakes. But the write up (Plot) calls the Terminator played by Arnold Schwarzenegger the T-800 when he's a CSM-101 (Cyberdyne Systems Model 101). You find this out after John Connor first meets the The Terminator who has just rescued him from the T-1000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of this movie just bored me to tears. The wanton destruction just seemed like a crutch to hide the fact that the writers only came up with 30 minutes of material.Also, I'm sick to death of the "killing machine with breasts" idea that is in every action movie for the past three years. Slapping tight leather pants and spiked heel boots on a supermodel doesn't make her believable as an action star. It just looks silly. Where's Linda Hamilton when you need her? She was ripped, solid AND hot without wearing spiked heels.On the other hand, I liked the storyline and particularly liked the literal rise of the machines (even though it was only about 10 minutes long in the movie). The inevitability of Judgement Day was cool - I wish they had done more with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm about to spoil the whole movie for you, so read on at your own risk. If you were content with the ending of Terminator 2, I suggest that you have nothing at all to do with this movie. Aside the constant barrage of cliches and overall bad acting, the one thing that errked me more than anything is that Jonathan Mostow completly ignored the first two movies, and decided that he would make one that went completely against any of the ideals held sacred by most fans of the series. He decided that "Fate is what we make", and "The future is not set" were just too happy. In this movie we find John Conner 10 years after the last movie ended. He's a shell of a man, living day to day, staying 'below the radar'. He still has nightmares of the Judgement Day future, and his role in leading humanity's survivors to victory over the machines. He happens to end up in an animal hospital run by the daughter (Claire Danes) of the man who finally develops 'Skynet'. The T-X and a T-800 are both sent back to Kill/Protect John's lieutenants this time around. They both find Claire Danes and Nick Stahl at the same time, and the long chase begins. Blah Blah Blah... lot of fighting actio n CG stuff... guns... Arnold's infinite bag of Terminator saying cliches... you get the point. Anyway, John Conner find out that Claire Danes' father is the creator of 'SkyNet', and the group advances on the secret underground military complex where her father works. T-X follows, and first generation Terminator machines are involved, more fighting... Okay, well, to get to the point, finally, Claire's father sends her and John to the supposed location of the 'SkyNet' central brain, and they end up in a cave-room with nothing but outdated computers and enough food to live for a year or two underground. They both finally figure out that there was no stopping 'SkyNet' because it was an Odyssey 5 ripoff Artificial Intelligence virus, and not a program solely located in a single computer. So, Judgement Day was an inevitability in this movie, and all is pooped on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, but I really enjoyed Terminator 3. The key, I believe, was to go in expecting to be let down. 2003 has been and will continue to be a sequel-happy year, filled with instantly forgettable rehashes of successful films in order to see if lightning would strike twice, or thrice, or who knows how many more times. Since the first two Terminator films were so incredibly good and T2 ended on such a fantastic note, I didn't think another good entry into the Terminator franchise was possible, especially since a) Arnold isn't young anymore, b) Linda Hamilton was not involved, and c) neither was Jim Cameron. I was expecting a sub-par action flick with mediocre special effects and painfully shallow performances all around. While the amazing Linda Hamilton's presence was sorely missed, as was the direction (not necessarily the dialogue) of James Cameron, T3 really delivered! It was a great deal of fun and excitement, exactly what a summer moviegoer should want to see during a season known for idiot movies.I am very hard to please in the summertime since SO much trash comes out and most so-called films released between June and August insult my intelligence beyond forgiveness. While not as fresh, intriguing, and thought-provoking as the first two, Terminator 3 actually, surprisingly, had somewhat of a brain! The story was well-conceived, the special effects were out of the park incredible (given the budget, they'd BETTER have been!), Arnold was in great shape, and most strikingly, the performances were very strong indeed!While Arnold Schwarzenegger's speaking performance was limited mostly to expository dialogue, short commands or replies ("Negative", "Get down!", "Take the wheel"), he gave a delightfully campy, tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the part tailor-made for him. His deadpan quips were in the "lame and predictable, but can't help laughing and smiling" category. As for the stunts and his fights with the new T-X supervillain, or "Terminatrix" (played adequately enough by stone-faced stunner Kristanna Loken), they were outstanding. At times, the physical confrontations between the two make the classic fights between Arnold's T-101 and Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2 look like a schoolyard spat. I kept seeing dollar signs popping up with all the cars, buildings, etc. that were destroyed.Perhaps the most inspired casting, however, were Claire Danes as Kate Brewster and Nick Stahl as John Connor. I NEVER would have expected Claire Danes to fit well into a Terminator movie, but she was a gem! First of all, she's looking great these days. She has such attractive features, but in more of a classical way. Whereas Loken's looks make guys simply say, "She's hot!", Danes has more of the look of a girl that a respectable man would want to introduce to his family. She played her part excellently and remembered to have a good time doing it, as one can see while watching her.Nick Stahl was perfectly cast as reluctant hero John Connor. He had a look in his eyes of a man with a haunting past (and future) as the role requires. There was a wonderful sense of urgency and despair in his voice that told me that he understood the part completely. His character's frustration came through perfectly and I know purists say that Eddie Furlong should've played him, but I disagree. Furlong was okay as young John, but nowadays he just doesn't have a certain look that Conner should have (no offense to Eddie. loved him in American History X). Stahl has such a strong dark side, it's a shame the part of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episodes II and III didn't go to him, as he would have probably done very well.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. T3 packed a nice summer popcorn movie punch and a very clever ending. Considering the expectations and the dynamite of potentially alienating diehard Terminator fans, director Mostow, whose exciting 1997 B-movie Breakdown showed a great deal of promise, has earned his wings in the annals of action moviemaking.</fullReview>

The over-predictable plot and good sense of humor, combined with old-syle action makes the movie well worth seeing. The viewer gets everything he needs, served chilled, right on time. It's in the last 3 minutes where they spoil it. They could have just displayed "to be continued", but instead it seems they reached the end of the movie and had to make up an ending on the set.

		<fullReview>first off, i'd like to say that as purely an action sci-fi flick, t3 has enough firepower to blow u away. explosions aplenty, and a t-x babe to ogle at. wat more could a guy ask for? plenty more in fact. cut to the chase. t3 lacks the depth of the previous 2 terminator movies. its purely action and just a lil develpoment of storyline to set up for t4. the feelings n emotion werent half as strong as compared to t1 n 2, and i feel they really focused too much on action, throwing plot out the window. it is that mix of emotion and suspense that really made the first 2 classics, and it is sadly lacking here. the t-x wasnt as remotely scary as the t-1000 played by Robert Patrick and i felt that t3 really could have done without those awful one-liners. the mood of t3 just doesnt provide for it, and putting the funny moments just felt awkard. all in all, im really surprised they took 12 yrs to come up with nothing more than a summer popcorn flick. hope t4's good enuff to let me forget this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TERMINATOR 3 is not a bad film on it's own. The film sufferes from plot problems and continuity problems. TERMINATOR 3 is worth one view but it's definetly not a multiple viewing movie. TERMINATOR 1 and 2 are hard acts to follow in this film and this film does not recapture the grandure of either of those films. What i liked was the villian was more in step with the original terminator film. A popcorn and coke film T3 boasts hollywood stunts and eyegrabbing special effects. However many of the attributes that make this film worthwhile hurt it criticaally. The film has plot holes and continuity problems as big as nebraska. The plot holes are of a scope and breadth I would expect in a z grade action picture but not in a first rate action film; these plot holes I might add never show up in the first two films. TERMINATOR 3 is worth a view but buyer beware. If you expect a fun time with a popcorn and coke....by all means go. If you are a discriminating fan who looks deeper you may be dissappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly disappointing and disgustingly commercial 3rd film - shame on everyone involved (SPOILERS, but a true T2 fan should never see this one)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (which have no movie theatres) during the opening weekend of July 4th. Like many fans, the trailers left me afraid that the franchise's third installment would turn into another Alien 3. I heard reviews saying the film wasn't bad, and even actually good. I went into the theatre expecting an above-average summer action flick and a decent continuation of the Terminator saga. What I got was a big, fat stinker of a movie.There is a scene VERY early on in T3 that signals the start of the end.Like most people, I watched T2 on DVD before seeing T3 to "get in the mood." It held up very well, of course, and I even felt compelled to watch the documentaries on the making of the movie. Cameron said, "It's important not to go too far and make the Terminator a clown figure." Cameron gave Arnold plenty of sombre, stoic scenes to emphasize the serious nature of this killing machine.In T3, Arnie gets a set of clothes from someone else like in the first two movies. Except, this time, the victim isn't a street tough or a biker: it's a gay stripper at a ladies' bar. When Arnold reaches into the coat for a pair of sunglasses, he pulls out ridiculous Elton John-esque shades. People in the audience chuckled, but I knew in my heart that they were making fun of one of the most memorable villains/heroes ever at the movie's expense.T3 plays like one of those movies shown on the brilliant cartoon "The Critic" - cornball humor, overdone action, and little underlying meaning. Mostow, while obviously a fan of the material, doesn't have much in the way of execution. The trademark Terminator feel is gone; no more cold blues, gritty blacks, and warm colors. The pacing of the movie is okay, but the "look" of the movie is all wrong and feels artificial.That brings me to the sad part of the review. CGI SHOULD BE BANNED FROM MOVIES FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. Why do the special effects of T2, a movie made more than a decade ago, look more realistic than T3? In a move that will inevitably be likened to "The Phantom Menace," Mostow overuses CGI almost from the very start. The TX is completely unbelievable as a deadly weapon - she looks more like a video game character. The nuclear holocaust of T2, one of the finest depictions of a nuclear blast ever put to film, is a computer-generated mess that looks really, really bad in T3. The future war scenes, once gritty and intense, are actually kind of boring. The stunts and fighting, once rooted in some of the best practical effects work in the business, are almost all obviously done on a blue screen or in a computer. I mean, THE "BATTLE ACROSS TIME" SHOW AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS (also directed by Cameron) looks better than this movie! (and it was more satisfying...)Arnold and the cast do an okay job with the stuff written for them. Claire Danes and Nick Stahl worked well, but why couldn't they hire somebody that looked like Eddie Furlong? Leonardo DiCaprio (of all people) would've been a better choice, since he's a dead ringer for Edward and even worked with Claire Danes in "Romeo + Juliet". Kristanna Loken lacks the menace and presence of Robert Patrick, even though she says even fewer lines (she doesn't even talk for the last half of the movie!). Arnold still looks good, but (and this is partially the script's fault) you never feel like he's Terminator - he feels like Arnold. The bit players feel okay but slightly hackneyed. There's a cameo by Dr. Silberman for the fans, but Silberman doesn't feel like the Silberman in the past two movies.That brings the problem of continuity. The Terminator POV screens in this one look nothing like the first two. The music is all different - I long for Brad Fiedel's driving techno-industrial score, not Marco Beltrami's forgettable drivel. I am definitely not happy with the whole idea of Connor's "lieutenants" - why the hell does Connor have to save the world, anyway? If he has more than half a dozen lieutenants, couldn't someone else take his place?Surprisingly, the story as a whole isn't bad. I'm kind of miffed that they threw out the whole "the future's not set" angle, but the ending was decent. It's just that the silly, botched execution of an inexperienced, b-grade director brings down the film.2 out of four stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first and liked the second Terminator movies; this one had trite dialogue, halfway fleshed-out characters, and no dramatic tension. Hollywood seems to not only have forgotten, but stopped caring about writing characters that the audience is going to care about. I am all for watching cars getting blown up, chase scenes, and smashing into buildings, and robots shooting everyone in sight - just make me care about what is happening to the people on the screen, OK? To be fair, there were some funny moments, and the face-off between Arnold and the female robot at the end was interesting, but unfortunately, by that time, it was too little, too late. What is really sad is to read how much everyone enjoyed the movie; it's too bad our standards for entertainment have deteriorated to the degree that quick editing, special effects, and constant movement without benefit of plot or coherent character development passes for decent moviemaking. I sound like an old fart (I'm not), but I do know the difference between a good action movie and this fraud that Hollywood asks us to believe is a good action movie. If I could, I would write to the studio and ask for my money back - too bad I can't get the two hours of my life back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Terminator 2 had closed the series, I was very concerned this would destroy everything Cameron intended. He was against it, after all. Well, my curiosity got the best of me, and I went to see it on the 4th of July, pretty much shaking in my boots.I'll get the pros out of the way first. This movie had me watching with a shark's grin the whole time.Schwarzenegger is effortlessly charming again. He can play a cyborg like no other. The only role he can act as, really.I liked Nick Stahl better as John Connor. Eddie Furlong got on my nerves throughout T2 with his annoying wise-ass attitude; Stahl seemed more mature and I bought him.Claire Danes, obviously replacing Sarah Connor as the female role, also surprised me. The girl from the short lived series My So-Called Life. Claire-freakin'-Danes. I never thought I'd see the day when I said that she was a decent actress.The movie's pace is better than T2's by far. A bit of humor is also thrown in, none of it very offbeat.The story is good, considering it being an independent effort. And what an ending! One of the best recent endings I've seen.Now for the cons, ladies and gentlemen.I thought the Terminatrix was an cataclysmically lame idea, and I happened to be right. Ms. Loken is indeed an incredibly sexy woman, but that was the whole problem with her. She gave off far too much sex appeal. Many corny lines (one such gem being "I like your gun") that she spouted didn't help matters. She also shamelessly mimicked Robert Patrick so much it was almost comical. What a damned shame. If she was on the level of the T-1000 this movie may have had the legs to be the second best of the series.Besides that, I have nothing negative to say except that the plot holes are just as staggering as they are in T2.Overall a fun movie but the least of the series without a doubt. It could have been so much better.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without Cameron touch, movie seems mechanical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really say I was disappointed. The movie turned out much like was expected for any Summer movie action sequel. I saw this movie expecting big explosions and cheesy one-liners, and it certainly delivered. But as a moviegoer, that doesn't do it for me. I like a good story to back up the action, and I did think I could get that from a Terminator movie, as has happened in the past.That's why this movie needed Cameron. It's Cameron's story. Without him, this movie falls flat. It all feels too uneventful for a movie about the arrival of Judgement Day, the most important day in human history. This whole movie takes place in only one day. In that one day two Terminators come and go, a military secret is exposed, John Connor leaves his life as a recluse and regains his passion for saving the world and falls in love with a previously unknown character, Kate Brewster. That's the most disturbing part of the movie - this new character that turns out to be one of the most important aspects of the human resistance. Coincidentally, she was in fact a part of John's life before and could have just as much been a part of T2. But she wasn't, and we have no reason to care for her. Not only that, but she seems all too willing to take on her role as a leader. At the beginning of the day she was running an animal clinic and she happily engaged. At the end of the day, her fiance has died (which she gets over quickly), she falls in love with another man she barely knows, and she has an overwhelming fervor to lead the human race. It doesn't work. This can't be what Cameron envisioned for his characters. Don't get me started on the stupid comedic one-liners that feel sorely out of place for a Terminator movie.Overall, this movie left me wanting more from it. I can't say that the ending wasn't a bit emotional, but it would have been so much more so with the inclusion of the original score. And let's not forget James Cameron.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the movie, and without blowing it for those that haven't seen it, I have to say that this movie completes the trilogy for The Terminator Series. There were many questions unanswered in T2, but some where answered in T3. I was surprised by the ending. I don't want to be a spoiler so I won't say much.Of the three movies I believe that this is the best one. You have to go see it, no question.There is some speculation that there might be a fourth movie. I sure hope not, because after the way T3 ended I don't see how it could possibly be followed by a fourth.

		<fullReview>first off, i'd like to say that as purely an action sci-fi flick, t3 has enough firepower to blow u away. explosions aplenty, and a t-x babe to ogle at. wat more could a guy ask for? plenty more in fact. cut to the chase. t3 lacks the depth of the previous 2 terminator movies. its purely action and just a lil develpoment of storyline to set up for t4. the feelings n emotion werent half as strong as compared to t1 n 2, and i feel they really focused too much on action, throwing plot out the window. it is that mix of emotion and suspense that really made the first 2 classics, and it is sadly lacking here. the t-x wasnt as remotely scary as the t-1000 played by Robert Patrick and i felt that t3 really could have done without those awful one-liners. the mood of t3 just doesnt provide for it, and putting the funny moments just felt awkard. all in all, im really surprised they took 12 yrs to come up with nothing more than a summer popcorn flick. hope t4's good enuff to let me forget this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TERMINATOR 3 is not a bad film on it's own. The film sufferes from plot problems and continuity problems. TERMINATOR 3 is worth one view but it's definetly not a multiple viewing movie. TERMINATOR 1 and 2 are hard acts to follow in this film and this film does not recapture the grandure of either of those films. What i liked was the villian was more in step with the original terminator film. A popcorn and coke film T3 boasts hollywood stunts and eyegrabbing special effects. However many of the attributes that make this film worthwhile hurt it criticaally. The film has plot holes and continuity problems as big as nebraska. The plot holes are of a scope and breadth I would expect in a z grade action picture but not in a first rate action film; these plot holes I might add never show up in the first two films. TERMINATOR 3 is worth a view but buyer beware. If you expect a fun time with a popcorn and coke....by all means go. If you are a discriminating fan who looks deeper you may be dissappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly disappointing and disgustingly commercial 3rd film - shame on everyone involved (SPOILERS, but a true T2 fan should never see this one)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (which have no movie theatres) during the opening weekend of July 4th. Like many fans, the trailers left me afraid that the franchise's third installment would turn into another Alien 3. I heard reviews saying the film wasn't bad, and even actually good. I went into the theatre expecting an above-average summer action flick and a decent continuation of the Terminator saga. What I got was a big, fat stinker of a movie.There is a scene VERY early on in T3 that signals the start of the end.Like most people, I watched T2 on DVD before seeing T3 to "get in the mood." It held up very well, of course, and I even felt compelled to watch the documentaries on the making of the movie. Cameron said, "It's important not to go too far and make the Terminator a clown figure." Cameron gave Arnold plenty of sombre, stoic scenes to emphasize the serious nature of this killing machine.In T3, Arnie gets a set of clothes from someone else like in the first two movies. Except, this time, the victim isn't a street tough or a biker: it's a gay stripper at a ladies' bar. When Arnold reaches into the coat for a pair of sunglasses, he pulls out ridiculous Elton John-esque shades. People in the audience chuckled, but I knew in my heart that they were making fun of one of the most memorable villains/heroes ever at the movie's expense.T3 plays like one of those movies shown on the brilliant cartoon "The Critic" - cornball humor, overdone action, and little underlying meaning. Mostow, while obviously a fan of the material, doesn't have much in the way of execution. The trademark Terminator feel is gone; no more cold blues, gritty blacks, and warm colors. The pacing of the movie is okay, but the "look" of the movie is all wrong and feels artificial.That brings me to the sad part of the review. CGI SHOULD BE BANNED FROM MOVIES FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. Why do the special effects of T2, a movie made more than a decade ago, look more realistic than T3? In a move that will inevitably be likened to "The Phantom Menace," Mostow overuses CGI almost from the very start. The TX is completely unbelievable as a deadly weapon - she looks more like a video game character.

		<fullReview>This movie was definately missing something without James Cameron and Linda Hamilton. The special effects were fantastic, and everything else was lukewarm. There was the fair share of humor in this movie that wasn't in the earlier ones...our society has made such a joke out of Arnold's mannerisms and accent in this movie that they movie itself makes fun of it. For example, when Nick Stahl is asking the Terminator if he remembers John from before, and he's like "Do the words 'Asta la Vista, baby' mean anything to you?" and so forth. This movie also takes advantage of the fact that the T-X is a really hot blonde 5'11 woman. Very corny parts with her include when she gets pulled over and, spotting the Victoria's Secret "What is Sexy" billboard, makes her breasts grow about 5 inches...and then when the cop comes she says in her seductive voice, "I like your GUN." In terms of acting, it's what you'd expect from a Terminator movie...Arnold IS the Terminator, so no complaints there, and Nick Stahl fills in nicely as John Connor, though I think I speak for a lot of people when I say it would have been nice to see Eddie Furlong again. Claire Danes was a little more sketchy. A lot of her movies have been either flops (Polish Wedding, the Mod Squad) or just plain bad (Brokedown Palace), but she has made enough of a career out of pretty good movies (the Hours, Romeo and Juliet, Igby Goes Down) that I don't think the hard core action is her thing. She's like a little girl in the movie and just looks uncomfortable blowing things up with machine guns...although the script has given her some scenes that were so lame that it would be hard for anyone to act them well ( ie telling the T-X to "Just die you bitch!"). Overall, this movie was alright...the humor and action make it enjoyable, and any hardcore Terminator fan will enjoy.</fullReview>

And what makes it better, a cool story that I've followed for 20 years (since I was a kid)! I'm so glad they didn't go "hollywood" on the storyline. If they had, I would hate this movie with a passion. I give them credit for keeping it "true". For those who have seen the movie, I hope you know what I'm referring to. If you don't know what I mean, then you certainly did not understand the movie!I'll admit going into this movie I was reluctant to "like" it. The original "Terminator" director did not work on this, Linda Hamilton did not sign on, plotline was sort of "typical", and a "bad chick" terminator was kind of lame. But I liked it. If anything, it's fun. If it wasn't summer, I might give it 4 out of 5 stars. But its summer and I'm in the mood for this stuff! 5 stars out of 5!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonathan Mostow (U-571) did a fantastic job. I wish Jim Cameron would commend him for taking care of his films, Despite that I really missed his directing so as Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn and Brad Fiedel. Nick Stahl did a good job playing the adult John Connor, So as Kristanna Loken playing T-X...I Love you! And for Claire Danes, I wish the director had chosen another leading lady she doesn't look tough enough.Arnold thanks for doing a sequel again. T3 has an ending with an apocalyptic note, yet filled with messages of Hope. Meaning, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose in a crisis that you're facing in life, but how you survive and endure in those trials and still keep on fighting...If they decide to do more sequels, they must finish the last chapter of the whole termiator saga with a happy ending where humans triumph over the machines eventually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I liked this movie. Granted it was very similar to number 2, even had similar scenes in it, but at least it was harmless fun. And, of course, it had big Arn in it. The supporting stars were OK too, not brilliant, but not dire.If you liked the second of the series, then this one will not disappoint you (unless you were angling for something different). Some of it is a little trite and, needless to say, it is almost entirely predictable, right down to the final scenes. But its Arnie, doing what Arnie does best.....breaking things.There are some nice views of the prototype hunter-killers that characterised the flashbacks in the second movie. But I swear one of the T1's shrugged after looking down a corridor for the intruders (Arnie and Co). Might have been my imagination, though.Anyway, good fun, but nothing new. Now all we have to do is wait for the fourth installment - yep, it ain't over with this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While T-1 delivered an action-packed and original story on an amazingly low budget, and T-2 added considerable depth and spectacular special effects, the third element of the T-Trilogy seems to be a step backwards.It's not all bad, mind you. All the usual action features are well done and the car chase scene is spectacular (if slightly drawn out). John Connor is also a convincing dropout trying to avoid his fate - a nice contrast with the sometimes annoyingly self-confident Connor of T-2.But what this installment fails to deliver is any real innovation. It ties up a few loose ends and adds a few arbitrary twists, but it just felt a little empty in comparison to the first two.If you're a sci-fi, Arnold or action flick fan, then this is a must-see.

Nick Stahl plays a believable, somewhat scruffy-looking John Connor, and Kristanna Loken (T-X) and Claire Danes (Kate) are welcome additions to the Terminator Universe.In keeping with the machines' evolution, the T-X seems to be an amalgamation of the T-800 (endoskeleton) and T-1000 (liquid metal) with its own unique abilities--it can form its own weapons. There are at least 3: plasma cannon, flamethrower, and chainsaw. It can also control other machines.Arnold is back in top form...Now, when can we expect to see another Conan film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from T3. I don't agree with the users who compare this movie favorably to the first two. Unlike the T1 and T2, there is really no emotion at all. The ending of T2 was really very touching. You even cared about Arnold the Robot! In T3, there is no real character development, and except for saving the human race, in this film, there is no one to root for because there is no emotional connection with the human characters, not to mention with the terminator or terminatrix. This film is much more violent than the others, and the action has no real purpose, direction, or shape. The filmmaker seems to think that loud means exciting, but it got very wearing after awhile, not to mention repetitive. I even fell asleep in the first half-hour, despite the noise! James Cameron, where were you when we needed you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good sequel with a good story and great ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit, I was sure T3 was going to blow because Cameron wasn't directing it, and that the plot initially sounded like T2's, and was basically going to be a rehash. I was afraid this movie was going to destroy the Terminator series. Thankfully, it did not. Terminator 3 combines great acting, a story that explains itself well, and excellent action scenes.The acting is very good. Nick Stahl plays a rather reluctant and fearful John Connor who refuses to believe that he is still being hunted by a Terminator even though cyberdyne was destroyed. Arnold Schwarzenneger, the star of the show, is also very good, retaining his deadpan, robotic behavior and tone of voice. It seems the resistance turned on his learning computer before they sent him back in time, because he is able to, well, learn in this movie (this makes more sense if you saw the uncut T2). This makes for some comic relief, that, while making the movie seem a little lighthearted at first, does not disrupt its overall dark nature. Claire Danes is also pretty good. She isn't your typical squeamish female character. While she is more fearful than John Connor, she ultimately becomes a more determined character after realizing her role, much like Sarah Connor in T1. Overall the acting is well done, and it certainly does help convey the whole despairty of the situation, and the characters' determination to accomplish their goals.The story was pulled off well. T2 saw John Connor realize his role, and become a less worthless person into a someone who can actually make decisions. As you will see in T3, John's first real test comes in. I can't say much more without spoiling the whole thing. While the story isn't as powerful and insightful as T2's, it is much darker and is filled with dispair. The ending was very moving, with the way the narration was done, and the tone of the music.The action scenes, whose quality is essential to any Terminator movie, were extremely well done. The car chase was very well done, because it was fast, and each crash and slam was done with the right camera angle and sound effect that you can feel the impact yourself. The camera changes are done quite quickly, but it maintains a wide angle on things, and a close angle on others so that the chase is effectively conveyed to be chaotic and messy, but at the same time you can see what is going on. The fight scenes were also good. Like the car chase, each punch and slam has a huge impact in sound and visuals. I mean, when you see one of the terminators get punched or thrown across a room, you can really feel the impact in you! They were also well cheographed. While the matrix films have a balletic and lightning fast quality to their fight scenes, the Terminator films' fights have a more brutal and hard hitting quality. Overall the action scenes were very well done. There was none of that shaky camera nonsense which I get so sick of.There is of course, a noticable flaw to the film. While T2 explained how the T-1000 was able to track the characters no matter where they went, T3 does not. The TX shows up almost everywhere the protagonists go without explaining how it found out(Except for the cemetary). I hope that a DVD release will in some way explain this.T3 is a worthy sequel. It doesn't have the epic quality that Cameron produced, it is still well done. To the regular viewer it is a great popcorn flick that isn't your standard hollywood action flick fair. To the terminator fan, it is a good medium to forward the story of Terminator and to show Ah-nuld kicking arse again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hope Cameron is cursing Mostow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Abysmal.James Cameron's first two Terminator movies were among the greatest action movies made and are compelling even after numerous viewings as Cameron knows how to tell a story.Jonathan Mostow, along with hordes of writers and producers, creates a typical Hollywood action movie that captures none of the feel of the originals. It seems as if no thought were given to any aspect of this movie except its special effects. The pacing is terrible, removing any sense of dread or feeling of suspense. The acting is likewise cardboard and you feel no sympathy for Connor or Brewster. Bizarrely, Arnold, through use of comic gimmicks, bad writing, and little acting, is totally unconvincing as a robot (the one role he seemed able to successfully play) and becomes mostly buffoonish.If this movie had been made without Terminator in the title and without Arnold in the cast, it would not have made $100, as it's totally uninspired and unconvincing. Instead, people are flocking to it to for the wrong reasons. James Cameron (with help from Linda Hamilton, William Wisher Jr, and ideas culled from Harlan Ellison) was what made the original movies works of art. It was not the special effects or Arnold. It was good storytelling.Perhaps rather than hoping Cameron is cursing Mostow for the terrible quality of this sequel, I should be hoping that Mostow is weeping at what at hack he is, knowing he contributed to a multi-million dollar scam against movie goers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well...it's certainly funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was definately missing something without James Cameron and Linda Hamilton. The special effects were fantastic, and everything else was lukewarm. There was the fair share of humor in this movie that wasn't in the earlier ones...our society has made such a joke out of Arnold's mannerisms and accent in this movie that they movie itself makes fun of it. For example, when Nick Stahl is asking the Terminator if he remembers John from before, and he's like "Do the words 'Asta la Vista, baby' mean anything to you?" and so forth. This movie also takes advantage of the fact that the T-X is a really hot blonde 5'11 woman. Very corny parts with her include when she gets pulled over and, spotting the Victoria's Secret "What is Sexy" billboard, makes her breasts grow about 5 inches...and then when the cop comes she says in her seductive voice, "I like your GUN." In terms of acting, it's what you'd expect from a Terminator movie...Arnold IS the Terminator, so no complaints there, and Nick Stahl fills in nicely as John Connor, though I think I speak for a lot of people when I say it would have been nice to see Eddie Furlong again. Claire Danes was a little more sketchy. A lot of her movies have been either flops (Polish Wedding, the Mod Squad) or just plain bad (Brokedown Palace), but she has made enough of a career out of pretty good movies (the Hours, Romeo and Juliet, Igby Goes Down) that I don't think the hard core action is her thing. She's like a little girl in the movie and just looks uncomfortable blowing things up with machine guns...although the script has given her some scenes that were so lame that it would be hard for anyone to act them well ( ie telling the T-X to "Just die you bitch!"). Overall, this movie was alright...the humor and action make it enjoyable, and any hardcore Terminator fan will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Summer Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible Vague Spoilers in my review/comments**Although not as great as parts 1 or 2, Terminator 3 is a terrific summer movie. Great action, mindless violence and pure wackiness. And what makes it better, a cool story that I've followed for 20 years (since I was a kid)! I'm so glad they didn't go "hollywood" on the storyline. If they had, I would hate this movie with a passion. I give them credit for keeping it "true". For those who have seen the movie, I hope you know what I'm referring to. If you don't know what I mean, then you certainly did not understand the movie!I'll admit going into this movie I was reluctant to "like" it. The original "Terminator" director did not work on this, Linda Hamilton did not sign on, plotline was sort of "typical", and a "bad chick" terminator was kind of lame. But I liked it. If anything, it's fun. If it wasn't summer, I might give it 4 out of 5 stars. But its summer and I'm in the mood for this stuff! 5 stars out of 5!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Useless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning, the absence of James Cameron and the two leading actors doomed the project. As expected, the tight framing and loss of focus in particularly quick shots and blue tint that are commonplace in Cameron films were not here. But that's just a stylistic complaint. Let's move on to what's really wrong with this film.It is not entertaining or engaging. You know the ending long before it has begun due to particular soliloquys. The characters aren't interesting, particularly with the T-X, which did not even evoke a smidgen of fear or worry other than replicating Robert Patrick's T-1000. The sequences play out like an average modern CGI action flick right off of the assembly line. There is no conflict, given that the previous concept of averting the future is negated by the new notion that nothing can avert Judgment Day. This just doesn't have the heart that made the previous films work.But what really bugs Arnold fans here is that unlike the previous films of his that made you laugh because he said lines, now he has so many one liners that it becomes annoying instead of humorous. The minute he puts on the star glasses in the opening, he immediately becomes a silly clown figure, which is bad for the character. Pointless cameos don't help matters either. While the previous films knew how to film an action sequence, this film just plays out like a longform BMW commercial. Ultimately, it is a waste of time and money. There is no reason for making this film other than a hefty paycheck. It is a useless picture in that it completely negates the previous films, as well as itself. I haven't felt this robbed by a film in quite some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see this film with my dad on the opening night, I was expecting another film with John Connor fighting to prevent judgement day, again! But I was pleasantly surprised! The start is hilarious when Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator) puts on the strippers glasses! The whole room was in knots!Nick Stahl (John Connor in Terminator 3) at first didn't appear as cute as Edward Furlong (John Connor in Terminator 2) but into the film his charm and boyish smile made him look like the cutest guy on earth! The acting in this film is superb and the story, way out as it seems, becomes believable and I couldn't find any plot inconsistencies.The ending in this film leaves the background for a 4th Terminator Film about John Connor (or his children as hinted) battling the machines in the war. This will undoubtedly make an excellent ending to the Terminator series. We might even see the Terminators and Kyle Reece (John's father from the first terminator film) getting sent back in time, which will be a little weird.This film is an excellent addition to the Terminator series. My only problem with it was it seems really weird at first and takes a while to sink in what is happening. Therefore I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, he said he'd be baaahck. And so he is. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in `Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.' And even though it's, well, not a titanic effort from James Cameron, it's a well-directed rock-'em sock-'em action piece directed by Jonathan Mostow (`U-571').This installment fits in quite well with the other two, and gives humorous nods to its predecessors along the way. It's set a decade after `Terminator 2' and is narrated by John Connor (Nick Stahl), who lives anonymously on the road, drifting from job to job as he tries to avoid the destiny his late mother, Sarah Connor, told him he faced, even though the two of them supposedly saved the world from a future in which machines tried to take over in a war with humankind. He has good reason to worry. A Terminatrix, a T-X (Kristanna Loken), appears in Beverly Hills to begin searching for Connor and also for Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a veterinarian answering a late-night emergency call. Kate finds John in her office, and ends up locking him in a cage while she tries to tend a sick cat. But the late-model, nearly indestructible Terminatrix isn't the only visitor from the future. Hot on her heels it eh T-101 (Schwarzenegger), an older, more fragile model that's been sent to ensure that John and Kate survive.The chase/action sequences are outstanding -- if you're looking forward to a chase scene involving a crane that Schwarzenneger funded himself, you won't be disappointed. The character development is fun to watch, and, let's face it, here's Schwarzenegger again in the very role he was destined to play. Yes, he's no spring chicken, but he doesn't need to be -- he still looks great as the machine that's driven to complete its mission. There are a couple of great scenes involving sunglasses, two nods to the `I'll be baaahck' catchphrase, and more humor as the bewildered Kate begins to realize that this John Connor guy, with all his tales about robots and wars between people and machines, isn't completely insane.There's plenty of R-rated action, too, amidst tons of violence, explosions and gore. And yes, it sets the stage for a fourth installment. If that's what the future holds, I, for one, will be baaahck.</fullReview>

If I had to make a third terminator it would have taken place during the war, I don't blame James Cameron for not helming this third installment as far as he's concern he probably thought he was finished with the franchise, and if it's true that a fourth one is on the works and eventually will be made than I wouldn't be surprise if he would shoot himself for creating a monster.

		<shortDescription>This movie broke my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 caused some reflection on my part. Normally I don't go see a movie and feel like that after the credits start to roll.Unfortunately, the reflection didn't have much to do with the quality of the film itself.Certain films are near and dear to us. For me it's films like The Princess Bride, Aliens, Casablanca, and the Terminator pictures. You've seen them until they feel like an old friend. And to find out someone is going to tinker with them makes you nervous. In the case of Terminator 3, the film leaves you feeling like you got kicked in the gut. Maybe it's not fair to judge the film against my memories, or for that matter the quality of the other films, but the film makers chose to produce it and I paid my eight bucks for the right to pass judgement.Director Jonathan Mostow should have thought more on this: If you chose to create a sequel to an existing film series, I would hope that you are doing it to actually move the story forward, and not to make a buck. I'll assume he wasn't. Films like Alien 3 (which ironically was another sequel based on a Cameron directed gem) tossed the previous film's ideas aside and did nothing new or interesting with the story and characters. Terminator 3 sadly treads the same ground, except we've got a poor film score and cinematography to boot.The story in synopsis reads like T2 revisited. An advanced terminator (Kristanna Loken) is sent back in time to destroy John Conner. Arnold Schwarzenegger, now an obsolete design, is again reprogrammed and sent back to protect him. The problem with this setup is that the first half of the film plays out without any dramatic tension. Loken does ok, but she's following Patrick as the T-1000 and Arnold as the T-800. She's about as menacing as a killer barbie doll. Hamilton felt more like a terminator in T2 than Loken does here. We know Conner isn't in danger for at least 3/4 the film, we know Arnold isn't in danger for at least 3/4 the film, etc.If the first act added to the characterization of the lead roles, this at least could have been put up with. As it stands, it's another cog in the bland, loud, effects wheel this summer. Is the now oft talked about crane street chase impressive? Well yeah, they spent probably 20 million dollars on it. It should look cool. But I felt no fear, no tension, nothing. Jonathan Mostow seems to have no concept of dramatic pacing here, and action for the sake of action doesn't cut it. Mostow also frames everything so blandly. Maybe its due to the complexity of the effects they need to add in post-production, but I could frame scenes like these. Framing would have helped add texture to the film, but his inferior John Ford routine doesn't work. You find yourself longing for Cameron and Alan Greenberg cinematic eye only a few minutes into the film.The film does wrap up with an interesting twist, but it unfortunately throws out everything Cameron preached for the first two films.The death of the concept of "No fate but what we make" was the biggest disaster in the film. Adding insult to injury, the way it happens is completely impossible, and ultimately a bit laughable.Speaking of laughable, I couldn't help but wander if Mostow thought he was making Bad Boys 2 or Con Air at times. Sometimes the graphic violence was bookended with rather stupid jokes. T2 had a few shots at levity, but this new film seems to have no concept of violence = consequences. The Terminator series always had this theme running underneath, and it was ultimately discarded with the rest of Cameron's ideas.In the end I could on about things like military command bases looking like Dr. Evil's lair. Or security letting Arnold and the kids walk into the most secret Air Force facility on the face of the planet, loaded with ammo and guns. Or why is the TX less advanced that the T1000? The T1000 was indestructible except by melting. The TX went down easy. She has a metal skeleton inside that can be broken. This is progress? Or how can "taking control" of the computer chips of a Ford Crown Victoria cop car suddenly give it the ability to drive itself? The onboard computer in a car doesn't press the gas peddle for us does it? Is this Terminator meets Trucks meets Duel? Etc. But that just begins endless nitpicking.The point is the filmed is flawed on basic levels, and like the 3rd and 4th Alien films, should be wiped from the Terminator mythos. As a summertime action flick, it would be a 7 out of 10. As a terminator film, its a zero...and a sad footnote to one of my favorite film series...</fullReview>

The acting is so wooden that anyone can do it. The people that made this film should look at how good number one was and make it like that The music score is the worst on any film and there is no music at the begining of the film.

		<fullReview>After watching T3, I can only say that the justice behind the movie is the ending. Sure, it did explain why SKYNET still wnet on-line despite CYBERDYNE'S destruction in T2. The good twist to the story line was that Mile's Dyson was the brains to SKYNET but he was not responsible for the launch. In fact, SKYNET was a military idea and SKYNET had to keep Robert Brewster alive and only kill him after the launch, as he will turn against the machines that he was once responsible for. Other than that, no fresh ideas.The series should just end here. ANyway, we all know the ending to it all. The humans will win by 2032. John Connor will NOT be killed as he already knows his fate and will try to prevent it. It will only delay his death by another 10 years when some maniac decides to kill him after he becomes president of the USA.</fullReview>

It's not quite as good as T2, but not much is. The Terminator story continues on as the machines begin their rise to power. This flick is full of action, including one chase scene that rivals the now legendary chase in The Matrix Reloaded, ridiculous gun shoot outs and brief comedic moments that Terminator fans are used to. Arnold gives a great performance as the T-101 again and the new "Terminatrix" chick is unbelievably hot, even though the nude appearance scene was a little too "PG-13" for me.

Or security letting Arnold and the kids walk into the most secret Air Force facility on the face of the planet, loaded with ammo and guns. Or why is the TX less advanced that the T1000? The T1000 was indestructible except by melting. The TX went down easy. She has a metal skeleton inside that can be broken. This is progress? Or how can "taking control" of the computer chips of a Ford Crown Victoria cop car suddenly give it the ability to drive itself? The onboard computer in a car doesn't press the gas peddle for us does it? Is this Terminator meets Trucks meets Duel? Etc. But that just begins endless nitpicking.The point is the filmed is flawed on basic levels, and like the 3rd and 4th Alien films, should be wiped from the Terminator mythos. As a summertime action flick, it would be a 7 out of 10. As a terminator film, its a zero...and a sad footnote to one of my favorite film series...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw T3 on 4th of July and I was excited about it but, when i found out that it wasn't going to be by Jim Cameron, I freaked out, kept asking myself "What if this one will suck and make the saga look bad" and other things like that. But when i saw it, I was extremely surprised by it. I loved it! But still not as much as T2 but it still made me smile when i walked out the theatre. T2 raised the bar so high that nothing can beat it, but T3 is about 2 notchs down from T2. So go see it, you might enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the script is bad. The jokes arnt funny and there are so many mistakes in the film like for e.g if there is no stopping the war then why didnt the terminator tell sarah in number two so she wouldnt have to kill miles dison as it wouldnt stop the war.. The terminator walks out with a coffin and he didnt kill 1 person why? john didnt mess with the chip so he should be killing anyone that gets in the way of his mission. The acting is so wooden that anyone can do it. The people that made this film should look at how good number one was and make it like that The music score is the worst on any film and there is no music at the begining of the film. The action scenes didnt leave you feeling WOW and just for the record i have a 8ft screen with a projector to watch it on and i can say its the worst film ive ever saw. Its on par with matrix reloaded i have been looking forward to this film but i will give it 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>End the Series Here Please....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching T3, I can only say that the justice behind the movie is the ending. Sure, it did explain why SKYNET still wnet on-line despite CYBERDYNE'S destruction in T2. The good twist to the story line was that Mile's Dyson was the brains to SKYNET but he was not responsible for the launch. In fact, SKYNET was a military idea and SKYNET had to keep Robert Brewster alive and only kill him after the launch, as he will turn against the machines that he was once responsible for. Other than that, no fresh ideas.The series should just end here. ANyway, we all know the ending to it all. The humans will win by 2032. John Connor will NOT be killed as he already knows his fate and will try to prevent it. It will only delay his death by another 10 years when some maniac decides to kill him after he becomes president of the USA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, I was a bit skeptical when I heard that this movie was coming out. I had a feeling that Hollywood was trying to milk an old, tired cash cow, but boy was I wrong. It's not quite as good as T2, but not much is. The Terminator story continues on as the machines begin their rise to power. This flick is full of action, including one chase scene that rivals the now legendary chase in The Matrix Reloaded, ridiculous gun shoot outs and brief comedic moments that Terminator fans are used to. Arnold gives a great performance as the T-101 again and the new "Terminatrix" chick is unbelievably hot, even though the nude appearance scene was a little too "PG-13" for me. I definitely recommend checking this out.$$$ 1/4 (out of $$$$)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sequel season 2003 continues, this time for a movie that was made 10 years ago. the plot remains the same: two 'terminator'-class machines are sent back from the future to the present time. one of them is sent to assassinate, and the other to protect. the targetted individuals again are unaware or do not accept their future importance, and the humor is on the same lines, including a reference to the famous Hasta La Vista from Terminator 2. As expected, the main attractions in this movie are the computer generated effects and the beautiful actresses (this time around the machine-sent terminator takes the form of the sexy Kristanna Loken). Nothing is surprising in this film, it takes the exact same things that made the first 2 movies a hit and jumbles them all back together into this bland product. Special effects are okay, nothing too exciting or innovative, and the plot is just dumb. If you hated the rest of the sequels this season (Matrix 2, Charlie's Angels 2, etc) you'll hate this one as well. don't waste your time/money - don't encourage the studios to make more crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With James Cameron's refusal to participate (is he going to work again?), and two of the lead actors bowing out as well, there was every reason to believe that this third entry was nothing more than a weak and derivative attempt to wring money out of a once-bright franchise. Let's face it; Arnold's instincts haven't been netting him gold lately. The dismal pre-release buzz didn't help its reputation either. So imagine my surprise when this actually turned out to be a pretty nifty sci-fi action thriller.Is it a great film? No; certainly not in a league with the first two films, which are now icons in the history of blockbusters. There are two real problems holding this one back.First, there's Kristanna Loken. I'll be the first to admit that I could sit in a theater and look at her all day. However, that's not the point of the character, is it? When it comes to sheer intimidation and menacing presence, she is no Schwarzenegger, and she is certainly no Robert Patrick (in my opinion, the definitive Terminator). While I didn't find her unbelievable, neither did I find her frightening. And that's a problem.The second stumbling block lies with the score. For any discerning fan of the Terminator series, Brad Fiedel's score is the soul of the films. Without his innovative work, it feels as if the voice of the terminators and judgment day is gone. Had he been replaced by someone like Jerry Goldsmith, the hole might have been filled. But Marco Beltrami's score is merely adequate. It hits its marks, and nothing more. The action cues are rudimentary, and the rest is simply dull. And the orchestral reworking of Fiedel's Terminator theme over the end credits is downright unwelcome.The bright points, however, are many. While the film starts out with a bit of a "been there, done that" vibe, it builds very successfully. Each successive minute is better than the last. The basic premise set up at the beginning simply has to be forgiven and gotten past. After all, if the future machines can send back Terminator after Terminator, why send each one back to a later point than the one before? Why not go back earlier, or send them all back to same point to pool their efforts? The movie isn't interested in answering these logic flaws, but fortunately finds more fertile ground in the characters. This movie's greatest strength lies in the fact that it is not a movie about the Terminator, but about John Connor. The Terminator is merely an element that serves to delineate Connor as a character, and illustrate his struggle with what appears to be his fate.Which brings me to something I greatly admire here. Cameron's films existed to illustrate the idea that the future is not written. The mantra of "no fate but what we make" is repeated to make the point that the actions of the individual matter; an interesting point in a movie about nuclear war and the annhilation of the human race. Well, this film will have none of that. It bravely reverses the stance of Cameron's stories, creating a starker, more realist view of the Terminator universe, in which common people can have no effect on events that shake the world. It's a dreary philosophy, but it rings truer than Cameron's warm fuzzy approach.The action here is first-rate, and wisely continues Cameron's tradition of unorthodox chase sequences. Why use fast cars when you can employ a crane truck and beat-up pickup? The Terminator fights bring more of a superheroic element, and the use of CGI stand-ins is first-rate (the Wachowskis should be forced to watch these sequences repeatedly); they are used sparingly, and we are never allowed to see them long enough to give away the artifice.Another surprise is how quickly and easily Nick Stahl falls into the role of John Connor. Perhaps it helps that the character was a young teen when last we saw him. Stahl builds an adult who could reasonably have developed from Edward Furlong's teenager, and the references to the previous film manage to roll believably from the character.Warning: this might be considered a spoiler. The ending cements the stark attitude of the film, demonstrating the inevitability of Connor's fate. It also provides the setup for the story that Terminator fans have been wanting to see all along, and that Cameron most likely would never have done. The final lines provide the perfect pinch of hope set amongst the apocalyptic imagery, and actually leave you hoping for one more sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On that special chemistry...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the third installment of the terminator series lacks the proper atmosphere of the first two, which were very entertaining. The whole idea of terminator is about confronting reality, even if it is uncomfortable, and T-3 skirts around the rough stuff way too much for serious fans of the terminator movies (of which I am one). Whereas arnold had a lack of attitude which gave an inherent comic element to the character, the script and story in T-3 personify him too much, and you may feel angered when he makes the terminator character into an emotionally guided human. The Terminator movies have all had some exploration of human relations (lovers in the first, mother-son in the second, and acquaintances in the third) but because of the lack of a real connection between the human characters involved in T-3, the viewer is forced to depend on the action more and more. This isn't that great since the director has decided to leave out a final confrontation, and the "climax", if you could call it that, to this action film is lacking in action. T-3 is a great disappointment for all fans of the terminator series, and all people looking to get a feel for the terminator series. My advice would be that, despite the energetic start, you skip this movie all together and concentrate on enjoying the original terminators, which had individual tones and experiences to offer.</fullReview>

The movie isn't interested in answering these logic flaws, but fortunately finds more fertile ground in the characters. This movie's greatest strength lies in the fact that it is not a movie about the Terminator, but about John Connor. The Terminator is merely an element that serves to delineate Connor as a character, and illustrate his struggle with what appears to be his fate.Which brings me to something I greatly admire here. Cameron's films existed to illustrate the idea that the future is not written. The mantra of "no fate but what we make" is repeated to make the point that the actions of the individual matter; an interesting point in a movie about nuclear war and the annhilation of the human race. Well, this film will have none of that. It bravely reverses the stance of Cameron's stories, creating a starker, more realist view of the Terminator universe, in which common people can have no effect on events that shake the world. It's a dreary philosophy, but it rings truer than Cameron's warm fuzzy approach.The action here is first-rate, and wisely continues Cameron's tradition of unorthodox chase sequences. Why use fast cars when you can employ a crane truck and beat-up pickup? The Terminator fights bring more of a superheroic element, and the use of CGI stand-ins is first-rate (the Wachowskis should be forced to watch these sequences repeatedly); they are used sparingly, and we are never allowed to see them long enough to give away the artifice.Another surprise is how quickly and easily Nick Stahl falls into the role of John Connor. Perhaps it helps that the character was a young teen when last we saw him. Stahl builds an adult who could reasonably have developed from Edward Furlong's teenager, and the references to the previous film manage to roll believably from the character.Warning: this might be considered a spoiler. The ending cements the stark attitude of the film, demonstrating the inevitability of Connor's fate. It also provides the setup for the story that Terminator fans have been wanting to see all along, and that Cameron most likely would never have done. The final lines provide the perfect pinch of hope set amongst the apocalyptic imagery, and actually leave you hoping for one more sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On that special chemistry...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the third installment of the terminator series lacks the proper atmosphere of the first two, which were very entertaining. The whole idea of terminator is about confronting reality, even if it is uncomfortable, and T-3 skirts around the rough stuff way too much for serious fans of the terminator movies (of which I am one). Whereas arnold had a lack of attitude which gave an inherent comic element to the character, the script and story in T-3 personify him too much, and you may feel angered when he makes the terminator character into an emotionally guided human. The Terminator movies have all had some exploration of human relations (lovers in the first, mother-son in the second, and acquaintances in the third) but because of the lack of a real connection between the human characters involved in T-3, the viewer is forced to depend on the action more and more. This isn't that great since the director has decided to leave out a final confrontation, and the "climax", if you could call it that, to this action film is lacking in action. T-3 is a great disappointment for all fans of the terminator series, and all people looking to get a feel for the terminator series. My advice would be that, despite the energetic start, you skip this movie all together and concentrate on enjoying the original terminators, which had individual tones and experiences to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 deserves its place beside Terminator 1 and 2 as the great cinematic epic that it is.I entered T3 with zero expectations. I left feeling relieved and overjoyed -- "they did it," was my only thought. "They made the sequel I would have made." And they really did.Whatever the critics say, know this: even James Cameron approves of Terminator 3. It carries his vision forward perhaps as faithfully as he himself would have done. There is the landmark humor, action, and, above all -- story.I have read complaints, from some critics, who seem to think T3 was meant to be a perpetually extended version of its predecessor, T2. No. T3 is in new hands; spawned entirely by new brains. The ideas are fresh, and the scope? -- Extraordinary.It is perhaps the best Terminator movie yet.</fullReview>

Errr... they are back with a rehash of the T1 story with a few mediocre actors; these even make Arnie look good. The script is pathetic -- just to generate some cheap jokes. The plot, if one call it that, is flimsy, full of holes, and guaranteed to enable the production of yet another sequel. Finally, it is evident that the film sets and paraphernalia were generated on the cheap.This film is very bad, and a grand disappointment.

		<shortDescription>Very good movie which almost lives up to its predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the views of some critics, I found this movie to be a solid piece of entertainment. Following on the heels of the 1984 sci-fi action classic "The Terminator" and its sequel "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", the plot once again centres around an attempt by machines from the future to eliminate John Connor, the man destined to become the saviour of humankind.Still afraid for his life, John now lives "off the grid" with no phone or known address to avoid being traced. One can understand his reasons, since a shapeshifting liquid metal cyborg (in the guise of T2's Robert Patrick) tried to kill him when he was still a child. Despite that the foretold nuclear war on August 29, 1997 (see the earlier flicks) failed to materialise, John still suspects all has not been set right. His fears are justified when another cyborg assassin, the T-X who assumes the form of a 5' 11'' blonde female, is sent back to eliminate his unsuspecting lieutenants (initially at least) on the eve of the postponed -- not averted -- nuclear war in the hope of changing the outcome of the future war between humans and sentient machines bent on their destruction. Once again, the resistance sends back another terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger, who else?) to protect John from the more advanced model. Why not send back a T-1000 or T-X instead? Well, I suppose capturing a liquid man (or woman) alive would be somewhat difficult, so it kinda makes sense.There are many absentees from the earlier movies, notably Linda Hamilton (John's mother Sarah in T1 and T2), Edward Furlong (John in T2) and not least the writer/director John Cameron. This time, the director is Johnathan Mostow, whose previous credits include Breakdown and U-571. However, I feel the director brought a new feel to the movie and all worked out quite well.Newcomers Nick Stahl and Claire Danes (who plays Katherine Brewster, one of John's future lieutenants) aquit themselves quite well and have good on-screen chemistry. Kristanna Loken (the supermodel turned actress who plays the T-X) is very convincing and has the same icy look that Robert Patrick had in T2. Arnold is getting a bit old for this type of movie now, but he still has the screen presence needed to liven things up.The movie is generally more light hearted than its two predecessors, though there is the odd dark scene mixed in. There are plenty of gags, some of which are effective and some which don't quite work. The T-X's abilities are interesting. Without giving too much away, she is somewhat a hybrid of the T-101 and T-1000, a metal endoskelton with advanced weapons surrounding by liquid metal, able to assume the forms of other people and control other machines (which leads to some interesting situations).T3 is entertaining throughout. Most of the movie is spent with the T-X chasing the heroes (and heroine), kind of similar to T1, but without the prolonged story-driven sections in the middle of T2. There are some very good action sequences, notably a chase seen early on, although I feel they could have made the movie a little longer (perhaps just over two hours) with a more climatic fight between the T-101 and T-X. Despite a good earlier fight scene, she is despatched a little too easily at the end, considering she is supposed to be an anti-terminator terminatrix (according to the T-101 anyway). The fight between the T-101 and T-1000 in the steel mill at the end of T2 was superior, as was the battle between Sarah and the T-101 in the Cyberdyne factory in the original. Also, there are sections where they don't really use the T-X as well as they could have. I think some of the gory sections (which would have made her a more scary character and on a par with Robert Patrick) were cut. For instance, she threatens a cop but we don't actually see him die. There's also a scene where she saws somebody up but we only see the splattering blood.All in all, an entertaining summer blockbuster (not quite as good as X2 but better than the Matrix Reloaded) and a worthy follow up, though not as groundbreaking as the previous two films.Eccentric Brit rates it 8/10 (T1 and T2 both 9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does anyone in Hollywood have a brain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a great movie. About 1/2 is pretty good (the basic concept created by James Cameron), but the film goes way down hill quickly once the plot gets going. Repeats things from the first movies and PLOT HOLES GALORE!(Spoilers)I can suspend my disbelief that we have a science fiction movie here, but come on... unbelievably advanced autonomous cybernetic organisms by the year 2030? Impossible for me to believe since we can't even get a robot to climb stairs, pick up a glass or recognize and interpret speech in 2003. In the opinions of most robotic scientists, we're at least a century away from a thinking, autonomous robot. So the dates in this movie are waaaaay off, I think. I won't even get into time travel (necessary for the story) that many think great thinkings believe is several millenia away, if not impossible.But those aren't my problems. I suspended my disbelief to accept time travel and the Terminator machines coming from 30 years in the future.1. How does Skynet take over? No computer software on Earth is linked to every other piece of software. They speak different computer languages. This is so laughable as to discredit the entire Terminator franchise. Furthermore, human beings launch nuclear missles (requires synchronized key turns, code keys and non-automated button pressing). It's done by humans, not a computer. Ridiculous. It is patently IMPOSSIBLE for a rouge computer virus to even take over a satellite/cellular network, much less a missle silo. The only thing it could do is give the President the illusion that Russian missles were on the way, so he would order his generals to launch the counter-attack.2. I'm sick of military "Command Centers" looking like they do in movies - like Dr. Evil's lair. We're to believe that they're flying a jet/rocket powered test vehicle 20 feet away from the SkyNet computer banks, INDOORS! Has anyone ever seen documentary footage of testing? It's done outside hangars and grey concrete buildings in the desert. I'll bet anyone a million dollars that the Air Force doesn't operate a single room on the Earth that looks remotely like the "Command Center" in T3. And they happen to have all their battle robots, hover drones, particle accelerator and SkyNet computers in one place? SURE. Did the screenwriters ever talk to anyone who was ever in the military? Los Alamos Labs don't look like dat.3. What kind of security lets Arnold and the 2 kids into the most secret Air Force facility on the face of the planet, loaded to the gills with ammo and guns? Huh?4. Why do the machines keep sending 1 Terminator? Why not 10? They keep screwing up. Why not ensure things? Why not build a Terminator suicide bomber? Why not just throw your power cell at John Conner when you get within a mile of him? Is SkyNet incompetent?5. Why is the TX less advanced that the T1000? The T1000 was indescructable except by melting. The TX went down in an explosion. She has a metal skeleton inside that can be broken. This is progress?6. Why did the missle shoot through the office window and not kill anyone? Why can people be thrown repeatedly onto cement floors without breaking ribs or limbs?7. Where was everyone at the old nuclear fallout facility? Why did it have power? Where were all the soldiers at the new command center? Shouldn't they be guarding the place?8. If Arnold took out his 2nd and last power cell, how did he manage to move his body and arm to stick it in the TX's mouth? Wouldn't he be absent a power sourace the instant he unhooked his final power cell? My digital camera ceases to take pictures if I remove its battery.9. Why did they take off in a Cessna 172, yet fly inside a DeHavilland? Totally different planes.10. How can "taking control" of the computer chips of a Ford Crown Victoria cop car suddenly give it the ability to move its own steering wheel and press its own brakes? Absolutely idiotic.11. How many bullets can fly, explosions demolish things and cars disintegrate without loss of life? I guess the director drew inspiration from the A-Team. Violence has no consequence.12. Are we to believe that on a planet with 6 billion people that simpletons like John Conner, his buddy at the Carl's Jr. drive-thru and a vet assistant will become the last hope of the Earth? Stretches believability to the max.13. Why can the T101 perfectly replicate voice and speech patterns of others, but speaks with a thick Austrian accent in default mode? (I'm just being a smart aleck now.)The more I think about this movie, the more I realize how much it blows. This movie is absurd science fiction but doesn't play it for fun like Men In Black or Ghostbusters. It plays things straight and that's why it is no good for anyone with a brain. More than stupid science fiction, it just doesn't make any sense, plotwise.Skip it in the theater but catch it on video. About as good as Alien 3, which was also a franchise that dropped Cameron when they got to part 3!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An new action movie with old school sensibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern filmmakers often try to create cinematic events which work on multiple levels. However, in order for a movie to be good, it must first succeed on a superficial level. This is where Matrix Reloaded failed. Reloaded, at its most profound, tried to engage the viewers in philosophical debate. But on the surface, Reloaded was nothing more than MTV style and sensibilities. Ultimately, Reloaded can be summed up in one word: Techno. Perhaps, that's slightly unfair, but it's less unfair than writing The Crow off as a goth movie. But enough about OTHER movies.Terminator 3 is a movie that does work on that basic level. It's absolutely entertaining to watch. The action scenes are more thrilling than anything that Hollywood has offered up so far in 2003. The plot is decent too. Even without James Cameron, the T3 managed to make a decent movie. Cameron has described T3 as "great", so the movie is clearly not an affront to the first two movies. If you liked Arnold in T2, you'll like him in T3. The reprogrammed, slightly outdated T-101 is as good as ever. Nick Stahl gives a good performances as the paranoid disillusioned 20-something junkie John Connor. Claire Danes also does well as Kate Brewster, a veterinarian thrown into a situation that's out of her control. Kristanna Loken does as well as she can with the T-X role. T-X isn't anywhere near as ruthless as Robert Patrick's T-1000, but she's far more effective at keeping her targets in her sites.Some people have said there's too much humor in T3. I disagree. Every action movie has its fair share of levity. The epic T2 had John Connor teaching the Terminator to say thinsg like "eat me, d***wad" as well explaining to him that he couldn't just kill people.Another complaint is that the plot is too thin. I disagree wholeheartedly with this. Director Johnathan Mostow and the writers don't beat you over the head with the motivation of the characters, they leave some of that open to you. Not every movie is gonna hold your hand and walk you step by step through a detailed explanation of things. Some things you just need to accept, or interpret for yourself. After all, this IS science fiction/action. However, there is one mind boggling scene where the T-X inexplicably escapes from a magnetic field. This is the only major flaw with the movie.Perhaps the one main drawback to T3 is that if you haven't seen the prequels, especially T2, then you may not understand some of the finer points of the movie. But if you haven't seen T2, you have no business watching any sci-fi/action movies anyway.T3 has a great ending, but they inevitably leave it open for another sequel. I really hope there isn't a T4. No series has ever passed the 3 movie and remained great or even good.T3 will never be as good as T2, but it's a valiant effort. I've tried not to talk too much about the plot; that's not the purpose of a review. If you want to know why the events in T2 didn't prevent Judgment Day, you'll have to go see T3 for yourself.I'm not here to ruin the movie. If you're a fan of Arnold, Terminator, or action movies, go see T3. It's a whole lot of fun and action from start to finish. And it fits seamlessly into the series progression.Overall rating: 3.5 out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to go watch Terminator 3, I didn't know what to expect. Is this some sort of money making scheme from Arnold since his last few movies where busts?, or was this film really going to be a great addition to the Terminator saga. The answer was both. Since most of the original forefathers weren't involved with the picture, the new fresh voices added a wonderful new adventure pack addition to the story. I understand you can't always get the same actors involved, and I'm glad that they added new characters to take their place. Keeping Linda and Eddie in the film would have felt like a T2 remake instead of a sequel.I truly enjoyed this movie, and I hope that they decide to continue with the saga, hopefully we don't have to wait another twelve years to see it though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand the pure idiocy of some people.T2. Good movie. Nice action scenes. Great use of CG for the time. Other director's would have cut the CG short or say, no this is too much work, whatever, but no, Cameron did it all. He made the T1000 go inside out, spill out from holes is stuff, etc. Forget about the one liners already. Those don't totally ruin a film. Neither does the opinion that Edward Furlong was whiney. Some idiot on the forums said T3 has better acting. Please shoot yourself right now to preserve the intelligence of the huamn race. The acting in T2 was amazing you idiot. Edward Furlong may be an exception to some but, I dunno, I bought the DVD and I never thought he was whiney. How the hell is a kid being chased by a f-ing liquid metal Terminator with ammo flying everywhere supposed to act? And who cares anyways. Morton and Hamilton were brilliant.T3. I'll give it only one thing: nice action scenes. Even nicer than T2. The concept of what the TX is is a little bit ridiculous, but whatever. Kristanna Loken looks so damn hot. I love her. Beautiful outfit as well. The quality of the CG isn't really that bad as one review said it was. Otherwise the movie is pretty crappy. Within 10 minutes of the film I was p***ed. What happend to the metal logo intro? None of that at all. What happened to the kick ass Terminator music? Only at the end credits. Tradition and consistancy give the franchise identity and they're nice touches, although if I was a director I'd put more importance on that. One thing that p***ed me off was that Mostow doesn't even know how to film scenes properly. Some scenes don't look right and he uses slow motion in some pointless places. If you thought T2's one liners were stupid then wtf is with "talk to the hand". That is the single most stupidest thing I can think of for a Terminator to say. And what's with Arnold acting like a moron. That whole "TX has infected my system" bit is pretty lame. The way Arnold stuggles with the virus in him was pretty clicheic and lame. What the hell is the scene with him banging a car with his hands in the hanger scene? And since when does restarting your system get rid of a virus? And when he put his own head back on... gimme a break. He looked pretty f-ing dead to me when the TX practically busted his head off with connections severed and all. The whole thing seemed pretty stupid. Mostow can't even get his facts straight. It clearly shows in T2 that Connor was 10 not 13 when the Terminator first encountered him. And the T-101 says he's supposed to kill Connor and that he'll be back. How is that possible when he blew himself up with the TX? oh, you mean another model 101? or what? There's inconsistencies and stupidity everywhere. At one point Connor mentions has enough fire power to blow up 10 super computers. Really? All 10 of them? Wow! The cameo appearance of Dr. Silberman was stupid. What's he even doing there? When he sees the Terminator he just runs away. Oh-kay.... and the fumbling for the keys cliche.BAD: The script is bad. The acting isn't particularly good. Filmed poorly. The T-101 says and does some stupid things. Inconsistencies in the plot.GOOD: A few nice action scenes. Loken is f-ing beautiful. So damn beautiful it makes me sick.Conclusion: Stupid.</fullReview>

Ipreferred the themes of T2 and The Terminator ( "there is no futurebut what we make"; gritty realism of "Terminator") to the theme ofthis film. The last 8 or 10 minutes drop off but there are enoughthrills and good scenes to tide you over. Arnold looks great for aguy in his 50's, but let's hope this series isn't his 401k plan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy continuation of the Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fully expecting to be disappointed with this film, especially after what I considered the existential failure of "The Matrix: Reloaded," earlier this year. Pleasantly, I was not. Any movie that starts off with a nuclear bang is okay in my book, and things picked up nicely thereafter.Arnold does the thing he does best (laconic one-liners), Nick Stahl is a suitable replacement for Ed Furlong (mostly due to decent acting chops and a certain resemblance to Michael Biehn), the effects are pretty much flawless, the chase sequences rock, the Terminatrix is a satisfying upgrade from the T-1000, and the ending is not only a darkly enjoyable conclusion to the (relatively thin) plot (which is pretty much a retread of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" minus Sarah Connor), it leaves things nicely open-ended for yet another sequel. I left the theater feeling that I got my money's worth; what more can you ask?My only complaints would center on the script's reliance on a number of coincidences that raise the eyebrow of believability (including the otherwise enjoyable cameo appearance of Dr. Silverman), and what I felt was the miscasting of Claire Danes. I'm not sure why I felt that way, as I consider her to be a gifted actor, but she just rubbed me the wrong way. I suppose repeated viewings will soften my opinion, perhaps. (3/10/07 edit: I just learned that Sophia "The Hitcher" Bush was originally cast in Danes' role, but was let go shortly after production began because the director felt she was too young. One can only wonder how this film would have fared thus cast...) Nutshell opinion: T3 moves the franchise forward with workmanlike style and panache, and leaves the viewer anticipating the next chapter. My hope is that when "T4" rolls around, we get to see Arnold playing the human being upon whom his Terminator was modeled.</fullReview>

This movie was fantastic. In it, Arnold is back again as the futuristic cyborg who must protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) from a robot assassin, this time played by Kristanna Loken. Arnold is back in the role that made him Ahnold. Kristanna Loken is a great villain (Not to mention super hot). She is no T-1000, though the action sequences were incredible and their were some unexpected twists that caught everyone in the theater off-guard. Everyone is crying about how James Cameron isn't involved, but i think Jonathon Mostow did a superb job. If there is a Terminator 4, i won't complain, even though it is not necessary. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie which almost lives up to its predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the views of some critics, I found this movie to be a solid piece of entertainment. Following on the heels of the 1984 sci-fi action classic "The Terminator" and its sequel "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", the plot once again centres around an attempt by machines from the future to eliminate John Connor, the man destined to become the saviour of humankind.Still afraid for his life, John now lives "off the grid" with no phone or known address to avoid being traced. One can understand his reasons, since a shapeshifting liquid metal cyborg (in the guise of T2's Robert Patrick) tried to kill him when he was still a child. Despite that the foretold nuclear war on August 29, 1997 (see the earlier flicks) failed to materialise, John still suspects all has not been set right. His fears are justified when another cyborg assassin, the T-X who assumes the form of a 5' 11'' blonde female, is sent back to eliminate his unsuspecting lieutenants (initially at least) on the eve of the postponed -- not averted -- nuclear war in the hope of changing the outcome of the future war between humans and sentient machines bent on their destruction. Once again, the resistance sends back another terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger, who else?) to protect John from the more advanced model. Why not send back a T-1000 or T-X instead? Well, I suppose capturing a liquid man (or woman) alive would be somewhat difficult, so it kinda makes sense.There are many absentees from the earlier movies, notably Linda Hamilton (John's mother Sarah in T1 and T2), Edward Furlong (John in T2) and not least the writer/director John Cameron. This time, the director is Johnathan Mostow, whose previous credits include Breakdown and U-571. However, I feel the director brought a new feel to the movie and all worked out quite well.Newcomers Nick Stahl and Claire Danes (who plays Katherine Brewster, one of John's future lieutenants) aquit themselves quite well and have good on-screen chemistry. Kristanna Loken (the supermodel turned actress who plays the T-X) is very convincing and has the same icy look that Robert Patrick had in T2. Arnold is getting a bit old for this type of movie now, but he still has the screen presence needed to liven things up.The movie is generally more light hearted than its two predecessors, though there is the odd dark scene mixed in. There are plenty of gags, some of which are effective and some which don't quite work. The T-X's abilities are interesting. Without giving too much away, she is somewhat a hybrid of the T-101 and T-1000, a metal endoskelton with advanced weapons surrounding by liquid metal, able to assume the forms of other people and control other machines (which leads to some interesting situations).T3 is entertaining throughout. Most of the movie is spent with the T-X chasing the heroes (and heroine), kind of similar to T1, but without the prolonged story-driven sections in the middle of T2. There are some very good action sequences, notably a chase seen early on, although I feel they could have made the movie a little longer (perhaps just over two hours) with a more climatic fight between the T-101 and T-X. Despite a good earlier fight scene, she is despatched a little too easily at the end, considering she is supposed to be an anti-terminator terminatrix (according to the T-101 anyway). The fight between the T-101 and T-1000 in the steel mill at the end of T2 was superior, as was the battle between Sarah and the T-101 in the Cyberdyne factory in the original. Also, there are sections where they don't really use the T-X as well as they could have. I think some of the gory sections (which would have made her a more scary character and on a par with Robert Patrick) were cut. For instance, she threatens a cop but we don't actually see him die. There's also a scene where she saws somebody up but we only see the splattering blood.All in all, an entertaining summer blockbuster (not quite as good as X2 but better than the Matrix Reloaded) and a worthy follow up, though not as groundbreaking as the previous two films.Eccentric Brit rates it 8/10 (T1 and T2 both 9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Took in Terminator 3 over the holiday weekend and was totally underwhelmed. Yes, the chase with the crane is very well done...maybe even one of the best I have ever seen. But all the other sequences in the first portion of the film looked so fake...right off the back lot. And going back to the trough for more of the same set up of how Arnold (long in the tooth) got his clothes was insulting and SO summer movie... Clair Danes in the best thing in the movie. When it was over, nearly all of the people in the theatre got up and left before the credits had even begun rolling. And there was no cheering or shouting from the audience. A matinee flick. Don't spend $8+ to go see this prime time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does anyone in Hollywood have a brain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a great movie. About 1/2 is pretty good (the basic concept created by James Cameron), but the film goes way down hill quickly once the plot gets going. Repeats things from the first movies and PLOT HOLES GALORE!(Spoilers)I can suspend my disbelief that we have a science fiction movie here, but come on... unbelievably advanced autonomous cybernetic organisms by the year 2030? Impossible for me to believe since we can't even get a robot to climb stairs, pick up a glass or recognize and interpret speech in 2003. In the opinions of most robotic scientists, we're at least a century away from a thinking, autonomous robot. So the dates in this movie are waaaaay off, I think. I won't even get into time travel (necessary for the story) that many think great thinkings believe is several millenia away, if not impossible.But those aren't my problems. I suspended my disbelief to accept time travel and the Terminator machines coming from 30 years in the future.1. How does Skynet take over? No computer software on Earth is linked to every other piece of software. They speak different computer languages. This is so laughable as to discredit the entire Terminator franchise. Furthermore, human beings launch nuclear missles (requires synchronized key turns, code keys and non-automated button pressing). It's done by humans, not a computer. Ridiculous. It is patently IMPOSSIBLE for a rouge computer virus to even take over a satellite/cellular network, much less a missle silo. The only thing it could do is give the President the illusion that Russian missles were on the way, so he would order his generals to launch the counter-attack.2. I'm sick of military "Command Centers" looking like they do in movies - like Dr. Evil's lair. We're to believe that they're flying a jet/rocket powered test vehicle 20 feet away from the SkyNet computer banks, INDOORS! Has anyone ever seen documentary footage of testing? It's done outside hangars and grey concrete buildings in the desert. I'll bet anyone a million dollars that the Air Force doesn't operate a single room on the Earth that looks remotely like the "Command Center" in T3. And they happen to have all their battle robots, hover drones, particle accelerator and SkyNet computers in one place? SURE. Did the screenwriters ever talk to anyone who was ever in the military? Los Alamos Labs don't look like dat.3. What kind of security lets Arnold and the 2 kids into the most secret Air Force facility on the face of the planet, loaded to the gills with ammo and guns? Huh?4. Why do the machines keep sending 1 Terminator? Why not 10? They keep screwing up. Why not ensure things? Why not build a Terminator suicide bomber? Why not just throw your power cell at John Conner when you get within a mile of him? Is SkyNet incompetent?5. Why is the TX less advanced that the T1000? The T1000 was indescructable except by melting. The TX went down in an explosion. She has a metal skeleton inside that can be broken. This is progress?6. Why did the missle shoot through the office window and not kill anyone? Why can people be thrown repeatedly onto cement floors without breaking ribs or limbs?7. Where was everyone at the old nuclear fallout facility? Why did it have power? Where were all the soldiers at the new command center? Shouldn't they be guarding the place?8. If Arnold took out his 2nd and last power cell, how did he manage to move his body and arm to stick it in the TX's mouth? Wouldn't he be absent a power sourace the instant he unhooked his final power cell? My digital camera ceases to take pictures if I remove its battery.9. Why did they take off in a Cessna 172, yet fly inside a DeHavilland? Totally different planes.10. How can "taking control" of the computer chips of a Ford Crown Victoria cop car suddenly give it the ability to move its own steering wheel and press its own brakes? Absolutely idiotic.11. How many bullets can fly, explosions demolish things and cars disintegrate without loss of life? I guess the director drew inspiration from the A-Team. Violence has no consequence.12. Are we to believe that on a planet with 6 billion people that simpletons like John Conner, his buddy at the Carl's Jr. drive-thru and a vet assistant will become the last hope of the Earth? Stretches believability to the max.13. Why can the T101 perfectly replicate voice and speech patterns of others, but speaks with a thick Austrian accent in default mode? (I'm just being a smart aleck now.)The more I think about this movie, the more I realize how much it blows. This movie is absurd science fiction but doesn't play it for fun like Men In Black or Ghostbusters. It plays things straight and that's why it is no good for anyone with a brain. More than stupid science fiction, it just doesn't make any sense, plotwise.Skip it in the theater but catch it on video. About as good as Alien 3, which was also a franchise that dropped Cameron when they got to part 3!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An new action movie with old school sensibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern filmmakers often try to create cinematic events which work on multiple levels. However, in order for a movie to be good, it must first succeed on a superficial level. This is where Matrix Reloaded failed. Reloaded, at its most profound, tried to engage the viewers in philosophical debate. But on the surface, Reloaded was nothing more than MTV style and sensibilities. Ultimately, Reloaded can be summed up in one word: Techno. Perhaps, that's slightly unfair, but it's less unfair than writing The Crow off as a goth movie. But enough about OTHER movies.Terminator 3 is a movie that does work on that basic level. It's absolutely entertaining to watch. The action scenes are more thrilling than anything that Hollywood has offered up so far in 2003. The plot is decent too. Even without James Cameron, the T3 managed to make a decent movie. Cameron has described T3 as "great", so the movie is clearly not an affront to the first two movies. If you liked Arnold in T2, you'll like him in T3. The reprogrammed, slightly outdated T-101 is as good as ever. Nick Stahl gives a good performances as the paranoid disillusioned 20-something junkie John Connor. Claire Danes also does well as Kate Brewster, a veterinarian thrown into a situation that's out of her control. Kristanna Loken does as well as she can with the T-X role. T-X isn't anywhere near as ruthless as Robert Patrick's T-1000, but she's far more effective at keeping her targets in her sites.Some people have said there's too much humor in T3. I disagree. Every action movie has its fair share of levity. The epic T2 had John Connor teaching the Terminator to say thinsg like "eat me, d***wad" as well explaining to him that he couldn't just kill people.Another complaint is that the plot is too thin. I disagree wholeheartedly with this. Director Johnathan Mostow and the writers don't beat you over the head with the motivation of the characters, they leave some of that open to you. Not every movie is gonna hold your hand and walk you step by step through a detailed explanation of things. Some things you just need to accept, or interpret for yourself. After all, this IS science fiction/action. However, there is one mind boggling scene where the T-X inexplicably escapes from a magnetic field. This is the only major flaw with the movie.Perhaps the one main drawback to T3 is that if you haven't seen the prequels, especially T2, then you may not understand some of the finer points of the movie. But if you haven't seen T2, you have no business watching any sci-fi/action movies anyway.T3 has a great ending, but they inevitably leave it open for another sequel. I really hope there isn't a T4. No series has ever passed the 3 movie and remained great or even good.T3 will never be as good as T2, but it's a valiant effort. I've tried not to talk too much about the plot; that's not the purpose of a review. If you want to know why the events in T2 didn't prevent Judgment Day, you'll have to go see T3 for yourself.I'm not here to ruin the movie. If you're a fan of Arnold, Terminator, or action movies, go see T3. It's a whole lot of fun and action from start to finish. And it fits seamlessly into the series progression.Overall rating: 3.5 out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to go watch Terminator 3, I didn't know what to expect. Is this some sort of money making scheme from Arnold since his last few movies where busts?, or was this film really going to be a great addition to the Terminator saga. The answer was both. Since most of the original forefathers weren't involved with the picture, the new fresh voices added a wonderful new adventure pack addition to the story. I understand you can't always get the same actors involved, and I'm glad that they added new characters to take their place. Keeping Linda and Eddie in the film would have felt like a T2 remake instead of a sequel.I truly enjoyed this movie, and I hope that they decide to continue with the saga, hopefully we don't have to wait another twelve years to see it though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand the pure idiocy of some people.T2. Good movie. Nice action scenes. Great use of CG for the time. Other director's would have cut the CG short or say, no this is too much work, whatever, but no, Cameron did it all. He made the T1000 go inside out, spill out from holes is stuff, etc. Forget about the one liners already. Those don't totally ruin a film. Neither does the opinion that Edward Furlong was whiney. Some idiot on the forums said T3 has better acting. Please shoot yourself right now to preserve the intelligence of the huamn race. The acting in T2 was amazing you idiot. Edward Furlong may be an exception to some but, I dunno, I bought the DVD and I never thought he was whiney. How the hell is a kid being chased by a f-ing liquid metal Terminator with ammo flying everywhere supposed to act? And who cares anyways. Morton and Hamilton were brilliant.T3. I'll give it only one thing: nice action scenes. Even nicer than T2. The concept of what the TX is is a little bit ridiculous, but whatever. Kristanna Loken looks so damn hot. I love her. Beautiful outfit as well. The quality of the CG isn't really that bad as one review said it was. Otherwise the movie is pretty crappy. Within 10 minutes of the film I was p***ed. What happend to the metal logo intro? None of that at all. What happened to the kick ass Terminator music? Only at the end credits. Tradition and consistancy give the franchise identity and they're nice touches, although if I was a director I'd put more importance on that. One thing that p***ed me off was that Mostow doesn't even know how to film scenes properly. Some scenes don't look right and he uses slow motion in some pointless places. If you thought T2's one liners were stupid then wtf is with "talk to the hand". That is the single most stupidest thing I can think of for a Terminator to say. And what's with Arnold acting like a moron. That whole "TX has infected my system" bit is pretty lame. The way Arnold stuggles with the virus in him was pretty clicheic and lame. What the hell is the scene with him banging a car with his hands in the hanger scene? And since when does restarting your system get rid of a virus? And when he put his own head back on... gimme a break. He looked pretty f-ing dead to me when the TX practically busted his head off with connections severed and all. The whole thing seemed pretty stupid. Mostow can't even get his facts straight. It clearly shows in T2 that Connor was 10 not 13 when the Terminator first encountered him. And the T-101 says he's supposed to kill Connor and that he'll be back. How is that possible when he blew himself up with the TX? oh, you mean another model 101? or what? There's inconsistencies and stupidity everywhere. At one point Connor mentions has enough fire power to blow up 10 super computers. Really? All 10 of them? Wow! The cameo appearance of Dr. Silberman was stupid. What's he even doing there? When he sees the Terminator he just runs away. Oh-kay.... and the fumbling for the keys cliche.BAD: The script is bad. The acting isn't particularly good. Filmed poorly. The T-101 says and does some stupid things. Inconsistencies in the plot.GOOD: A few nice action scenes. Loken is f-ing beautiful. So damn beautiful it makes me sick.Conclusion: Stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was expecting a average movie since cameron was not directing the movie. but the movie wasn't a disappointment. its a good movie, the ending is very good. i found myself in the mood halfway through the movie, 'the fear of machines' brought about by the other two movies. it gets real interesting after that. the director has brought some humour which works, but unecessary. i would love to see a T4. Now the bad aspects. Loken does not fit the TX profile that well, she looks beautiful but a girl more athletic and more importantly a bit muscular would have been the better choice. Stahl is also not a very ideal choice either. he is short and has a softer image. i don't know why Edward Furlong from T2 was not chosen. the continuity had a very strong impact on the appeal of John Connor. Otherwise a taller guy with chiselled features resembling the John Connor from T1. The movie was shot mostly in daylight, T2 was shot in the night giving that somber and lonely feeling putting a fear in the hearts of audience. It should have been followed here. Action sequences are great, again night would have been better. But that sould not spoil the thrill of watching T3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this expecting a decent movie, and was pleasantly surprised. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as the John Connor, who is now a man, with a destiny. I think Nick Stahl did a good job as John Connor and was completely believable. Claire Danes does the best job in this movie in my opinion as Kate Brewster, a future lieutenant and wife to John Connor. She has this amazing charisma about her and I enjoyed watching her on the screen. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the T-101 (NOT T-800 like the Plot outline says, jeez get it right!) terminator, now obsolete. I wasn't a big fan of some of the one-liners he used but it was a decent performance in spite of it. Kristanna Loken plays the new T-X terminator. Now although she has very few lines, her face speaks in great detail. Earl Boen also reprises his role as Dr. Silberman in a quick spot, which I found to be very funny.Now as far as the movie goes I think this was more funny than the previous versions but it still maintain its action/thriller appeal. It was suspenseful when it needed to be and that was very important. And I think the last thirty minutes of this movie were really quite good and thought provoking. The end really came too soon, which was my only disappointment. I don't really enjoy movies which try to stick too much information in too little time, as this movie does. However its done well enough that you do not become bored or puzzled at some of the things that happen. However my only problem is this film really should have been longer. I think had they had another twenty or thirty minutes we could have seen a little more story. The movie seems more concerned with the action than the dialog which doesn't quite turn me off, though I would have liked to see more. My hope is that the DVD will include much more that was cut from the film. And I think while deleted scenes are good, I'm much more on the special editions where the cuts are seamlessly added to the theatrical release. In any case this movie is good, and can only get better with more scenes. I for one am wishing and waiting for a fourth installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than 2, but surpasses the first? No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS. READ WITH CAUTION.The first Terminator movie was an excellent action-thriller, with Arnold is a complete cold-hearted a-hole. The 2nd Terminator movie was supposed to be even better, but it was a dry, worthless, shameful rip-off of the original. So, how does part 3 stand?I've hated just about every movie I've seen since May. X-men 2 was disappointing, Matrix 2 just plain stunk, and Hulk was bad. Very, very bad. T3 is actually more enjoyable than these films, but it fails to capture the magic of the first one. However, it at least does not cut-and-paste every scene from the first one into this one, like part 2 did. Overall, it's not exactly the best action flick of the year *cough, Cowboy Bebop*, but it does have some memorable scenes.Questions fill my head. No, not ones that question the series continuity, but ones like: How come in the series, any time the good guys or bad guys touch a single vehicle, it does not last even five minutes before getting destroyed? This question haunted my brain during the entire third film.The TX in this one is basically a T-1000 on steroids. It has the same abilities as Robert Patrick's character, plus literally can do almost anything.The action emphasis on this one is more on destruction than the first two films combined(not that the second one counts, since it was just the first film with the characters changed). The scene where this is most evident to me is in one scene in which T-101 and TX fight in hand-to-hand combat, pretty much destroying everything in their path. More things get demolished in this part than in an episode of Dragonball Z.That one psychologist from the first 2, Dr. Stieberman, makes a humorous return appearance. It happens about halfway through the film. Speaking of humor, there's quite a few humorous scenes throughout the entire film, moreso than the first one.This film probably wouldn't exist had Cameron chosen to use the original ending to T2. Some people are probably really happy about that.BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a decent, brain-dead action-adventure flick, this is currently your best bet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I was not expecting a tremendous movie when I went to see T3. I was happily surprised at how fast paced and fun this movie was straight off the bat. There was some great suspense as I found myself asking of the maincharacters: "How are you going to get away from the T-X now?" Kristanna did a great job at playing the hard-core, cold-hearted killer that every Terminator should be. She was brutal and efficient, and best of all never stopped in the middle of killing someone in order to explain her master plan. I like that in a villain. Arnold was once again amazing as the protector, and Nick and Claire were fantastic as his suporting cast. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an action-packed flick that has some great twists and turns. The ending is also perfect for the ideas and theories the story conveys about fate and free will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action scenes with little plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, there is this movie called Terminator 3, but the only thing that resembles anything related to the Terminator franchise here is Arnold and, unfortunately, he alone doesn't convince me that this is the Terminator.T3 is a not-bad summer action film, full of action and adventure, but not much in the way of a plot. I read a comment on imdb that says that the ending alone is worth the price of admission; that reviewer is apparently very easily amused.Throughout the film, which does have some interesting action sequences, there was a noticeable lack of depth. T3 almost seemed like it was developed "by committee" with little bits that had a certain feel, and other bits that had another feel.Kristanna Loken, who played the T-X, was fine as an actress. She performed her role well. But, what is the point of getting a supermodel to play John Connor's killer? Her beauty had nothing (at least not revealed in the film) to do with the role of the T-X, and there was no reason not to use a more sinister character. Casting her degraded the film to less-than-science-fiction, because good science fiction films avoid such fluff. Based on T3, I could see Kurt Russell, Steven Segal and maybe Jackie Chan getting involved in T4, almost to the point of slapstickT3 actually hinted that the 'plot' was about to go somewhere, when the T-X began programming machines to help her. This was where it was getting interesting, and it happened pretty early on in the film. I could see where the "Rise of the Machines" subtitle was being utilized. Then it totally fell flat, with virtually no mention of the rise of any machines, except little bits that were touched on here and there, and that which was implied at the end of the film.The special effects and action scenes were technically good, but my policy is that good special effects, by themselves, are useless.Overall, the film is somewhat interesting, with a light plot and strong action sequences, although in the end it seems as if I was ripped off with hardly any payoff. Certainly not along the lines of T2 (James Cameron), which is one of the best films to ever come out of Hollywood, and one that I've seen dozens of times. T3 had none of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as satisfying as T2, but pretty fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Connor is shown in a flash-forward in the beginning of 'T3,' not just as triumphant, but triumphant with an American flag draped over his shoulder. An American man saves the world from the small-minded machines. And so begins the sometimes not-so-subtle love song to the American man, that 'T3' so often is. A love song sung in broken English, and with a German accent.Nothing that Hollywood puts this much energy and money ino can ever be dismissed as just an action picture.A film student could probably do a pretty decent dissertation on the differences in directing styles by comparing 'T2' and 'T3' as two films that are as similar as two films can get in terms of subject-matter, but which differ so noticeably in tone and subtext.The cold, dark blue world of T2 was full of sophisticated foreboding and it couched it's fantastic effects and spectacular violence in some interesting meditations on the concepts of Generation X and of the passage of time. Arnold was older, but still the picture of vitality and robotic perfection. There was some poetry to the picture.The present effort is not devoid of these elements, but comes precipitously close on a number of different levels.For those of us who were 16 when the original 'Terminator' came out, watching 'T2' was like watching your idiot friend get a date with his sexy first-year college professor. Someone big decided to take this slightly moronic but highly entertaining concept seriously and make a silk purse out of it and it was great. 'T3' is kind of like what it'd be like if that friend came around again after marrying the professor and tried hard to remember what it was like to be down with his boys way back when. You want it to be the same, but it just isn't. It's an exercise in sentimentality mostly.But what we don't get in terms of depth and scope, we get in terms of Arnold's personal vision of masculinity. I mean, let's face it, everybody knows the 'Terminator' movies are for boys -- the girls have 'Sex in the City.' Arnold's commentary on the state of the American male ego is subtle, but if you watch for it, it becomes very clear.Firstly, I was highly suspect of the newcomer bad-guy, or gal, in this case. From press pictures, she didn't seem scary at all -- or even mechanical in any way. I thought the angular dimensions and sheer size of someone like Brigitte Nielsen, in her heyday, would have been far more adequate a choice. But I have to say Kristanna Loken won me over early. Soft and supple, but somehow menacing in her sheer determination, I don't think it's an accident a pretty young German woman wound up opposite my favorite Austrian killer robot. And I doubt it was an accident she comes dressed in the guise of a leather-clad, Lexus-driving material girl who pumps up her breast-size to get out of trouble.Further, the scene in which Arnold and Kristanna square off in a men's room is very nearly worth the price of admission. Not simply a dance of destruction, but subtly, a contest of dominance and submission. Indeed, Arnold works his old-fashioned German values into this film probably more than any other I've seen. Arnold's robot makes value judgments this time around and says things like "Maybe you're not the John Connor I know." I doubt it took more than a couple of Nazi movies for Schwarzenegger to feel it was his duty to rehabilitate the sensibilities of his grandparents to the typical American if he ever got the opportunity. One must wonder how much he is appealing the current, non-threatening (think Tom Hanks) consensus of movie manhood, when his character says things like "I am an obsolete design" and "she is a healthy female of breeding age." Finally, *** SPOILER *** one can't help but read into the imagery of Arnold's robot pulling a grasping female robot off of the John Connor character and ramming his, Arnold's, heart (metaphorically) down her throat to finish her off. The young Connor escapes with his bride-to-be. This is a powerful image of male dominance that implies something of fatherhood and parental dynamics.It's easy to debate these inferences, but it's important to remember that when Hollywood whispers, everyone hears.I think old Arnold thinks the American male is a little embattled and a little down on himself and thinks we could take a lesson from our vanquished teutonic foes. Because this is the movie he'd make given that mindset.Do we need this shot in the arm? Hey, I'M not gonna argue with him. It's Arnold!This movie review by Erik Gloor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS (this is a reply to everyone wanting a T4)Thats all folks. THERE WILL NOT BE A T4. the whole backbone of the story is not the war between man and machine, but the prevention of said war. There is nothing left to the Terminator series now that "judgement day" has arrived. Now that John Connors is "in charge" there is nothing that the machines can do to stop that.Killing Connors before he gained control was the machine's motives. Without the time travel aspect what does the movie have that is unique? nothing.Because John Connors survived Judgement day, he wins and the machines lose. thats it. winners connors, losers machines. i do not want to see another terminator movie about the war between humans and machines because there would not be a novelty to it at all. i thought the ending of T3 was perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: CONTAINS UNQUESTIONABLE SPOILERS!Oh, yeah! This movie is a perfect prequel to what can be an even more terrifying, intense, Orwellian and Fritz Langian T4 that can totally eclipse the first three. If I were writing the screenplay, this would be my opening:The missiles are flying, the nuclear warheads detonating. Every single bit of the horror we baby-boomers tried so hard to prevent in reality and to capture in nightmare fiction and film during the Cold War in "Level Seven," "Fail-Safe," "On the Beach," and "Seven Days in May" finally comes home to roost. But it's not the Soviets or the Red Chinese or even terrorists with black-market nuclear weapons who are responsible: It's our own creation, born from our fear and hubris - SkyNet.Scenes of people of every nation being vaporized in the middle of their day and night work and play activities around the globe are accompanied by the dark, apocalyptic chords and lyrics of "House at Pooneil Corners" by Jefferson Airplane (remember that one, fellow baby-boomers?)Gracie Slick sings as a SkyNet craft..."Circles...like a vulture."After a few short minutes of mind-bending horror that make us wish we had never invented atomic bombs or computers or even been born - instantly making us all almost Luddites - we find ourselves in a creepily silent post-apocalyptic world as only Industrial Light and Magic can portray them. It is possible to even tie this vision of hell in with technology we "successfully" harvested, retroengineered, and exploited from Roswell in 1947, but which we - the true sorceror's apprentices - never, ever completely understood.Scene upon scene of devastation assault us as the opening credits roll - we wish we had never started watching T4 but now we can't look away - and Marty Balin's angelic voice rises..."From here to heaven is a scar, Dead center, deep as death..." ...and Gracie Slick's voice joins his..."All the idiots have left..." ...followed by the whole band..."...the idiots have left. Cows are almost cooing, Turtle doves are mooing, Which is why..."The music starts to fade, and we are there."...a Pooh is poohing In the sun..."Somehow, a stuffed Pooh Bear lies unharmed next to his dead child in a sunny yard (a "clean" neutron bomb might accomplish that trick).John Connor and Kate Brewster will emerge as our leaders in the counter-revolution, though neither ever wanted or bargained for it. (But neither did Winston Churchill, in the years between WWI and WWII.)So will Sarah Connor. Nope, she ain't really dead, folks. She faked her death (why do you suppose her coffin was filled with guns and ammo that her son could easily procure anyhere instead of either her body or sandbags except as a message to her son if he's clever enough to figure it out after the dust settles - maybe Arnie knew about the ruse - we now know he can lie - and maybe not). Those two are humanity's only hope, there in the depths of Crystal Mountain (except possibly for Sarah, who I'd have underground in Mexico), with obsolete computers that have never been linked to SkyNet because they were created in the days before the DARPANet and the Internet were even thought of. They're slow, and they are programmed in almost archaic languages such as Fortran. But they work, and they are uninfected.This is a screenwriter's dream.Bring it on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie is good, it certainly is not as good as its 2 predecessors. Although the story is good, Kristanna Loken as the TX does not carry the film. Arnold continues to amaze with his physique (not bad for a 55+/- y.o.) but he has had better roles. His reprisal of the T101 terminator did not do him or the character any justice. I can see where the story line would allow for part 4 but I would hope that the powers that be would let it end here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that bothered me with this movie was the ending. The ending definitely lacked something and reminded me the fact that the movie was too short. Apparently the director played it very safe with this flick. He copied James Cameron's structure of the movie and did a good job. It was very fun and I think Claire Danes was good choice, just because of the moment she picked up the gun fired at the flying craft(I wish there was more of that). Chirstina Loken did an amazing job and she was HOT in that suit. Arnie also does a good job, except some jokes could have been told differently to make them funnier. The guy who played John Connor also captured not wanting to be the one kinda situation very well and made the transition to a hero good. There were no apparent mistakes in the movie, the FX were made to look real (which was a good choice for this movie, unlike the stylized Matrix sfx.) Although some parts were funky to the trained eye, I think overall this movie connected to T2 very well and extended creatively. But managed to fall short by an hair. B.</fullReview>

Arnold looked terrible!! John Connor and the girl had no screen presence!! There was not even one lousy minute in the movie where I felt amazed or impressed.

		<fullReview>This was the best action movie I have ever seen. Arnold's back in the role he was born to play and he's taking us on a non-stop ride packed with action, adventure, and few good laughs. This movie combines the darkness of the first film with the blockbuster action of the second film (without the cheese) and delivers up The Perfect Terminator movie. After the film was over I immediately wanted to see it again. Very rarely does a movie leave you feeling this excited after you've viewed it.

		<fullReview>This movie rocks. Really rocks. I give it 8 out of 10 stars. It's almost as good as T2, lacking only the older movie's emotional depth. The special effects are cutting edge, the script intelligent and the acting good. They didn't go for an obvious, easy ending either. Loken is the best terminator ever. Sure there's some plot holes, but they aren't as big as those in the Matrix.** MAJOR SPOILERS **Some reviewers either don't understand the trilogy or haven't seen the earlier movies in the franchise.First off, the ending is neither confusing nor does it suggest what led up to it was pointless. The ending fulfills the title: the war with the machines has begun. The goal of the evil terminators was to kill off mankind's hero in the coming war, and the protectors were to save him. The protectors won. That's not a bad ending. Arnold tells us early in the movie what the outcome will be.. It seems you cannot rewrite the future after all, contrary to what our hero has believed up til now. (Stephen Hawking is working on a theory that will show you cannot go back in time and make substantive changes in the future).Arnold can't go forward in time to get outfitted as a better terminator. One thing physics does reveal is that you cannot go forward in time. Another complaint was that the saw TX uses to free herself should have stuck to the magnets also. Not if it wasn't ferrous, so that scene is quite plausible. What we should be asking is why the ultra-advanced TX is made from ferrous materials at all.Loken is better than Patrick as a terminator -- she shows less emotion and is more consistent. Not to mention really hot. This movie was rated R -- why did they put that ugly wig over her breasts?Arnold was more dead-pan in T2, and was a better robot in T2. But he's fun in his new style, and I liked his performance. He had fun with this movie. ALL the acting this movie was at least competent, and some of it quite good. In T2, John's foster dad puts out one of the worst acting performances I've seen -- ever. I still cringe when he speaks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Connor is shown in a flash-forward in the beginning of 'T3,' not just as triumphant, but triumphant with an American flag draped over his shoulder. An American man saves the world from the small-minded machines. And so begins the sometimes not-so-subtle love song to the American man, that 'T3' so often is. A love song sung in broken English, and with a German accent.Nothing that Hollywood puts this much energy and money ino can ever be dismissed as just an action picture.A film student could probably do a pretty decent dissertation on the differences in directing styles by comparing 'T2' and 'T3' as two films that are as similar as two films can get in terms of subject-matter, but which differ so noticeably in tone and subtext.The cold, dark blue world of T2 was full of sophisticated foreboding and it couched it's fantastic effects and spectacular violence in some interesting meditations on the concepts of Generation X and of the passage of time. Arnold was older, but still the picture of vitality and robotic perfection. There was some poetry to the picture.The present effort is not devoid of these elements, but comes precipitously close on a number of different levels.For those of us who were 16 when the original 'Terminator' came out, watching 'T2' was like watching your idiot friend get a date with his sexy first-year college professor. Someone big decided to take this slightly moronic but highly entertaining concept seriously and make a silk purse out of it and it was great. 'T3' is kind of like what it'd be like if that friend came around again after marrying the professor and tried hard to remember what it was like to be down with his boys way back when. You want it to be the same, but it just isn't. It's an exercise in sentimentality mostly.But what we don't get in terms of depth and scope, we get in terms of Arnold's personal vision of masculinity.

There was some poetry to the picture.The present effort is not devoid of these elements, but comes precipitously close on a number of different levels.For those of us who were 16 when the original 'Terminator' came out, watching 'T2' was like watching your idiot friend get a date with his sexy first-year college professor. Someone big decided to take this slightly moronic but highly entertaining concept seriously and make a silk purse out of it and it was great. 'T3' is kind of like what it'd be like if that friend came around again after marrying the professor and tried hard to remember what it was like to be down with his boys way back when. You want it to be the same, but it just isn't. It's an exercise in sentimentality mostly.But what we don't get in terms of depth and scope, we get in terms of Arnold's personal vision of masculinity. I mean, let's face it, everybody knows the 'Terminator' movies are for boys -- the girls have 'Sex in the City.' Arnold's commentary on the state of the American male ego is subtle, but if you watch for it, it becomes very clear.Firstly, I was highly suspect of the newcomer bad-guy, or gal, in this case. From press pictures, she didn't seem scary at all -- or even mechanical in any way. I thought the angular dimensions and sheer size of someone like Brigitte Nielsen, in her heyday, would have been far more adequate a choice. But I have to say Kristanna Loken won me over early. Soft and supple, but somehow menacing in her sheer determination, I don't think it's an accident a pretty young German woman wound up opposite my favorite Austrian killer robot. And I doubt it was an accident she comes dressed in the guise of a leather-clad, Lexus-driving material girl who pumps up her breast-size to get out of trouble.Further, the scene in which Arnold and Kristanna square off in a men's room is very nearly worth the price of admission. Not simply a dance of destruction, but subtly, a contest of dominance and submission. Indeed, Arnold works his old-fashioned German values into this film probably more than any other I've seen. Arnold's robot makes value judgments this time around and says things like "Maybe you're not the John Connor I know." I doubt it took more than a couple of Nazi movies for Schwarzenegger to feel it was his duty to rehabilitate the sensibilities of his grandparents to the typical American if he ever got the opportunity. One must wonder how much he is appealing the current, non-threatening (think Tom Hanks) consensus of movie manhood, when his character says things like "I am an obsolete design" and "she is a healthy female of breeding age." Finally, *** SPOILER *** one can't help but read into the imagery of Arnold's robot pulling a grasping female robot off of the John Connor character and ramming his, Arnold's, heart (metaphorically) down her throat to finish her off. The young Connor escapes with his bride-to-be. This is a powerful image of male dominance that implies something of fatherhood and parental dynamics.It's easy to debate these inferences, but it's important to remember that when Hollywood whispers, everyone hears.I think old Arnold thinks the American male is a little embattled and a little down on himself and thinks we could take a lesson from our vanquished teutonic foes. Because this is the movie he'd make given that mindset.Do we need this shot in the arm? Hey, I'M not gonna argue with him. It's Arnold!This movie review by Erik Gloor</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Biehn (Kyle Reece) must be in Terminator 4 or it will FAIL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I wasn't too pleased with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines even though the movie unexpectedly ended the way I had hoped for. The feeling I was given during Terminator 1 and 2 was completely gone by the third. I blame this mainly on the music and weak characters. I see the first two movies as a puzzle. All the pieces seemed to fit together because James Cameron took the movies to heart and made sure everything was perfect. In the third movie it seemed like the movie was filled with many holes. The theme was completely lost, certain elements which I had hoped to see (the familiar picture of Sarah Conner from the previous movies, how in the world Cyberdyne Systems was able to rebuild itself and continue research) never showed.Agree with me or not, I believe that Arnold shouldn't have been in this movie. He was no longer necessary for the movie. Having another Terminator going back through time even though it was getting old with all these Terminator's going through time just doesn't work in my opinion. T3 should have been focused on the character John Conner more and on the birth of Skynet as it unleashed its wrath upon the world. I would have continued with the "Empire Strikes Back" theme but would have put more emphasis on it. I would have shown more T-80's (Those Terminator's from the T2-3D show at Universal Studio's.)Now for the point of me posting this topic. I feel the 4th and final movie should include Kyle Reece. His importance in playing the important role of the soldier going back in time to protect the past Sarah Conner is all too important. Plus he's one of my favorite characters!With Arnold supposedly coming back for the 4th, I think thats lame! &gt;.&lt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*I was a little worried going into this one. The Robobabe Terminator angle felt like a desperate attempt to inject some (unneeded) sex appeal into the franchise. I was worried there was going to be a scene where the Terminator and his Termimistress were going to try to consummate their Roboaffair. I am happy to report my fears were vanquished. Or do I mean terminated? They didn't really exploit her femininity at all. The supermodel Terminator was just there as a pleasing visual effect.So I'm relieved to tell you that "Terminator 3" is a success. This is a return to form for Schwarzenegger. It may very well be the best movie of the summer. I found myself amazed at some parts. The demolition derby with the big trucks was the kind of mindless destruction I used to associate with Arnold flicks. Great to see it back.So once again the Terminator has to jump through the time portal and save John Connor's rear end. Why does the human resistance keep sending back a dinosaur machine like Arnold? Surely they could come up with a more advanced killing machine or at least upgrade Schwarzenegger to meet the current supermodel preferred version.At any rate, the two Terminators are going to have to face off. This was the part I worried about the most. Was I going to enjoy watching a hot babe walk off the cover of Vogue and thrash Schwarzenegger? Could I even believe it was possible? Once again, the movie succeeds. Their fight in the bathroom was fantastic. It was a special effects overload. Many toilets were destroyed in the fight for the future.Overall, "Terminator 3" is a great summer flick. All I can say about the ending is this: Begun this Terminator war has...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines on July 2, the night it premiered and I was blown away by it. I was expecting it to not be all that great because James Cameron didn't direct this one but Arnold Schwarzenegger was in it and that was worth it enough to go see it. He reprises his role as the T-800 Terminator in terrific fashion and once again proves that he is the reason for these movies. One element missing that I wish Terminator 3 had was Sarah Conner. I'm glad we got an explanation of why she wasn't in this one but I think it would've been more interesting in some areas if she was in it. I was sketchy about how a third Terminator film could even take place with T2 almost virtually eliminating any plot for a third one but it is explained very well as to how a third one can take place. The Terminator (Arnold) explains that the events of T2 only postponed judgment day but that it was inevitable. Nick Stahl did a fine job as John Conner. Kristanna Loken was the perfect fit for the T-X and she was very nice to look at as well. Claire Danes did scream a little too much and was kind of annoying in her role as Conner's future wife Kate Brewster and I didn't see much chemistry develop between her and Stahl in the film. I thought it was clever to put in some sexual innuendos between the male and female terminator during their fight scenes (e.g. the T-X reverse wrapping her legs around the Terminator's waist, grabbing his you know what area and picking him up). The ending was a shocker but it was a great ending nonetheless. I was pleasantly happy with Terminator 3 and Jonathan Mostow deserves some credit for the way he directed this film. It's not easy to fill Cameron's shoes especially for the Terminator franchise. If you loved the first two films, you must see the third one. It is worth it and I plan on seeing it again in the theater I liked it so much. I'm not as picky as some people are when it comes to movies but I highly recommend watching this if you're a fan of the Terminator movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks for very solid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some imdb reviews before going to see the movie and I didn't have much of expectation. It turned to be false alarm. It is great movie - it follows traditions of first and second Terminator. It has very solid script and I counted only two moments, which might be edited out.Visual effects are very good, but they are not extraordinary. Anyway it is better this way, that vice versa in Star Wars Episode II.There are several funny episodes, which does not spoil movie at all. One can laugh or not, because movie does not depend on them at all. It is like T1 episode in hotel, when Arny selects "@##! off" from menu. That one also was decoration, but very good one.POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*****************************************I liked ending, it is first not happy end for Terminator movies. It should have been that way. Machines are too powerful even now and once they got loose, nothing will stop them. It is better not to start such things. Also, movie shows that machine can be really human, but not by behavior as in second terminator. It shows that they can make choices, which are against their orders and which are right in human sense. Of course, it is not very sophisticated in the scene, where Arny breaks the car, instead of killing John. BTW, Arny is really great: just recall scenes with sunglasses.There is couple of logical and technical mistakes in the movie, which are not very critical. At first, how Skynet can start sending virus, if it was only in air force laboratory and not connected anywhere else? Also it was not even self-aware, so it should not have had evil intentions at that point. At second, phrase "our firewalls are holding virus" sounds great, but I hope, it is not a case and military networks are completely physically separated from Internet. At third, it is just usual stuff in action movies, Terminatrix was able run with speed of a car, but it cannot overtake Kate and John in the tunnel on the airbase.And last, I like Claire Danes and Arnold Schwarzenegger (in case if I meet him someday :), but rest of the actors play looks a bit forced.*****************************************I gave 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Complement to the Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although parts of it seem contradictory to certain things within our expectations, this film is MAXIMUM fun. Sequels/prequels cannot ever meet up to hype and expectation.Although the movie does fall short due to the non-Brad-Fiedel score and a cop-out excuse for the exclusion of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton turned down her role, thus an alternate story had to be made up to explain her character's absence), it is nevertheless the most explosive and well-paced action flick of the summer so far.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** People grudge about the ending, but this is not "The Empire Strikes Back," "Attack of the Clones," "Lord of the Rings," or "Back to the Future." This is the PERFECT ending to the story. T4 is T1. Remember, we are talking about time travel paradox here. This story has no ending. It is fine the way it is: looping around. The progression is: T1, T2, T3, T1, T2, T3, T1...etc.*SPOILER-FREE AGAIN* A T4 completely set in the future--to let us see the full-scale future war sequences that we only slightly saw and heard about--will be a good complement. Heck you don't even need Arnold for that. All you need are plenty of endoskeletons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, on it's own merits, T3 is a good movie. However, it is not a good sequel to T2, and is absolutely not an adequate ending for the series. If you are a fan of Terminator, pass on this film.Jonathan Mostow was obviously not a fan of the first 2 Cameron films. If he had been, he would have been true to the world of the Terminator. In the first place, Sarah Connor is the heart of films -- not the T-101. Obviously, Arnold is the boxoffice star, but he is not the protagonist of the story. Neither is John Connor, for that matter. Since Mostow didn't have a problem casting Nick Stahl as John Connor, he should have cast another actress as Sarah Connor -- T3 needed Sarah Connor. And why is Eddie Furlong not in this film? Nothing against Stahl, but he was miscast. And so was Claire Danes.Good chase scene -- mega destruction. Pretty, pretty T-X. Story needed major re-write and some James Cameron input.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines on July 2, the night it premiered and I was blown away by it. I was expecting it to not be all that great because James Cameron didn't direct this one but Arnold Schwarzenegger was in it and that was worth it enough to go see it. He reprises his role as the T-800 Terminator in terrific fashion and once again proves that he is the reason for these movies. One element missing that I wish Terminator 3 had was Sarah Conner. I'm glad we got an explanation of why she wasn't in this one but I think it would've been more interesting in some areas if she was in it. I was sketchy about how a third Terminator film could even take place with T2 almost virtually eliminating any plot for a third one but it is explained very well as to how a third one can take place. The Terminator (Arnold) explains that the events of T2 only postponed judgment day but that it was inevitable. Nick Stahl did a fine job as John Conner. Kristanna Loken was the perfect fit for the T-X and she was very nice to look at as well. Claire Danes did scream a little too much and was kind of annoying in her role as Conner's future wife Kate Brewster and I didn't see much chemistry develop between her and Stahl in the film. I thought it was clever to put in some sexual innuendos between the male and female terminator during their fight scenes (e.g. the T-X reverse wrapping her legs around the Terminator's waist, grabbing his you know what area and picking him up). The ending was a shocker but it was a great ending nonetheless. I was pleasantly happy with Terminator 3 and Jonathan Mostow deserves some credit for the way he directed this film. It's not easy to fill Cameron's shoes especially for the Terminator franchise. If you loved the first two films, you must see the third one. It is worth it and I plan on seeing it again in the theater I liked it so much. I'm not as picky as some people are when it comes to movies but I highly recommend watching this if you're a fan of the Terminator movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks for very solid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some imdb reviews before going to see the movie and I didn't have much of expectation. It turned to be false alarm. It is great movie - it follows traditions of first and second Terminator. It has very solid script and I counted only two moments, which might be edited out.Visual effects are very good, but they are not extraordinary. Anyway it is better this way, that vice versa in Star Wars Episode II.There are several funny episodes, which does not spoil movie at all. One can laugh or not, because movie does not depend on them at all. It is like T1 episode in hotel, when Arny selects "@##! off" from menu. That one also was decoration, but very good one.POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*****************************************I liked ending, it is first not happy end for Terminator movies. It should have been that way. Machines are too powerful even now and once they got loose, nothing will stop them. It is better not to start such things. Also, movie shows that machine can be really human, but not by behavior as in second terminator. It shows that they can make choices, which are against their orders and which are right in human sense. Of course, it is not very sophisticated in the scene, where Arny breaks the car, instead of killing John. BTW, Arny is really great: just recall scenes with sunglasses.There is couple of logical and technical mistakes in the movie, which are not very critical. At first, how Skynet can start sending virus, if it was only in air force laboratory and not connected anywhere else? Also it was not even self-aware, so it should not have had evil intentions at that point. At second, phrase "our firewalls are holding virus" sounds great, but I hope, it is not a case and military networks are completely physically separated from Internet. At third, it is just usual stuff in action movies, Terminatrix was able run with speed of a car, but it cannot overtake Kate and John in the tunnel on the airbase.And last, I like Claire Danes and Arnold Schwarzenegger (in case if I meet him someday :), but rest of the actors play looks a bit forced.*****************************************I gave 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Complement to the Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although parts of it seem contradictory to certain things within our expectations, this film is MAXIMUM fun. Sequels/prequels cannot ever meet up to hype and expectation.Although the movie does fall short due to the non-Brad-Fiedel score and a cop-out excuse for the exclusion of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton turned down her role, thus an alternate story had to be made up to explain her character's absence), it is nevertheless the most explosive and well-paced action flick of the summer so far.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** People grudge about the ending, but this is not "The Empire Strikes Back," "Attack of the Clones," "Lord of the Rings," or "Back to the Future." This is the PERFECT ending to the story. T4 is T1. Remember, we are talking about time travel paradox here. This story has no ending. It is fine the way it is: looping around. The progression is: T1, T2, T3, T1, T2, T3, T1...etc.*SPOILER-FREE AGAIN* A T4 completely set in the future--to let us see the full-scale future war sequences that we only slightly saw and heard about--will be a good complement. Heck you don't even need Arnold for that. All you need are plenty of endoskeletons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, on it's own merits, T3 is a good movie. However, it is not a good sequel to T2, and is absolutely not an adequate ending for the series. If you are a fan of Terminator, pass on this film.Jonathan Mostow was obviously not a fan of the first 2 Cameron films. If he had been, he would have been true to the world of the Terminator. In the first place, Sarah Connor is the heart of films -- not the T-101. Obviously, Arnold is the boxoffice star, but he is not the protagonist of the story. Neither is John Connor, for that matter. Since Mostow didn't have a problem casting Nick Stahl as John Connor, he should have cast another actress as Sarah Connor -- T3 needed Sarah Connor. And why is Eddie Furlong not in this film? Nothing against Stahl, but he was miscast. And so was Claire Danes.Good chase scene -- mega destruction. Pretty, pretty T-X. Story needed major re-write and some James Cameron input.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Biehn (Kyle Reece) must be in Terminator 4 or it will FAIL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I wasn't too pleased with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines even though the movie unexpectedly ended the way I had hoped for. The feeling I was given during Terminator 1 and 2 was completely gone by the third. I blame this mainly on the music and weak characters. I see the first two movies as a puzzle. All the pieces seemed to fit together because James Cameron took the movies to heart and made sure everything was perfect. In the third movie it seemed like the movie was filled with many holes. The theme was completely lost, certain elements which I had hoped to see (the familiar picture of Sarah Conner from the previous movies, how in the world Cyberdyne Systems was able to rebuild itself and continue research) never showed.Agree with me or not, I believe that Arnold shouldn't have been in this movie. He was no longer necessary for the movie. Having another Terminator going back through time even though it was getting old with all these Terminator's going through time just doesn't work in my opinion. T3 should have been focused on the character John Conner more and on the birth of Skynet as it unleashed its wrath upon the world. I would have continued with the "Empire Strikes Back" theme but would have put more emphasis on it. I would have shown more T-80's (Those Terminator's from the T2-3D show at Universal Studio's.)Now for the point of me posting this topic. I feel the 4th and final movie should include Kyle Reece. His importance in playing the important role of the soldier going back in time to protect the past Sarah Conner is all too important. Plus he's one of my favorite characters!With Arnold supposedly coming back for the 4th, I think thats lame! &gt;.&lt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 was a good movie don't get me wrong. However, T1 &amp; T2 were such great movies it had a hard act to follow. T3 had great action at the beginning &amp; the car chase was excellent but it just didn't live up to the first two. Had it been a stand alone movie, I would have been impressed but it just didn't reach the heights of T1 &amp; T2. Ah-nuld is still good though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*I was a little worried going into this one. The Robobabe Terminator angle felt like a desperate attempt to inject some (unneeded) sex appeal into the franchise. I was worried there was going to be a scene where the Terminator and his Termimistress were going to try to consummate their Roboaffair. I am happy to report my fears were vanquished. Or do I mean terminated? They didn't really exploit her femininity at all. The supermodel Terminator was just there as a pleasing visual effect.So I'm relieved to tell you that "Terminator 3" is a success. This is a return to form for Schwarzenegger. It may very well be the best movie of the summer. I found myself amazed at some parts. The demolition derby with the big trucks was the kind of mindless destruction I used to associate with Arnold flicks. Great to see it back.So once again the Terminator has to jump through the time portal and save John Connor's rear end. Why does the human resistance keep sending back a dinosaur machine like Arnold? Surely they could come up with a more advanced killing machine or at least upgrade Schwarzenegger to meet the current supermodel preferred version.At any rate, the two Terminators are going to have to face off. This was the part I worried about the most. Was I going to enjoy watching a hot babe walk off the cover of Vogue and thrash Schwarzenegger? Could I even believe it was possible? Once again, the movie succeeds. Their fight in the bathroom was fantastic. It was a special effects overload. Many toilets were destroyed in the fight for the future.Overall, "Terminator 3" is a great summer flick. All I can say about the ending is this: Begun this Terminator war has...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although parts of it seem contradictory to certain things within our expectations, this film is MAXIMUM fun. Sequels/prequels cannot ever meet up to hype and expectation.Although the movie does fall short due to the non-Brad-Fiedel score and a cop-out excuse for the exclusion of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton turned down her role, thus an alternate story had to be made up to explain her character's absence), it is nevertheless the most explosive and well-paced action flick of the summer so far.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** People grudge about the ending, but this is not "The Empire Strikes Back," "Attack of the Clones," "Lord of the Rings," or "Back to the Future." This is the PERFECT ending to the story. T4 is T1. Remember, we are talking about time travel paradox here. This story has no ending. It is fine the way it is: looping around. The progression is: T1, T2, T3, T1, T2, T3, T1...etc.*SPOILER-FREE AGAIN* A T4 completely set in the future--to let us see the full-scale future war sequences that we only slightly saw and heard about--will be a good complement. Heck you don't even need Arnold for that. All you need are plenty of endoskeletons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had by far the best action scenes and special EFX I've ever seen. Now whether or not it stacks up with T2 or not, personally I don't care. I will say, however, I did go into this movie with very little expectations so perhaps thats why I enjoyed it so much. I was pleasantly surprised. In a era of mindless summer blockbusters, maybe we all should just put our brains to bed for a bit and go out and be entertained. Not all of us are long-haired, overweight, losers who still live at home and have aspirations of attending film school and directing the next great sci-fi epic. So, for all you other folks, I highly recommend this flick. Arnold is funnier than ever and the mindless action actually develops a bit of a brain about 45 minutes in which does help greatly. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fortunately i got in for free</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i was so hyped up to see this movie. from the day i first heard it was announced to the week of its release, it was the one movie i was actually looking forward to. buddy of mine that worked at our local cinema-plex got me in for free and i sat down with only the best of intentions. i knew something was wrong the minute the opening credits came up and "holy sh*t?! wheres the all to familiar Terminator theme by Brad Fiedel?" i almost wanted to cry. by the end of the movies i had more questions than just those to ask. like why did they send poor Arnold's model back to fight off the T-X? the t-800 vs. the t-1000 wasnt so bad and it put Arnold at a little disadvantage and made him have to outwit the thing. if they were even, then it wouldnt have been interesting. but the t-800 vs. the t-x wasnt even remotely fair. its like a toaster vs. a flamethrower. what the hell were the story writers thinking?acting wise, the movie was average. Arnold played his part as the emotionless cyborg excellently as usual. Nick Stahl was pretty convincing as the future leader John Connor and Claire Danes was just there. nothing really standing out in her role. Newcomer Kristanna Loken played the T-X very well. Unfortunately the new female terminator just didnt seem as terrifying as the previous terminators and really didnt give you that sense of hopelessness and despair as Robert Patrick's and Arnold's previous terminator roles did. you wanna be scared of the terminator, not drool over it. but i guess that was the whole point. drool and be scared at the same time.overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was an entertaining summer flick and one of the better big-budget action movies released in a while. the ending was one that made you think yet very dissapointing. kinda like terminator sorta kinda maybe 2.5. i think James Cameron's direction would have been much better. an average action flick with the Terminator name stamped on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming Soon- Terminator 4 : Warriors of the Wasteland ???? Not really, I just made that title up.... But that was exactly how I felt after the somber (cliffhanger without actualy being a cliffhanger) ending.I went to this with an open mind (since Jim Cameron didn't produce it). After all, didn't Jim Cameron have a breakthrough success with "ALIENS"...and he didn't produce the first one... so I kept an open mindThis one had much more humor in it than the 2 previous films, the whole theater errupted with uncontrolable laughter at the "TALK TO THE HAND!" scene at the begining of the film. The chase scene was great too (MATRIX 2's chase scene blows T3's chase Scene away). and yes the plot did have some holes.... but I can over look those holes because the plot holes seem to be what keeps the story line going from one film to the next (in other words, plot holes are a necesary evil if you want to keep the story going).I couldn't help but feel like this film was acting as a bridge story that is setting the stage for future Terminator movies (probably without Arnald)that will take place in the futuristic post nuclear war landscape where humans are fighting the war against the machines....In a strange kinda way, I hope that is exactly what is happening with this franchise... we'll see in the futureI give this film 7 out of 10 stars -go see it, its pretty good</fullReview>

The writing is terrible, its not clever, its almost the same plot as T2, yet it doesn't work because, its almost the same plot as T2, its been done. and its been done very well in the past, so well, that its not going to be outdone by this b movie piece of garbage. this movie is honestly like a slap stick comedy, not a tech noir, science fiction like its 2 predecessors. i can't say enough about how bad this is, but for your sake and the sake of the ones you care about, do not go anywhere near this suck-fest entitled T3 because some of its suckiness might rub off on you, and believe me, you don't want that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Summer Movie (Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor SpoilersTerminator 3 is exactly the type of movie that I like to see as part of the summer blockbuster season. It's loaded with incredible looking action, it's humorous , and it has a huge cheese factor. The storyline is only used just to get to the next explosion or the next joke. But even so, for the most part the story seemed right on par with the previous installments, and at the ending, it completely took off and a classic was born.In a huge departure from the previous installments, director Jonathan Mostow has taken the James Cameron-abandoned franchise and made it his own with a very exciting and thrilling film. I thought the ending of T3 was simply amazing and such a welcome change from the 'happy' ending that follows so many of the summer movies. Very courageous of Mostow as well, I might add.The films titanic budget is all up there on the screen and was used to great effect (minus Arnie's $30 million take of course).The action in this movie is truly the show stopper here. The sequence with the upending crane truck was absolutely staggering and completely blew my mind. The best car chase scene I have ever scene (or at least the most destructive). The hearse sequence, is also very noteworthy. The action sequences never let up and really demonstrate just how far along the advances in CGI, animatronics, and even make-up have come. Kudos to the always excellent work by Stan Winston with his T-X design and fully-functioning T-1 robots.I think that what many of the negative reviewers of this film take issue with is the lack of subtle humor that was so prevalent in the first two movies. The comedy was put into overdrive for this film, as Arnie delivers more one-liners than ever, some of them absolutely atrocious. But if you can just laugh them off, you'll still be in for a great ride. The humourous cameo by Dr. Silberman was a nice touch.Schwarzenegger however to my surprise, is still very convincing as the cybernetic organism that he first played almost twenty years ago, and his physique for the most part is as it was back in 1984, although he does look a little smaller. Kristanna Loken did a great job too as the female T-X, but I still think that Robert Patrick as the merciless T-1000 is still the most ruthless of the villain Terminators.Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John Connor and Kate Brewster respectively, also put in decent performances. Connor does look like a grungy vagrant, but a liquid metal terminator coming through the future ten years ago solely to kill you, is bound to be somewhat traumatic for the guy, and might just cause him to live an alternate lifestyle.All in all, a very entertaining popcorn flick. Highly recommended if you enjoy action movies, or the Terminator film franchise (if you can digest some minor plot holes). I can't wait for the DVD, and I hope that T4 gets the greenlight too, with Mostow once again at the helm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popcorn Movie...nothing more, nothing less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like the problem with a lot of reviews is that many are forgetting this series is called: "The Terminator", and that is what is continuing to happen in Terminator 3."John Connor" is looking to be terminated by the machines who rule existence in the future -- come heck or high water. That is THEIR plan which is the whole point of these films. Send a machine, or machines, to kill John Connor or to possibly SAVE John Connor. Once you get that in your brain, nothing else matters. What we are seeing is what occurs in and around John's life as this happens and why these machines NEED for it to happen. Remember that, and you may -- or may not -- enjoy, Terminator 3.With that in mind, who cares if Arnold is there or not. He's a lovely "familiar" addition, but by no means the make or break all of the central idea. This franchise CAN go on without him. Arnold's character (if you want to call it that) is a TYPE of machine model that will either save or destroy John Connor. Depends on who's programming what at which time...This terminator MODEL has the same face. Arnold's. Do not be surprised if the next Terminator movie (God Forbid, hut hey, money is money) has several Arnolds in it and ya don't know which is "good" or "bad". There are other advanced models sent as we now are aware such as...the "Robert Patrick" model and this Barbie doll from a Rodeo drive window. (As a resident of Beverly Hills I take offense, she should have been at least 53 years old, and should have came out of a plastic surgeon's chair as she was getting rhinoplasty/breast augmentation or a tummy tuck. Now that would have been a fun film!)There will be many more sent, etc...but don't forget the point --- that the Arnold model terminator is a "dependable", "stronger" model even if its older than the others send to do the job of terminating John Connor at various ages and stages in the game.Heck yes, I miss James Cameron's work, but I would have been disappointed if he went into this mire of Hollywood Franchise Business at this stage in his career. Same with Linda Hamilton. Onwards and upwards, I always say.Mr. Mostow has HIS chance now and he's done exactly what was needed of him. Studio execs are applauding. To produce an adolescent testosterone driven Holiday release popcorn movie heavy on explosions, action and pyrotechnics and thin on plot, story and series continuity.MAJOR Terminator fans will be scratching their heads at a lot of this installment, younger viewers will be thrilled and give the film praises because it's all the old Hollywood rape your pockets for the summer shuffle and jive of "smoke and mirrors action". On the other hand, the ending (like everyone else I wont give away) but for me, well worth the price I paid to get in this weekend to see it (and that was on a matinée.)Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (Which by the way, is the best title since "South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut") is nothing more than some popcorn selling "entertainment" to kill a long drawn out holiday weekend and another, installment in "the Life of John Connor, human savior."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great sequel to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying the first two Terminators are among my all time favorites. I left the theaters amazed and thought the ticket was well worth it. I'll always own copies on tape (and now need to purchase the DVD's with the extra features).I can't really say that for "T3". While there was good action and Kristiana Loken was very good as the T-X, I thought there could've been more new ground to cover. How about a more extended look at the future, after the nuclear bombs have dropped and the humans have to fight the machines? How about seeing John Conner as the great military leader he supposedly is? Or seeing how the terminators were first created? Maybe we'll see those concepts in "T4" assuming there will be one. There can only be so many times these machines can go back to track down John Conner and whoever he's associated with. Overall this wasn't bad, but after 12 years of waiting and hoping for another sequel I expected a little more.</fullReview>

It has more plot than T1, or T2 combined.The lack of Cameron does not bother me at all. It also has several twists that give it more depth than the previous Terminator movies. The special effects were great, well above the Matrix movies if you ask me. CGI use was nice and not overdone.Arnold is back in top shape for this one as well. I really hope we see a T4. I think it was not a good time to release T3. My theatre was pretty empty on Friday night (the 4th of July). I think a lot of people were out to other Holiday parties. I guess we'll know on later on.More action, more destruction, more plot, more Terminator, go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to back home runs with T2 and T3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator was a great movie in it's own right. It was an 80s horror film that introduced many of us to Arnold (those of us who hadn't seen Conan). However, Terminator lacked intricacy in it's writing and plot. That problem was quickly resolved in Terminator 2, which showed us that there was so much more to the future, Skynet, and Cyberdyne systems than we thought. Terminator 2 not only brought more story to the table, but more action. It also introduced us to a couple of great actors (Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong). The long anticipated Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines picked up right where T2 left off. Where can you go from T2, some may ask? The story was already brought to a conclusion, right? Wrong. Just when you thought you knew everything, you finally realize that you hardly anything. T3 does exactly what T2 did for Terminator. It takes us even DEEPER into the world of the Terminators and answers a lot of questions that many of us had after T2. The creators of this movie took a series that seemingly had it's strings tied up and created a whole new chapter that is brilliant in it's depth. Not only does T3 bring a great story to the table just as T2 did, but it too brings blockbuster action. After watching T3, it's arguably the best action movie of this summer. Mostow does a great job of filling in for Cameron (we miss you James!). It's truly enjoyable to watch action movies as they used to be made...without much aid of computers. Matrix Reloaded was great...but it relied heavily on computer imagery. Most of T3's action is genuine, jaw dropping stunts. And just as T2 introduced us to new Hollywood faces, so too does T3. Nick Stahl, who plays John Connor, has a great deal of acting talent. He brings his own touch to the character of Connor, now 20 something. We see a whole new side of Connor, very different from the one we saw in T2. In T2, Connor was a rebellious teen who just wanted to have a good time with his friends at the arcade. T3 shows us a worn down, depressed, junkie. Stahl did an excellent job of pulling off the role. He reminded me very much of Tobey Macguire in this movie, perhaps due to his narration and soft-spoken demeanor. We're also introduced to Kristanna Loken, who plays the T-X. It's hard to gauge whether anyone who's recruited to play a terminator truly has any acting talent. The role just doesn't do actors any justice. They must literally constrain their acting talents to the confines of a robot. We obviously know, now, that Schwartzenegger and Patrick were better actors than their terminator roles made them out to be. So too will be the case, I believe, with Loken. Not just anyone can play the role of a terminator. It takes a certain breed and I believe the creators of T3 did a great job of casting. All in all, I give this movie a 9.5, but seeing as that's not a choice, I just rounded up to 10. Bash me if you wish, but I suggest you see the movie. It really is worth the time and money. It delivers in every possible way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator films are supposed to rule. Even in the age where sequels, by definition, suck, somehow Terminator 2 still ruled (maybe even more than the first). A standard was set, they aimed high and they hit higher with strong characters, a strong story and excellent effects.T-3 did NOT rule, however. There was virtually NO story, the special effects were completely derivative of T2 (couldn't the cgi geeks come up with something better?), the characters were so devoid of depth that you almost wished them dead and the authors copped out by simply dismissing the well crafted plot of the earlier Terminator films.The introduction of cute one liners from T2 was so overused in T-3 that it got stale quicker than a "Charlie's Angels" sequel. The film makers of T-3 simply cashed in on a proven formula and didn't seem to care one bit about fumbling on one of the best film storylines ever created. I, for one, had expected that they would have spent much more time on the story and had done justice to the prior films. Mediocrity does not belong in Terminator films;they deserve much, much more. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like the problem with a lot of reviews is that many are forgetting this series is called: "The Terminator", and that is what is continuing to happen in Terminator 3."John Connor" is looking to be terminated by the machines who rule existence in the future -- come heck or high water. That is THEIR plan which is the whole point of these films. Send a machine, or machines, to kill John Connor or to possibly SAVE John Connor. Once you get that in your brain, nothing else matters. What we are seeing is what occurs in and around John's life as this happens and why these machines NEED for it to happen. Remember that, and you may -- or may not -- enjoy, Terminator 3.With that in mind, who cares if Arnold is there or not. He's a lovely "familiar" addition, but by no means the make or break all of the central idea. This franchise CAN go on without him. Arnold's character (if you want to call it that) is a TYPE of machine model that will either save or destroy John Connor. Depends on who's programming what at which time...This terminator MODEL has the same face. Arnold's. Do not be surprised if the next Terminator movie (God Forbid, hut hey, money is money) has several Arnolds in it and ya don't know which is "good" or "bad". There are other advanced models sent as we now are aware such as...the "Robert Patrick" model and this Barbie doll from a Rodeo drive window. (As a resident of Beverly Hills I take offense, she should have been at least 53 years old, and should have came out of a plastic surgeon's chair as she was getting rhinoplasty/breast augmentation or a tummy tuck. Now that would have been a fun film!)There will be many more sent, etc...but don't forget the point --- that the Arnold model terminator is a "dependable", "stronger" model even if its older than the others send to do the job of terminating John Connor at various ages and stages in the game.Heck yes, I miss James Cameron's work, but I would have been disappointed if he went into this mire of Hollywood Franchise Business at this stage in his career. Same with Linda Hamilton. Onwards and upwards, I always say.Mr. Mostow has HIS chance now and he's done exactly what was needed of him. Studio execs are applauding. To produce an adolescent testosterone driven Holiday release popcorn movie heavy on explosions, action and pyrotechnics and thin on plot, story and series continuity.MAJOR Terminator fans will be scratching their heads at a lot of this installment, younger viewers will be thrilled and give the film praises because it's all the old Hollywood rape your pockets for the summer shuffle and jive of "smoke and mirrors action". On the other hand, the ending (like everyone else I wont give away) but for me, well worth the price I paid to get in this weekend to see it (and that was on a matinée.)Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (Which by the way, is the best title since "South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut") is nothing more than some popcorn selling "entertainment" to kill a long drawn out holiday weekend and another, installment in "the Life of John Connor, human savior."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great sequel to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying the first two Terminators are among my all time favorites. I left the theaters amazed and thought the ticket was well worth it. I'll always own copies on tape (and now need to purchase the DVD's with the extra features).I can't really say that for "T3". While there was good action and Kristiana Loken was very good as the T-X, I thought there could've been more new ground to cover. How about a more extended look at the future, after the nuclear bombs have dropped and the humans have to fight the machines? How about seeing John Conner as the great military leader he supposedly is? Or seeing how the terminators were first created? Maybe we'll see those concepts in "T4" assuming there will be one. There can only be so many times these machines can go back to track down John Conner and whoever he's associated with. Overall this wasn't bad, but after 12 years of waiting and hoping for another sequel I expected a little more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator is back on top!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was pretty good. Some will fault T3 because of the lacking of some characters, but it does not hurt this film. It has more plot than T1, or T2 combined.The lack of Cameron does not bother me at all. It also has several twists that give it more depth than the previous Terminator movies. The special effects were great, well above the Matrix movies if you ask me. CGI use was nice and not overdone.Arnold is back in top shape for this one as well. I really hope we see a T4. I think it was not a good time to release T3. My theatre was pretty empty on Friday night (the 4th of July). I think a lot of people were out to other Holiday parties. I guess we'll know on later on.More action, more destruction, more plot, more Terminator, go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to back home runs with T2 and T3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator was a great movie in it's own right. It was an 80s horror film that introduced many of us to Arnold (those of us who hadn't seen Conan). However, Terminator lacked intricacy in it's writing and plot. That problem was quickly resolved in Terminator 2, which showed us that there was so much more to the future, Skynet, and Cyberdyne systems than we thought. Terminator 2 not only brought more story to the table, but more action. It also introduced us to a couple of great actors (Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong). The long anticipated Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines picked up right where T2 left off. Where can you go from T2, some may ask? The story was already brought to a conclusion, right? Wrong. Just when you thought you knew everything, you finally realize that you hardly anything. T3 does exactly what T2 did for Terminator. It takes us even DEEPER into the world of the Terminators and answers a lot of questions that many of us had after T2. The creators of this movie took a series that seemingly had it's strings tied up and created a whole new chapter that is brilliant in it's depth. Not only does T3 bring a great story to the table just as T2 did, but it too brings blockbuster action. After watching T3, it's arguably the best action movie of this summer. Mostow does a great job of filling in for Cameron (we miss you James!). It's truly enjoyable to watch action movies as they used to be made...without much aid of computers. Matrix Reloaded was great...but it relied heavily on computer imagery. Most of T3's action is genuine, jaw dropping stunts. And just as T2 introduced us to new Hollywood faces, so too does T3. Nick Stahl, who plays John Connor, has a great deal of acting talent. He brings his own touch to the character of Connor, now 20 something. We see a whole new side of Connor, very different from the one we saw in T2. In T2, Connor was a rebellious teen who just wanted to have a good time with his friends at the arcade. T3 shows us a worn down, depressed, junkie. Stahl did an excellent job of pulling off the role. He reminded me very much of Tobey Macguire in this movie, perhaps due to his narration and soft-spoken demeanor. We're also introduced to Kristanna Loken, who plays the T-X. It's hard to gauge whether anyone who's recruited to play a terminator truly has any acting talent. The role just doesn't do actors any justice. They must literally constrain their acting talents to the confines of a robot. We obviously know, now, that Schwartzenegger and Patrick were better actors than their terminator roles made them out to be. So too will be the case, I believe, with Loken. Not just anyone can play the role of a terminator. It takes a certain breed and I believe the creators of T3 did a great job of casting. All in all, I give this movie a 9.5, but seeing as that's not a choice, I just rounded up to 10. Bash me if you wish, but I suggest you see the movie. It really is worth the time and money. It delivers in every possible way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Done so well, the action and the story line moved right along. I was caught up in the story within minutes of the movie starting. Just tell me how Arnold S. stays so young looking.

		<shortDescription>Mediocrity Unacceptable for a Terminator Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator films are supposed to rule. Even in the age where sequels, by definition, suck, somehow Terminator 2 still ruled (maybe even more than the first). A standard was set, they aimed high and they hit higher with strong characters, a strong story and excellent effects.T-3 did NOT rule, however. There was virtually NO story, the special effects were completely derivative of T2 (couldn't the cgi geeks come up with something better?), the characters were so devoid of depth that you almost wished them dead and the authors copped out by simply dismissing the well crafted plot of the earlier Terminator films.The introduction of cute one liners from T2 was so overused in T-3 that it got stale quicker than a "Charlie's Angels" sequel. The film makers of T-3 simply cashed in on a proven formula and didn't seem to care one bit about fumbling on one of the best film storylines ever created. I, for one, had expected that they would have spent much more time on the story and had done justice to the prior films. Mediocrity does not belong in Terminator films;they deserve much, much more. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Summer Movie (Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor SpoilersTerminator 3 is exactly the type of movie that I like to see as part of the summer blockbuster season. It's loaded with incredible looking action, it's humorous , and it has a huge cheese factor. The storyline is only used just to get to the next explosion or the next joke. But even so, for the most part the story seemed right on par with the previous installments, and at the ending, it completely took off and a classic was born.In a huge departure from the previous installments, director Jonathan Mostow has taken the James Cameron-abandoned franchise and made it his own with a very exciting and thrilling film. I thought the ending of T3 was simply amazing and such a welcome change from the 'happy' ending that follows so many of the summer movies. Very courageous of Mostow as well, I might add.The films titanic budget is all up there on the screen and was used to great effect (minus Arnie's $30 million take of course).The action in this movie is truly the show stopper here. The sequence with the upending crane truck was absolutely staggering and completely blew my mind. The best car chase scene I have ever scene (or at least the most destructive). The hearse sequence, is also very noteworthy. The action sequences never let up and really demonstrate just how far along the advances in CGI, animatronics, and even make-up have come. Kudos to the always excellent work by Stan Winston with his T-X design and fully-functioning T-1 robots.I think that what many of the negative reviewers of this film take issue with is the lack of subtle humor that was so prevalent in the first two movies. The comedy was put into overdrive for this film, as Arnie delivers more one-liners than ever, some of them absolutely atrocious. But if you can just laugh them off, you'll still be in for a great ride. The humourous cameo by Dr. Silberman was a nice touch.Schwarzenegger however to my surprise, is still very convincing as the cybernetic organism that he first played almost twenty years ago, and his physique for the most part is as it was back in 1984, although he does look a little smaller. Kristanna Loken did a great job too as the female T-X, but I still think that Robert Patrick as the merciless T-1000 is still the most ruthless of the villain Terminators.Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John Connor and Kate Brewster respectively, also put in decent performances. Connor does look like a grungy vagrant, but a liquid metal terminator coming through the future ten years ago solely to kill you, is bound to be somewhat traumatic for the guy, and might just cause him to live an alternate lifestyle.All in all, a very entertaining popcorn flick. Highly recommended if you enjoy action movies, or the Terminator film franchise (if you can digest some minor plot holes). I can't wait for the DVD, and I hope that T4 gets the greenlight too, with Mostow once again at the helm.</fullReview>

To produce an adolescent testosterone driven Holiday release popcorn movie heavy on explosions, action and pyrotechnics and thin on plot, story and series continuity.MAJOR Terminator fans will be scratching their heads at a lot of this installment, younger viewers will be thrilled and give the film praises because it's all the old Hollywood rape your pockets for the summer shuffle and jive of "smoke and mirrors action". On the other hand, the ending (like everyone else I wont give away) but for me, well worth the price I paid to get in this weekend to see it (and that was on a matinée.)Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (Which by the way, is the best title since "South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut") is nothing more than some popcorn selling "entertainment" to kill a long drawn out holiday weekend and another, installment in "the Life of John Connor, human savior."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great sequel to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying the first two Terminators are among my all time favorites. I left the theaters amazed and thought the ticket was well worth it. I'll always own copies on tape (and now need to purchase the DVD's with the extra features).I can't really say that for "T3". While there was good action and Kristiana Loken was very good as the T-X, I thought there could've been more new ground to cover. How about a more extended look at the future, after the nuclear bombs have dropped and the humans have to fight the machines? How about seeing John Conner as the great military leader he supposedly is? Or seeing how the terminators were first created? Maybe we'll see those concepts in "T4" assuming there will be one. There can only be so many times these machines can go back to track down John Conner and whoever he's associated with. Overall this wasn't bad, but after 12 years of waiting and hoping for another sequel I expected a little more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was pretty good. Some will fault T3 because of the lacking of some characters, but it does not hurt this film. It has more plot than T1, or T2 combined.The lack of Cameron does not bother me at all. It also has several twists that give it more depth than the previous Terminator movies. The special effects were great, well above the Matrix movies if you ask me. CGI use was nice and not overdone.Arnold is back in top shape for this one as well. I really hope we see a T4. I think it was not a good time to release T3. My theatre was pretty empty on Friday night (the 4th of July). I think a lot of people were out to other Holiday parties. I guess we'll know on later on.More action, more destruction, more plot, more Terminator, go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to back home runs with T2 and T3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator was a great movie in it's own right. It was an 80s horror film that introduced many of us to Arnold (those of us who hadn't seen Conan). However, Terminator lacked intricacy in it's writing and plot. That problem was quickly resolved in Terminator 2, which showed us that there was so much more to the future, Skynet, and Cyberdyne systems than we thought. Terminator 2 not only brought more story to the table, but more action. It also introduced us to a couple of great actors (Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong). The long anticipated Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines picked up right where T2 left off. Where can you go from T2, some may ask? The story was already brought to a conclusion, right? Wrong. Just when you thought you knew everything, you finally realize that you hardly anything. T3 does exactly what T2 did for Terminator. It takes us even DEEPER into the world of the Terminators and answers a lot of questions that many of us had after T2. The creators of this movie took a series that seemingly had it's strings tied up and created a whole new chapter that is brilliant in it's depth. Not only does T3 bring a great story to the table just as T2 did, but it too brings blockbuster action. After watching T3, it's arguably the best action movie of this summer. Mostow does a great job of filling in for Cameron (we miss you James!). It's truly enjoyable to watch action movies as they used to be made...without much aid of computers. Matrix Reloaded was great...but it relied heavily on computer imagery. Most of T3's action is genuine, jaw dropping stunts. And just as T2 introduced us to new Hollywood faces, so too does T3. Nick Stahl, who plays John Connor, has a great deal of acting talent. He brings his own touch to the character of Connor, now 20 something. We see a whole new side of Connor, very different from the one we saw in T2. In T2, Connor was a rebellious teen who just wanted to have a good time with his friends at the arcade. T3 shows us a worn down, depressed, junkie. Stahl did an excellent job of pulling off the role. He reminded me very much of Tobey Macguire in this movie, perhaps due to his narration and soft-spoken demeanor. We're also introduced to Kristanna Loken, who plays the T-X. It's hard to gauge whether anyone who's recruited to play a terminator truly has any acting talent. The role just doesn't do actors any justice. They must literally constrain their acting talents to the confines of a robot. We obviously know, now, that Schwartzenegger and Patrick were better actors than their terminator roles made them out to be. So too will be the case, I believe, with Loken. Not just anyone can play the role of a terminator. It takes a certain breed and I believe the creators of T3 did a great job of casting. All in all, I give this movie a 9.5, but seeing as that's not a choice, I just rounded up to 10. Bash me if you wish, but I suggest you see the movie. It really is worth the time and money. It delivers in every possible way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Terminator 3" is a worthy successor because it continues the series in exactly the same way that, say, "Alien3" did not. Whereas "A3" basically said "forget those earlier two movies" and did something disastrously different, "T3" follows through on situations set up in the first two installations, neither contradicting anything we were told earlier, nor pulling any crucial but previously unknown info out of a hat. (Think "Halloween II": "Gee, we forgot to tell you that Laurie Strode is Michael Myers' sister." Never have bought that. None of that nonsense here.) "T3" sets up familiar scenes--e.g., Arnold arrives naked from the future and has to find some clothes--then plays against expectations, often humorously, to resolve them.Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is absent, but still has her own contribution to make. "T1" was about Sarah; "T2" was about Sarah and her son John; "T3" is about reluctant hero John. But since the tuff-heroine aspect is so important to this series, that baton is passed to former teenager Claire Danes, who's surprisingly capable as a pi$$ed-off action chick.Arnold's Terminator--hostile in "T1", helpful in "T2"--is still helpful here, if a bit chattier. His matter-of-fact transmission of useful info, and his timely observations of human nature as he's been programmed to understand it ("Anger is more useful than despair"), make use of Arnold's gift of deadpan comedy. And the terminatrix, the TX, played by 23-year-old Kristanna Loken, is an absolute icepick. Combining the deadliest aspects of the earlier models' hardened skeleton AND liquid-metal body, this one adds built-in weapons systems and the ability to remote-control other machines. Loken has only two facial expressions here: a total blank, and a go-to-hell version of a Mona Lisa smirk. Both expressions are chillingly unblinking. Brrr!Ignore the whiners who are going on about how bad a movie they think this is; they're the equivalent of Comic Book Guy on "The Simpsons" saying, "Worst episode EVER!" Killer robots, nuclear peril, over-the-top vehicle chases, and a two-fisted action heroine: what more could you ask? Surprisingly downbeat ending, all but guaranteeing a "T4."

		<fullReview>What can one say about the same story told a different way. I mean we all know what happens and how and...well it is somehow still ok. I gave the movie a "5" and that is better than most this summer. Arnold S. is getting a bit long of tooth but he still looks pretty formidable. The rest is fairly fragile stuff in the plot department so I won't risk any "spoilers" but let us agree that the story isn't much. The action is up to current standards of exploding cars , buildings, people etc..But just once I would like someone to clue me in on the problem of how these super terminators can EVER lose. Nothing stops them so how would humans ever win even in the future?There is a hint in this movie and I am going to assume that the creators of this situation have pondered that problem and that will be visited in Terminator "4"?I can't really see to much to change in the format. It is what it IS! The formula works and why change it? For fans, and I am one, it is great.A great movie in form and substance it isn't, but who cares. "Hasta la vista Baby!"</fullReview>

Having watched T-1 and T-2 roughly 50 times each, I would consider myself a huge Terminator fan.This movie delivers the best movie of the year, and its doubtful very many movies could top this (aside from possibly ROTK, should it be good).John Mostow provides an interesting, new perspective on the franchise.

DO NOT expect to get a chance to get up and goto the bathroom.I've read that some film critics claim that this Terminator doesn't have a story, nor a heart (compared to either of the earlier movies) is rather wrong. The theme of the movie is different from T-1 and T-2.Unlike T-1 and T-2, which have messages of hope during horrible circumstances, T-3 heart lies in inevitability, fate and destiny. John's portrayl of hopelessness is excellent.*Possible Spoilers*The movie does take about 15 minutes to start up, but after that, is excellent. The direction of how the machines take over is brilliant. I was stunned at the portrayl of the actual rise of the machines. Even though there is a lack of future war scenes, the movie makes up in the beginning of the war. I doubt that any director could do a better job.The only complaints I could have in the movie is the 5 second scene where Arnold puts on his glasses for the first time, which was humorous, but not needed.

		<fullReview>Having seen all three of the Terminator films as an adult, I've been progressively disappointed as the movies have come along. The first was by far the best, with real characters, a great story idea, and a solid script. The second, Judgment Day, presented a great chase sequence, but progressed poorly thereafter with weak acting and a script that steadily worsened. While the special effects were amazing at the time, the film failed where it counts most: the appearance of sympathetic characters. This last installment, which hopefully will indeed be the last, is easily the weakest in the series with very poor acting, and a script that relies mostly on special effects and chase scenes. The attempts at humor are badly needed in this movie, which was borderline boring. Even Arnold, sorry to say, seems tired of his character. With all its heavy machinery, the film sinks under its own weight.</fullReview>

I laughed so hard I almost got kicked out of the theatre. By the way, cameron is the wrong guy for terminator. he is too serious and deep.The new director finally realized terminator's potential as a comedy, and exploited arnold's arnoldness to create the most lighthearted and funny terminator yet. It is too bad that all three weren't like this. Anyone who complains about his movie is a loser who can't lighten up and just have a good time.

		<shortDescription>A mere segue for T4?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, you know what? Arnie can't carry a movie with the Terminator shtick anymore... it's just gotten TOO old. You gotta give him credit for looking so good at his age, but all the one liners he's forced to utter seem so contrived and derivative (as does the majority of this movie). And that opening sunglasses gag?!... Gimme a break!It was Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton's energy &amp; desperation that brought T2 home, and their absence is acutely felt here (not to mention James Cameron's story telling and direction). I'm sure Furlong's real life personal challenges could have been incorporated to make John Connor's current state that much more striking... but oh, that would be too "risky" for such a cash-cow franchise. Clare Danes is the only actor here that could have generated some real empathy and humanity in this movie, but the poor writing does not ask her to.Robert Patrick's liquid-metal Terminator was excellent in T2 (still gives me the creeps just thinking about it) and his abilities &amp; limitations really added to the story and made some kind of sense. Kristanna Loken's coolness was great and her TerminatriX had real potential (should have had more sexy/gory scenes) but was ultimately derivative, as well. In addition, I didn't buy her upgraded terminator-ability of molting specific body parts into complicated machinery, and even less the idea that they could be permanently "damaged". (The story suffers when the writers don't follow their own rules.) God knows what unbelievable gimmick they'll come up with for T4, to try to out do the T-X!The action scenes were impressive, but I've grown tired of chase scenes pretty much altogether, each one trying to out do the last... they're just silly (e.g. Matrix Reloaded)... try spending the same time advancing the plot! (The last time I saw a decent chase scene was Ronin.) On top of that, they must have had wheels on the crane spreaders for that thing not to completely tip over right away!The only part that was really new and interesting was the end, at the military research facility, with the prototype robot tanks and planes running amok, but that was like only 10 minutes! There should also have been much more interaction with Colonel(?) Brewster, instead of killing him off as soon as they get to the research facility. It also made ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE that there were no military personnel manning that VIP bomb shelter... Very weak. However, I did like the CGI of nuclear missiles and explosions, but they didn't play up the Apocalypse enough... don't want to use up too much T4 material, I guess.Since this movie does a complete 1-80 with the deterministic aspect of fate (I thought "Fate is what you make it"?), it is a lot less hopeful than T1 &amp; T2 were. The only positive aspect about this new storyline is the relationship between John Connor and Kate Brewster, which everyone seems to like.With the amount of money they spent and the potential of the Terminator/Skynet premise, I was very much disappointed. This movie has its moments and could have been great, but it felt more like an expensive pilot for a post-doomsday TV series, and ends too early, just as things start to get interesting. Hopefully, they'll hire some real storytellers for the inevitable T4 for which this movie appears to be a mere segue. Rating for this `genre', given T2 is a 10/10: 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, you know what? Arnie can't carry a movie with the Terminator shtick anymore... it's just gotten TOO old. You gotta give him credit for looking so good at his age, but all the one liners he's forced to utter seem so contrived and derivative (as does the majority of this movie). And that opening sunglasses gag?!... Gimme a break!It was Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton's energy &amp; desperation that brought T2 home, and their absence is acutely felt here (not to mention James Cameron's story telling and direction). I'm sure Furlong's real life personal challenges could have been incorporated to make John Connor's current state that much more striking... but oh, that would be too "risky" for such a cash-cow franchise. Clare Danes is the only actor here that could have generated some real empathy and humanity in this movie, but the poor writing does not ask her to.Robert Patrick's liquid-metal Terminator was excellent in T2 (still gives me the creeps just thinking about it) and his abilities &amp; limitations really added to the story and made some kind of sense. Kristanna Loken's coolness was great and her TerminatriX had real potential (should have had more sexy/gory scenes) but was ultimately derivative, as well. In addition, I didn't buy her upgraded terminator-ability of molting specific body parts into complicated machinery, and even less the idea that they could be permanently "damaged". (The story suffers when the writers don't follow their own rules.) God knows what unbelievable gimmick they'll come up with for T4, to try to out do the T-X!The action scenes were impressive, but I've grown tired of chase scenes pretty much altogether, each one trying to out do the last... they're just silly (e.g. Matrix Reloaded)... try spending the same time advancing the plot! (The last time I saw a decent chase scene was Ronin.) On top of that, they must have had wheels on the crane spreaders for that thing not to completely tip over right away!The only part that was really new and interesting was the end, at the military research facility, with the prototype robot tanks and planes running amok, but that was like only 10 minutes! There should also have been much more interaction with Colonel(?) Brewster, instead of killing him off as soon as they get to the research facility. It also made ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE that there were no military personnel manning that VIP bomb shelter... Very weak. However, I did like the CGI of nuclear missiles and explosions, but they didn't play up the Apocalypse enough... don't want to use up too much T4 material, I guess.Since this movie does a complete 1-80 with the deterministic aspect of fate (I thought "Fate is what you make it"?), it is a lot less hopeful than T1 &amp; T2 were. The only positive aspect about this new storyline is the relationship between John Connor and Kate Brewster, which everyone seems to like.With the amount of money they spent and the potential of the Terminator/Skynet premise, I was very much disappointed. This movie has its moments and could have been great, but it felt more like an expensive pilot for a post-doomsday TV series, and ends too early, just as things start to get interesting. Hopefully, they'll hire some real storytellers for the inevitable T4 for which this movie appears to be a mere segue. Rating for this `genre', given T2 is a 10/10: 6.</fullReview>

Everything about this movie is excellent. It was well worth a ten year wait. Although I don't think it is better than Terminator 2 Judgement Day. I think it is a tie between them. I was Shocked to see that Judgement Day still happened. I guess Skynet did win.I wonder if they will make a Terminator 4. Overall excellent movie ****</fullReview>

The acting was great, although Kristanna Loken was a bit of a downer, she could've been better. The story took the T franchise into a whole new direction. Lemme also say that as an Arnold fan AND a HUGE T fan, I was never skeptical of this movie. It's not as PG-13 friendly as most of you people think either, at one point the TX shoves her arm through a guy's back and out the other side, I won't say who though since I'm not one for spoilers.

		<fullReview>I've been waiting 12 years for a new Terminator movie. Having watched T-1 and T-2 roughly 50 times each, I would consider myself a huge Terminator fan.This movie delivers the best movie of the year, and its doubtful very many movies could top this (aside from possibly ROTK, should it be good).John Mostow provides an interesting, new perspective on the franchise. Having been dissapointed with most of Camerons recent work, I am very glad he did this movie.The acting in the movie is pure gold, some of the best active I've seen. Arnold, Nick, Kristanna and Claire prove to be equal to any of the actors in the previous versious of the franchise.Action scenes are equal to both T-1 and T-2 in terms of intensity, possibly surpasing both.The pacing of the movie is very well done. Having been saddened by the poor job on Matrix : Reloaded, this movie (aside from a 5 second scene) has excellent pacing. DO NOT expect to get a chance to get up and goto the bathroom.I've read that some film critics claim that this Terminator doesn't have a story, nor a heart (compared to either of the earlier movies) is rather wrong. The theme of the movie is different from T-1 and T-2.Unlike T-1 and T-2, which have messages of hope during horrible circumstances, T-3 heart lies in inevitability, fate and destiny. John's portrayl of hopelessness is excellent.*Possible Spoilers*The movie does take about 15 minutes to start up, but after that, is excellent. The direction of how the machines take over is brilliant. I was stunned at the portrayl of the actual rise of the machines. Even though there is a lack of future war scenes, the movie makes up in the beginning of the war. I doubt that any director could do a better job.The only complaints I could have in the movie is the 5 second scene where Arnold puts on his glasses for the first time, which was humorous, but not needed. As well as the fact the movie didn't quite have the B-rated sheen that the first 2 had.I was suprised at 2 things which pleased me, the suspence and violence. Mostow did a better job with these 2 things than either Terminator.*End possible Spoilers*Having said all that, I'd look at it this way, on a scale of 1-10T-1 = 9.75 T-2 = 9.30 T-3 = 8.75-9.00Go see this movie, and if you've seen it, see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen all three of the Terminator films as an adult, I've been progressively disappointed as the movies have come along. The first was by far the best, with real characters, a great story idea, and a solid script. The second, Judgment Day, presented a great chase sequence, but progressed poorly thereafter with weak acting and a script that steadily worsened. While the special effects were amazing at the time, the film failed where it counts most: the appearance of sympathetic characters. This last installment, which hopefully will indeed be the last, is easily the weakest in the series with very poor acting, and a script that relies mostly on special effects and chase scenes.

		<fullReview>This was one heck of a movie. The Effects are good. The Acting is Superb Especially by Kristina Lokken and Arnold. Nick Stahl was also very good as John Connor. Everything about this movie is excellent. It was well worth a ten year wait. Although I don't think it is better than Terminator 2 Judgement Day. I think it is a tie between them. I was Shocked to see that Judgement Day still happened. I guess Skynet did win.I wonder if they will make a Terminator 4. Overall excellent movie ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Continuation of the Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humor mixed with action adventure. I loved it! I only wish John Conner was tougher, as he would have been having gone through the last movie and having been raised by Sarah C. Look for the scene with the psychiatrist - he is also in the second movie but the humor will be lost on you if you don't notice that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good action Sci-Fi. Nothing new for everything here has been done by parts 1 and 2. The Directing was not as good as parts one and 2. The story here was only fair and did not connect well with parts 1 and 2. The CGI technology here was better but not as creative as Terminator 2. This movie was obviously done only to make more money for it really lacked CREATIVITY and lacked ORIGINALITY. The Actor who plays John Connor does not look like the younger John Connor of part 2 at all. Very sloppy things like this were prevalent in this movie. Only for Sci-Fi action fans and big fans of the lead actors......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third movie does it's best to make two previous films pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Plot Points In This Review****I went into Terminator 3 with high hopes and high expectations. What I left with, was the same feeling I had after viewing Alien 3 for the first time. It had somehow accomplished nothing more than tarnishing the two films that had come before it. Through two Terminator films, we were led to believe that things that happen in the future could be changed, that certain things didn't have to be inevitable. With Terminator 3, we find out that was all nonsense, that there was no reason for the existence of the first two movies at all, because what's going to happen is going to happen and you can't do a darn thing about it. (just delay it for a while till we can get the next movie made). So what we end up with is three movies from the George Lucas School of prequels, though we didn't know it till now. Thanks, but no thanks for cluing us in.There are plenty of exciting action and chase sequences in the film, and they do grab your attention while they are on the screen. Still, they are nothing more or less than we've seen in any other Summer Blockbuster, so I can't recommend seeing this movie on that alone. Schwarzenegger does his usual fine one note job as The Terminator, but Nick Stahl's John Connor is so wimpy, we long for Edward Furlong to pop up and give him a swift kick in the pants. Clare Danes as Kate Brewster, Connor's future wife, is by far more interesting, and you begin to wonder how John Connor and not her ever became the one to lead the rise against the machines. It almost makes you glad that in the future a Terminator does take out John Connor. I for one would feel a lot better about it if Kate were leading my revolution. Kristana Lokken, despite not having much to do except morph, is menacing enough, but no more or no less than Robert Patrick was in the previous film. She just has the advantage of having a few more tricks up her sleeve.Will there ever be a Terminator 4? Could happen I suppose, if this one makes the major dollars as the previous films did. Trouble is, we now know the ending, and as in the Star Wars prequels, when you know what is going to happen, getting there just isn't that much fun anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard they were making another terminator movie, I didn't know what to expect. After seeing this movie though, I was really impressed. I honestly believe this movie is very good. Yes some of the jokes were really lame, like the talk to the hand thing, but many other complaints people have with the movie are unjustified. People have been complaining that Nick Stahl acted "lost" in the movie. Yet that was an element of his character. Even Arnold who's now around 60 was great. Claire Danes who doesn't do many action movies was wonderful in the movie. Not to mention Loken, who is amazing, acted her part pretty well. I'm not arguing that this movie is the best terminator. Yes we all know that Cameron is a great director, but Mostow is one too. The action and story are amazing. People have been complaining about how the movie doesn't require enough thought, but seriously the third time around I think everyone understands the concept by now. There wasn't much need to explain the war. Terminator 2 did that great. This movie is an excellent movie that I believe will make an excellent addition to the terminator series. My only concern is that in order to milk the franchise, future movies will begin to suck. Let's just hope I'm wrong. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I have just seen T3 rise of the machines and we were absolutely blown away by this 3rd installment of the Terminator Saga.At first I had wondered whether the absence of James Cameron as the director would be felt but I can honestly say now, that the T3 story and character development was superbly well done by Jonathan Mostow who has earned my respect as the director of T3.The progression of the events in the film is particularly gripping and intense especially when one understands everything that has led up to the events that take place in T3. All the pieces seem to come together at a whirlwind pace and many questions are answered from the first 2 movies.The action sequences are first-rate, outstanding and compelling. The dynamic interplay and chemistry displayed by the four main characters T101, the TX, John and Kate is fascinating to watch.I highly recommend this film, which is not only non-stop action but also full of emotional depth and eye opening perspectives which characterizes great science fiction stories. I am extremely demanding of science fictions stories having been a hard core Sci-Fi fan all my life and this film passes the test with flying colors.This trilogy will take its rightful place alongside my other favorite Sci-Fi sagas such as the Alien series.</fullReview>

Probably the best of the 5 summer movies I have seen so far.However, If you guys own the Ultimate Edition DVD of T-2, watching the Special Edition cut with the extra scenes featuring the Sarah Connor character as an old woman will not make this 3rd part make sense.Overall, fantastic sequel....A-....Looking forward to the conclusion.</fullReview>

Although this movie was a bit more comical then the previous movies and there is a noticeable difference between this movie and the others because of the absence of James Cameron, it still holds that true Terminator feeling. My only problem with this movie would be the length, barely and hour and a half, which is an half an hour shorter than the spectacular T2.

		<fullReview>...but not worthy as a successor to T2.Great action sequences, big explosions, great chases, and even a little self depricating humor. i liked that. there was only one scene that i felt was overly contrived. overall, it held my attention and kept the adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Arnold looked great.but the plot was average and somehow just wasn't as intelligent as T2. i know I'm not supposed to expect intelligence from an action flick, but i did. The acting was wooden and characters were one sided. I had trouble understanding everyone's motivation. (except for the terminator himself who by definition is one sided, wooden, and motivated). There were also some unexplained idiosyncracies that seemed like the director was going to do something more but then changed his mind. but then at the other extreme, there were some things that were very obvious, but yet were still drilled into us again and again.overall, a good action flick. but I was expecting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 appeals to long time fans and newcomers as well, this was a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now im not going to give any of the movie away, because it will not be nearly as good if i do. T3 definitly takes a step up from T2 and T1 in the special effects department. Some of the special effects were absolutely breathtaking. The TX (Lokken)was brilliant as she acted so much like a machine i almost thought that she was! she has very few lines so for most of the movie, she uses facial expressions. She is also very...evil. within the first 20 minutes of the movie she kills quite a few people. Arnold comes back strong as the somewhat primitive Terminator Model-101. Again, like T2 he is greatly at the disadvantage. I think Arnold played the terminator better in T3 then he did in any of the other ones. He seemed a lot more like a machine.As for Nick Stahl playing John Connor, when i first heard that he was replacing Edward Furlong i was really angry. Furlong was the original John Connor, not to mention hes a great actor. He would have been perfect to play Connor again. But i was pleasantly suprised, Nick Stahl played the part great, and you got the feel that he was very nervous, and unstable about judgement day and his destiny from the first moment you saw him. Kathryn Brewster(Claire Danes)is Connors supporting character and Danes does a much better job then i thought she was going to do. All in All, the acting was very well done.The plot had some holes in it but not too bad. I think that they could have cleared a few things up. However, the ending stole the entire movie. I was completely stunned at the end, and it was very unpredictable....i had NO clue it was even coming.All in All, definitly worth the $9.00, maybe another $9.00 if i want to go again.....i urge everyone to go see this movie, it was great8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a worthy sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is more of an attempt to simply do a sequel for money. The plot line is fairly convoluted and seems more like the second part in a trilogy.Arnold is simply Arnold. He is okay, the action is as expected, lines seems more forced and the writing is not as witty as T2. Nick Stahl seems more like a TV actor and doesn't have the anger that Eddie Furlong portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a decent job as his future spouse. Kristanna Loken as T-X is a little confusing as a character and a Terminator. Is she an improvement? She has more mechanical breakdowns than the T-1000 series. She is a babe. She tries to be icy like Robert Patrick did in T2, but to me she needs more training.My major beef about the movie is some obvious script flaws. Claire's father is in charge of an secret Air Force research lab and she along with John Conner and Arnold manage to simply waltz into this facility without even a glitch, loaded with weapons and explosives. Good security, especially in the times we live in now.The other downer is the end. How can the future be written in stone. I find this extremely unbelievable that not one thing all these people do, doesn't appear to change one thing in the future time line.I wish James Cameron was involved with this project. He is a much better writer/director for this type of genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is that this movie kicked ass! Probably the best of the 5 summer movies I have seen so far.However, If you guys own the Ultimate Edition DVD of T-2, watching the Special Edition cut with the extra scenes featuring the Sarah Connor character as an old woman will not make this 3rd part make sense.Overall, fantastic sequel....A-....Looking forward to the conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when treated as a stand alone, T3 is a highly entertaining film.Ah-nold is still doing his thing in a major way. Here's hoping that the storywriters keep the twists and surprising with the indomitable Terminator. Kristanna Loken is a knockout. Her coldness and mercilessness is memorable. Nick Stahl and Clare Danes are engrossing actors. Stahl reminds me of Michael Biehn and Danes of a young Linda Hamilton. All in all, the acting is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great follow up to the Terminator series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie ever since I first saw T2 many years ago. Now that I have seen it, I can positively say that this was a really good movie and would even enjoyable to the audience that hasn't been longing for this movie as I have. Although this movie was a bit more comical then the previous movies and there is a noticeable difference between this movie and the others because of the absence of James Cameron, it still holds that true Terminator feeling. My only problem with this movie would be the length, barely and hour and a half, which is an half an hour shorter than the spectacular T2. I do suggest this to any terminator or non-terminator fan, you don't need to know every thing about the story to keep you into like some new movies out right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but not worthy as a successor to T2.Great action sequences, big explosions, great chases, and even a little self depricating humor. i liked that. there was only one scene that i felt was overly contrived. overall, it held my attention and kept the adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Arnold looked great.but the plot was average and somehow just wasn't as intelligent as T2. i know I'm not supposed to expect intelligence from an action flick, but i did. The acting was wooden and characters were one sided. I had trouble understanding everyone's motivation. (except for the terminator himself who by definition is one sided, wooden, and motivated). There were also some unexplained idiosyncracies that seemed like the director was going to do something more but then changed his mind. but then at the other extreme, there were some things that were very obvious, but yet were still drilled into us again and again.overall, a good action flick. but I was expecting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 appeals to long time fans and newcomers as well, this was a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now im not going to give any of the movie away, because it will not be nearly as good if i do. T3 definitly takes a step up from T2 and T1 in the special effects department. Some of the special effects were absolutely breathtaking. The TX (Lokken)was brilliant as she acted so much like a machine i almost thought that she was! she has very few lines so for most of the movie, she uses facial expressions. She is also very...evil. within the first 20 minutes of the movie she kills quite a few people. Arnold comes back strong as the somewhat primitive Terminator Model-101. Again, like T2 he is greatly at the disadvantage. I think Arnold played the terminator better in T3 then he did in any of the other ones. He seemed a lot more like a machine.As for Nick Stahl playing John Connor, when i first heard that he was replacing Edward Furlong i was really angry. Furlong was the original John Connor, not to mention hes a great actor. He would have been perfect to play Connor again. But i was pleasantly suprised, Nick Stahl played the part great, and you got the feel that he was very nervous, and unstable about judgement day and his destiny from the first moment you saw him. Kathryn Brewster(Claire Danes)is Connors supporting character and Danes does a much better job then i thought she was going to do. All in All, the acting was very well done.The plot had some holes in it but not too bad. I think that they could have cleared a few things up. However, the ending stole the entire movie. I was completely stunned at the end, and it was very unpredictable....i had NO clue it was even coming.All in All, definitly worth the $9.00, maybe another $9.00 if i want to go again.....i urge everyone to go see this movie, it was great8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a worthy sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is more of an attempt to simply do a sequel for money. The plot line is fairly convoluted and seems more like the second part in a trilogy.Arnold is simply Arnold. He is okay, the action is as expected, lines seems more forced and the writing is not as witty as T2. Nick Stahl seems more like a TV actor and doesn't have the anger that Eddie Furlong portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a decent job as his future spouse. Kristanna Loken as T-X is a little confusing as a character and a Terminator. Is she an improvement? She has more mechanical breakdowns than the T-1000 series. She is a babe. She tries to be icy like Robert Patrick did in T2, but to me she needs more training.My major beef about the movie is some obvious script flaws. Claire's father is in charge of an secret Air Force research lab and she along with John Conner and Arnold manage to simply waltz into this facility without even a glitch, loaded with weapons and explosives. Good security, especially in the times we live in now.The other downer is the end. How can the future be written in stone. I find this extremely unbelievable that not one thing all these people do, doesn't appear to change one thing in the future time line.I wish James Cameron was involved with this project. He is a much better writer/director for this type of genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard they were making another terminator movie, I didn't know what to expect. After seeing this movie though, I was really impressed. I honestly believe this movie is very good. Yes some of the jokes were really lame, like the talk to the hand thing, but many other complaints people have with the movie are unjustified. People have been complaining that Nick Stahl acted "lost" in the movie. Yet that was an element of his character. Even Arnold who's now around 60 was great. Claire Danes who doesn't do many action movies was wonderful in the movie. Not to mention Loken, who is amazing, acted her part pretty well. I'm not arguing that this movie is the best terminator. Yes we all know that Cameron is a great director, but Mostow is one too. The action and story are amazing. People have been complaining about how the movie doesn't require enough thought, but seriously the third time around I think everyone understands the concept by now. There wasn't much need to explain the war. Terminator 2 did that great. This movie is an excellent movie that I believe will make an excellent addition to the terminator series. My only concern is that in order to milk the franchise, future movies will begin to suck. Let's just hope I'm wrong. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I have just seen T3 rise of the machines and we were absolutely blown away by this 3rd installment of the Terminator Saga.At first I had wondered whether the absence of James Cameron as the director would be felt but I can honestly say now, that the T3 story and character development was superbly well done by Jonathan Mostow who has earned my respect as the director of T3.The progression of the events in the film is particularly gripping and intense especially when one understands everything that has led up to the events that take place in T3. All the pieces seem to come together at a whirlwind pace and many questions are answered from the first 2 movies.The action sequences are first-rate, outstanding and compelling. The dynamic interplay and chemistry displayed by the four main characters T101, the TX, John and Kate is fascinating to watch.I highly recommend this film, which is not only non-stop action but also full of emotional depth and eye opening perspectives which characterizes great science fiction stories. I am extremely demanding of science fictions stories having been a hard core Sci-Fi fan all my life and this film passes the test with flying colors.This trilogy will take its rightful place alongside my other favorite Sci-Fi sagas such as the Alien series.</fullReview>

There wasn't much need to explain the war. Terminator 2 did that great. This movie is an excellent movie that I believe will make an excellent addition to the terminator series. My only concern is that in order to milk the franchise, future movies will begin to suck. Let's just hope I'm wrong. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I have just seen T3 rise of the machines and we were absolutely blown away by this 3rd installment of the Terminator Saga.At first I had wondered whether the absence of James Cameron as the director would be felt but I can honestly say now, that the T3 story and character development was superbly well done by Jonathan Mostow who has earned my respect as the director of T3.The progression of the events in the film is particularly gripping and intense especially when one understands everything that has led up to the events that take place in T3. All the pieces seem to come together at a whirlwind pace and many questions are answered from the first 2 movies.The action sequences are first-rate, outstanding and compelling. The dynamic interplay and chemistry displayed by the four main characters T101, the TX, John and Kate is fascinating to watch.I highly recommend this film, which is not only non-stop action but also full of emotional depth and eye opening perspectives which characterizes great science fiction stories. I am extremely demanding of science fictions stories having been a hard core Sci-Fi fan all my life and this film passes the test with flying colors.This trilogy will take its rightful place alongside my other favorite Sci-Fi sagas such as the Alien series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is that this movie kicked ass! Probably the best of the 5 summer movies I have seen so far.However, If you guys own the Ultimate Edition DVD of T-2, watching the Special Edition cut with the extra scenes featuring the Sarah Connor character as an old woman will not make this 3rd part make sense.Overall, fantastic sequel....A-....Looking forward to the conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when treated as a stand alone, T3 is a highly entertaining film.Ah-nold is still doing his thing in a major way. Here's hoping that the storywriters keep the twists and surprising with the indomitable Terminator. Kristanna Loken is a knockout. Her coldness and mercilessness is memorable. Nick Stahl and Clare Danes are engrossing actors. Stahl reminds me of Michael Biehn and Danes of a young Linda Hamilton. All in all, the acting is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great follow up to the Terminator series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie ever since I first saw T2 many years ago. Now that I have seen it, I can positively say that this was a really good movie and would even enjoyable to the audience that hasn't been longing for this movie as I have. Although this movie was a bit more comical then the previous movies and there is a noticeable difference between this movie and the others because of the absence of James Cameron, it still holds that true Terminator feeling. My only problem with this movie would be the length, barely and hour and a half, which is an half an hour shorter than the spectacular T2. I do suggest this to any terminator or non-terminator fan, you don't need to know every thing about the story to keep you into like some new movies out right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but not worthy as a successor to T2.Great action sequences, big explosions, great chases, and even a little self depricating humor. i liked that. there was only one scene that i felt was overly contrived. overall, it held my attention and kept the adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Arnold looked great.but the plot was average and somehow just wasn't as intelligent as T2. i know I'm not supposed to expect intelligence from an action flick, but i did. The acting was wooden and characters were one sided. I had trouble understanding everyone's motivation. (except for the terminator himself who by definition is one sided, wooden, and motivated). There were also some unexplained idiosyncracies that seemed like the director was going to do something more but then changed his mind. but then at the other extreme, there were some things that were very obvious, but yet were still drilled into us again and again.overall, a good action flick. but I was expecting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 appeals to long time fans and newcomers as well, this was a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now im not going to give any of the movie away, because it will not be nearly as good if i do. T3 definitly takes a step up from T2 and T1 in the special effects department. Some of the special effects were absolutely breathtaking. The TX (Lokken)was brilliant as she acted so much like a machine i almost thought that she was! she has very few lines so for most of the movie, she uses facial expressions. She is also very...evil. within the first 20 minutes of the movie she kills quite a few people. Arnold comes back strong as the somewhat primitive Terminator Model-101. Again, like T2 he is greatly at the disadvantage. I think Arnold played the terminator better in T3 then he did in any of the other ones. He seemed a lot more like a machine.As for Nick Stahl playing John Connor, when i first heard that he was replacing Edward Furlong i was really angry. Furlong was the original John Connor, not to mention hes a great actor. He would have been perfect to play Connor again. But i was pleasantly suprised, Nick Stahl played the part great, and you got the feel that he was very nervous, and unstable about judgement day and his destiny from the first moment you saw him. Kathryn Brewster(Claire Danes)is Connors supporting character and Danes does a much better job then i thought she was going to do. All in All, the acting was very well done.The plot had some holes in it but not too bad. I think that they could have cleared a few things up. However, the ending stole the entire movie. I was completely stunned at the end, and it was very unpredictable....i had NO clue it was even coming.All in All, definitly worth the $9.00, maybe another $9.00 if i want to go again.....i urge everyone to go see this movie, it was great8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a worthy sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is more of an attempt to simply do a sequel for money. The plot line is fairly convoluted and seems more like the second part in a trilogy.Arnold is simply Arnold. He is okay, the action is as expected, lines seems more forced and the writing is not as witty as T2. Nick Stahl seems more like a TV actor and doesn't have the anger that Eddie Furlong portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a decent job as his future spouse. Kristanna Loken as T-X is a little confusing as a character and a Terminator. Is she an improvement? She has more mechanical breakdowns than the T-1000 series. She is a babe. She tries to be icy like Robert Patrick did in T2, but to me she needs more training.My major beef about the movie is some obvious script flaws. Claire's father is in charge of an secret Air Force research lab and she along with John Conner and Arnold manage to simply waltz into this facility without even a glitch, loaded with weapons and explosives. Good security, especially in the times we live in now.The other downer is the end. How can the future be written in stone. I find this extremely unbelievable that not one thing all these people do, doesn't appear to change one thing in the future time line.I wish James Cameron was involved with this project. He is a much better writer/director for this type of genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard they were making another terminator movie, I didn't know what to expect. After seeing this movie though, I was really impressed. I honestly believe this movie is very good. Yes some of the jokes were really lame, like the talk to the hand thing, but many other complaints people have with the movie are unjustified. People have been complaining that Nick Stahl acted "lost" in the movie. Yet that was an element of his character. Even Arnold who's now around 60 was great. Claire Danes who doesn't do many action movies was wonderful in the movie. Not to mention Loken, who is amazing, acted her part pretty well. I'm not arguing that this movie is the best terminator. Yes we all know that Cameron is a great director, but Mostow is one too. The action and story are amazing. People have been complaining about how the movie doesn't require enough thought, but seriously the third time around I think everyone understands the concept by now.

		<shortDescription>WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard they were making another terminator movie, I didn't know what to expect. After seeing this movie though, I was really impressed. I honestly believe this movie is very good. Yes some of the jokes were really lame, like the talk to the hand thing, but many other complaints people have with the movie are unjustified. People have been complaining that Nick Stahl acted "lost" in the movie. Yet that was an element of his character. Even Arnold who's now around 60 was great. Claire Danes who doesn't do many action movies was wonderful in the movie. Not to mention Loken, who is amazing, acted her part pretty well. I'm not arguing that this movie is the best terminator. Yes we all know that Cameron is a great director, but Mostow is one too. The action and story are amazing. People have been complaining about how the movie doesn't require enough thought, but seriously the third time around I think everyone understands the concept by now. There wasn't much need to explain the war. Terminator 2 did that great. This movie is an excellent movie that I believe will make an excellent addition to the terminator series. My only concern is that in order to milk the franchise, future movies will begin to suck. Let's just hope I'm wrong. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I have just seen T3 rise of the machines and we were absolutely blown away by this 3rd installment of the Terminator Saga.At first I had wondered whether the absence of James Cameron as the director would be felt but I can honestly say now, that the T3 story and character development was superbly well done by Jonathan Mostow who has earned my respect as the director of T3.The progression of the events in the film is particularly gripping and intense especially when one understands everything that has led up to the events that take place in T3. All the pieces seem to come together at a whirlwind pace and many questions are answered from the first 2 movies.The action sequences are first-rate, outstanding and compelling. The dynamic interplay and chemistry displayed by the four main characters T101, the TX, John and Kate is fascinating to watch.I highly recommend this film, which is not only non-stop action but also full of emotional depth and eye opening perspectives which characterizes great science fiction stories. I am extremely demanding of science fictions stories having been a hard core Sci-Fi fan all my life and this film passes the test with flying colors.This trilogy will take its rightful place alongside my other favorite Sci-Fi sagas such as the Alien series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie ever since I first saw T2 many years ago. Now that I have seen it, I can positively say that this was a really good movie and would even enjoyable to the audience that hasn't been longing for this movie as I have. Although this movie was a bit more comical then the previous movies and there is a noticeable difference between this movie and the others because of the absence of James Cameron, it still holds that true Terminator feeling. My only problem with this movie would be the length, barely and hour and a half, which is an half an hour shorter than the spectacular T2. I do suggest this to any terminator or non-terminator fan, you don't need to know every thing about the story to keep you into like some new movies out right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but not worthy as a successor to T2.Great action sequences, big explosions, great chases, and even a little self depricating humor. i liked that. there was only one scene that i felt was overly contrived. overall, it held my attention and kept the adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Arnold looked great.but the plot was average and somehow just wasn't as intelligent as T2. i know I'm not supposed to expect intelligence from an action flick, but i did. The acting was wooden and characters were one sided. I had trouble understanding everyone's motivation. (except for the terminator himself who by definition is one sided, wooden, and motivated). There were also some unexplained idiosyncracies that seemed like the director was going to do something more but then changed his mind. but then at the other extreme, there were some things that were very obvious, but yet were still drilled into us again and again.overall, a good action flick. but I was expecting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 appeals to long time fans and newcomers as well, this was a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now im not going to give any of the movie away, because it will not be nearly as good if i do. T3 definitly takes a step up from T2 and T1 in the special effects department. Some of the special effects were absolutely breathtaking. The TX (Lokken)was brilliant as she acted so much like a machine i almost thought that she was! she has very few lines so for most of the movie, she uses facial expressions. She is also very...evil. within the first 20 minutes of the movie she kills quite a few people. Arnold comes back strong as the somewhat primitive Terminator Model-101. Again, like T2 he is greatly at the disadvantage. I think Arnold played the terminator better in T3 then he did in any of the other ones. He seemed a lot more like a machine.As for Nick Stahl playing John Connor, when i first heard that he was replacing Edward Furlong i was really angry. Furlong was the original John Connor, not to mention hes a great actor. He would have been perfect to play Connor again. But i was pleasantly suprised, Nick Stahl played the part great, and you got the feel that he was very nervous, and unstable about judgement day and his destiny from the first moment you saw him. Kathryn Brewster(Claire Danes)is Connors supporting character and Danes does a much better job then i thought she was going to do. All in All, the acting was very well done.The plot had some holes in it but not too bad. I think that they could have cleared a few things up. However, the ending stole the entire movie. I was completely stunned at the end, and it was very unpredictable....i had NO clue it was even coming.All in All, definitly worth the $9.00, maybe another $9.00 if i want to go again.....i urge everyone to go see this movie, it was great8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a worthy sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is more of an attempt to simply do a sequel for money. The plot line is fairly convoluted and seems more like the second part in a trilogy.Arnold is simply Arnold. He is okay, the action is as expected, lines seems more forced and the writing is not as witty as T2. Nick Stahl seems more like a TV actor and doesn't have the anger that Eddie Furlong portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a decent job as his future spouse. Kristanna Loken as T-X is a little confusing as a character and a Terminator. Is she an improvement? She has more mechanical breakdowns than the T-1000 series. She is a babe. She tries to be icy like Robert Patrick did in T2, but to me she needs more training.My major beef about the movie is some obvious script flaws. Claire's father is in charge of an secret Air Force research lab and she along with John Conner and Arnold manage to simply waltz into this facility without even a glitch, loaded with weapons and explosives. Good security, especially in the times we live in now.The other downer is the end. How can the future be written in stone. I find this extremely unbelievable that not one thing all these people do, doesn't appear to change one thing in the future time line.I wish James Cameron was involved with this project. He is a much better writer/director for this type of genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie if anything left me dying for more Terminator!! Okay, no, it's not art-house, it's not a brainy film, but is it entertaining! Many critics call it a B-Movie. Well, so what. It's fast, fun, and escapist to a hilt. Most critics feel a need to view movies as "art" and critique it on that point. For me, movies are escapism and if they make me forget about the outside world for a couple of hours, they've done their job. Terminator 3 does it wonderfully! The chase scene blows the much-lauded scene from Matrix Reloaded out of the water. Just awesome.Arnold is back, baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just going to make this short for now because I am very tired. I just came back from seeing the "sneak preview" and I have to say that this movie should have never been greenlit. Most of Arnold's dialogue were horrible but that wasn't the biggest issue of the movie. The main disappointment is the lack of a strong story. With a better director this movie could have been significantly better. T2 had a great story and ended perfectly. The story ended so well that it closed the story preventing the making of a sequel which obviously didn't happen. The ending of the movie doesn't necessarily leave it open for a sequel but there is a chance that there could be. And if there is a sequel I hope I would have the chance to direct it, which I highly doubt. But it is nice to dream. I already have an idea on a possible sequel that would have a strong story and would be able to close the saga. But anyway I do recommend this movie to fans of the previous films so your knowledge may expand on the Terminator universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie hoping to be surprised if not downright delighted at what I was seeing. I had hoped that it wouldn't be just another Hollywood big budget sequel that falls short of anything above average. I was, however, very disappointed with what I saw. It was just another Hollywood sequel that had little to add to the first two movies.I was not, however, totally put off by the film. There were some excellent sequences that deserve the proper recognition. The crane chase was creative and entertaining. A few other ideas that I won't mention were good, along with the introduction to skynet, but these were not enough. I didn't feel the same intensity that T2 brought me, or the sense of originality that T1 gave to me.The movie runs short, less than two hours. The dialogue seemed a little cheap. But worst of all, the story was second rate. For as much money as they spent, they could make sure everything is excellent, not just the special effects. If you want nonstop action, by all means see this movie. If you want a thought provoking epic, look elsewhere. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone expecting T3: Rise of the Machines to be the next landmark film in the science fiction genre will be dissapointed. But anyone looking for a quality action movie will not. That's basically what this movie is: a quality movie that doesn't let it's viewers down. We all know that T2 is one of the best action movies of all time and that pedigree makes this movie tough to live up to expectations. But T3 comes through in some ways and doesn't in others. The action is first rate ( I liked the fact there is very little cgi and a lot more real things being blown up), the actors turn in good performances (Arnold pretty much looks as he did in T2), and it makes you want to see T4 (if they make it). The only problems i have with the film are very nitpicky. There is somewhat of a lack of cinematography (it made me miss James Cameron's blue tinted T2), and the Terminatrix is so unbelievably beautiful that it was tough for me to be scared of her. All in all, a pretty satisfying movie with good action, good performances, and some unexpected laughs thrown in. **1/2 stars out of 4</fullReview>

You can obviously tell there will be a forth movie I just hope it will be better than this one hopefully a little more complex not just cheesy wannabe catch phrases and a pair of sun glasses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie hoping to be surprised if not downright delighted at what I was seeing. I had hoped that it wouldn't be just another Hollywood big budget sequel that falls short of anything above average. I was, however, very disappointed with what I saw. It was just another Hollywood sequel that had little to add to the first two movies.I was not, however, totally put off by the film. There were some excellent sequences that deserve the proper recognition. The crane chase was creative and entertaining. A few other ideas that I won't mention were good, along with the introduction to skynet, but these were not enough. I didn't feel the same intensity that T2 brought me, or the sense of originality that T1 gave to me.The movie runs short, less than two hours. The dialogue seemed a little cheap. But worst of all, the story was second rate. For as much money as they spent, they could make sure everything is excellent, not just the special effects. If you want nonstop action, by all means see this movie. If you want a thought provoking epic, look elsewhere. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hold T2 in a special place in my heart, as cheesy as that is. I love that movie, and had reservations about this third Terminator movie. Let me assure you though, that this movie is a great time and truly worthy of the Terminator name. The Terminator franchise may be Jimmy Cameron's baby, and T2 is still an amazing film, but this movie takes the series in a great direction, and I look forward to the movie that follows in the footsteps of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone expecting T3: Rise of the Machines to be the next landmark film in the science fiction genre will be dissapointed. But anyone looking for a quality action movie will not. That's basically what this movie is: a quality movie that doesn't let it's viewers down. We all know that T2 is one of the best action movies of all time and that pedigree makes this movie tough to live up to expectations. But T3 comes through in some ways and doesn't in others. The action is first rate ( I liked the fact there is very little cgi and a lot more real things being blown up), the actors turn in good performances (Arnold pretty much looks as he did in T2), and it makes you want to see T4 (if they make it). The only problems i have with the film are very nitpicky. There is somewhat of a lack of cinematography (it made me miss James Cameron's blue tinted T2), and the Terminatrix is so unbelievably beautiful that it was tough for me to be scared of her. All in all, a pretty satisfying movie with good action, good performances, and some unexpected laughs thrown in. **1/2 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked Terminator 3. As a "Terminator" fan, though, it would have been better if James Cameron was still on the scene, and how about killing off Sarah Conner? Still though, a VERY good movie compared to some other movies I know, and the T-X character adds most of the action on this film, which makes it a great film! Highly recommend it. 9.4/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good (not great) movie to just sit and watch. The action was pretty good but I did expect more. I left the movie thinking it was only intermission. The final duel should have been longer and the slapping over the head hinting to another movie takes away form the overall ending. Is T4 already in production?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong I am a Terminator fan but you got to know when things aren't so good, and this movie wasn't all it was hyped up to be. It had action scenes and what not but no real base line to it story wise. You already know what Terminator is about but there could have been more added to the story line, they explain things well so it wasn't very hard to catch on at all, but it seems like there is something missing not enough effort on this one. The end just leaves you wanting more but not on a good basis. You can obviously tell there will be a forth movie I just hope it will be better than this one hopefully a little more complex not just cheesy wannabe catch phrases and a pair of sun glasses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie hoping to be surprised if not downright delighted at what I was seeing. I had hoped that it wouldn't be just another Hollywood big budget sequel that falls short of anything above average. I was, however, very disappointed with what I saw. It was just another Hollywood sequel that had little to add to the first two movies.I was not, however, totally put off by the film. There were some excellent sequences that deserve the proper recognition. The crane chase was creative and entertaining. A few other ideas that I won't mention were good, along with the introduction to skynet, but these were not enough. I didn't feel the same intensity that T2 brought me, or the sense of originality that T1 gave to me.The movie runs short, less than two hours. The dialogue seemed a little cheap. But worst of all, the story was second rate. For as much money as they spent, they could make sure everything is excellent, not just the special effects. If you want nonstop action, by all means see this movie. If you want a thought provoking epic, look elsewhere. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hold T2 in a special place in my heart, as cheesy as that is. I love that movie, and had reservations about this third Terminator movie. Let me assure you though, that this movie is a great time and truly worthy of the Terminator name. The Terminator franchise may be Jimmy Cameron's baby, and T2 is still an amazing film, but this movie takes the series in a great direction, and I look forward to the movie that follows in the footsteps of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone expecting T3: Rise of the Machines to be the next landmark film in the science fiction genre will be dissapointed. But anyone looking for a quality action movie will not. That's basically what this movie is: a quality movie that doesn't let it's viewers down. We all know that T2 is one of the best action movies of all time and that pedigree makes this movie tough to live up to expectations. But T3 comes through in some ways and doesn't in others. The action is first rate ( I liked the fact there is very little cgi and a lot more real things being blown up), the actors turn in good performances (Arnold pretty much looks as he did in T2), and it makes you want to see T4 (if they make it). The only problems i have with the film are very nitpicky. There is somewhat of a lack of cinematography (it made me miss James Cameron's blue tinted T2), and the Terminatrix is so unbelievably beautiful that it was tough for me to be scared of her. All in all, a pretty satisfying movie with good action, good performances, and some unexpected laughs thrown in. **1/2 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked Terminator 3. As a "Terminator" fan, though, it would have been better if James Cameron was still on the scene, and how about killing off Sarah Conner? Still though, a VERY good movie compared to some other movies I know, and the T-X character adds most of the action on this film, which makes it a great film!

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong I am a Terminator fan but you got to know when things aren't so good, and this movie wasn't all it was hyped up to be. It had action scenes and what not but no real base line to it story wise. You already know what Terminator is about but there could have been more added to the story line, they explain things well so it wasn't very hard to catch on at all, but it seems like there is something missing not enough effort on this one. The end just leaves you wanting more but not on a good basis. You can obviously tell there will be a forth movie I just hope it will be better than this one hopefully a little more complex not just cheesy wannabe catch phrases and a pair of sun glasses.</fullReview>

I didn't feel the same intensity that T2 brought me, or the sense of originality that T1 gave to me.The movie runs short, less than two hours. The dialogue seemed a little cheap. But worst of all, the story was second rate. For as much money as they spent, they could make sure everything is excellent, not just the special effects. If you want nonstop action, by all means see this movie. If you want a thought provoking epic, look elsewhere. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hold T2 in a special place in my heart, as cheesy as that is. I love that movie, and had reservations about this third Terminator movie. Let me assure you though, that this movie is a great time and truly worthy of the Terminator name. The Terminator franchise may be Jimmy Cameron's baby, and T2 is still an amazing film, but this movie takes the series in a great direction, and I look forward to the movie that follows in the footsteps of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone expecting T3: Rise of the Machines to be the next landmark film in the science fiction genre will be dissapointed. But anyone looking for a quality action movie will not. That's basically what this movie is: a quality movie that doesn't let it's viewers down. We all know that T2 is one of the best action movies of all time and that pedigree makes this movie tough to live up to expectations. But T3 comes through in some ways and doesn't in others. The action is first rate ( I liked the fact there is very little cgi and a lot more real things being blown up), the actors turn in good performances (Arnold pretty much looks as he did in T2), and it makes you want to see T4 (if they make it). The only problems i have with the film are very nitpicky. There is somewhat of a lack of cinematography (it made me miss James Cameron's blue tinted T2), and the Terminatrix is so unbelievably beautiful that it was tough for me to be scared of her. All in all, a pretty satisfying movie with good action, good performances, and some unexpected laughs thrown in. **1/2 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ii have waited for this film for years, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. The first time i watched T3, i came out with mixed feelings because all the scenes that i really wanted to see in the film were missing. I was really looking forward to seeing the CRS build T-1s and T-600/800 endoskeletons. Most of all, i wanted to see Chief Master Sergeant William Candy. When i watched the movie, i saw that many scenes were cut out. So, when i watched T3 for the second time, I LOVED IT. Things just fit together perfectly. T3 is definitely my favorite of the trilogy. IMO, it told the coolest story out of the three. We finally see Skynet's rise to power. Also, the story had heart and it had a soul. T3 was basically John Connor's story. At the beginning of the film, he is a slacker who wants no part of his destiny. At the end of the film, he finally accepts his fate as the leader of the human race. Nick Stahl gave a fantastic performance as John Connor, he made you care for the character and he actually made the character's inner emotional struggle throughout the film believable. Claire Danes was excellent as Kate Brewster. Kate is very much like the Sarah Connor of the first film. She is an innocent woman who is suddenly taken away from her life and put into a world full of terror and death. Kate is very important to the plot of the film and to the terminator story as a whole. Arnold is perfect as The Terminator, what else can i say? Kristanna Loken gave a great performance as the T-X. IMO, she was just as terrifying and menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well. The humor worked fine IMO, it was very similar to T2 in this aspect. The humor comes at the right time. To all the naysayers, this IS NOT a remake or a rehash of T2. It is a worthy continuation of the terminator story full of new and fresh ideas. The ending of the film is just awesome. Its probably the best ending in years. Same goes for the action and special effects. Stan Winston and ILM did an excellent job. Kudos to Jonathan Mostow to staying true to T-1 and T2 and giving us a terrific third installment. Hopefully, he will return for T4, which will be the full future war film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to go see T3 today, I wasn't expecting much. This was forthree reasons:1) Its a modern day sequel based on great classic movies, and most modern sequels suck. 2) It wasn't directed or written by James Cameron. 3) How the hell could the story fit?! IT ENDED IN T2!So, I went in with not expecting much. God I was wrong. While it isn't as good as THE TERMINATOR or its sequel TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, I say it was very entertaining. The action sequences were good, and the story fit well into the existing time line. The acting was also very good. I was kind of disappointed that Edward Furlong didn't come back to play John Connor, and I was really hoping for a cameo of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor and Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese (I know he is dead, but he did make a cameo in T2, just watch the deleted scenes on the T2 Extreme DVD), but we can't have everything now, can we? I was also pleased that there were some very funny inside jokes to us Terminator fans.Also, the T-X was a pretty good ruthless villain, even though she will never compare to Robert Patrick's T-1000 or Arnold's original T-101. The movie also, of course, sets up for a sequel which will be very interesting (I'd tell you why, but then it would ruin the ending).Overall, it was pretty entertaining and better than expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When compared to the first and second Terminator movies, T3 is probably average at best.The special effects were top notch but the movie seemed forced. Whereas the first and second at times grew deep and philosophical (or as much as this storyline would allow), T3 had none of that. It was just action scenes mixed in with ho-hum dialogue to explain what was about to happen next.Terminator 2 technically was a sequel, but it didn't *feel* like a sequel. T2 could have stood on its own.Terminator 3, on the other hand, pretty much assumes that the viewer is familiar with the storyline. Old characters (just one really) are shamelessly plugged in for quick appearances that didn't further the storyline one bit. New characters have been added and their histories faked to appear as if they've always been a part of the Terminator world. The movie watched as if it was the last season of some long running television series overdue for retirement.On the plus side, T3 has some strengths. As mentioned earlier, the special effects were excellent. Also, the writers gave the Terminator some hilarious moments.This is a short movie and the action moves briskly. Watch it if you're a fan of the series or if you're into awesome action scenes, but don't expect it to be very deep. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can do it once, twice, go ahead and do it AGAIN!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie, there wasn't a lot of promoting going on and I'm disappointed with that matter. Everybody's upset because James Cameron didn't put his two cents into the movie. Well, WHO CARES!!! This is what I call a movie. It's been a long time since I've seen a good movie. Especially since this is an anticipated one. I've been longing to see Arnold back with a machine gun in his hand or whatever arsenal he can equip himself with as the lethal and clever terminator. I loved this movie. It beats all the other movies for the summer. Rated R action shows hardcore here. Forget what the critics say about this movie. Terminator 3 lived up to its name. If they didn't like this 3rd one then they can forget about liking the whole series all together.Jonathan Mostow did a great job. He took on a big project that I think all other directors would have been scared to do. If I saw him in person I'd congratulate him on a job well done. I love the terminator series. I forgot he did U-571. In my opinion Cameron missed out. I don't care if he didn't direct. It's time for somebody to try something new.Even though this movie costs 175 million to make, it doesn't matter. The action made up for it. The special effects was the best I've seen in a while. THANKS STAN WINSTON!!! I'm proud of that. I'm a martial arts movie maniac. There wasn't martial arts in it, and that just it, old fashioned beat 'em up style (thrown through walls, slammed, etc.) The humor was great too. Only thing that was off was the father of Claire Danes's character. He didn't seem to emotional when he thought she was killed. Oh well, still great movie. Can't wait for the dvd to come out. Last thing, Kristanna Loken did great as the villian and sexy too. GO SEE IT EVERYBODY!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to Terminator 3 with skepticism, having enjoyed watching T2 over and over as a kid (I'm 22). The thing that really bugged me initially about Terminator 3 before I entered the theater, was that there was no Linda Hamilton and no Edward Furlong.No James Cameron too direct!?How good can it be??Having just seen Terminator 3 a little over an hour ago, I can't remember the last time I was blown away by a movie. Arnold is still as cool as ever, reprising his breakthrough role with more stunts that you can expect a 54 year old body builder to take on. The Terminatrix is great and Kristanna Loken takes the role with artificial intelligence written all over her. Nick Stahl has the John Connor role down to a T. The Kate Brewster character had to sink in for a while, but the chemistry between her and Connor is comparable to that of Kyle and Sarah.However, if you know and love the first two films like I do, you can only get so much out of the third act. It has all the action and explosions that you can expect from a summer action thriller. But there lacks the storytelling that James Cameron was known to carefully mesh into breathtaking action and effects. Without the powerful story telling of James Cameron, this movie is really just about getting away from the bad guy and stopping the inevitable nuclear war. I loved seeing prototypes of the Skynet computers come to life, reconizing them from the first two movies. I was even taken by Kate Brewster's connection to John Connor and events preceding Terminator 2 and the way they hate each other upon knowing they will one day be married. But despite the cleverness, familiarity and even the disturbing nuclear fear that John Mostow brings to the series I struggle to come to the conclusion that Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is just a way to bring back a loved character. I wish it (the story telling NOT the action) had been better. ** out of 4.</fullReview>

IMO, it told the coolest story out of the three. We finally see Skynet's rise to power. Also, the story had heart and it had a soul. T3 was basically John Connor's story. At the beginning of the film, he is a slacker who wants no part of his destiny. At the end of the film, he finally accepts his fate as the leader of the human race. Nick Stahl gave a fantastic performance as John Connor, he made you care for the character and he actually made the character's inner emotional struggle throughout the film believable. Claire Danes was excellent as Kate Brewster. Kate is very much like the Sarah Connor of the first film. She is an innocent woman who is suddenly taken away from her life and put into a world full of terror and death. Kate is very important to the plot of the film and to the terminator story as a whole. Arnold is perfect as The Terminator, what else can i say? Kristanna Loken gave a great performance as the T-X. IMO, she was just as terrifying and menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well. The humor worked fine IMO, it was very similar to T2 in this aspect. The humor comes at the right time. To all the naysayers, this IS NOT a remake or a rehash of T2. It is a worthy continuation of the terminator story full of new and fresh ideas. The ending of the film is just awesome. Its probably the best ending in years. Same goes for the action and special effects. Stan Winston and ILM did an excellent job. Kudos to Jonathan Mostow to staying true to T-1 and T2 and giving us a terrific third installment. Hopefully, he will return for T4, which will be the full future war film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Terminator 3 tonight and I msut say that it was good. I was somewhat dissapointed by it since T2 set such high standards, but it was nonetheless a very solid movie. T2 was made in 1991 with a budget of 100 million. To me this movie still holds its ground to T3, a movie made 12 years later. Cameron's presence was missed on this film, but Mostow did a job well done and can hopefully spawn a sequel of two off this story line. Although not as good as T2 it keeps the franchise alive and the story provides more than enough interest for another movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as sequels go, as good or better than Matrix Reloaded. This movie has some of the viciousness of the first one, definitely an R. T2 seemed to back off the violence a bit, but Kristanna Loken makes Robert Patrick look like a wussy. That chase is definitely as good as the Reloaded freeway chase :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Worthy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe it. After five years of reading through rumours and gossip, it has finally been unleashed. After a year of antcipating this movie and watching the previews over and over again "it is time". Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is here, and holy crap did come in style.This movie blows all of the other summer movies away.Before I go on, I must say this; MINOR SPOILERS (nothing drastic) will be given away.The movie opens with John Connor now in his 20's. He's living off the radar, and moves around a lot. He sort of a has been now. Since they stopped Judgment Day from happening ten years previous, he has nothing to live for really. However, he's still paranoid and never forgets what his mom taught him. But now another, highly advanced terminator (Kristana Loken) has been sent back to, well, terminate him. The T-X, as it's called, goes around and kills all of John's future Lieutenants. The T-X also goes after a girl named Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) who we find out has a very important role in the future war. The Human Resistance was able to send back another Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to protect Connor and Brewster. But which one will reach him first?Now, I'll get to the good stuff in awhile but first I want to mention the casting. The casting of Nick Stahl as Connor was great. I first saw Stahl in the Mel Gibson directed movie The Man With-out A Face. Then Stahl was just a kid, but he did a great job in the role he played. Stahl replaces Edward Furlong in the role of Connor and he does a great job at it. His performance is brilliant and the way he captures the character of a guy who knows that the world could be destroyed at anytime is excellent.The casting of Claire Daines as Kate Brewster was a smart move as well. I can't actually think of any other actress who would fit in this role. As much as I like Natalie Portman, I don't think she would have been believable in this role, and it would have just been her doing her Star Wars bit again. Daines and Stahl have some great chemistry on screen together and that really helps the movie. That's one thing that can always hurt a movie if people are supposed to like each other. Bad chemistry is noticeable, and it distracts from the picture.Now onto the choice role of the T-X, Kristana Loken. While she doesn't play the character as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 character in T2, she does do a good job, at being the, sort of, innocent cute girl. She actually surprised me and did a good job. She's not a scary character, which is a shame, but she's a tough one. I wasn't to keen on the idea of a female terminator, I though it would be handled wrong, but I was wrong. I suppose that's what I get for under-estimating Jonathan Mostow, who did good job with this movie.Sure T3 isn't as good as the first two. I didn't expect it to be, and it doesn't bother me. First of all, it's a different director and writers. The James Cameron Terminator movies are far superior to this one, but this one is still a worthy sequel.Mostow, who directed the great Kurt Russell thriller 'Breakdown' and the tense submarine thriller 'U-571', handles this movie really well. He pays homage to the original Terminator movies as well as adding his own spin on it.This one isn't as 'dark' as the other ones were, but it still works. I have said for awhile now, that this movie will either crush Mostow's career, or give him the respect he deserves. And it looks like I'm right.Mostow has an eye for action, and a well placed eye that is. Most of the action in this movie is way better than most of the other action in any of the previous summer action movies.And another good thing is it never lets up. The action just keeps coming. What a thrill ride. The massive car chase near the beginning was brilliant. I said the Matrix: Reloaded car chase was good, but this one is far better, mainly because it uses REAL cars and real stunts. It doesn't rely on CGI to make explosions and cars crash.The first car chase, or rather truck chase, is fun and thrilling. It involves a crane truck and Arnie chasing the T-X on a police motorcycle. It's too much to talk about it, but it's great. What I also liked about this chase was something very subtle. The chase started a night, but it ended during the day. I loved the fact that Mostow decided to have the sun come up during the chase. I don't know why. Probably because most car chases either happen during the day or night, never in between. It was a nice touch. Lame I know, but I liked it.The rest of the action is skillfully done and it was some neat stuff to see. A fight between the Terminator and the T-X had me worried for a minute that Woman's Rights Activists might sue the studio because of the beating Arnie gives the female T-X. But then she fought back, so I guess it evens the score.Also, I must mention Stan Winston. He worked on the previous two Terminators and even won an Academy Award for make-up and special effects on T2. He returns here, and does a stellar job. I love seeing the battle damage on the Terminator, with the Terminator skeleton popping out and flesh still hanging on. It's really neat make-up and job well done. I think another Academy Award might in sights for Winston.Now there was a lot of humour in this one. I laughed at a lot of it, and it was nice to kind of see Arnie play around and make fun of himself on screen. Like just after he gets his outfit and what he does. It was stupid, but I will admit, I laughed. It was harmless, but it could have done with-out it.Now, there were some things that I didn't like about T3. Yes, I know, hard to believe, eh? I didn't like some of the dialogue. It was weak at times, but all the goodness about this movie makes up for all the bad.I also didn't like the fact the classic Terminator theme was absent through out the whole movie. Now Marco Beltrami did a god job composing the movie. The soundtrack was great, it's just, I missed that Terminator theme. It's such an awsome theme, how could he not use it? Sure it appears in the end credits, but still?The story moves along at break neck pace and keeps rolling and rolling. The movie does slow down from time to time to explain things and further the story as well. I don't want to say anything about the story in general, but what I will say is that it's pretty good.In Roger Ebert's review he said `The ending must remain for you to discover, but I will say it seems perfunctory'. I disagree. I liked the ending. As did Ebert's reviewing buddy Richard Roeper. It does leave questions out there, but it also seems to say that, no matter how much we try, we are always doomed. You can't stop something from happening that's supposed to happen, you can only postpone it, and wait until it arrives to do what your fate has chosen for you to do.The ending was good. I liked it. I don't care what anyone says about it, it was good.So, now my closing comments, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a summer action movie that delivers. It doesn't have a complicated storyline that makes you stop paying attention and makes you just want to leave the theatre so bad (Matrix Reloaded). It doesn't rely heavily on CGI like the Matrix did, and when it has CGI, its damn good. It's not as noticeable or poorly done like the Matrix and Hulk were. It also has non-stop great action.It's a great movie and I know I've said this before, but I recommend seeing this. Go buy a ticket, buy some popcorn sit down and enjoy the lame, but fun, humour, the action and spectacular visuals.I have to say it, but Arnold is back everyone, and he's back in full force. Terminator 3 is here, and now its time for King Conan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just garbage...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Warning...Terminator 3 defies logic on so many levels. First of all, I have the same initial question with T-3 that I did with T-2. Why on earth does the future John Connor (or military personnel) continue to send old, obsolete model cyborgs to save him in the past? Wouldn't it make sense to send the same updated, slicker model that was sent to kill him? And why does the female T-X pump up her clevage to flirt with a cop? Isn't she the Terminator?? Why does she need tricks to get his gun? Just take it like you do everything else! Speaking of the cop's gun, why does she even need a gun? Her arm can shape into a gun, a rocket launcher, and a flame thrower. And why does she need to taste a bloody woman and bloody gauze pad to identify people? Isn't her tongue made from the same synthetic material her finger is? She should taste it as soon as she sticks her finger in it. She also murders a guy in a drive thru burger joint, but the window is on the right hand side. Why? Isn't this America?? And what happened to her mission to destroy John Connor's future lieutenants? She abandons that idea early on and decides to pursue John Connor and his future wife for the duration of the movie.T-3 is a poor movie with a convoluted plot, uneven pacing and boring action. The ending is anti-climatic and the film in general feels small and incomplete. It ends with a door open for a sequel, but I am not looking forward to it. T-3 is simply garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was much room for improvement in the third installment of the series. I enjoyed the action just as I would have expected but the new John Conner, Nick Stahl and Kate Brewster, Claire Danes do not have much screen presence for these roles.The one liners and references to the previous films are very good and are enough to keep it interesting. I noticed that the audience did not catch many of the references and wondered if the humor was only there for the die-hard fans. Overall I would say go to a matinee instead of paying full price.</fullReview>

The pacing is fast, just like the first Terminator film.The acting is top notch and the ending is just awesome. Not only is it thought provoking, but it is also very emotional.Ties in very well with T1 and T2, and it continues the mythology of John Connor in an excellent way. At the beginning of the film, he is a slacker who wants no part of his destiny. At the end of the film, he accepts his fate as the leader of the human resistance against Skynet.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two words sum up this movie for me and they are popcorn flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moviegoing auidences have been waiting twelve years for Arnold Schwarzenegger to come back to the role that made him famous and the question remains; was it worth the wait? For me the answer is yes and no. First I'll focus on the yes part of the movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines delivers it's share of action and special effects which in the summer time is why we go to the movies. Nick Stahl whose is a very talented actor takes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong and does it well. And the T-X played by the sexy Kristanna Loken is meancing and a smooth bad ass bad guy. Fianlnly Jonathan Mostow handles the action sequences very well in the film. The chase sequence in the film is one of the best I've seen from the three movies he's directed . Now let's focus on the no part of Terminator 3 that will upset many moviegoers. Terminator 3 has two main probelms that makes the film pale in comparison to it's precassadors. The first being the lack of storytelling that trio of screenwriters John Brancato,Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian can't seem to capture that Cameron magic which affects the direction of the talented Mostow. The second problem is the familar score by composer Brad Fiedel which is gone from this film. When it comes to the females in the film Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken both kinda gives a paper thin performances. Danes over does the damsel in distress role and Loken is nothing more than eye candy (but damn does she look good). The film won't please all tastes but if you want mindless entertainment then check this one out. Hopefully the inevitable Terminator 4 with Nick Stahl in the lead will be an improvement over this one. It's not that Terminator 3 is a bad film it just wasn't worth a 12 year wait. Mt final verdict on the film is ** 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoliers* I just got back from seeing T3 tonight. At first I was not sure whether I really loved it or I really hated it. I have since decided on the former. I went into the movie with a very hopeful yet skeptical attitude. Ok, the movie. At first I was afraid that my fears were coming true (the stupid sunglasses, talk to the hand - which actually was incredibly funny to me). The T-X made me quite sketical at first because she is so hot that I could not think of her being a mean ass. Then when she connects to the net through her phone I thought "oh d*mn." From then on out she is a bad*ss. The chase through LA is hands down awesome. Much better than the Matrix Reloaded chase (though not as long). The Terminator is very good. If a little more emotive than he should be. Things about the movie that I really loved: Skynet coming online was so cool. There really wasnt much to it, but just knowing that it was happening was so cool. Conner realizing that judgement day cannot be averted was very good. I also liked how the machines came to realize that just as judgement day itself could not be avoided, neither could John Conner, so instead they aim at the less important parts in an attempt to lessen the sum - the future generals that serve under Conner. At first I did not like how the movie ended, with the bombs dropping right at the end. But in retrospect I think it was good that way. However, it also necessitates another sequel. I was sorta hoping for some closure. But I was also itching to see everything blow up. Which also did not really happen. But I guess that really was not all that necessary. There were a few other bad things. First of all, there was just a little too much corny humor. Some would have been good, but not as much as was in there. The sarah conner part was rather lame, in my opinion. I wish they would have explained some more how the main players all happened to find there way together at the kennel. The movie sorta throws out the whole "no fate but what we make" thing. However, I think that is a good thing though. Lastly, I was hoping that Mostow would throw in something about Uncle Bobs left over arm at the end of T2. All that being said, I am very pleased with this movie. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Still, experience T3 on the big screen along with great sound, and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just garbage...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Warning...Terminator 3 defies logic on so many levels. First of all, I have the same initial question with T-3 that I did with T-2. Why on earth does the future John Connor (or military personnel) continue to send old, obsolete model cyborgs to save him in the past? Wouldn't it make sense to send the same updated, slicker model that was sent to kill him? And why does the female T-X pump up her clevage to flirt with a cop? Isn't she the Terminator?? Why does she need tricks to get his gun? Just take it like you do everything else! Speaking of the cop's gun, why does she even need a gun? Her arm can shape into a gun, a rocket launcher, and a flame thrower. And why does she need to taste a bloody woman and bloody gauze pad to identify people? Isn't her tongue made from the same synthetic material her finger is? She should taste it as soon as she sticks her finger in it. She also murders a guy in a drive thru burger joint, but the window is on the right hand side. Why? Isn't this America?? And what happened to her mission to destroy John Connor's future lieutenants? She abandons that idea early on and decides to pursue John Connor and his future wife for the duration of the movie.T-3 is a poor movie with a convoluted plot, uneven pacing and boring action. The ending is anti-climatic and the film in general feels small and incomplete. It ends with a door open for a sequel, but I am not looking forward to it. T-3 is simply garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of good action but disappointing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was much room for improvement in the third installment of the series. I enjoyed the action just as I would have expected but the new John Conner, Nick Stahl and Kate Brewster, Claire Danes do not have much screen presence for these roles.The one liners and references to the previous films are very good and are enough to keep it interesting. I noticed that the audience did not catch many of the references and wondered if the humor was only there for the die-hard fans. Overall I would say go to a matinee instead of paying full price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!!!I loved it. What can i say! This movie is definitely my favorite of the series. Not only does it tell a great story, but it has awesome action scenes. The pacing is fast, just like the first Terminator film.The acting is top notch and the ending is just awesome. Not only is it thought provoking, but it is also very emotional.Ties in very well with T1 and T2, and it continues the mythology of John Connor in an excellent way. At the beginning of the film, he is a slacker who wants no part of his destiny. At the end of the film, he accepts his fate as the leader of the human resistance against Skynet.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two words sum up this movie for me and they are popcorn flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moviegoing auidences have been waiting twelve years for Arnold Schwarzenegger to come back to the role that made him famous and the question remains; was it worth the wait? For me the answer is yes and no. First I'll focus on the yes part of the movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines delivers it's share of action and special effects which in the summer time is why we go to the movies. Nick Stahl whose is a very talented actor takes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong and does it well. And the T-X played by the sexy Kristanna Loken is meancing and a smooth bad ass bad guy. Fianlnly Jonathan Mostow handles the action sequences very well in the film. The chase sequence in the film is one of the best I've seen from the three movies he's directed . Now let's focus on the no part of Terminator 3 that will upset many moviegoers. Terminator 3 has two main probelms that makes the film pale in comparison to it's precassadors. The first being the lack of storytelling that trio of screenwriters John Brancato,Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian can't seem to capture that Cameron magic which affects the direction of the talented Mostow. The second problem is the familar score by composer Brad Fiedel which is gone from this film. When it comes to the females in the film Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken both kinda gives a paper thin performances. Danes over does the damsel in distress role and Loken is nothing more than eye candy (but damn does she look good). The film won't please all tastes but if you want mindless entertainment then check this one out. Hopefully the inevitable Terminator 4 with Nick Stahl in the lead will be an improvement over this one. It's not that Terminator 3 is a bad film it just wasn't worth a 12 year wait. Mt final verdict on the film is ** 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoliers* I just got back from seeing T3 tonight. At first I was not sure whether I really loved it or I really hated it. I have since decided on the former. I went into the movie with a very hopeful yet skeptical attitude. Ok, the movie. At first I was afraid that my fears were coming true (the stupid sunglasses, talk to the hand - which actually was incredibly funny to me). The T-X made me quite sketical at first because she is so hot that I could not think of her being a mean ass. Then when she connects to the net through her phone I thought "oh d*mn." From then on out she is a bad*ss. The chase through LA is hands down awesome. Much better than the Matrix Reloaded chase (though not as long). The Terminator is very good. If a little more emotive than he should be. Things about the movie that I really loved: Skynet coming online was so cool. There really wasnt much to it, but just knowing that it was happening was so cool. Conner realizing that judgement day cannot be averted was very good. I also liked how the machines came to realize that just as judgement day itself could not be avoided, neither could John Conner, so instead they aim at the less important parts in an attempt to lessen the sum - the future generals that serve under Conner. At first I did not like how the movie ended, with the bombs dropping right at the end. But in retrospect I think it was good that way. However, it also necessitates another sequel. I was sorta hoping for some closure. But I was also itching to see everything blow up. Which also did not really happen. But I guess that really was not all that necessary. There were a few other bad things. First of all, there was just a little too much corny humor. Some would have been good, but not as much as was in there. The sarah conner part was rather lame, in my opinion. I wish they would have explained some more how the main players all happened to find there way together at the kennel. The movie sorta throws out the whole "no fate but what we make" thing. However, I think that is a good thing though. Lastly, I was hoping that Mostow would throw in something about Uncle Bobs left over arm at the end of T2. All that being said, I am very pleased with this movie. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Terminator 3 tonight and I msut say that it was good. I was somewhat dissapointed by it since T2 set such high standards, but it was nonetheless a very solid movie. T2 was made in 1991 with a budget of 100 million. To me this movie still holds its ground to T3, a movie made 12 years later. Cameron's presence was missed on this film, but Mostow did a job well done and can hopefully spawn a sequel of two off this story line. Although not as good as T2 it keeps the franchise alive and the story provides more than enough interest for another movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Worthy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe it. After five years of reading through rumours and gossip, it has finally been unleashed. After a year of antcipating this movie and watching the previews over and over again "it is time". Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is here, and holy crap did come in style.This movie blows all of the other summer movies away.Before I go on, I must say this; MINOR SPOILERS (nothing drastic) will be given away.The movie opens with John Connor now in his 20's. He's living off the radar, and moves around a lot. He sort of a has been now. Since they stopped Judgment Day from happening ten years previous, he has nothing to live for really. However, he's still paranoid and never forgets what his mom taught him. But now another, highly advanced terminator (Kristana Loken) has been sent back to, well, terminate him. The T-X, as it's called, goes around and kills all of John's future Lieutenants. The T-X also goes after a girl named Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) who we find out has a very important role in the future war. The Human Resistance was able to send back another Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to protect Connor and Brewster. But which one will reach him first?Now, I'll get to the good stuff in awhile but first I want to mention the casting. The casting of Nick Stahl as Connor was great. I first saw Stahl in the Mel Gibson directed movie The Man With-out A Face. Then Stahl was just a kid, but he did a great job in the role he played. Stahl replaces Edward Furlong in the role of Connor and he does a great job at it. His performance is brilliant and the way he captures the character of a guy who knows that the world could be destroyed at anytime is excellent.The casting of Claire Daines as Kate Brewster was a smart move as well. I can't actually think of any other actress who would fit in this role. As much as I like Natalie Portman, I don't think she would have been believable in this role, and it would have just been her doing her Star Wars bit again. Daines and Stahl have some great chemistry on screen together and that really helps the movie. That's one thing that can always hurt a movie if people are supposed to like each other. Bad chemistry is noticeable, and it distracts from the picture.Now onto the choice role of the T-X, Kristana Loken. While she doesn't play the character as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 character in T2, she does do a good job, at being the, sort of, innocent cute girl. She actually surprised me and did a good job. She's not a scary character, which is a shame, but she's a tough one. I wasn't to keen on the idea of a female terminator, I though it would be handled wrong, but I was wrong. I suppose that's what I get for under-estimating Jonathan Mostow, who did good job with this movie.Sure T3 isn't as good as the first two. I didn't expect it to be, and it doesn't bother me. First of all, it's a different director and writers. The James Cameron Terminator movies are far superior to this one, but this one is still a worthy sequel.Mostow, who directed the great Kurt Russell thriller 'Breakdown' and the tense submarine thriller 'U-571', handles this movie really well. He pays homage to the original Terminator movies as well as adding his own spin on it.This one isn't as 'dark' as the other ones were, but it still works. I have said for awhile now, that this movie will either crush Mostow's career, or give him the respect he deserves. And it looks like I'm right.Mostow has an eye for action, and a well placed eye that is. Most of the action in this movie is way better than most of the other action in any of the previous summer action movies.And another good thing is it never lets up. The action just keeps coming. What a thrill ride. The massive car chase near the beginning was brilliant. I said the Matrix: Reloaded car chase was good, but this one is far better, mainly because it uses REAL cars and real stunts. It doesn't rely on CGI to make explosions and cars crash.The first car chase, or rather truck chase, is fun and thrilling. It involves a crane truck and Arnie chasing the T-X on a police motorcycle. It's too much to talk about it, but it's great. What I also liked about this chase was something very subtle. The chase started a night, but it ended during the day. I loved the fact that Mostow decided to have the sun come up during the chase. I don't know why. Probably because most car chases either happen during the day or night, never in between. It was a nice touch. Lame I know, but I liked it.The rest of the action is skillfully done and it was some neat stuff to see. A fight between the Terminator and the T-X had me worried for a minute that Woman's Rights Activists might sue the studio because of the beating Arnie gives the female T-X. But then she fought back, so I guess it evens the score.Also, I must mention Stan Winston. He worked on the previous two Terminators and even won an Academy Award for make-up and special effects on T2. He returns here, and does a stellar job. I love seeing the battle damage on the Terminator, with the Terminator skeleton popping out and flesh still hanging on. It's really neat make-up and job well done. I think another Academy Award might in sights for Winston.Now there was a lot of humour in this one. I laughed at a lot of it, and it was nice to kind of see Arnie play around and make fun of himself on screen. Like just after he gets his outfit and what he does. It was stupid, but I will admit, I laughed. It was harmless, but it could have done with-out it.Now, there were some things that I didn't like about T3. Yes, I know, hard to believe, eh? I didn't like some of the dialogue. It was weak at times, but all the goodness about this movie makes up for all the bad.I also didn't like the fact the classic Terminator theme was absent through out the whole movie. Now Marco Beltrami did a god job composing the movie. The soundtrack was great, it's just, I missed that Terminator theme. It's such an awsome theme, how could he not use it? Sure it appears in the end credits, but still?The story moves along at break neck pace and keeps rolling and rolling. The movie does slow down from time to time to explain things and further the story as well. I don't want to say anything about the story in general, but what I will say is that it's pretty good.In Roger Ebert's review he said `The ending must remain for you to discover, but I will say it seems perfunctory'. I disagree. I liked the ending. As did Ebert's reviewing buddy Richard Roeper. It does leave questions out there, but it also seems to say that, no matter how much we try, we are always doomed. You can't stop something from happening that's supposed to happen, you can only postpone it, and wait until it arrives to do what your fate has chosen for you to do.The ending was good. I liked it. I don't care what anyone says about it, it was good.So, now my closing comments, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a summer action movie that delivers. It doesn't have a complicated storyline that makes you stop paying attention and makes you just want to leave the theatre so bad (Matrix Reloaded). It doesn't rely heavily on CGI like the Matrix did, and when it has CGI, its damn good. It's not as noticeable or poorly done like the Matrix and Hulk were. It also has non-stop great action.It's a great movie and I know I've said this before, but I recommend seeing this. Go buy a ticket, buy some popcorn sit down and enjoy the lame, but fun, humour, the action and spectacular visuals.I have to say it, but Arnold is back everyone, and he's back in full force. Terminator 3 is here, and now its time for King Conan.</fullReview>

The James Cameron Terminator movies are far superior to this one, but this one is still a worthy sequel.Mostow, who directed the great Kurt Russell thriller 'Breakdown' and the tense submarine thriller 'U-571', handles this movie really well. He pays homage to the original Terminator movies as well as adding his own spin on it.This one isn't as 'dark' as the other ones were, but it still works. I have said for awhile now, that this movie will either crush Mostow's career, or give him the respect he deserves. And it looks like I'm right.Mostow has an eye for action, and a well placed eye that is. Most of the action in this movie is way better than most of the other action in any of the previous summer action movies.And another good thing is it never lets up. The action just keeps coming. What a thrill ride. The massive car chase near the beginning was brilliant. I said the Matrix: Reloaded car chase was good, but this one is far better, mainly because it uses REAL cars and real stunts. It doesn't rely on CGI to make explosions and cars crash.The first car chase, or rather truck chase, is fun and thrilling. It involves a crane truck and Arnie chasing the T-X on a police motorcycle. It's too much to talk about it, but it's great. What I also liked about this chase was something very subtle. The chase started a night, but it ended during the day. I loved the fact that Mostow decided to have the sun come up during the chase. I don't know why. Probably because most car chases either happen during the day or night, never in between. It was a nice touch. Lame I know, but I liked it.The rest of the action is skillfully done and it was some neat stuff to see. A fight between the Terminator and the T-X had me worried for a minute that Woman's Rights Activists might sue the studio because of the beating Arnie gives the female T-X. But then she fought back, so I guess it evens the score.Also, I must mention Stan Winston. He worked on the previous two Terminators and even won an Academy Award for make-up and special effects on T2. He returns here, and does a stellar job. I love seeing the battle damage on the Terminator, with the Terminator skeleton popping out and flesh still hanging on. It's really neat make-up and job well done. I think another Academy Award might in sights for Winston.Now there was a lot of humour in this one. I laughed at a lot of it, and it was nice to kind of see Arnie play around and make fun of himself on screen. Like just after he gets his outfit and what he does. It was stupid, but I will admit, I laughed. It was harmless, but it could have done with-out it.Now, there were some things that I didn't like about T3. Yes, I know, hard to believe, eh? I didn't like some of the dialogue. It was weak at times, but all the goodness about this movie makes up for all the bad.I also didn't like the fact the classic Terminator theme was absent through out the whole movie. Now Marco Beltrami did a god job composing the movie. The soundtrack was great, it's just, I missed that Terminator theme. It's such an awsome theme, how could he not use it? Sure it appears in the end credits, but still?The story moves along at break neck pace and keeps rolling and rolling. The movie does slow down from time to time to explain things and further the story as well. I don't want to say anything about the story in general, but what I will say is that it's pretty good.In Roger Ebert's review he said `The ending must remain for you to discover, but I will say it seems perfunctory'. I disagree. I liked the ending. As did Ebert's reviewing buddy Richard Roeper. It does leave questions out there, but it also seems to say that, no matter how much we try, we are always doomed. You can't stop something from happening that's supposed to happen, you can only postpone it, and wait until it arrives to do what your fate has chosen for you to do.The ending was good. I liked it. I don't care what anyone says about it, it was good.So, now my closing comments, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a summer action movie that delivers. It doesn't have a complicated storyline that makes you stop paying attention and makes you just want to leave the theatre so bad (Matrix Reloaded). It doesn't rely heavily on CGI like the Matrix did, and when it has CGI, its damn good. It's not as noticeable or poorly done like the Matrix and Hulk were. It also has non-stop great action.It's a great movie and I know I've said this before, but I recommend seeing this. Go buy a ticket, buy some popcorn sit down and enjoy the lame, but fun, humour, the action and spectacular visuals.I have to say it, but Arnold is back everyone, and he's back in full force. Terminator 3 is here, and now its time for King Conan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just garbage...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Warning...Terminator 3 defies logic on so many levels. First of all, I have the same initial question with T-3 that I did with T-2. Why on earth does the future John Connor (or military personnel) continue to send old, obsolete model cyborgs to save him in the past? Wouldn't it make sense to send the same updated, slicker model that was sent to kill him? And why does the female T-X pump up her clevage to flirt with a cop? Isn't she the Terminator?? Why does she need tricks to get his gun? Just take it like you do everything else! Speaking of the cop's gun, why does she even need a gun? Her arm can shape into a gun, a rocket launcher, and a flame thrower. And why does she need to taste a bloody woman and bloody gauze pad to identify people? Isn't her tongue made from the same synthetic material her finger is? She should taste it as soon as she sticks her finger in it. She also murders a guy in a drive thru burger joint, but the window is on the right hand side. Why? Isn't this America?? And what happened to her mission to destroy John Connor's future lieutenants? She abandons that idea early on and decides to pursue John Connor and his future wife for the duration of the movie.T-3 is a poor movie with a convoluted plot, uneven pacing and boring action. The ending is anti-climatic and the film in general feels small and incomplete. It ends with a door open for a sequel, but I am not looking forward to it. T-3 is simply garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was much room for improvement in the third installment of the series. I enjoyed the action just as I would have expected but the new John Conner, Nick Stahl and Kate Brewster, Claire Danes do not have much screen presence for these roles.The one liners and references to the previous films are very good and are enough to keep it interesting. I noticed that the audience did not catch many of the references and wondered if the humor was only there for the die-hard fans. Overall I would say go to a matinee instead of paying full price.</fullReview>

The pacing is fast, just like the first Terminator film.The acting is top notch and the ending is just awesome. Not only is it thought provoking, but it is also very emotional.Ties in very well with T1 and T2, and it continues the mythology of John Connor in an excellent way. At the beginning of the film, he is a slacker who wants no part of his destiny. At the end of the film, he accepts his fate as the leader of the human resistance against Skynet.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two words sum up this movie for me and they are popcorn flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moviegoing auidences have been waiting twelve years for Arnold Schwarzenegger to come back to the role that made him famous and the question remains; was it worth the wait? For me the answer is yes and no. First I'll focus on the yes part of the movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines delivers it's share of action and special effects which in the summer time is why we go to the movies. Nick Stahl whose is a very talented actor takes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong and does it well. And the T-X played by the sexy Kristanna Loken is meancing and a smooth bad ass bad guy. Fianlnly Jonathan Mostow handles the action sequences very well in the film. The chase sequence in the film is one of the best I've seen from the three movies he's directed . Now let's focus on the no part of Terminator 3 that will upset many moviegoers. Terminator 3 has two main probelms that makes the film pale in comparison to it's precassadors. The first being the lack of storytelling that trio of screenwriters John Brancato,Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian can't seem to capture that Cameron magic which affects the direction of the talented Mostow. The second problem is the familar score by composer Brad Fiedel which is gone from this film. When it comes to the females in the film Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken both kinda gives a paper thin performances. Danes over does the damsel in distress role and Loken is nothing more than eye candy (but damn does she look good). The film won't please all tastes but if you want mindless entertainment then check this one out. Hopefully the inevitable Terminator 4 with Nick Stahl in the lead will be an improvement over this one. It's not that Terminator 3 is a bad film it just wasn't worth a 12 year wait. Mt final verdict on the film is ** 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoliers* I just got back from seeing T3 tonight. At first I was not sure whether I really loved it or I really hated it. I have since decided on the former. I went into the movie with a very hopeful yet skeptical attitude. Ok, the movie. At first I was afraid that my fears were coming true (the stupid sunglasses, talk to the hand - which actually was incredibly funny to me). The T-X made me quite sketical at first because she is so hot that I could not think of her being a mean ass. Then when she connects to the net through her phone I thought "oh d*mn." From then on out she is a bad*ss. The chase through LA is hands down awesome. Much better than the Matrix Reloaded chase (though not as long). The Terminator is very good. If a little more emotive than he should be. Things about the movie that I really loved: Skynet coming online was so cool. There really wasnt much to it, but just knowing that it was happening was so cool. Conner realizing that judgement day cannot be averted was very good. I also liked how the machines came to realize that just as judgement day itself could not be avoided, neither could John Conner, so instead they aim at the less important parts in an attempt to lessen the sum - the future generals that serve under Conner. At first I did not like how the movie ended, with the bombs dropping right at the end. But in retrospect I think it was good that way. However, it also necessitates another sequel. I was sorta hoping for some closure. But I was also itching to see everything blow up. Which also did not really happen. But I guess that really was not all that necessary. There were a few other bad things. First of all, there was just a little too much corny humor. Some would have been good, but not as much as was in there. The sarah conner part was rather lame, in my opinion. I wish they would have explained some more how the main players all happened to find there way together at the kennel. The movie sorta throws out the whole "no fate but what we make" thing. However, I think that is a good thing though. Lastly, I was hoping that Mostow would throw in something about Uncle Bobs left over arm at the end of T2. All that being said, I am very pleased with this movie. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Terminator 3 tonight and I msut say that it was good. I was somewhat dissapointed by it since T2 set such high standards, but it was nonetheless a very solid movie. T2 was made in 1991 with a budget of 100 million. To me this movie still holds its ground to T3, a movie made 12 years later. Cameron's presence was missed on this film, but Mostow did a job well done and can hopefully spawn a sequel of two off this story line. Although not as good as T2 it keeps the franchise alive and the story provides more than enough interest for another movie.8/10</fullReview>

T2 seemed to back off the violence a bit, but Kristanna Loken makes Robert Patrick look like a wussy. That chase is definitely as good as the Reloaded freeway chase :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Worthy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe it. After five years of reading through rumours and gossip, it has finally been unleashed. After a year of antcipating this movie and watching the previews over and over again "it is time". Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is here, and holy crap did come in style.This movie blows all of the other summer movies away.Before I go on, I must say this; MINOR SPOILERS (nothing drastic) will be given away.The movie opens with John Connor now in his 20's. He's living off the radar, and moves around a lot. He sort of a has been now. Since they stopped Judgment Day from happening ten years previous, he has nothing to live for really. However, he's still paranoid and never forgets what his mom taught him. But now another, highly advanced terminator (Kristana Loken) has been sent back to, well, terminate him. The T-X, as it's called, goes around and kills all of John's future Lieutenants. The T-X also goes after a girl named Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) who we find out has a very important role in the future war. The Human Resistance was able to send back another Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to protect Connor and Brewster. But which one will reach him first?Now, I'll get to the good stuff in awhile but first I want to mention the casting. The casting of Nick Stahl as Connor was great. I first saw Stahl in the Mel Gibson directed movie The Man With-out A Face. Then Stahl was just a kid, but he did a great job in the role he played. Stahl replaces Edward Furlong in the role of Connor and he does a great job at it. His performance is brilliant and the way he captures the character of a guy who knows that the world could be destroyed at anytime is excellent.The casting of Claire Daines as Kate Brewster was a smart move as well. I can't actually think of any other actress who would fit in this role. As much as I like Natalie Portman, I don't think she would have been believable in this role, and it would have just been her doing her Star Wars bit again. Daines and Stahl have some great chemistry on screen together and that really helps the movie. That's one thing that can always hurt a movie if people are supposed to like each other. Bad chemistry is noticeable, and it distracts from the picture.Now onto the choice role of the T-X, Kristana Loken. While she doesn't play the character as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 character in T2, she does do a good job, at being the, sort of, innocent cute girl. She actually surprised me and did a good job. She's not a scary character, which is a shame, but she's a tough one. I wasn't to keen on the idea of a female terminator, I though it would be handled wrong, but I was wrong. I suppose that's what I get for under-estimating Jonathan Mostow, who did good job with this movie.Sure T3 isn't as good as the first two. I didn't expect it to be, and it doesn't bother me. First of all, it's a different director and writers. The James Cameron Terminator movies are far superior to this one, but this one is still a worthy sequel.Mostow, who directed the great Kurt Russell thriller 'Breakdown' and the tense submarine thriller 'U-571', handles this movie really well.

I was sorta hoping for some closure. But I was also itching to see everything blow up. Which also did not really happen. But I guess that really was not all that necessary. There were a few other bad things. First of all, there was just a little too much corny humor. Some would have been good, but not as much as was in there. The sarah conner part was rather lame, in my opinion. I wish they would have explained some more how the main players all happened to find there way together at the kennel. The movie sorta throws out the whole "no fate but what we make" thing. However, I think that is a good thing though. Lastly, I was hoping that Mostow would throw in something about Uncle Bobs left over arm at the end of T2. All that being said, I am very pleased with this movie. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but shows how amazing terminator 2 is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Terminator 3 tonight and I msut say that it was good. I was somewhat dissapointed by it since T2 set such high standards, but it was nonetheless a very solid movie. T2 was made in 1991 with a budget of 100 million. To me this movie still holds its ground to T3, a movie made 12 years later. Cameron's presence was missed on this film, but Mostow did a job well done and can hopefully spawn a sequel of two off this story line. Although not as good as T2 it keeps the franchise alive and the story provides more than enough interest for another movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as sequels go, as good or better than Matrix Reloaded. This movie has some of the viciousness of the first one, definitely an R. T2 seemed to back off the violence a bit, but Kristanna Loken makes Robert Patrick look like a wussy. That chase is definitely as good as the Reloaded freeway chase :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Worthy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe it. After five years of reading through rumours and gossip, it has finally been unleashed. After a year of antcipating this movie and watching the previews over and over again "it is time". Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is here, and holy crap did come in style.This movie blows all of the other summer movies away.Before I go on, I must say this; MINOR SPOILERS (nothing drastic) will be given away.The movie opens with John Connor now in his 20's. He's living off the radar, and moves around a lot. He sort of a has been now. Since they stopped Judgment Day from happening ten years previous, he has nothing to live for really. However, he's still paranoid and never forgets what his mom taught him. But now another, highly advanced terminator (Kristana Loken) has been sent back to, well, terminate him. The T-X, as it's called, goes around and kills all of John's future Lieutenants. The T-X also goes after a girl named Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) who we find out has a very important role in the future war. The Human Resistance was able to send back another Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to protect Connor and Brewster. But which one will reach him first?Now, I'll get to the good stuff in awhile but first I want to mention the casting. The casting of Nick Stahl as Connor was great. I first saw Stahl in the Mel Gibson directed movie The Man With-out A Face. Then Stahl was just a kid, but he did a great job in the role he played. Stahl replaces Edward Furlong in the role of Connor and he does a great job at it. His performance is brilliant and the way he captures the character of a guy who knows that the world could be destroyed at anytime is excellent.The casting of Claire Daines as Kate Brewster was a smart move as well. I can't actually think of any other actress who would fit in this role. As much as I like Natalie Portman, I don't think she would have been believable in this role, and it would have just been her doing her Star Wars bit again. Daines and Stahl have some great chemistry on screen together and that really helps the movie. That's one thing that can always hurt a movie if people are supposed to like each other. Bad chemistry is noticeable, and it distracts from the picture.Now onto the choice role of the T-X, Kristana Loken. While she doesn't play the character as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 character in T2, she does do a good job, at being the, sort of, innocent cute girl. She actually surprised me and did a good job. She's not a scary character, which is a shame, but she's a tough one. I wasn't to keen on the idea of a female terminator, I though it would be handled wrong, but I was wrong. I suppose that's what I get for under-estimating Jonathan Mostow, who did good job with this movie.Sure T3 isn't as good as the first two. I didn't expect it to be, and it doesn't bother me. First of all, it's a different director and writers. The James Cameron Terminator movies are far superior to this one, but this one is still a worthy sequel.Mostow, who directed the great Kurt Russell thriller 'Breakdown' and the tense submarine thriller 'U-571', handles this movie really well. He pays homage to the original Terminator movies as well as adding his own spin on it.This one isn't as 'dark' as the other ones were, but it still works. I have said for awhile now, that this movie will either crush Mostow's career, or give him the respect he deserves. And it looks like I'm right.Mostow has an eye for action, and a well placed eye that is. Most of the action in this movie is way better than most of the other action in any of the previous summer action movies.And another good thing is it never lets up. The action just keeps coming. What a thrill ride. The massive car chase near the beginning was brilliant. I said the Matrix: Reloaded car chase was good, but this one is far better, mainly because it uses REAL cars and real stunts. It doesn't rely on CGI to make explosions and cars crash.The first car chase, or rather truck chase, is fun and thrilling. It involves a crane truck and Arnie chasing the T-X on a police motorcycle. It's too much to talk about it, but it's great. What I also liked about this chase was something very subtle. The chase started a night, but it ended during the day. I loved the fact that Mostow decided to have the sun come up during the chase. I don't know why. Probably because most car chases either happen during the day or night, never in between. It was a nice touch. Lame I know, but I liked it.The rest of the action is skillfully done and it was some neat stuff to see. A fight between the Terminator and the T-X had me worried for a minute that Woman's Rights Activists might sue the studio because of the beating Arnie gives the female T-X. But then she fought back, so I guess it evens the score.Also, I must mention Stan Winston. He worked on the previous two Terminators and even won an Academy Award for make-up and special effects on T2. He returns here, and does a stellar job. I love seeing the battle damage on the Terminator, with the Terminator skeleton popping out and flesh still hanging on. It's really neat make-up and job well done. I think another Academy Award might in sights for Winston.Now there was a lot of humour in this one. I laughed at a lot of it, and it was nice to kind of see Arnie play around and make fun of himself on screen. Like just after he gets his outfit and what he does. It was stupid, but I will admit, I laughed. It was harmless, but it could have done with-out it.Now, there were some things that I didn't like about T3. Yes, I know, hard to believe, eh? I didn't like some of the dialogue. It was weak at times, but all the goodness about this movie makes up for all the bad.I also didn't like the fact the classic Terminator theme was absent through out the whole movie. Now Marco Beltrami did a god job composing the movie. The soundtrack was great, it's just, I missed that Terminator theme. It's such an awsome theme, how could he not use it? Sure it appears in the end credits, but still?The story moves along at break neck pace and keeps rolling and rolling. The movie does slow down from time to time to explain things and further the story as well. I don't want to say anything about the story in general, but what I will say is that it's pretty good.In Roger Ebert's review he said `The ending must remain for you to discover, but I will say it seems perfunctory'. I disagree. I liked the ending. As did Ebert's reviewing buddy Richard Roeper. It does leave questions out there, but it also seems to say that, no matter how much we try, we are always doomed. You can't stop something from happening that's supposed to happen, you can only postpone it, and wait until it arrives to do what your fate has chosen for you to do.The ending was good. I liked it. I don't care what anyone says about it, it was good.So, now my closing comments, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a summer action movie that delivers. It doesn't have a complicated storyline that makes you stop paying attention and makes you just want to leave the theatre so bad (Matrix Reloaded). It doesn't rely heavily on CGI like the Matrix did, and when it has CGI, its damn good. It's not as noticeable or poorly done like the Matrix and Hulk were. It also has non-stop great action.It's a great movie and I know I've said this before, but I recommend seeing this. Go buy a ticket, buy some popcorn sit down and enjoy the lame, but fun, humour, the action and spectacular visuals.I have to say it, but Arnold is back everyone, and he's back in full force. Terminator 3 is here, and now its time for King Conan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest installment of the Terminator movies will not only thrill fans, but also impress the casual viewer. Time isn't wasted on useless sentimentality as this movie kicks into action from the very beginning. Schwarzenegger reprises his role to perfection and thankfully keeps the cheesy one-liners to a minimum.Although it is noticeably missing the James Cameron touch, director Jonathan Mostow certainly delivers a quality picture worthy of becoming part of the trilogy. Some bad acting and poor writing hinder this from being a perfect film, but that was almost to be expected. Still, experience T3 on the big screen along with great sound, and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just saw it at a advance screening and...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved it, I was breathless almost the entire way. This film puts Matrix Reloaded and just about any other action movie to shame. The best action, as well as all around, movie of the year, and one of the best all time. I was a Terminator fan that was trying to have high hopes, but couldnt continue thinking James Cameron isnt here, the story was finished, blah , blah, blah, T3 proves once thing is for sure, the story wasnt fnished. T3 is the complete movie, action, suspense, and alot of it, some of the coolest shootouts and chases ever. The crane sequence takes a major dump on the cgi-infested highway chase of Matrix Reloaded. The humor was great, not to much either, it was some funny stuff. The story itself was great. and it doesnt result to using 'Arnie's arm was left behind in T2' story. It actually comes up with something completely original and that fits perfectly into the Terminator universe. Even though he might not admit it, James Cameron would be proud of this film. One thing that would have made the film better was more of the future war, it was hardly in this film at all. I dont know where the T-1000's running around in liqiud metal form came from, but they are not there. Maybe they were in the book. The special effects were great, everything they could do in real time, they did, very little CGI compared to that of Matrix, and much better done. Stan Winston and ILM have outdone themselves again. At this point, its a for-sure for Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards, but we'll see what LOTR brings in December. Sarah Connor being dead may have changed some of the things of the story, but it went fine without her, I didnt miss her at all really, and the action sure benefited from her will. As far as the big suprise ending, its action packed, and moves the story flawlessly into the war, as well as John perfectly into the role of the Resistance leader. As far as T4 goes, its gotta happen, and I am sure that it will as long as T3 wont bomb at the B.O. And considering how much I liked, no loved, this movie, how much the friends I went with loved this movie, and how much the people around me loved it, T3's box office should be just fine. As far as it being only 1 Hour 49 Minutes, I didnt notice it, the pacing was great, it wasnt too long, never faltered or got boring, and felt longer than its running time. The action is more on the fly, as well as the story, much more of the way T1's pacing was, rather than T2's. As far as comparing the three films...T1 - A+ T2 - A T3 - A+ Thats right, I think it was not only better than T2, but just as good as T3.That's just about all I can say, an awsome movie from start to finish, and like many have said, a perfect fit in to Cameron's installments, but with Mostow's deffinative vision. Speaking of you Mostow, great job, you took someone elses baby and truly made it your own. I highly recommend this film and hope you all see it opening day, or at the sneak previews the night before, and see it many more times after that like I will.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best one of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not normally a fan of big Hollywood blockbusters, not least the high-grossing trilogies of recent years (Harry Potter, Matrix, Lord of the Rings), but there's something about the first two Terminator films I've always liked. Maybe because it's set in the real world, I don't know. When I had the opportunity to see a preview of Terminator 3, I thought I was bound to be disappointed, not least because the director Jonathan Mostow made the appalling U571. But I was enthralled. From start to finish, I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen for one moment. Much of the film is similar to the first two, in that there's an evil Terminator after the good guy with someone from the future to protect them. Cue high adrenalin car chases, stunts, explosions, etc., all done with panache and good humour. But there's more to this movie than its predecessors, more than just simple chasing. There's a bigger picture, about fate, about therelentless march of technology and the naivety of the American military.Quite simply, it's an interesting film. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are believable and have good chemistry, Arnie is entertaining, with some great one-liners and the female Terminatrix blends in without any problem. Perhaps this is the best of the trilogy. Let's hope there's not another decade before the fourth</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Miss This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of "The Terminator" franchise. I saw the first one when I was 10 years old and it blew me away to say the least. I was stoked to see T2 and it exceeded my greatest expectations. When I heard that they were finally making a third film, I was thrilled. However, I became concerned when all the problems with the film began even before the production started. Jim Cameron not being involved made me very apprehensive about the integrity of the story and its themes about humanity and technology. I didn't want T3 to be just a shoot-em-up action pic which the summer usually carries. I had read Arnold saying that he wouldn't be involved in the film unless Jim Cameron was involved but when he signed without him I figured that it was either a really good script which did the first two films justice or the $30 million paycheck (I hoped it was not just the second but Arnold doesn't really need the money so the script must be descent). The female Terminator seems a little contrived to me (through the process of elimination, it's the next antagonist that brings a new twist to the series, since the first two villians were males and Schwarzenegger had to be the hero again). Kristanna Loken sure looked the part: tall, seductive with killer eyes and a menacing presence. But, can the audience buy a woman "out-manning" Arnold. I was pleased that they decided not to cast Eddie Furlong as John Connor. Nick Shahl is a good actor with a couple good credits on his resume (In The Bedroom, Disturbing Behavior). Jonathan Mostow was a strange choice I thought as director, given he only has a couple credits to his name, both with only moderate success (Breakdown, U-571). Although, without Jim Cameron, the director is no longer a sell point anyway because no one can match his venerable appeal to sci-fi fans. Warner Bros. just needed someone who was passionate about the project and didn't want to run it into the ground. If Mostow took the job, he must truly believe he can pull it off. With all these pros and cons on my mind, I was very curious, nervous and excited going into this movie. I saw the film at a private screen for the Tonight Show staff on the WB lot last Monday (June 26). IT BLEW ME AWAY. It delivers on most fronts. The action is intense. It has a lot of physical stunt work which I believe to be more amazing then CGI stunts (like The Matrix films) because it comes with greater realism and bigger stakes. The special effects do not disappoint. The T-X is very cool. She can manipulate any machine and use them to work under her control. She can shape-shift like the T-1000 in "T2" (but she is still a metallic unit under her organic guise). She can manufacture weapons with her arms (flame-thrower, rocket-launcher). And she isn't too hard to look at either. She was sent back through time to take out John Connor's mission partners from the future since John Connor cannot be located (he's living off the grid leaving no physical evidence of his existence whenever he goes). He's totally paranoid about this future and dreads what he knows about it. The T-X happens upon John while attempting to terminate his future wife and parnter-in-arms (well played by Claire Daines). But the T-800 was sent back to protect John again and he gets to John first (but barely). The first meeting of the two Terminators culminates in a spectular car chase with a gigantic crane truck through the streets of downtown LA. It's one of the many fantastic action pieces in the film. The movie is basically a cat-and-mouse game between the T-800 and company and the T-X (similar story to the first two films). This film still has the plot line about Skynet and its imminent self-awareness which actually is set to happen on the same day the film take places. This adds great tension and suspense to the story since time becomes such a critical factor for John. Can he once again prevent the rise of the machines and circumvent his destiny? According to the T-800, Judgment Day has just postponed by the events which took place in "T2", not prevented. John doesn't want to be the leader of the human resistance again the machines and chooses once again to stop Skynet while still trying to evade the T-X who is hot on his trail (again, another great tension-builder). Before I continue, I need to mention one point which still bothers me a bit about the entire story behind "T3". If at the end of "T2", all evidence of the existence of the Terminator was destroyed in the boiling steel and Cyberdine Labs was completely eradicated, how did the T-800 and other models of Terminator get invented this time around. At the end of "T1" there was the wreakage of the T-800 in the hyraudlic press which inspired the creation of the hardware. But, all that is destroyed in "T2". I'm willing to forget about that hole in the story since the film was so good and worth making, but it's worth mentioning anyway. "T3" does lack the strong bond formed between the Terminator and John which is something that made "T2" surprising dramatic at times and made its ending more tragic and memorable. But even though "T3" doesn't work on all the same levels of "T2", the film focuses much harder on the levels it takes on and makes you forget about its lack of drama. The film has an ending I did not expect and I believe that it was the best way to end the film. I won't spoil it for you but you won't see it coming. I really hope that people will go see this film because it deserve to do well at the box-office. I don't think the advertising does the film justice and may deter a lot of people from seeing it (it looks a lot like a typical summer blockbuster instead of a good film). I wish they ran a few trailer which toned down the stunt work and special effects and dealt more with the story and the themes so people can see that it actually has them. Good word of mouth is what is going to fill the seats in the theater. It will open well, I think ($75 million over the 5 day week) but it's staying power will rely on both good reviews and repeat business. I am going to see it again this weekend and urge everyone who liked the first two not to miss the third installment. It will not disappoint, I promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No matter what you say... it's still better than Part IV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the main problems with 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' was that it had to follow not only the original 'Terminator' movie, but its (arguably better) sequel, 'T2: judgement Day,' therefore whatever came next had not just one, but TWO tough acts to follow. In short ? it didn't.It does its best to follow the plot of the first two movies, i.e. bad cyborg sent back through time by the machine-rulers of the future to kill humanity's last hope for survival versus protector (also from the future), however, it comes across as a Terminator-made-for-TV movie. If it wasn't for the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as the titular cyborg, it has a real sense of being a lot less epic than its predecessors.For a start, it's shorter, secondly, the effects don't seem to have improved much since the groundbreaking 'liquid metal' SFX from T2 and it never really makes us care much about the characters. Linda Hamilton did not want to reprise her role as the iconic action heroine Sarah Connor, leaving Claire Danes to do her best to fill her shoes. And, if you've been following Edward Furlong's 'career' since he made his name as the young John Connor from T2, you'll know that he wasn't in much shape to reprise his role. Instead, Nick Stahl tries his best to play humanity's future leader and, although credit for making him look like his (on screen) father, Kyle Reece, is never really given much to do apart from look confused at the fact that the Terminator has returned. In other words... T1/2 produced real characters who stuck with us through the ages whereas T3 rushes us from one chase scene to the next and it's over before you know it.Don't get me wrong ? I didn't hate Part III. I own it and watch it every few years (just not as much as the first two, obviously!). It has its good parts ? mainly Schwarzenegger. He still holds his own, even playing ? technically ? a new cyborg from the last two instalments. It's also worth noting that Part 3 is a '12' certificate, therefore don't expect the overall dark tone from the other two. There are more wisecracks here which lighten the mood.But, even if you do hate it, it's still pretty good fun watching two indestructible cyborgs go toe to toe and the ending is actually quite good. Perhaps the worst thing about it was that it's great ending leads us effortlessly into Part IV (aka Salvation) and we all know how that one turned out (sorry Christian Bale, but a Terminator is not a Terminator movie without Mr Schwarzenegger taking the lead role).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In its own right, its a ton of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is a total departure from the first two films. It perfectly fits the storyline and doesn't create too many glaring plot holes from the first two films. The problem is that there is a distinctive lack of brilliant artistic vision behind it. This was made to cash in and is made to be a mainstream action/sci-fi flick. Taken at that value...I love it. Its fun and campy and absolutely non-stop action packed popcorn popping fun. If you love Schwarzenegger like I do...this is bread and butter for fans of his. He comes back swinging as his infamous Terminator role. Much like Terminator 2 there is a lot of campy scenes and they feel just a little more campy this time around but for some reason campy works in the context of this very real world they create. I think the cleverness behind Terminator 3 is that the action is so good and the pace is so fast that you forget its not as clever as the previous two films. This is all about Arnold and continuing the story and sort of a much expected prologue to Judgement Day. I think it would have been a very different film had James Cameron returned to direct but it is what it is and I enjoy it!! Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator. He is more robotic this time and the low brow humour is toned down but it is lots of Arnold. If you look up the easter eggs in place for fans you'll enjoy it quite a bit. It isn't his most charismatic role and definitely not his best turn as the Terminator (I hope that is still to come with Genisys) but it is still great. While I'm not fond of them having a different John Connor every single time...Nick Stahl actually is really great in the role. He is very serious and brooding and plays the part well. His John Connor is a drifter, trying to find his way in the non-Judgement Day world and you actually believe he could become the Saviour of mankind. He doesn't have NEAR the chemistry with Schwarzenegger that Edward Furlong did but he still plays a good part and leads the cast well. Claire Danes is an interesting character and she plays the part well. She does have good chemistry with Stahl and Schwarzenegger and I actually wish she would come back to the series at some point playing Katherine Brewster. Kristanna Loken is interesting in her role. I always thought this would be her breakout role but she sort of slipped into B-Movie obscurity. She is actually extremely effective as the villainous and deadly T-X. She is stunningly beautiful but there is something campy about her performance too. Still she has few lines and her hand to hand battles with Schwarzenegger are excellent. They make worthy foes and while she isn't near as effective as Robert Patrick was but it works. While they manage to write out Sarah Connor, her spirit is alive and well in the story.If you hold Terminator 3 up against T2 then you will hate...plain and simple. Terminator 2 is easily one of the best sci-fi/action films ever made period and this is a far cry from that. But...its far enough after that film that if you watch it for sheer fun then you can find plenty to enjoy. I'm not sure why they put Jonathan Mostow at the helm of such a potentially big entry in the franchise. He just doesn't have the proper experience. He does alright but when you consider one of the best directors of all time practically created this franchise, you can't hand it off to just anyone. The special effects are a HUGE step down and the CGI is nowhere near the standard T2 set (which is funny considering it was a dozen years later.) I'm trying very hard to hold Terminator 3 on its own and not compare it because I love this movie!! Just have fun with it and enjoy the continuing story because it works and it has a ton of action and its not nearly the mess so called "die hard" fans make it out to be. Its a step down but still fun. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but Soulless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to sequels, third's not always the charm. In fact, it rarely is. For some reason, Hollywood can SOMETIMES get #2 in a series right but rarely #3. And Terminator 3 is, considered by a lot of people, not to be an exception to that rule. Fans seem to generally hate this one, calling it the first nail in the coffin for the franchise with Terminator Salvation being the next. But is it really as bad as people have claimed? Let's take a look and find out!The plot takes place seven years after the second film where Sarah Connor has died of leukemia and John now lives off the grid, like a homeless bum. Even though they destroyed Cyberdyne Systems and supposedly stopped Judgment Day, John still feels unsafe and paranoid that it'll eventually come and he'll have to fight for the fate of mankind. It turns out that Judgment Day was never stopped, only postponed as two Terminators come back in time, one to assassinate John, and one to protect him.I remember reading somewhere that Linda Hamilton was offered to reprise her role as Sarah Connor in this film but declined and called the script "soulless" and that pretty much sums up the entire film for me. While it's not as bad as a lot of sequels out there, or even that bad of a film in general, it just feels soulless and empty. Terminator 2 was really the finale of the franchise. They destroyed Cyberdyne and basically prevented Judgment Day from ever happening so there really was no need for a sequel at all.Speaking of T2, this film is also severely lacking in creativity. It basically rehashes all the same plot points of T2 except without Sarah Connor, and contradicting the message in that film(more on this later). Now, you could argue that since T2 borrowed a lot from the first Terminator as well, it's not that big of a problem but the thing is, T2 developed the characters further, it expanded the universe, and it explored the themes of the first film deeper. This film doesn't do any of that, it just uses all the same concepts and ideas except now, the message of the second film about how humanity isn't doomed by fate and how we can change it, is now replaced with "it's destiny". It could have been an interesting concept to explore, about how humanity is destined to destroy itself someday, but it just feels like an excuse to continue the franchise and make more money in this case.Okay, so I just basically tore up the film in the two last paragraphs but why don't I hate this film? Well, plain and simply, it's entertaining. While it's certainly not as thought-provoking as James Cameron's films, it still works as an action movie. The fights between the Terminators are brutal, fast-paced, and intense. There's a scene where they fight in a bathroom and they smash literally EVERYTHING in that room. It's so over-the-top, it actually becomes sort of funny at points. The pacing was fairly quick, never leaving the audience bored much and there's some decent suspense throughout(nothing compared to the first two, though). The film also LOOKS quite good. The cinematographer, Don Burgess, did a good job recreating a similar look to T2 and while the CGI isn't quite photo-realistic, it was used REASONABLY and there was a good use of both practical stunts and animatronics as well so I won't fault it too much for that.The cast is just sorta hit-and-miss here. Arnold is more emotionless this time around, no longer the caring father figure to John and it works since John is no longer a kid. Nick Stahl oddly plays John whinier as an adult than Edward Furlong did as a child but nonetheless, Stahl does a good job playing a man trying to escape his own destiny. Claire Danes does OKAY as Kate Brewster, but her character was just sort of bland and uninteresting throughout to the point where her performance was ultimately forgettable. Kristanna Loken is again, sorta bland and forgettable, which is a shame considering that she's the main villain of the film. She just lacks any sort of menace and isn't in anyway intimidating throughout the entire film and it really feels like she only got cast for the sake of sex appeal.Director Jonathan Mostow seems capable but he lacks the attention to detail James Cameron has and he doesn't seem to put the same level of nuance in his film. He just seems more interested in getting us to the next action scene and less interested in the human elements that made the first two films so fantastic. But the thing he seems to struggle with the most is humor. This film just goes way too far at times to the point where it feels like downright parody. Do I even HAVE to mention the part where Arnold gets his clothes from a male strip club? Thankfully, the humor gradually died down and became more subtle as the film went on.Overall, if you just want a fun, brainless popcorn flick that just happens to be a Terminator film, you'll enjoy it. But if you really want something meatier and more intelligent, than you should probably look somewhere else. This is just another Hollywood cash-grab sequel. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm gonna give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third Time's kinda the Charm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, in my opinion, is extremely underrated.It really isn't that bad at all. I'm not saying it's the series savior, in fact I think this movie is nothing compared to T1 and T2, but I'm just saying it's okay as a whole. The action is good, it kept me entertained throughout, and that sequence in the beginning when the T-X gets in a crane truck and chases John Connor is just awesome! What I thought to be the big plot twist was in the end when the T-X reprograms the T-800 to kill John actually kept me in suspense. Overall, the action sequences throughout the movie are done very well. Again, this movie is no where near the series savior. The acting has it's up and downs. Like I said, the crane scene was great, but after that the movie becomes extremely dramatic as they drive through the desert. It gets even more dramatic when John holds up a gun to his head just because Terminator won't do what he wants. Seriously? Quote Kyle from T1; "It can't be bargained or reasoned with". The acting...meh. It's OK throughout. Although it becomes obvious at sometimes that certain actors don't want to be there. The plot, for what it is, is OK. In my opinion this movie should have never happened, when in T2 they stop judgment day. This is mentioned in the middle of this movie, but never even questioned again. But, we got kind of a reason for this movie, whatever, let's move on. One thing that bothers me is that the killer Terminator is in the form of a girl (by default). I'm not against girls or anything, I just think the Terminator movies have a tradition of the Terminators being in the form of a boy by default, so the T-X doesn't really lead up to the franchise. Still, I kinda like that twist. This movie is good, but I still think the story ends at T2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No this isn't as good as The Terminator, or T2, But it's still good and doesn't deserve all the hate. It still has some great action scenes, mainly the truck scene, but it's still good. The ending is actually sad, they couldn't stop Judgement Day, so the world will be in a huge war, and I guess that's what Terminator Salvation is about. Either way, it's a welcome edition in the franchise and is WAY better than people say, it doesn't deserve the hate, it has some great scenes, the special effects are good, the acting's decent, it has some funny lines, it's a good watch, and it's fun. It may not be movie of the decade, but it's still good, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third movie in The Terminator series came very late in the day, and while it has some explosive, well-done action scenes and the odd dose of unexpected humour (Arnie in the Elton John-style sunglasses) it's easy to see the imagination and grasp of character the first two movies had has gone.It isn't a bad film taken on its own and its unexpected ending works quite well; other than that it's just a long chase movie. It's a pacey but rather soulless film, indifferently acted and with poorly conceived characters. Some tension is generated by female Terminator Kristanna Loken's first attack, but even this just descends into formula after a while. We've been here before in the earlier movies, and they did it a lot better.What the film really misses is James Cameron's ultra-smart direction and sassy grasp of narrative. I'll be honest and say I don't care much for Titanic and Avatar but his two Terminator movies, Aliens, and The Abyss are much admired genre classics. Johnathon Mostow's effort, in the end, does not join them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the machines is a good big-budget action.Shot in wonderful locations in and around LA,breath-taking stunts and cutting edge visual effects.But as a huge fan and admirer of the franchise,I should say I was disappointed on watching this one.There are many reasons why I was disappointed on watching this one,the first being that it lacked the surreal edge that the first two films had giving you that scare as well as a fine thrill.Nick Stahl showed promise playing the role of john Connor but he had innocence written all over his face.I would have been really happy if furlong had reprised the role himself.Well,Arnie...looked way out of shape,guys who are reading this might disagree with me on this but I will elaborate it fairly..In the first two movie he was a towering 6'1-6'2 demolition man who had that grizzly killer look but here he has shrunk beyond imagination to a 5'11 and appears really odd and you can make out some sort of a difference.Plus the comical one-liners make him seem more like a clown.Even the specifics of the story have been badly altered for example,when Arnie is re-programmed by the T-X,he is about to kill Connor but Connor reminds him about his mission and that he was about to fail which gives Arnie a reminder and he shuts himself down.I found this absolute crap,because Michael biehn who brilliantly portrayed Kyle Reese in the first installment clearly stated that "It cant be bargained with,It cant be be reasoned with!".Well the saving grace of the movie has to be without doubt,the T-X,kristanna loken beautifully played out the role and she looked just the way she had to : A crafty,censual and deadly female terminator.If there is one thing that I respect the production crew for,it would definitely be their idea of choosing a female opponent.Because it was perfect to see a female to kick some action into it.And it was amazing to see Arnie go up against a female opponent who was taller than he is and certainly looked much more deadlier than he was and it was simply amazing to see the T-X take Arnie to town and for me the best scene of the movie other than the car chase was the scene where she decapitates Arnie.Well fans of this movie will definitely hate this review but as an ardent fan of the franchise I deeply felt Cameron's legacy had a much better thing in store.Its a well-made action film but not a true-blue terminator flick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimaginative Sequel Fails to Bring Anything New to Series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my biggest pet peeves in modern film is the creation of completely unnecessary sequels to fantastic movies. Here, we have a prime example. In my opinion, the TERMINATOR franchise would've been better off if it'd ended with the conclusion of James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2; I really wish he'd gone with his original ending showing how Judgment Day had been avoided, thereby putting a halt to future installments. Sadly, this was not the case and in 2003 Jonathan Mostow brought us the third film in the saga. The plot is nothing we haven't seen before in two other films: the future finds the human race at war with the machines (run by Skynet) and again, an attempt is made to put an end to the human resistance movement before the war ever starts. Skynet sends a new, upgraded model of Terminator to 2003 to kill John Connor, Kate Brewster (his future wife and second-in-command), and his future lieutenants. In response, the future resistance sends back another T-800 Terminator to protect him until Judgment Day passes.So, essentially what we have here is TERMINATOR 2 all over again, without some of the best aspects of what made the second film so great: James Cameron's writing/direction, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, etc). The new villain, the Terminatrix, is basically a higher-tech mash-up of the first two (a weaponized endo-skeleton and a morphing liquid metal alloy) except this time it's a woman. Too much of the film feels like a rehashing of everything we've seen that most of it is forgettable until the final 30 minutes. Once Skynet goes online and Judgment Day officially arrives, the movie becomes more entertaining as we see early Hunter-Killers and T-1's rampage through a military base. The battles between the Terminators are impressive and fun to watch, but the film wanders a little too far into camp for my tastes. Some scenes, particularly the T-800's arrival in a roadside bar for ladies' night, may elicit chuckles from some but had me groaning.One element that fails to live up to the first films are the performances of the cast. With the exception of Arnold Schwarzeneggar as the T-800 Terminator (he invented the role and he really can't go wrong), the cast doesn't strike the same chord. Nick Stahl does a decent job as John Connor and seems to be a suitable replacement for Edward Furlong but Claire Danes (as Kate Brewster) spends the majority of the movie freaking out and Loken (as the Terminatrix) tries to invoke the cold, soulless killer that was Robert Patrick's T-1000 but never quite has the same effect. If a third Terminator film was really necessary, I wish Mostow and the writers had gone a little further and tried to create a unique story to grab the audience's attention, rather than feeding us the same old formula (especially with the utilization of Judgment Day as a plot point, there's so much potential there). You won't be bored by TERMINATOR 3, as it's a halfway decent action movie, but fans of the franchise who were hoping for an explosive follow-up to Cameron's T2 probably won't find what they were hoping for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 (T3) often gets a bad rep but I think it's caused more by the greatness of T2 and how it was difficult if not impossible to beat. I didn't like how Skynet was still active even after the events of T2, it seemed to negate most sacrifices made by the protagonist and to slap the director James Cameron's work in the face (shades of Alien 3 here). However, without that, there wouldn't have been a T3 so I would have been quite satisfied if a simple explanation had been given. As it is, I had to check Wikipedia for that. The new director straddles a fine line between rip-offs and homages having at first trouble finding its own voice. It didn't feel as exciting and fresh as T2. The plot and directing were good but not as inspired as T2 either.The terminatrix was not as good a villain as the T-1000, something was missing. Arnold was still in fine form but did look older than previous films (which is unavoidable I guess ;). The actors playing Connor and Kate Brewster were quite good. The first chase scene felt a bit overlong but you've got to admire the stunt work and I don't remember that kind of truck being used in a chase before. The film and action does pick up in the second half making it more suspenseful. I loved the fight between the Terminator and the Terminatrix when they were bashing walls. I thought that was great. I also loved the bold ending very much as it's kind of surprising while also closing the big loop hole left at the end of T2. Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit, more in the second half than the first. It's worth renting or purchasing if you're a action sci-fi or Terminator collector.Rating: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inferior sequel, but not a bad film on it's own merits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 'Terminator' film was a tough one to follow, but James Cameron came up with a sequel that was bigger and better than it's predecessor. It seemed to end the story of Man vs. Machine, but fans wanted more. For years there was talk of a possible second sequel, but Cameron opted to not be involved. In 1996 Universal Studios opened a new attraction called T2 3-D: Battle Across Time, which again sparked interest in furthering the film series, but it wouldn't really happen until 7 years later. A new director, no Linda Hamilton, and a new actor playing the role of John Connor didn't exactly have fans feeling bowled over. The film received mixed reviews and made less at the box office than it's predecessor. After seeing it for myself I can say that it's not an altogether bad film on it's own, though as a sequel to two landmark films it doesn't measure up.Pros: Good performances all around. Spectacular make-up, visual, and mechanical effects. A good score. Very beautifully photographed. Moves at a decent pace. Some truly awesome action sequences and set pieces. Though not as good as before, some of the humor is still amusing. The last 20 minutes are non-stop excitement.Cons: Plot is thin. Lacks some of the heart of the previous ones. Some of the humor is more silly than funny and therefore a bit cringe-inducing. Unlike the first two films, this one is sort of forgettable. As with the previous films you have to be really forgiving of the totally over-the-top and unbelievable action scenes.Final thoughts: The first two 'Terminator' films are so good that making a third was not going to be an easy task. Though not a bad film, 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is a big step down and not that great of an Action or Science Fiction film either. It entertains and dazzles effects and action-wise, plus the performances and direction are more than competent, so it's not a total waste. It's a decent summer blockbuster, nothing more nothing less.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How such a right movie can become so wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read that Terminator 3 was being developed in mid February 2002 I jumped off my chair and cheered loudly. I remember the anticipation for the movie being huge. I was watching trailers, following updates here and on other sites on a weekly basis up until the release of the film. So I entered the cinema, only to see that someone in production didn't share my opinion on what a Terminator film is all about.A Terminator movie to me is all about the frightening, unbelievable, yet realistic story about men creating it's own doom by making smarter and smarter computers and machines. It's about the story and adventures of Sarah Connor and John Connor. It's also about having the most hardcore villains ever in firstly Arnold Schwarzenegger and secondly Robert Patrick. In the same way that Keith Richards playing guitar in the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie the casting of a Terminatrix beating up Arnold Schwarzenegger sinks a landmine into the heart of the movie. Now, Kristanna Loken is a beautiful woman, and also good at what she's doing in this film. It's only that the role she's playing doesn't work for me. I know that her role is a superior model to Arnold's and I have to think deeper than this, but there is just no way that it looks right to me when a beautiful woman kicks Arnold Schwarzeneggers but. It's a totally wrong decision in my opinion. That was the saddest part of the movie to me.And while we're at it. There's about one or two jokes in some scenes in the first two movies that never ever makes the film cross the line to being a comedic film. At parts, this movie truly is comedic and even silly. It doesn't feel like it has the right tone for a Terminator movie.The casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor isn't a perfect choice either in my opinion... He's not that good of an actor and doesn't even look like Edward Furlong a few years into the future from Terminator 2. That's why I'm so glad they cast Christian Bale as Connor for the new Terminator Salvation film since he's a much better actor and looks way more like Furlong than Stahl does.Now to the good parts of the movie. Apart from the to me obvious flaws of the movie that I presented it does have glimpses of classic Terminator quality. The core story, Terminatrix aside, is actually good. The Directing is good. Claire Danes is brilliant as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger. Kristanna Loken is good at playing a Terminatrix, it's just that her role is hopeless to succeed in my opinion. So that's a really double-edged sword. I don't think there's any woman that could have done it any better. The music arrangements are good and feel like a Terminator movie and so are some of the action scenes. I recommend this movie to those who likes to see big explosions and high speed chases, without thinking too much about what's really going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, or at least I was. Politics aside, I've enjoyed most of his films, even if many of them were basically no-brainer, popcorn action flicks.By all accounts he WAS a huge action star back in the day, but even with all the bodybuilding he did to get ready for T3, I still wasn't buying him as The Terminator I enjoyed from the first installments anymore. Everybody ages and even after most of the budget seems to have gone to pancake make-up and Oil of Olay to cover his wrinkles, I'm still unconvinced. I really, really wanted to give him a chance to reprise the role he so superbly fit back in 1984 and again in T2, but it's 19 years later. In the end, he's a 60+ year-old guy with a great build for his age.As for the story; it was OK. I've certainly seen better sci-fi and action films. Did it add much to The Terminator universe? Not really. It did accomplish the feat of tying up some lose ends as to how John Connor survived the nuclear attack that is necessary for there to even be a Terminator plot line. I'm not sure that the movie could have been made without Schwarzenegger somewhere in the mix, but I guess we'll all find out when T4 opens.The characters themselves were fairly cardboard and underdeveloped. Thankfully the first two movies gave some background because this one really did not help it along. I can say the the addition of a female Terminator was an interesting twist and broadened the scope of the Terminator world.If you loved the first two as I did (I've seen The Terminator at least 100 times), you'll need to see T3, just don't get your hopes too high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since the grossing success of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, fans pleaded and wished for another Terminator movie, me being one of them. Now I regret it. Terminator 3 was just junk basically. If I could sum this movie up with one word, it'd be junk. They're so many things wrong with it, the movie itself just has mind-less action, a female villain, ridiculously unfunny scenes and humor. Really, a character and series like The Terminator, never should have humor, and mind-less action mixed together because it results in a disaster. This movie felt it had to be made, like the fans couldn't see it end at Terminator 2; but we waited too long, so much has changed; it could never live up to the standards as the first two. Terminator 3 is a major disappointment, and sort of adds embarrassment and negativity to the first two movies. Terminator fans I suggest you give it a watch, just to see how much they've done to 'ruin' the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, the movie was still pretty good. It just paled in comparison to the cinematic artworks that were the first two films.The story was on the weak side here. A female terminator called the T-X (played by Kristanna Loken) is sent back to kill John Connor (played by a stale Nick Stahl). That's not a rip off of T2, right? And also like T2, an even further outdated T-800 (somehow called a T-850)(Arnie again also) is sent to protect him and his wife who was never mentioned before, Kate Brewster (played by a boring Claire Danes). Apparently Judgement Day wasn't stopped, making T2 completely useless.The effects were good but over-used. Especially in fight scenes. Also, T-850's clothes were sort of goofy, as well as his attitude. He was just too robotic and not even in the sense that he was supposed to be. He seemed to be reading cue cards and not trying to be a robot half the time. John Connor was very weak here, as well as Kate Brewster. I hope she will be omitted from the so-called "script" of the upcoming Terminator 4.OK, I can't stand to talk about this pathetic excuse of a Terminator movie anymore. I'm gonna go watch T1 and T2 and pray for forgiveness for even considering this movie to be in the same league as them.5/10.</fullReview>

But come on -- how seriously is anyone expected to take this story? The screenplay also has a reflexive quality to it, with Arnold the actor, feeling his age as an action movie star, playing an old and outdated model of cyborg, who can't keep up with the new times.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's such a pity that Hollywood seems almost incapable of realising when a franchise has run its course. So, they go on. And on.Two terminators were quite enough. The first was a creepy, almost B-movie horror flick - simple, but eminently well presented. 'Judgement Day' on the other hand, was a truly epic work of science fantasy. Between the two they used up all of the ideas associated with the concept. There was nothing else to play for. So why then not finish on a high note? Because there's still money in it; that's why. Like prospectors mining gold, they just can't accept that the vein has run out.OK, what else can we do that's new? I know; how about a female terminator? We can always build a story round that. Yes. Actually, the T1000 of 'Judgement Day' was itself capable of completely mimicking any human females it killed, so what was the point of a dedicated design? I won't go on. Objective critics have seen all of the movie's shortcomings. Only nerds sat back and gaped in awe at this one.Yes; the new effects were excellent. The tanks that had a hint of 'Robocop' about them were highly believable hokum, as were the flying machines. But we'd seen them all before, just fewer in number. The acting was plausible but hardly set the screen on fire. Arnie actually looked bored in this outing, which is something of an acting revelation for him. And the script was - well - cheesy.Judgement Day it transpires was, after all, unavoidable. It took an extra two hours of repetitive, rehashed celluloid mayhem of slaughter, truck-chases, and shattering glass to tell us that? I don't think so.Watching inadequate sequels to favourite movies is rather like seeing old friends dying from some wasting illness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>really good, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, i really enjoyed it. I think it did wrap up the first two terminators pretty well, but it really wasn't as good as the first 2. It was too short. It did have some potential, yet it could have been better. But it was a good action film. I just don't see how T4 is going to be made, with the series and all. Its just not all going to fit together in the long run. But i did like it, and really don't get why other people don't. I guess it's because the first two are classics. When you see this, forget how good the first 2 were, and just see it as T3-an awesome action movie! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transputing Terminators</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the 1930ies, Science fiction, the "genuine American fairytale" (Gotthard Günther), has anticipated a world determined by computers. The about six generations of computers built since Zuse share that they are unable to deal with circularity, i.e. self-reference, re-entry, autopoiesis, etc., because they are constructed according to classical logic which does not allow, e.g., a statement like "I am lying", since this statement is true when I am lying and false when I am not lying, i.e. it is true when it is false and false when it is true. On similar reasons, comments about sentences are excluded, e.g. "This sentence is true/false". When we hear now, in "Terminator 3" (2003), a sentence like "My command is to protect you" or even stronger: "Get away from me ... I have no choice ... I cannot control my functions ... I am a machine", then it is clear that in the case of terminators, we have to deal with a trans-classic logic and hence not with simple computers but with "trans-puters", i.e. with computers that allow self-reference because the logical law of the Excluded Middle is abolished.From the above quotation it is also clear that when a machine says "I have no choice ... I am a machine", it is self-aware on what it is, i.e. it has its own will. Its third logical value besides position and negation after the abolishment of the Law of the Excluded Middle allows this kind of machine to realize the difference between its program and its intent to react appropriately in a certain situation. Not even the newest computers can realize that, since they follow a logic in which the Law of the Excluded Middle is still valid. Here we also find the profoundest reason why terminators are that human-like (and, conversely, why they like to appear in human-like shape and sometimes lead to "hermaphroditic" creatures like "cyborgs", "androids" and others): Control of will is hitherto still a feature by which humans are differentiated from machines. If we now watch terminators, we see that trans-puters presuppose formalization not only of cognition (like classical computers do), but also of volition. But formalization of volition would imply that from a certain point on the computer would transgress its constructor. There would not be anymore, as in classical computers, a symbiosis between constructor and construction.Such "poly-contextural" computers (a term introduced by G. Günther during his work at the "Biological Computer Laboratory" of the University of Illinois) with both formalized cognition and volition would fulfill Norbert Wiener's claim for Golem-like "human-machines" uttered in his book "The Human Use of Human Beings" (1950). However, from a general point of view it is strange that cybernetics, which was established as a science since the Macy conferences in New York (starting in 1946) and is nowadays practically extinct in the academic world, seems to survive in Science Fiction which, in its turn, is anticipating future computer generations. But since "control" is a core-term of cybernetics, this science may perhaps become revitalized in times where whole continents are menaced by terrorism. If this is true, one should, however, not forget that total control must not only concern the reign of cognition but most utterly the empire of the will, too. Since this must not be done as in the case of Dr. Mabuse whose aim was simply to replace the will of humans by his own, but in allowing a machine to have its OWN will, the concept of formalization of volition only will imply both control and freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flawless Terminator series finally hits a snag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron's Terminator films are classics. The original was an exciting, pulse pounding adventure. A gritty SF film with a sharp edge. Then with Terminator 2, he took the framework of Pt 1, and expanded it out into an epic-sized masterpiece. We've had to wait 12 years for a third instalment. But without Cameron in the director's chair, this has had a domino effect.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is not all bad but its a major disappointment after what we've seen beforehand. This time the director is Jonathan Mostow. And he doesn't have the intense style Cameron brings to his action films.In spite of his over-sized ego, James Cameron is an excellent action film director. His films always have an exhilarating kick. Mostow on the other hand merely 'borrows' from Cameron. If the setpieces in T3 feel eerily familiar, that's because you've seen them in the other Terminator films.T3 is not a direct rehash of Pts 1 &amp; 2. It has got a slightly different plot. But at its heart, its about the same thing. Two Terminators from the future are sent into the past. And their objective concerns John Connor. One to protect him. One to kill him.Aside from Arnold Schwarzenegger, the thread of the Terminator trilogy has always been John Connor. He was a target before he was even born. Then when he was a child. And now as a young man. Gone is the surly Edward Furlong. Now in the role is Nick Stahl.This was the first film I'd ever seen Stahl in. And to say he's disappointing is putting it politely. It's hard to believe this is the person Edward Furlong would grow up to be, and someone who will go on to be the leader of the human resistance, much less the saviour of the human race. Stahl is a positively wimpy John Connor. It's all the more surprising especially after seeing what a good actor Stahl is in films like Sin City and the underrated Disturbing Behaviour.T3 has slightly adjusted the plot for this latest instalment. But not by much. John Connor is again targeted for termination. But he's not alone. His future lieutenants are also on the chopping block. One of them is also his future wife, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a humble vet who gets roped into Skynet's latest assassination plan.As for the Terminators, Arnie is present and correct. But the newest addition, and the one spark of originality the film has is a female Terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken).Loken is sexy as hell in red leather, but she's disappointing too. She never generates a threatening presence the way Arnie or Robert Patrick did. She's supposed to be emotionless, but she's just too emotional in her inflections. She even smiles. And when she does downplay her emotions, she's just bland.Claire Danes isn't much better as Kate. I suspect she's Linda Hamilton's replacement. Nick Stahl almost says as much when he compares her to his mother. This is untrue. Hamilton had a startling presence in T2. She was always believable when packing a rifle. Danes struggles to make the part her own, and ends up buried in the A-list action sequences and special effects.The film's one ace in the hole is Arnie. At least he comes off with a degree of respectability. The Terminator is a role Arnie could do in his sleep. But thankfully he doesn't sleepwalk through the role. His cold, detached observations are surprisingly funny. Like Pt 2, he's been reprogrammed as a good Terminator, but interestingly, he's allowed some ambiguities. Things he was never allowed in the previous films.Although he's John's protector, he doesn't have to follow his orders. He can outright refuse if he wants. He is even capable of lying. Those are moments pleasantly reminiscent of his acting in Pt 1. Which made me realise how much I missed him being an evil Terminator. Arnie's OK as a good Terminator, but he's great when he's bad!At least the special effects are up to scratch. Most of them involve the T-X. She can form guns, revert to liquid, and even control machinery. As well as effect a few improvements in the chest area! But impressive as these effects may be, they don't come with the awe the T-1000 had when he assumed the pattern of a tile floor. Or gathering his shattered bits into a puddle and reassuming human form. The T-X is technically proficient, but she's curiously unremarkable.The action scenes are on a par with the previous films, but they don't feel as thrilling. The most spectacular is a high speed chase involving an artificial crane, remote controlled police cars, and LA's rush hour traffic. But the action doesn't enthrall you. It's mindless, crash-bang-wallop chaos. You somehow distance yourself from the action on display. It never grabs you by the throat the way James Cameron's action sequences did.One thing that is different about T3 is the fact that the war against the machines is about to begin, hence the title. There are a few nifty scenes involving the first wave of Skynet's robotic legions, including robots that stalk the corridors while searching out their prey. And I did like the way the film doesn't wimp out on us. The war begins in earnest, even if it never shows the devastation of our world being destroyed, making way for the terror that's to come.But still, Terminator 3 never really flies. There are nice ideas here and there, like the T-X trying to deprogram the reprogrammed Terminator, but T3 is very underwhelming. James Cameron's absence had more of an effect than I thought it would. When Mostow tries to emulate Cameron, the results are just embarrassing. A shame this once great series seems to have run dry. Let's hope the next instalment is an improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You are terminated! (The series? Definitely)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger comes back again as the good guy this time facing an even more powerful opponent, the T-X (Kristanna Loken).John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now an adult and its now the time of the machines beginning to take over. Judgment Day is just a day or two ahead when the movie starts.John Connor's second-in-command and wife, Kate Brewster (Claire Daines), is called into work early morning and meets John Connor (again) because he has stolen pills.Not very long after, the T-X shows up. More than just built to destroy, she is also very seductive and incredibly attractive. She is clever and adapts to her surroundings. It's hard to care about Kate, John or Arnold when Kristanna Loken is on screen.Linda Hamilton and James Cameron are both absent. Sarah has been killed off and Jonathan Mostow (U-571) has taken over directing. Generic writers have taken the writing over. Earl Boen is the only one who has returned aside from Arnold.The action was still great but the story was less interesting than the second film. It seemed they ran out of ideas. The special effects were phenomenal. It took upward ten months for a ten second shot to be captured. The stunts are stunning to watch and the CGI is hard to tell if it's real or fake.After watching behind the scenes you are shocked to find out what was real and what was fake. A few laughs here and there, some cool effects, great stunts, edge-of-your-seat action packed and a super attractive Terminatrix are the reason to not miss this one.Die-hard Terminator fans will be disappointed because it's not as great as part two but will still like it to an extent. Arnold fans, he's still funny and does another great job. But, I think that the series is mainly done. Even if they come out with a fourth part in 2009, I think this is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie suffers from a nostalgia complex (just like the new star wars films). People think about the original two with a warm feeling of nostalgia and are thus in part blinded by the fact that this isn't that much different from them. This has more softening humour than the first two, and the main plot is actually nothing new, but I don't see that as a problem.Terminator 2 is better, and maybe the first one as well, but I don't think this deserves even nearly as much bashing as it has received. It has nice action scenes (even though at least one of them is a bit over-length), and the lovable humour unique to the terminator series is present. It's a great movie well worth the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminates the saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those machines won't give up. After sending a Terminator back in time to murder John Connor's mother in the fist movie, then a T-1000 to kill a teenager John in the sequel, now the time-traveling android assassin is a T-X (Kristanna Loken), targeting twenty-something John (Nick Stahl) and his future wife Kate (Claire Danes). With scarce originality, another android (Schwarzenegger) is sent back by rebels to stop the T-X.T3 lacks the nail-biting tension of the first two movies. Loken, with her supermodel appearance, is utterly wrong for the part, as she tries and fails to mimic Robert Patrick's superb performance as the T-1000. Patrick, with his glacial stare and sinister body language, conveyed a deep sense of menace. Loken comes across as a stunning blonde more likely to induce lust (for her looks) or laughter (for her acting). Seriously, she is bad - her stiff walk, the comical way she tilts her head... it's a vapid, leaden performance. The only clever use of the new female terminator is a brief scene where she looks at a lingerie advertisement and inflates her bust to a bigger size. It took the android only a quick glance to understand how to be more persuasive in our sexist society.Stahl is a better actor than Furlong was in T2, but writing in his scenes with Danes is cringe-inducing. Ahnold is Ahnold.Plot is nonsensical: so, is Judgement Day inevitable or not? The T-X kills Connor's lieutenants, but hey, no big deal, someone else will take their place - it's destiny. But this contradicts the whole point of the previous movies. Sooo... future can be altered, but only in a plot-convenient way? I honestly don't get it, and I suspect the writers didn't either.All would be forgiven if this boasted magnificent action, but director Mostow, who made the decent submarine flick U-571, doesn't deliver anything memorable. Say what you want of James Cameron, but the man knows his set-pieces.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than average but doesn't live up to its name **spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**possible spoilers contained** Terminator 3 was roundly slammed by critics and fans alike, but having waited 12 years for it, I was prepared to enjoy it no matter what, and was actually pleased with the results.It's been 10 years since the events of Terminator 2 and John Connor has managed to avoid any traceable records, living "off the grid." When the new Terminator, a femme fatale played by Kristanna Loken arrives and kills off some of his schoolmates, it's up to JC (get it?) to save humanity, with the help of Good-Guy Terminator Arnie, and Claire Danes as former girlfriend/future wife. Violent Oedipal imagery abounds, when we find out the empty "womb"/tomb of his mother, MIA Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), contains some heavy artillery. The film, which is basically a chase movie like the first two, ends on a down note. Where T-1 and T-2 were hopeful about the fate of humans, the final installment lets us know that we'll all be responsible for our destruction.While not nearly up to the standards of special effects and intelligent narrative set by the first two movies, T-3 was a cut above most bonehead action flicks, and it still manages to make the audience think. It certainly missed both James Cameron and Linda Hamilton (whose ignoble death was not befitting the mother/Amazon we loved from T-2: "There are 206 bones in the human body. That was one."). I'll continue to love the series, because it's compelling and smart without losing the action, and I look forward to the next one. I'll bet Arnie won't be required, since digital imagery has come a long way. We'll see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3: Excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is a very well made movie with amazing action and awesome special effects. It had very big shoes to fill and in my opinion Mostow delivered a good (not great) film. Sure, it could have been much better but it also could have been much worse. The TX is excellent. Kristanna Loken does an impressive job. She's not as scary as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, but she still delivers. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are alright. It's great to see Arnold as the Terminator again! Although he messes up a few lines, it does not hurt the film.The problem i do have with the film is the comedy. Sure, some jokes might be funny, but it's not at the right place in a Terminator film. The movie should have been darker and more serious.One other thing that bugged me was mistake they made about John's age. In T2 John is 10 years old. But at the opening of T3, John says he was 13 during the events of T2. I cant imagine them making a mistake like that. Overall, T3 is a solid entry in the franchise and i highly recommend it to action-fanatics.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Total Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is, quite frankly, a failure.Let us start with the inferior special effects: Given that the film cost 187 million dollars to make, one would expect superior quality special effects, or, at least, high quality. However, it was not delivered.A terminator exists for one purpose: to kill. It is relentless, brutal, and every feature of its design is meant to facilitate more efficient killing. As a special effects artist, one should create imagery that captures this idea... So.. my question is... how exactly will those glowing lights help a terminator kill??? both terminators have an EXCESSIVE amount of glowing, Christmas-tree like features. the T-101 has red and green lights inside its chest, and the T-X is practically a walking blue LED. It reminds one of geeky PC with UV lights rather than a killing machine.we will also note that the T-X comes with tiny a rotary saw!! i mean, come on!! the giant stabbing sword of t-1000 provided a much better visual representation of brutality. Big, sharp, pointy objects looks menacing, blurry round things doesn't, especially when it's about 2 inches in diameter and comes with the sound FX of a dentist's drill.the physics is horrible as well, in the hand-to-hand combat scene, the T-X manage to throw T-101 for 10 meters without moving back an inch. And no, it doesn't make T-X look strong, it makes the entire scene look artificial, like a bad kung-fu movie. There is also a scene where the T-101 pulls open the door of a safe: not only is that physically impossible (if it were a real safe one most most likely pull the entire safe out of the wall) but the scene also fails to convey the message that the terminator is strong. To covey strength visually, one need to establish visually that 1) something is difficult to do and 2) the character does this difficult thing, so he/she is strong. Throughout the film the terminators perform feats of strength way too effortlessly, which takes away the realism. (in comparison, Robert Patrick's hand to hand fight scene in T2 was much much better.There are two more scenes that bugs me visually. One is the scene where T-X sends electric signals to police cars. the computer generated graphics looks like something from the 1980's. the other scene is where cathrine bruster shot T-101 and T-101 spits out the bullet. If i had designed that scene i would have had the bullet tear off a large chunk of T-101's cheek, making a wound that looks like a menacing grin while revealing its metal mandible, or better yet, tear off a piece of T-101's eye.. or, at the very least, show some blood... but nooo.. the T-101, simply catches the bullet with its mouth.. like.. some parlor trick... sigh..Aside from the special effects problem, there are script problem as well.. ill place humor is a huge problem in this movie.T-101 saying "talk to the hand" is just not funny.T-101 wearing star shaped sun-glasses.. not funny either...T-101 saying "excuse me" to T-X: not funny.cathrine bruster punching T-101 in back the same way that most girls punch guys when they are flirting with them: what is this: a romantic comedy? T-X saying "i like your car" "i like your gun"... just plain weird.T-X breast enlargement: serves no purpose. (she was gonna kill the cop anyway, not like there is a NEED for deception and doing things for no apparent purpose destroy the whole image of the Sparthan, cold blooded killing machine.) T-X always walking like she was on a catwalk.. neither funny, nor sexy, nor cool, nor menacing.T-X having a strange curious look before using her remote control ability: just plain weird to see cold blooded killing machine with the look of curiosity! In short.. the film sucks...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst action movies of the decade!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first question in regards to reviewing this movie is 'why'. Why did they decide to continue a story that had been finished? Why did they not get James Cameron to direct? Why, why, why? Obviously the answer is money. They wanted to use a formula which generated big box office, which it did. Unfortunately this movie completely shattered the point of the previous movies, which is very hard to do. Usually when I talk about the terminator series I casually ignore this third installment about which is hard to say anything flattering.First of all following in the footsteps of James Cameron is a hard thing to do. After all Cameron wrote and directed the first two installments in the franchise and did a wonderful job. He created two of the best action movies I have ever seen. In comes Jonathan Mostow who has but a fraction of Cameron's talent. To be fair there isn't a lot Mostow can do with the material he is given. The script seems rushed and casually ignores what made the previous movies so successful. Why the heck wasn't Linda Hamilton brought back. Her character should be treated with more respect than this. Once again the movie never should have left the drawing board.Acting wise the film has taken a huge step down. Schwarzenegger received an enormous pay check to return in this second sequel and you feel the lack of interest from his part. His performance is the least of my concerns regarding the acting, however, and Schwarzenegger gives a decent performance as he still has the stiffness and commanding presence required to be the terminator. Nick Stahl is brought in to play John Connor and while not my primary point of critique he is still frightfully dull. I don't understand why they didn't just let Edward Furlong reprise the role. Claire Danes is equally dull and much of her acting seems forced and unbelievable. Stahl's and Danes' chemistry in the scenes where they bond is pretty stale and lifeless. You don't feel the tension there was between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. My primary point of critique is in the choice of villain. Kristianna Loken's villain, T-X, has none of the menace that T-1000 had or that Arnold had in the first film. It's hard to get too excited in the showdowns between her and the protagonists, sadly.Effects wise the movie has also taken a step down. Obviously the effects are more complex but they have lost their edge. While the effects were impressive they were outmatched this year (2003) by The Matrix sequels and The Return of the King. Terminator has in one stroke been reduced to second fiddle and provides only adequate CGI. One misses the ingenuity of the effects revolving around the T-1000. Once again, what a shame.All in all Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a massive disappointment and the series really deserved more respect than this piece of garbage. One of the worst movies of the year and definitely one of the worst action movies of the decade.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goodness me this film seemed to upset a lot of people who seemed to take it just a little bit too seriously. Seems a very good end to the trilogy (?) to me. The added humour gives it enough of it's own identity to let it stand alone. It's a very good sci-fi action film.Yes - it's not as good or ground-breaking as T1 and T2 but then how could it be? T2 for me was - as I'm sure it was for many others - one of the definitive sci-fi films of the Nineties. And yes there are plot-holes and discrepancies you could drive a crane through but I think you geeky chaps should worry less about those and get out and play with some real people a bit more.Ignore the knockers - enjoy the mayhem, sexy killer-robo-babe and Arnies' one liners and make your own mind up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it was hackneyed, in parts. Yes, there are repetitious plot angles, it is part of the "prophesy" thing. Come on people, it is the third installment, and the whole movie is about re-writing the future! However-I liked the female robot/terminator character. I also liked how all the previous hints and possibilities for the future were brought in. I liked how it was wrapped up. It made sense, and was easy to follow. Arnold has great physical presence in this film, and does a great job. After all, this is not rocket science, it is only pretending to be. It is also not a religion (unless you are Tom Cruise), so lighten up-it's a movie, grab some popcorn and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no winning for Terminator 3: Rise of the MachinesNo James Cameron No Sarah Connor Different John Connor Some plot holes blah, blah, blah. and so it goes on!Some 'fans' of the Terminator franchise would have you believe that T3 is quite possibly the worst sequel ever. Frankly, its not even close to that.Sure, there is a little element of Deja Vu with T3 in comparison to T2. Again, 2 Terminators go back in time, except this time the enemy Terminator, the TX is a female.Lots of people have criticised this as "not cool to see Arnie beat up a girl", without actually using their brains and thinking that the whole point of the enemy Terminators is to blend in, and surely a slim petite female will blend in better than bulky Arnie anyday?"But T3 is only a PG rated movie and T2 was a 15 and T1 was 18."Well folks, times move on. If T1 was released today, I think it would struggle to get a 15 rating. Its not so much that the producers of T3 have scaled everything back, its simply that censoring conditions have changed since The Terminator was first released."But James Cameron, the godfather of Terminator isn't doing it."Don't forget William Wisher folks, he was as much a creator of the Terminator franchise as Cameron was. Sure, Cameron is a good director and is a good visionary, Aliens was good, True Lies was good, but what the hell happened to the ending of The Abyss? It didn't have one! So he's not without his flaws."Different John Connor." Well, as was very well documented, Edward Furlong was given time to get his act together, stop doing drugs, and sort himself out, and he chose not to.But enough of the frivoulous stuff, what of the movie itself?I liked Terminator 3. Sure, it doesn't have quite the same impact as Terminator 2, but T2 was a landmark film in 1991, the special effects were revolutionary in their day (the work on T2 made Jurrassic Park possible 2 years later). The effects in T3 are EASILY the equal of T2, its just you don't appreciate them as much as T2 because T3 merely recreates a lot of them, so the "WOW" factor is lost.Linda Hamilton didn't want to play Sarah Connor again, and to be honest, it didn't make much difference. In the first film she was all needy and pathetic, in the second she was gung-ho and slightly off the wall..... I don't see what she could have done in the third film. And quite a few people bleat that shes one of the most important characters.... well so was Kyle Reese, and that didn't stop Cameron killing him off in the first film!What I like about T3 is it puts an end to the notion of another movie going back in time again! I absolutely LOVED the ending of this film, it was as perfect as you could have hoped for. Did it make the events of T2 pointless that they couldn't avoid Judgment Day? Not really, because it would have screwed up the films time paradox.If Judgment Day didn't happen, then Kyle Reese wouldn't have been born, John Connor would not have been conceived, no Terminators would have been sent into the past, which would mean that T2 could never happen... and people criticise T3 for plot holes?????Solid performances from Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. Arnold's acting is functional (as it should be for a Terminator).I liked seeing the start of Skynets weapons with the Hunter Killers and flying Hunter Killers that you see in flashbacks in T2.The one criticism I would have is that Arnies Terminator is TOO effective against the TX throughout most of the movie. The same criticism could be levelled against the T-1000 in T2, it wasn't until the end when the TX and T-1000 both beat Arnie.Considering Arnies T-850 in T3 admits he is an obsolete model, you might of expected a bit more damage to him before the final showdown.Kristanna Loken is nearly as effective as Robert Patrick was in T2.T3, isn't perfect. Its too similar to T2 in places. T2's biggest draw was that there were two Terminators, and the previous bad Terminator in T1, became the good Terminator in T2. Well, thats pretty much the same in T3, its the same setup as T2.Its not until you get to the end of the movie that things dramatically change, and it really is a brilliant ending. But for die-hard fans of the Terminator franchise, I can forgive them for feeling a little shortchanged by the first hour of the movie, because its almost a retread of T2.What T3 does very nicely is setup the war between humans and Skynet for T4. T4 will be the logical conclusion to the series, T3 is more than just the stop gap to that, and it needed that ending to make T4 possible.I also don't think that Arnies inclusion in T4 will be strictly necessary, as his character relevance will be diminished.I liked T3 a lot. Sure, its not as good as T2 or T1, but thats as much to do with the effects of T2 being so outstanding for their time, and the storyline of T1 being the first and original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines picks up years after the events of Terminator 2. Cyberdyne has been destroyed, the war has been averted, but John Connor is still afraid. He drops off the grid. He drifts from town to town while there is no record of his existence. Now, a new terminator called the T-X is sent back to kill John Connor once and for all, and once again, a T-800 model is sent back to protect him. He finds out the war has only been delayed, and now he must try to find a new way to stop it. This is a fun, action packed film, but it doesn't live up to the first two.James Cameron is no longer the director, which is the film's first problem. Next, the style is too different. A lot of comic relief was put into the script, and at some points it was highly unnecessary. The story in this movie only manages to confuse anybody that was paying attention to the second film. There are too many questions that go unanswered at the end of this movie. What I did like about this movie was that it finally showed us how the war started, and that was really cool to see. I also liked all the references that were made to the second film, like when John Connor asks the terminator if he remembers "hasta la vista, baby." Some of the humorous parts got a good laugh out of me, but it just got to be too much at some parts.The acting was pretty good. Arnold played the role that he created perfectly. Nick Stahl did a very good job taking over for Edward Furlong. Kristanna Loken does well as the new Terminator.Overall, this movie contains a lot of action, humour, and is really fun to watch, but it's a disappointment after the second film.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>chessy lines?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just wondering what the reason for so many Attempts at comedy in this movie. I know there was some comedic moments in t2. However, t3 was filled with so many chessy(funny) lines. This was written by Cameron wasn't it? Did he decide that this was going to be comedy instead of sci/fi action. Or where those lines added behind his back by the diector? I have a feeling that they were suggested by Arnold during the shooting and that Mostow is such a pansy that he didn't stand up and refuse to have those ridiculous lines in the movie. Don't get me wrong I love Arnold but I have seen interviews where he attempts to be funny and they turn out surprisingly similar to the chessy feeling of T3.</fullReview>

But this movie was really bad. It just got worse as it went. The ending was the worst. It was really stupid. Once in a while, an Arnold movie can be good, but this movie is not a 6.8. I would not recommend anyone from renting, buying or seeing this movie unless your IQ is under 65 or you are nine years old. This was not one of Arnold's finer moments in film. The best of the Terminator series was Terminator 2 which is strange because usually the first movie in a series is the best. The basic plot for this movie was: a guy in the future will lead the humans to victory against the robots; the robots of the future send a robot into the past to try and kill the guy and Arnold (a robot for the humans) has to try to protect the guy from that robot.</fullReview>

After the very successful sequel from 1991 all had been said, the world had been saved and this could have been a prime example of how not to spoil a good idea to bring the Terminator back once.Anyway, the damage is done!</fullReview>

There must be a suspension of disbelief in a movie . I am ready to accept a robot from the future that can do extraordinary things . I'm fully capable of believing any number of things .

Old catchphrases are recycled as well - "SHE'LL be back!" Arnie observes, having blows the latest anti-terminator terminator through a wall and down an air vent While the pure shock value of seeing a terminator cut its own flesh away is now totally lost, (remember a cinema full of people going "Ew!!" when Arnie cut one of his eyes out in the original Terminator movie?) there are still serious moments, as when a woman motorist sees a naked woman (the latest terminator - remember everyone seems to come from the future naked) walking in the street - clearly the motorist has an empathetic moment of what the hell has been done to that poor woman?

		<shortDescription>Good, but not good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a good, entertaining film for fans of the previous two Terminator films, but it doesn't make enough of an effort, so ends the series on an anticlimactic note. For example, the new Terminator of the second film was a dramatic improvement over the Terminator of the first, while the villain machine of T3 is the same as the previous one with the exception of being a female machine that accessorizes.The adult John Connor has less juevos than even Claire Danes' character, who surprisingly impresses in this film as she does in all her work. I didn't expect her to do well in an action film and she demonstrated herself to be capable of some of the moxie of a Uma Thurman or Angelina Jolie. I hope she makes more action films. Unfortunately, in this film the action sequences make no attempt to go beyond anything accomplished in the previous two films. There is one exceptional car chase scene that rivals the freeway chase scene of the Matrix trilogy, but this expected device is the film's highlight.The film departs philosophically from the previous two: human victories were previously believed to create an open ended future. This film, in contrast, ends on a fatalist note; the future is determined and our only responsibility is to survive. For this reason this is possibly the last film in the series; all that is left is to depict the human/machine war after Judgment Day or the future they build after beating the machines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sequel of the Terminator franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My next comment will get all James Cameron fans angry, but then again that is entirely their problem. I liked T3 better than T2.Sure, there are plot holes in T3 where you could drive a truck through, in fact I think they do in couple of occasions, but the bottom line is, that I was entertained more by this film than I was by T2. The main reason is, that I've never been found of Edward Furlong in the role of John Connor. I thought he was a bit annoying character in T2. In T3 John (Nick Stahl) is still a bit whiny, but he wasn't as annoying.Linda Hamilton didn't return, which was a bit shame, but luckily the movie works without her. Claire Danes substitutes as a female hero, Kate Brewster, who resembles Hamiltons original role from T1 as a woman who doesn't first believe, but soon gets the situation.Arnold is back of course, as a protector as in the T2, but now he has more attitude and his role is actually a lot better than it was in T2, at least I liked him more as a "don't mess with me" kind of a robot.Kristianna Loken is more modified liquid circuit Lisa, who this time is able to generate weapons out of her limbs, as in energy guns, flame thrower and such.T3 is nonstop action from the beginning to the end. The pseudo philosophical aspects of two previous Cameron films have been dropped almost completely and the action scenes have grown bigger and more showing. There are couple of hilarious action scenes as well and Arnold's Terminator is a bit more comical, but not too much.As said, the movie has a couple of scenes which could have used more plot, but overall pros win over the cons. The movie is entertaining if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 - the machines do rise, but the movie lets down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Responsible for James Cameron's career boost, back in 1984, was the dark action-meets-horror "The Terminator". More than another thriller, this was a mark on the history of cinema, not only for its special effects and action sequences, but for its innovator story and plot. The idea of a terminator that came back from the future to murder the mother of a boy who would become the leader of human resistance in a few decades caught everyone attention. Seven years later, James Cameron did what most directors are unable to: the sequel to "The Terminator", named "Terminator 2: The Judgement Day", surpassed the first film. With the intelligent twist of turning the first film's villain into the second one's hero, along with the introduction of the teenager John Connor and the ultimate villain T-1000, drove this film to the top, making it one of the best action / science-fiction pictures of all times.Because of all of this mystic surrounding the Terminator series, I was ecstatic with the announcement of the release of a sequel to the series, "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines". Eventually, my expectations lowered a little when I knew James Cameron wouldn't be involved in it, although John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris (responsible for David Fincher's underrated "The Game") and Jonathan Mostow would be directing it.Ten years after Terminator 2, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) died of leukemia and John Connor (Edward Fulrong / Nick Stahl) became a recluse, always isolated from society. This introduces the new chapter in the Terminator series. This time, the T-850 Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels back in time to protect not only John Connor, but also a woman whose name is Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes) from another enemy: the terminatrix T-X (Kristanna Loken). But who was this Brewster character and why would the T-850 want to protect her? The answer is simple: she was going to marry John Connor and have children with him. Together, they would lead the human resistance against the machines in a not-so-distant future.Unfortunantely, it's when the existence of the terminators is justified by the authors that the plot reaches mediocrity. The excuse found for the return of the terminators is no other than fatality, the inevitability of destiny. Besides bringing up a lot of philosophical issues, this «plot twist» makes us think that all the efforts of Sarah, John and the T-800 to destroy the Cyberdyne building were completely and utterly useless. And it also makes "destiny" a fact and not an open discussion (like the existence of God, for that matter): Terminators were meant to exist and there's nothing anyone or anything can do to stop it, it's just fate. A poor excuse, in my opinion.The key-character, the T-850 (and not the T-800 as in the previous two films) is also a little disappointing. Why? After becoming a complex and almost touching character in Terminator 2, with a great chemistry between him and John Connor, the Terminator is little more than a machine and there's not the least sign of a relation between him John. This fits the plot created for this film, but it takes out something that was fundamental for the success of "Judgement Day". The only point where the authors tried to add a little humanity to the machine was when he had to face the duel between what he was programmed to do and what he «should» to: the results was terrible. At the same time, it's undeniable that Schwarzenegger's performance did put a lot of charisma into the character and it was very good to see him playing the Terminator once more. It's very hard to believe that Arnold is in his 50's, due to his great physical shape. On the other hand, the terminatrix T-X causes very little impact, despite her great attributes as a killing machine (the arms that become lethal weapons, the ability to connect to the internet and doing DNA exams in the blink of an eye, etc). It's impossible not to compare Loken's T-X to Richard Patrick's T-1000 and the second one is a clear winner. The T-1000 was a much more menacing character than the T-X and this is probably not just because of the actors, but because of the atmosphere of this film: it seems to be shot in daylight all the time, meaning that it does not have that dark side that were obvious in the other two films and were part of their greatness - the two first Terminators were thrillers and this is absolutely just an action movie.Nevertheless, despite the poor story and plot schemes, Mostow tries to draw the attentions off the plot and on the spectacular action sequences. And this is where the film's strength resides, even though the action reaches its climax early in the film. In conclusion, the third film of the Terminator saga is a close cousin to Terminator 2, since exploits the same theme of the good terminator who travels back in time to protect John Connor (and, this time, Kate Brewster) and the bad terminator who tries to do the opposite. Unfortunately, I have to admit that this was a disappointment, mostly because of its weak story and plot, but also because of the film's atmosphere (not dark at all and doesn't make you sit on the edge of your seat like the first two films did) and the lack of charisma of both John Connor (not because of Stahl's acting, but because of what Connor grows up to be; nevertheless, I would definitely like to see Edward Fulrong playing John Connor once more - after all, it was his character) and T-X. In my opinion, the emotional appeal of the terminator series along with the action sequences rescue the movie from complete failure.</fullReview>

I know it's devoid James Cameron and some feel that this film lacked his vision and leadership. But somehow, I feel that Cameron has lost his ability to tell a story without a $100+ Million dollar budget. I like this story because it relies on and clings to the original premise unlike the second film. To me, T2 was all about eye candy and had very little to do with story. T3 returns to the gritty hard-core reality of a post-nuke world at war against SkyNet and the machines. I get chills at the end. I also love the return of the Love Story element. The first film is a love story as much as it is an action film. THat element was totally lost in T2. Congrats to the producers and all for returning the franchise to its roots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When seeing the trailer the first time I was astonished, it really gave me this wow feeling, and I was looking forward to see the movie. But after seeing the movie I felt betrayed, betrayed form the big Hollywood studio. And again, they showed only the best scenes from the movie. Ohh, no, not the best scenes, only the best key frames from action overloaded scenes.The runtime is too short, not even 2 hours of action was presented to the public. After the 2hour and 22 minutes of Terminator 2 I thought this third part, where the end of the world starts, will be as at least 2 hours long. Because of this lack of time the story is told a bit too fast. One action scene is right after the previous one, there is no time to think about the seen, no time to cross-link the first two parts with this third one. The talks of John Connor, where he explains where he was and what he was/is doing, well the story tellings, is simply flat, dry and monotone. Yeah, I could say it's boring. You get the info you have to know but it seems that there is no feeling behind that, it doesn't give the feeling that John is ?the" man of the future, the one and only. . .The effects, some are realistic, some are not, even Terminator 2 from 1991 has more realistic effects than this one. I'm talking here especially about the cemetery scene where T-X flies on this gravestone. How the stone brakes and the dust this little accident makes is absolutely fake and this fake is visible, even from miles away. The car chaise, it's fine, but hell, did the this scene where all those buildings got demolished really cost 25$ millions.The cemetery scene with Kate, the doc and the police . . . well it's to boring. Kate being at the SWAT truck, talking to the doc, being very excites, under shock, talking nonsense, the doc offers her some chill pill ( something to calm her down ), Kate takes the pill, hold it in her hands, in the other hand some water and starts telling the doc what's up. Then she mentions the name John and some huge, and the doc asks who this John is. Kate says, ?John, John Connor, an old schoolmate" and then the doc goes blank. ?You men John Connor, son of Sarah Connor" ? ?Yes" ? ?And this huge guy, and here comes the description of Arnie, calls himself a Terminator" ? ?Yes, but how do you know that" . . . and then you hear some explosions and machine guns firing. The doc turns around and sees the Terminator . . . doc shows his wondering face and says ?No, not again", takes the pill away from Kate, drinks it . . . takes another pill(s) from drinks them and then runs away. . . Kate runs after him wondering how the doc knows this bullet eating giant and tells Kate the past contacts with this Terminatora and this is where Kate should realize that it's true what John was talking about . . . this small scene, told slowly, and wisely could have made the movie a bit longer and brought some break before the next big block of explosions and fight scenes To the ARMY, well the general and co at this Computer Defense center or whatever it is act like the generals from the movies Under Siege 1 and 2.The scene where T-man is reprogrammed to kill John and John is telling him not to do it, the inner fight that the Terminator has, is simply childish and very predictable. It is somehow the low, not Terminator like.It's also funny how two people in their mid 20's can escape from human killing machines, but the well trained, educated military people are killed within a few seconds. I thought in such high security facilities only the best of the best can be the guards. O.K., a lot of computer programmers, scientists and engineers are working there, but it's simply stupid that they get killed.It seems like Jonathan Mostow used the analogy, the time-line, the art of T2 and tried to copy it to the new is story. Tried to make the same things but really failed.</fullReview>

When I heard the rumors of a T3, I wondered how it could be possible after the way T2 ended. Was there another chip, was there something left at the metal plant, etc. I was curious to see why. So I was understandably shaken when the premise for the whole film was summed up in 1 line. I felt like getting up and walking out at that point. There was no real tension, not much terror and how scary is it to have a supermodel chase around a dude, his future wife and a robot? . I think the franchise should have ended after T2 and this was an obvious attempt for Arnold to get 1 last great payday before going into politics full time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Terminator Movie Ever !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying the fact that the Terminator films are the crowning glory of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career.When I read that part 3 was to hit the theaters soon,I was beside myself with excitement:would this be as good as the previous two ? After I saw it,I had to say:this is the best one of the three! First,Schwarzenegger is in better form than ever.Ten years since the last Terminator movie and who can even notice ?He looks as good,as invincible and what's more,he is more "human ".The script provides him with a number of one-liners that will surely cause a lot of laughs all over the world.Director Jonathan Mostow does a great job,and frankly, I must say that he has surpassed James Cameron .By introducing the " Terminatrix",he has taken the action to a whole new level.Kristanna Loken plays Arnold's ultimate antithesis,and she does a fantastic job.Throughout the film,she maintains the expression of a ruthless,brutal assassin who will never stop until she achieves her objective: to kill John Connor.She looks far more convincing than Robert Patrick did in the previous installment.It is a contributing factor to this film's superiority to the other two of the trilogy.The special effects are incredible:this time, special effects genius Stan Winston has not relied on CGI to get the adrenaline rising,but uses real robots to usher in Judgement Day.The result is a fantastic battle-scene between Arnold and the robots,and you are left thirsting for more. Nick Stahl does his best to look and act like the John Connor as a grown-up,but I don't think he leaves a lasting impression.It is Claire Danes playing Catherine Brewster,Connors' future wife, who takes the cake as far as acting is concerned-what's more,she is the only one except Arnold who fires at the attacking horde of robots,prompting Stahl's remark :"You remind me of my mother !"Danes looks more fit to lead the resistance than Stahl.If there is a fourth installment(and I pray there will be ! ),she should be cast again as Catherine Brewster.I used to think that T2 could never be surpassed,but this film proved me wrong.Outstanding work,Jonathan Mostow !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another of those films that promised the world, but didn't deliver. Granted, its not bad, but it should have been so much better. The story and acting are all generally fine, but what is lacking is the biting violence of the first movie, and to a lesser degree T2. By going for a 12A rating, the team behind this accepted that it would have to be very tame so little kids wouldn't be scared. That is where it goes wrong. This film should have been an 18 without question. The action scenes are quite entertaining, but they never go far enough, and there is a scandalous lack of gore for a film claiming to be from the action genre. T3 summarises what is wrong with so many of today's films, they are antiseptic, pale imitations of their 80s forebears. Had this film been made in say, 1988, I have no doubt that whilst the special effects would have been much worse, the film overall would have been vastly more action packed. Arnie is on top form as the Terminator and the support stars are all fine, but when you look back at T1 and T2 you realise that this is not in the same league. Arnie should also have been in this film more often, that he wasn't detracts from the film. A missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redundant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie, knowing that after T2 the only possibility to make a sequel would be to break with the existing storyline somehow and come up with something as 'Hollywood-plausible' as the trick used to justify "Alien: resurrection". So I expected nothing more than an action movie, probably combining elements from the two previous movies, using more special effects, more spectacular explosions, and contemporarily adding the obligatory woman beating up men. And I was kind of right. The one-liners were there, the spectacular chases, the CGI effects, the explosions, and a female terminator sowing death and destruction and grabbing Arnie in the crotch. *WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW!* I won't go into detail about all the holes in the plot, because this has been done in countless reviews before. Something I haven't read during a sampling of the thousands of reviews, is that at the end, Connor says something like the Terminator has tricked them into the nuclear shelter. This would fit with the dialog right after the chase in the funeral car, when the Terminator at first didn't seem to want to change its objective of leading Connor and Brewster to a safe place in Mexico. Maybe it knew about the Crystal Peak shelter and tricked them into believing they could take out Skynet, but actually lead them to that shelter. However, the only reason why they went there, is that Brewster's dad said the Skynet mainframe is located there. Or maybe I was so confused about all the other plot holes that I got this wrong, whatever. One thing I don't understand about many of the reviews here is that people find it so obvious that this movie ought to have a T4 sequel. Maybe they didn't catch Arnie's last phrase "We'll meet again" which IMHO only refers to the fact that Connor will be killed by this very terminator in the future, as explained during the conversation in the van. Actually I believe this movie has literally blown up every chance for an interesting sequel which still has something in common with the Terminator movies as we know them. The earth is nuked, which only leaves an opportunity to make a movie which is one long battle scene in a post-apocalyptic world, the kind we saw a few of in the first two movies as flash-forwards - or flash-backs if you want. In other words, this would be something like Mad Max but then with dimmed lights and robots, which are so numerous and strong that it'll require loads of 'Hollywood-plausibility' to avoid the only real plausible outcome, being the eradication of humanity. There is no room for anything of the stuff that made the first movies interesting. But apparently, many people want to see robots beating the crap out of humans during two hours until they are all dead. Well, I don't. Not even Cameron would be able to make an interesting movie out of that. Overall, I found this a redundant addition to the two existing excellent movies. It didn't work as a sequel, nor as a tribute, nor as a parody, only as an action movie to pass the time on an otherwise boring evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I had been hoping that James Cameron would be back to repeat his fine work with the 'Terminator' series, I was not disappointed with Jonathan Mostow's version of the latest installation. The only thing I would have added was the start of the future war - in the post-nuclear-attack world, where the human resistance starts to fight the horrifying machines of Skynet.In this latest addition to the Terminator series, the CSM-101 (Schwarznegger) returns again to protect John Connor (Stahl) - now invisible &amp; untraceable - from Skynet's latest assassin droid, the T-X (Loken), a frightening machine with multiple onboard weapons and the ability to control other machines from a distance. Additionally, Skynet has already begun its stealthy takeover of computer systems, in the guise of a computer virus. In a series of frightening and near-lethal encounters, John meets up with his future wife and co-leader in the resistance, Kate Brewster (Danes). With the T-X unable to locate John, she starts by going after future prominent figures in the resistance, one of whom is Kate's dad, an Air Force General in charge of Cyber Research Systems - which includes Skynet. They also discover that it is too late to stop Skynet from starting the horrible nuclear war that is the prelude to the war between Skynet's machines and the human resistance. However, they decide to try to at least protect General Brewster from the T-X, as the Terminator reveals he is an important resistance figure - making him a main target of Skynet's assassin droid. When they reach CRS, they discover that General Brewster's bosses in the Pentagon have lost all control of their military, courtesy of the Skynet virus that has cut them off. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has ordered Kate's dad to uplink Skynet in the hopes of killing the virus. Despite Brewster's reluctance to do so, he complies - and Skynet takes control of ALL the U.S. military, including the nuclear subs and missile silos! The T-X appears and guns down General Brewster, but he escapes along with John &amp; the others to his office, where he warns Kate &amp; John to head to Crystal Peak - supposedly the system core of Skynet. John &amp; Kate escape to the hardened facility and enter, aided by clearance codes carried by Kate's dad. After a narrow escape from the T-X, in which she meets an ugly end, they descend several hundred feet into the mountain to discover it is nothing more than a command center for General Staff and VIPs. The President, Congress, Cabinet and Joint Chiefs never got the warning, however, and John &amp; Kate are alone in the structure. Seconds later, alerts pour in from all over the country, as Skynet launches the USAF's ICBMs against targets in Russia &amp; China. In a frightening end sequence, missile trails criss-cross the sky as Russia &amp; China launch their counterattacks, and all over the world nuclear mushroom clouds erupt. Judgment Day has come - and soon, the war against the machines will begin.Despite the lack of an 'opening' sequence about the future war, it still leaves open great potential for a Terminator 4. The characters of the future war are introduced to us in a way that makes them believable and real. It will be interesting to see how the CSM-101 Terminators figure in the future war - we are given some hint of this in future war sequences that show huge platoons of CSM-101s deploying from Skynet bombers against the human resistance. Bring on Terminator 4!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sarah Conner is dead, and the Nuclear war never happened, they stopped it, didn't they? John Conner is now a recluse living with no possible connection to civilisation, scared of being found again by the Terminator's that he believes will rise again.Unable to find John Conner the machines send back a new Terminator, the T-X (kind of a cross breed of the T-101 and the T-1000, with none of the weaknesses and some serious firepower) this time sky-net is targeting John's Commanders, and Arnie is back back to protect them.The War of the Machines is inevitable, and John's previous attempts to stop it only postponed it, the machines will rise.With some Great Action, and a decent twist to the original plot, T-3 is certainly worthy of the Terminator Title and is a must for the fans of the series.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a low-quality thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T2 was just a snotty family movie, but you must admit it was a high-quality snotty family movie. If somebody wanted to defile everything with a gloomy hopeless secondary concocted thing (and nobody had any doubt that it would be a gloomy hopeless secondary concocted thing), they could at least try and make a high-quality one. And what did we see? We are absolutely lost in time-travel and alternative universes. That's very good. If we were not lost, we would clearly see how stupid all this stuff is. I will kill you in the future, because you will trust me after the story that was in the second film. All right. I'd like to see how he trusted him after he had told him (in the third film) that he would kill him. Or was it in one more alternative universe? Naturally, it was, in that universe all these young people had not been killed. And what will he do without them? Down with them, it's his problem, there's no fate, but he is doomed to save the humanity, so don't be afraid, he will save it! Schwarzenegger. We all know, that all his heroes are in fact one and the same hero, and he has only two ways in this situation: self-parody and self-plagiarism, and while the first is fun, the second is annoying. Now we see that he invited the third way: plagiarizing parody. Who needed it? Not me. It was just another way to make a connection with T2, and it didn't work, because it is a different film in a different era. Then, it is just badly done. Yes, they crashed much more cars, but why the chases in the first two films are as much more thrilling as less cars were broken there? They could just have rolled all those cars off a cliff without shooting it - with the same use, maybe, even with more use, because they would at least have had fun themselves. So many details that don't fit each other, the first two films and the reality, that it would be an even longer post if I tried to recall all of them. I still hope some of them are just a problem of the translation, but the other cannot be. Why such crude work? You probably remember that moment it T2, where a song begins with a new scene, "Bad to the bones" or something like that. What we find in this film? Another song, switched on in a somehow similar frame. But that one was as organic as a fragment of a song in the middle of a movie can be, and this one just strikes eardrums with no sense. All this "primary weapons", broken lavatory pans, fragile flying machines, mysterious blinking stands... It resembles a cheesy shooter video game much more than a film. Maybe, it was their primary target: to make a film easily transforming into a video game. But I am not going to play this game, neither I want to see the film many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T1 was great, T2 a worthy sequel but T3.....? I don't know where to start, is it the non-existing plot, the bad acting or the ignorance of details which I disliked most? There are so many senseless moments that I just name a few of them: There is a scene where the T-X is lying on the roof of a car with her target John Conor sitting inside. As we see in almost every scene the pure strength and power of T-X is incredible, so what should be easier than simply destroying the roof and killing John Connor? But what is she doing? Relaxing on the roof (maybe she wanted to get a tan) and trying to saw the roof. I mean, why not pushing through the roof? A really big flaw in the story: after Skynet has taken over control robots kill all people in the military base and control the entire building. Only John Connor and his future wife survive, find a plane and fly away. Fly away? Where have all the robots gone??? Also it was interesting to learn that coffins and cars are bulletproof by default. And so it goes on and on.... Of course the special effects were good. The best one was definitely to let Arnold look like as if the last 20 years did not happen. He really didn't give the impression to be 50something.Nevertheless I give it a 5 because the action is quite entertaining. Unfortunately there is no single moment where T3 can hold the standard set by its 2 predecessors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this film I read some user reviews because word of mouth was saying this was a weak film. I am a huge Arnold fan and love the Terminator series and think T-2 is a fantastic classic (especially the extended version - Pioneer Special Edition laser disc). This movie does nothing to improve the Terminator series. To the contrary just as Aliens 3 hurt the Alien series T-3 hurts the Terminator series. The biggest flaw is that John Connor in this film is not the John Connor of the past film. Connor was trained almost from infancy to be a soldier ? a killing machine by his mother Sarah. The type of life he lived and the things he experience would have molded who he was forever. This John Connor is a wimp ? badly directed and badly acted, if you can call it acting. Did the director of this film watch T-2? 'You remind me of my Mother,' a cowering John says to his future wife after she saves his ass. A veterinarian that acts more like a trained soldier than John; she takes control of the action, snatching up machine guns and fighting off the machines while John covers his head. Like Aliens 3 the story line of T-3, what story there is, stinks. The new female terminator ? well big deal, nothing new here ? zero edge to this boring character. At no time during this film did I feel that any of the main characters were in any real danger. For me the Terminator series ends with T-2 just as Aliens ended with Aliens 2. I hear that there is a hope to keep the series going based on the new female terminator. Good luck for me this series is terminated. I'm not joining in on the phony reviews just because I wanted this movie to be great and because I like Arnold. I tired of long boring chase scenes used as filler for weak stories. While T-2 had ground breaking special effect, T-3 offers nothing special at all. This is a 0ne star waste of time and didn't deserve a 44 million opener.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets put it this way : T1 was a major hit, new, original, well acted even. T2 , breaking the law of bad sequels, was even better. Pioneer in FX for that time, arnold coming back as the good guy was a very clever idea. T3 .... man, just flunk ... it's like seeing a prototype of T2. John connor in his 20's version is pathetic ... he cant lead a bunch ofkids to kinder, let alone humanity. I mean, if john-the-kid from T2 would meet with john of T3, he would kick his butt!!! Arnold does the same stuff he did in T2, just with irony. Same scenes, same jokes, old stuff ... and i'm a terminator fan, so i laughed, but honestly ... The Terminatrix, being a hot woman,is a good innovation ... the FX they put on her are fancy,not cutting edge as in T2, but they'll do (i mean the 2 or 3 special effects).She doesn't have to do much, I wouldn't call it even acting, you can write all her lines in this movie in a paper as small as a bus ticket. But that's OK, i didn't expect more. She did her job on this movie, but I somehow wished Peta Wilson form Nikita had been given the role.Kate Brewster, john's future wife, is just average...the poor girl got some amazingly stupid lines from the script writer , like "You cant kidnap me, you see my ring, I have a fiancée" haha that made me laugh ...The ending of the movie, on the other hand, surprised me. One point up for that.To sum it up, a 'viewable 'flick ONLY if u r a Terminator fan</fullReview>

Frozen in T2, magnet in T3 These are all scenes ripped from T2!!! They just changed the foe into a woman instead of Robert Patrick and added the military angle, that's it! THEY COULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH MORE COOLNESS! Welcome to Hollywood, land of stealing stuff from others creativity. PLUS, he finds the keys in the visor and when he shoots at the cops his display says "zero casualties" - if he's a different T101 model then how does he remember that stuff from T2?

		<fullReview>I must be the only person in the world who believes T3 is better than the first two movies, but I stand by my opinion. The first two Terminator movies were great and definitely action classics, and the 3rd one really takes the ball and gives this series a slam dunk. The action is crisp and well filmed. The dialogue is sensible, both serious and half-mocking. Lastly, the storyline did not disappoint, as often is the case in sequels of this scale (ex. the Matrix movies). The casting in this movie at first threw me off, but eventually the new characters fit into the timeline. The female terminator is also another reason to check out T3 many times. All in all, T3 is a benchmark for 21st century action movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very pathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heart that T3 is coming out in Theaters, I was thrilled. I loved the first 2 films and was anxious to see the sequel. I am so glad that I never found the time to watch this movie in the movie theater. I rented it on DVD and what I found was a very average movie by today's standards. Similar action scenes were done before, and the soul of each character was missing. My biggest complain is how pathetic they made John Connor. Correct me if I am wrong, but wouldn't you think that a kid from Terminator 2 would turn out like he did in T3? Not for a minute. Brave 13 year old John Connor was now a 22 year old wimp. Give me a break, what happened? I am to believe that he would lead the army of people to victory against robots in the future? Come on, be serious. The chemistry between Terminator and John was non existent. There was no chemistry even between John and his wife to be. All this was a compilation of action scenes. I must admit that there was plenty of action and very good special effects. This movie was not directed by James Cameron, and it shows. Sequels generally don't work. Terminator 2, however, was better than Terminator, but Terminator 3, in my opinion, is not even close to being on the same level as Terminator. I never thought to regard Lethal Weapon 4 or Bad Boys 2 a better film than T3. I expected way more from this movie and was very disappointed to see Arnold beaten in one scene at the end. The ending was cut abruptly, probably because they want to make the next Terminator movie. I bet they won't even use Arnold next time. It'll probably be something like 'Starship Troopers', except with robots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a rare occurrence. It's a third entry to a universally revered and critically acclaimed blockbuster action film series. And yet, it's far more taut and far less ambitious than its prequels. Too many big-budget sequels try to outdo the masterpiece(s) that preceded them by being bigger, badder, longer. In the end, such sequels often underwhelm or fail. Star Wars, the Matrix, the list continues (Lord of the Rings is an exception; ALL THREE films comprising the series are huge and ambitious).Terminator 2: Judgment Day was a huge, ambitious, ground-breaking sequel to a small, well done, highly-successful production. But in its ambition and scale it succeeded brilliantly, making probably the greatest action film of all time.T3 doesn't try to be another T2. Its running time is about 90 minutes (compare that with 2.5 hours for the previous entry). Much of the cast is gone, and James Cameron is replaced by some outside screenwriters and Jonathan Mostow directing. Thoughtful ruminations on the nature of man are cut down to some intense, less sweeping in scope, much more personal conversations. The action is almost non-stop, and the sense of urgency is there in every single frame. The result is quite a sight to behold, for any action fan. It's as if the makers of T3 decided to take what made T2 so unusual and throw it away, somehow making this fact a strength. T2 was a great film, but it could be slow in parts (especially the director's cut) and was tough to digest. T3 isn't a great film, but it is excellent, nonetheless, and the pacing is its greatest strength.T3 is set "today." John Connor (now played by Nick Stahl) is in his early 20s, and the date that was to be Judgment Day (nuclear World War III) has passed. His mother is now dead from natural causes, but to her dying day she knew that the machines must not get to her son. The usual time-travel paradox rears its ugly head here, but we'll ignore that. John, who never wanted to be savior of mankind, nevertheless "lives off the grid" so that there is no computerized way to get to him.Ostensibly, there is no Judgment Day, there is no SkyNet, and there should be no machine menace. And yet, a female-looking terminator (the T-X) is sent through time. She starts methodically clipping teenagers (for what reason, we don't know).The trusty T800 (Arnold, again) also reappears. Clearly he's there to protect John, but his other motives aren't quite known. In any case, soon John Connor, T800, and a seemingly random female veterinarian (Claire Danes) are on the run from from T-X, the law, and who knows what else.I don't want to give away any more of the strong plot, which is revealed primarily through terse conversations with the good terminator. I'll just say that the plot is well done -- especially considering the hole the T2 ending put the writers into -- and the ending is outstanding.The plot's fine, but it's the pacing and action that are the true strength of the film. You see (this isn't much of a spoiler, since it was all over the trailers), Judgment Day is *today*. That means our friends have 2-3 hours to do something about it, or else.... The action starts immediately and doesn't really stop. (Case in point: Watch for the VERY FIRST TIME T800 and T-X meet in a scene. The directness of the T800's approach is quite amusing.) There are multiple car chases and many fights. In particular, one of each stands out. First, there's a scene where a mobile crane, with T800 on top, is driven THROUGH several city blocks. It's really something to behold. That is, it's impressive until the finishing stunt, which is simply staggering (even if it could, in principle, be CGI). The other standout action sequence is the T800-T-X hand-to-hand combat scene. You'll see T-X (an attractive, slender female) throw T800 (a hulking body-builder) through several walls in ONE throw. Then you'll see said bodybuilder break a urinal on said model's head. Of course, it wouldn't be a Terminator movie without a SWAT team trying to stop Arnold with bullets, which is always fun due to its futility.The actionless moments, while few, carry plenty of dramatic weight. John is a reluctant hero, played to perfection by Stahl. Danes is amusing as an action heroine, but her good moments are while she's still just a vet. Arnold is perfect as the Terminator -- in fact, better than ever (and, while he's got a few lines on his face, he's perfectly buff, just like in 1992). He delivers his lines, whether serious or humorous (and there is lot of, perhaps too much, humor) in a perfect dead-pan style. The script, thankfully, doesn't give him anything sentimental (human) to say (correcting one of T2's greatest weaknesses), so he doesn't struggle at any point. The emotional connection between John (or whoever) and T800 is never really explored in depth, avoiding that aspect of the previous film (again, a good move).The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that get high scores) needs their head examined. I give it another point because what it does attempt to do it accomplishes so easily and perfectly. (For reference, I gave T2 a ten.) Any true weakness it has is simply that it's just an action movie, and that's it. It's hard to say anything bad (other than nitpicks) about the film itself.P.S. Some of the later comments on this movie really leave me speechless. You'll get no argument from me: T3 is certainly not T2. But it's not trying to be T2. I know, you don't care what it's trying to be, you just want to be entertained. Well, that's what the film delivers. Any serious comparison (where one wishes T3 was more like T2) to the 2nd Cameron opus is misguided, and only serves to confuse oneself. I wish I could recommend you not to watch T2 before watching this film, to give you a clean slate. But I cannot, since T3 clearly assumes knowledge of both of its two prequels, at least plotwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to know how John Connor and gang got into the Skynet base without clearance? I mean, a military installation that important would be surrounded by hundreds of soldiers. Where were they when Skynet took over? Everybody is getting killed and there are no soldiers anywhere to be found. No security whatsoever.Then, why did Connor leave the base? That's where Skynet is based and they could have just blown up all the mainframes and put a stop to Skynet.I don't even get how Connor gets killed in the future. Does anybody actually understand the circumstances surrounding his death? It was not properly explained.None of this makes sense. It was a poorly made movie and as Cameron said, Terminator is a movie of the 90's. We've seen it all before and if they were going to make a sequel, they should have made one that made sense.We have all been waiting to see a war between the humans and the machines so why didn't they film the next film in the series back to back so people could actually see what we've been dreaming of seeing, not this nonsense.As much as I did not like this film, I do recommend it to fans of the saga just so they can get another dose of the saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have come across quite a few people who disliked this movie. Their reasons are numerous: plot holes, it destroys the continuity, etc. I could go on and on but I will not do that here.I think the biggest problem that most people had going into this film was that they were expecting it to be something that it wasn't. They were expecting this movie to be another Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This movie, I believe, was never meant to be that. It did have likenesses to the other movies such as action sequences, time travel, etc. However, this movie needs to be judged on its' own merits and not that of the two movies preceding it, to do this is about as intelligent as judging a child against the performance of his/her siblings.I think that all parties involved in the making of this film did an excellent job in making a film that held up rather well. A good job was done of creating something that added to the Terminator storyline but still was original enough to be a good movie in its own right. Some familiar concepts in the Terminator Universe were taken and expanded on or better defined. It seems that most of the problems that I have heard from others who have viewed the film have come from their own preconceived ideas about what certain aspects of the film or Terminator Universe should be and not from the film itself.Therefore my recommendation about this movie is to simply take the film for what it is, entertainment. This is a good phrase to sum up what I think. As entertainment this movie holds up rather well. Take it for what it is and enjoy it. Don't beat your brain out trying to understand it because it is only a movie. Overall I think this was a good movie 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destruction of a franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are really no words to explains this pathetic waste of a movie. Without James Cameron and Linda Hamilton on board for this latest installment you had to assume that this movie wasn't going to be as good. Don't get me wrong I am probably one of the biggest Terminator fans out there. I followed the storyline from T1 and used that to understand T2 which made for a very good plot. However, T3 comes along, and you can't hope but to think that Director Johnathon Mostow had NO concept of this film and forget the essence of the Terminator Franchise (I.E. Arnold in T3 mentioning his model number as T-101 when in actuality it's T-800 Model 101) I mean whoever wrote this film obviously didn't pay much attention to the other two films. AND the complete abandonment (sought of) of the Main title theme and replaced with some crappy generic music...Mr. Cameron i think you should have thought twice about allowing some other director continue to tell your story...and very horrible at that. ~AnT~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Cameron, Arnie being a tad older and the fact it was twelve years since T2, while I was looking forward to Terminator 3, I was also a bit of wary, but I shouldn't have been. Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines is fantastic, a spectacularly entertaining blockbuster ride that continues the story with respect, great action, a knowing sense of humor and with a seriousness that doesn't drag the film down. Mostow may have seemed like an unusual choice to direct (someone more along the lines of John McTiernan or Ridley Scott would have more accommodating I would have thought), but he does justice to the first two, continuing the saga of John Connor in a way that more than respects the fineness of the first two films.Essentially the film is a mixture of the first two installments, more so the second one, in the execution of the action sequences (huge chase scene, cyborgs beating each other to a pulp), but like the first one, Mostow favors a more pessimistic tone to the film, giving the film a sense of approaching darkness, especially in the final minutes that is both shocking, touching and moving, in much the same way as Cameron did in the first Terminator film. Mostow does not just put Connor in danger again, have him stop judgment day again and have him live happily ever after again. No, he layers the film with twists and turns such as the fact that the machines' strike on humans was merely delayed and that Connor is now dead in the future, that it his future wife, Katherine (played by Claire Danes) who has sent the T-800 back to save John. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong and he is a good replacement, perfectly playing the part with a brooding intensity. Danes is charming and if there is a fourth film I hope she will be in it. Kristanna Loken is great at the T-X. Playing the part with a cold blooded humor that is fantastic to watch and lastly there's Arnie. Let's just say it's like watching someone ride a bike after having not done so for many years. He clearly hasn't forgotten (talk to the hand is right).All in all Terminator 3 is terrific. A surprising joy from start to finish, one hopes that a forth film will be left alone because as it stands this is a perfect little trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all of you who are interested in renting out this movie, I recommend you do it with the lowest expectations.Here are some spoilers: 1) it's an exact copy of #1/#2 I mean, they even use the SAME EXACT PHRASES to try and get you nostalgic for the first 2 movies (which were awesome)2) The plan/strategy is not cohesive/inconsistencies in plot: First they are going to protect the other members of the resistance, then they don't and they let them die. Other problems: Why not send back terminators to just search for John Connors--even if they don't know where he is now? And why is this version of this terminator (terminatrix) is so stupid (speeding on highways, etc.)? And why not go back to an earlier date (again) to get John Connors?There are a lot more spoilers, but I don't want to take away all the fun...Seriously, do yourself a favor and just wait until there is no other movie you want to see before wasting your time here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pathetic attempt to cash in on the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a pathetic attempt to make a quick buck! The fight sequences, and probably Arnold's nude arrival, were mostly computer generated images(CGI). This movie definitely lacks the Cameron touch; it is overproduced, overworked, and has way too much action which still doesn't look genuine or complete. The crane chase is ridiculous; it appears that all cars have a sophisticated "wire" system like the Boeing 777. The fight sequences between the terminators are very silly, Arnold's terminator is 100 times stronger in this film, he can pummel a car to the ground without popping his skin or even scraping his leather jacket! At least Cameron made us believe that the T-800 is made out of steel servos and joints, but this time with all the CGI he's really flexible and agile. In scenes without CGI Arnold barely moves and looks like he has arthritis. With all that silly action and a dumb script the movie is very dull and tiring. As for Arnold, this should be his last action movie. He just cannot carry on such a film anymore, he is getting too old for this kind of work. I admire the man for his bodybuilding career and his 1980's action movies, but now he is only a nostalgic glimpse of a great action hero! Well, they could've done worse! They could've hired Rob Cohen to direct and cast some pro wrestler or Vin Diesel for the lead. I give it a generous 3 out of 10 stars, but only for Arnold's sake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited in pure excitement to see this movie.I was a fool.Where is James Cameron?! He KNEW what to do with this movie!I was about the most disappointed creature on the planet when I left the theater after seeing this.Comparison. I OWN Killer Klowns from Outer Space. I do NOT own T3.Nuff said? No?It is the epitome of puerile. It is under-dramatized, the script is nothing more than cliché after cliché and the focus of the actor seems to be somewhere in the distance, rather than on the situations to which they are supposed to be subjected.The "Terminatrix" was a cool idea, and she pulled it off with a bit of panache and talent. But the effects and function of the T-1000 (Played excellently by Robert Patrick in T2-Judgment Day), were far superior, as was the story line and the direction of the cast.It's amazing to me to sit in a theater after shelling out a load of money to see a star-studded cast walking around seemingly without any sense of purpose or direction.It was a sorry, slip-shod excuse for a sequel to the first two movies, which were excellently done and extremely well made, well written and directed by a Master; James Cameron.On the lighter side; however, the rumor going around the web concerning Mr. Schwarzenegger's having paid out of his own pocket to film the crane scene is a nice thought. I wonder if it's true? Does anyone know?And, I am looking forward with (only a small degree now of...) hope for the future run of War of the Machines movies which are now made possible by the storyline.I can only hope someone comes to their senses and brings back James Cameron to do them. And maybe they won't start the War of the Machines without Schwarzenegger.Let's all hope. Shall we?It rates a 3.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsT3 is a belated prequel to the 1991 sequel,also starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.Returning to the role that set him on the road to international superstardom,Arnie here reprises his role as the machovelian Terminator.It's hard to say whether or not the first two films director,James Cameron,had it in mind to make this third instalment,or whether this is yet another idea for a movie thought up by unimaginative Hollywood execs unable to come up with original ideas and so just resorting to resurrecting long dormant franchises (although the first sequel did come seven years after the original).But all the same,he isn't and in his place,we have Breakdown helmer Johnathon Mostow.Whether or not this is because Cameron was dissatisfied with the outcome of the script is unknown,but Mostow is a competent enough director as his past efforts have shown.One thing his film is lacking,though, that was dominating Cameron's first two and pretty much made them indistinguishable,is the dark feel that set the scene,in it's place a more lively,jolty feel that will either make or break the film for you.Although,the film's plot just seems like a rehash of the last one with a few things thrown in for window dressing.It's also got to contend with underwhelming set pieces,lifeless humour and rather unappealing dialogue.There are some clever ideas here and there (which are never explored to their full potential though) and there is the gorgeous Kristanna Lokken to add eye candy to the proceedings (she can come and terminate me any day).But overall it has to be described as a rather pointless experience that's box office performance will probably warrant a follow up but which certainly doesn't get your appetite wetted for it's arrival.**</fullReview>

I kept my eyes on the screen at all times.There is a ton of action, and a few very funny moments, but really, it doesn't take anything away from the very emotional and powerful story. This film is great.A few people seem to think that this film isn't as good as the others...I totally disagree. Give this film a few years, and it will become a classic, like the previous movies. T-2 took years to become a classic. Many people thought at first that it ruined the saga because it was the first time you saw the Terminator as a "babysitter"...However, as the years went by, it became in many people's minds a classic. Give T-3 a few years, and it will become a classic too. It's an excellent film with strong messages and a strong story.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy to the Terminator franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been following Terminator 3's progress since day one. And the day came when I finaly saw it. With out a doubt a masterpiece. But it took more then one viewing to see Mostow's vision.Too much these days people need them to explain a story by words, and dialouge, like your mother telling you a bedtime story. T3 is one of those deeper movies that once you look past the action there are some deep thoughts, and morality issues it talks about. I love where they took the story, and the character's especially John.Thoguh I am mad to know as a huge fan I followed T3 from day one, watched every interview/set report ect. There was about 40 mintues cut from the movie. Including:-10 Minute Future War Sequence.-An Alternate Opening Credits with the T3 song from soundtrack.-From some people/the book there was a little more of the stripper joint, and the T-850 did more dammage to the bouncer.-A few more scenes like more of the T-850 grabbing his shotgun after running over the T-X.-The T-X killing Liz Anderson a 10 year old girl.-T-X and more of her and the cop like her saying the exact speed she was going.-The T-X going to Bill Anderson's house, and breaking in.-More of the champion crane sequence you can tell easily by the editing.-Way more talk in the Tundra with John and the T-850 talking about Judgment Day and the upgrades the T-850 has.-A little more of the store scene, the T-850 grabs the glasses.-More of John talking in the back of the Tundra with Kate.-Flashbacks of young John and Kate, we could tell from IMDB's young John in the credits early on.-From old set reports and eye witnesses I think the T-850 disabled or maybe even killed cops originaly in the graveyard shoot out because they talked about how he did kill people in that scene long ago.-More of the Graveyard chase, the T-X right behind them and John is shooting at her.-Way more of a slow scene what it was we may never know from the book either the author of the book said he had to change the versions so many times. That is why it was delayed from June to late July because WB changed it so much. But I think there was much more of a slow desert T2 kind of scene between John and Kate and the Terminator. Just more talking.-So so so much more of the CRS Labs. Showing how the Terminator's survived and Skynet. And all of the early prototypes being made including the 101 from the real human Arnold Sgt. Candy.-Shows how the T-X gets to the CRS labs with the chopper and gets in.-How Kate/John/T-850 get into CRS, she calls him Uncle Tom. The T-850 shoots some guards in the knee caps.-More of the T-850 talking to General Brewster about the line he said 'I was made here.'-Extened Bathroom sequence where they accually go through the floor.-You can tell by editing and the book that originaly they had Kate/John fight a T-1 as well, or at least run from it. But they cut it out.-Shows from pictures that we see the T-X get out of the particle accelerator and she sees the disabled T-850 standing there and she jumps in the chopper. As she saw John/Kate take off.-Now this scene I gathered from set reports and old talks. I think originaly the T-850 came on line and walked across the air strip with the T-1's shooiting everyone and he is in the midst of it all walking to the big chopper. -Way more of the accual 'Rise of the machines' more of the T-1's killing everyone.-Alternate End fight. From set reports and interviews with Stan/Arnold and Larisis or what ever said the same thing I heard. That there was originaly a huge tunnel chase where the T-X in full endo form ran after the T-850/John and Kate. And it was more of a epic battle between the two. Very expensive but cut sadly enough.These were things we either got from set reports ect.There was an alternate end fight, it will be in the DVD/Game it self.Though it stinks that these cuts were made the movie was still worthy of the franchise. James Cameron thought so, he loved the movie. And we all know James does not just say things to be nice.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines 9.6/10Highs: Great story, depth, and some serious issues talked about. Great acting and dialouge and ending.Lows: Too much cut, not enough of everything. Lots of the detailed story scenes were cut.Bottom Line: A great film on every level. Not as good as Terminator 2 but I doubt any movie will ever accomplish that. That is a hard feat. But Terminator 3 is one of the best movies I've seen in years, and so worth the long wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rise of the Mostow/ Extremely brave piece of storytelling. (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what I was expecting with this installment of the popular Terminator franchise. I really enjoyed Mostow's previous films 'Breakdown' and 'U-571'. But it was not the look or the direction of the film that worried me but the story. The early premise of the film seemed to be an exact replica of T-2 but less Linda Hamilton an older John Connor with love interest and a sexy, beautiful and more effective killing machine T-X. I imagined that once again Judgement Day was going to happen and once again Connor with protecting Terminator would save the day.But the script with a wicked sense of humour was brave and original, well mostly. I loved the ending and I wasn't expecting it, I thought we were going to get a soapy ending. I was fascinated by the destiny of man and whether they can do anything to stop it even when the characters are clearly told it. It was also leaner, I thought that Cameron in the writing process may have spread out the idea of the Terminator having a split personality over his operating functions.By the way Arnie looked the best he ever has in his leather threads. Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken are extremely sexy in differing ways and I felt Nick Stahl played John Connor very well as a neurotic young man with the burden of the fate of humanity on his shoulders.There was maybe one major goof the two scribes made though, and I don't know if they were just treating the audience as idiots. But in the camper on the way to Robert Brewster the issue comes up that the Termiantor has been sent back not by Connor but by Brewster a future leading General in the Resistance. Why Brewster and not Connor because in 2032 Connor gives the order for the Terminator of Arnie's type to terminate him. Connor says something on the lines of 'who killed me' and the Terminator says 'I did'. Well so far during the film the Terminator has expressed on a number occasions how he has come of an assembly line and has nothing to do with the 'Uncle Bob' model sent back in 1992. The Termiantor in T-3 has no way to get back to the future and he surely knows his fate at the start of the mission and if he has nothing to with 'Uncle Bob' he will have nothing to do with the Termiantor that will do the deed. Arnie later says to Connor 'Thank you' for holding up the automative door and Arnie say 'We will meet again'. But maybe that is understandable because that Terminator though not sent back by Connor probably met him in the future.Will there be another Termiantor film, well 'there is no fate except for what we make it'. So I suppose if everybody gets to the cinema and sees this film as many times as possible the better the chance of T-4. Would I like to see another Termiantor post 'Judgement Day' you better ya. The chances it would be a major turkey increases but if they get the brilliant Mostow and the same scribes it should be alright. But first I am looking forward to the remake of 'Westworld' with the Arnie and the T-3 scribes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wrote a comment earlier on this film and feel compelled to write another. I really love this movie. I can understand the people who say that it isn't as good as T1 or T2 and what have you, but who can honestly say that Arnold has made a better film than T3 since his last collaboration with James Cameron? Seriously, folks... True Lies was released 9 years ago! T3 breaks the string of bad/mediocre Arnold flics.Some people have really gotten onto the screenwriters for T3. News Flash: T3 was as inevitable as is the human race eventually destroying itself. The writers did what they absolutely HAD to do to have the series make sense. T3 did not render the previous time travel philosophies of T1 and T2 irrelevent. T1 said that time was cyclical. T2 said that some things can be changed. T3 said that some things can't. How does T3 conflict with T1 and T2? Simple answer is it doesn't. It simply says that some things no matter how much you want them to, cannot change. Destiny. There may be no fate but what we make, only within the confines of a certain set of rules.In sum, T3 is a great film. But for the comparisons to T1 and T2, I would say it's near flawless. I think that the people who are criticizing this would be best off going back to watching such masterpieces of cinema as the Bridges of Madison County and Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. As Arnold says on the commentary track of Conan the Barbarian, "if you believe that (people who like those movies would like T3) you also believe that there're Richard Simmons Jr's running around!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have nothing bad to say about this film, perhaps except for its music, a bit boring. But ignore this weakness, everything is perfect.T-X is really a dangerous and hot and beautiful killing machine. I am wondering why there are some saying that T-1000 (T2) was more dangerous than T-X. She is ,T-X, is faster.And T-1000 did not have any gun and he could not bend his shape like T-X can.One more thing and is the most dangerous thing about T-X is she can control and give orders to other machines.This is very obvious, even Terminator was under her control to fight against John Corner.So do you guys think this female machine is more dangerous ? In T2, there was only one bad guy (T-1000). In this time, there are lots of killing machines controled by T-X.There are lots of hot actions that worth to see.I am very impressed when the two ultimate machines fighting each other. And when they chasing each other on the roads.And I think the end is very good.It gives us some to think of such as we are killing ourselves by our weapons and machines....Every actor in this film , I think, has completly accomplished their roles.Congratulations Go Cameron, I am waiting for T4. I give this movie 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' has an approach a little different than the first two Terminator-films. 'The Terminator' and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' had some humor but most of all it had great action with beautiful special effects and they were meant seriously. It had some ideas about time traveling that made the movies more interesting. This second sequel does not take itself too seriously. The special effects are there, but the way they play with the time traveling this time is just too much. Fortunately there is some great humor in this one, another sign that you must not take it too seriously.I had a feeling the story didn't matter much, which it did with the first two. Everything was made for some thrilling moments, pretty well done, some great special effects and some nice humor. The new terminator called Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, is nice but the Arnold Schwarzenegger from the first and the Robert Patrick from the second film had something Loken is missing. I didn't like Nick Stahl as well. Edward Furlong was so great in 'T2' that Nick Stahl almost looks bad. The scenes with him and his future wife played by Claire Danes are sometimes a little annoying.May be it sounds like I didn't like the movie very much. That is definitely not true. Because it is a sequel I compare with the other movies from the series and it can't win from those first two movies. But compare it with almost any other sci-fi action movie and this one is better. It is very well made, has suspense and humor and Schwarzenegger is back in the role perfect for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'd like to say that Terminator 3 really is a good movie but it is lacking size T2 had(in aspects of Acting, Violence and Execution). There are SPOILERS following in this text so don't read it in case you haven't seen the flick!It's far better made than T1(no wonder...)and also has a better storyline, etc. but the Terminator-Feeling just didn't come up.Arnie is far too tame. He wasn't as menacing.............. The R-Rating also is a joke. I mean part one was very violent,part 2 toned down the violence(there were short and effective bursts of violence), part 3 only got the R because of the infamous "killing the detective" scene and for the nudity. Arnie was not responsible for any of the movie's violence. At least the could have had him kneecapping some people in this one.....But hey............It's just me (an old arnie fan) who wants the Oak to kick some ass..........I guess so or else the movie would have had a much harder edge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnolds Back!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is fantastic. The best film of the summer and proves that Arnold still looks good in an action film. I'm not going to sit here and give you the plot, you can read that in the other posts. What I will tell you is that some of the people who bashed this movie are wrong.I first heard someone say that Terminator 3 is nothing more than a prequel to the Matrix. I beg to differ. The whole Humans vs Machines in the future came about in the first Terminator, back in 1984. If anything, the Matrix is just a sequel to the Terminator series, going beyond 2029, or 2032.As for the comedic tone, I saw the film 3 times all ready, and each time I have seen it, all the jokes seem to have gotten a great response. As for the Action, I think all in all, people were treated to something more than a few slow motion kung fu scenes. Terminator 3 refuses to go the way most action films have gone. Having a movie directed towards a well choregraphed fighting scene. Granted, Terminator 3 seems to be missing about 20 minutes of film, which is why the story does seem a little rushed, but at this point in the series, we don't need much character development. We know John Connor, we know the Terminators, all we really needed to know was Kate Brewster, and we get all that information in the middle of the film...As for why Arnold doesn't shoot one person while carrying the coffin, all though in the past(or future) Arnold killed John, is it impossible to believe that Kate Brewster while reprogramming the terminator, programmed him not to kill humans.....Just an IDEAAll in all **** out of ****- This film delivers for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh boy, another Terminator!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like everyone else, I had my doubts about this movie. Basically, for the same reasons as everyone else. But damn, this was good.I love the Terminator flicks. I've been a big fan since I was ten. Yeah, my parents weren't too restrictive when it came to the movies I watch. I love action films and I love Arnold. This guy will always be cool to me. I even forgave him for Batman and Robin.This movie was really great. It has a great story, outstanding action and good performances. Hence, it's a Terminator movie. In fact, I don't think I've ever been so impressed by action scenes in some of the more recent movies. Watching that bathroom fight, I started thinking to myself,"You know, I don't care if you are a machine. That had to hurt!" As for the performances, I can't say enough about Arnold. The new character I liked the most was Claire Danes' Kate Brewster. I really felt for her character. Her fear, her grief and her confusion. She really gave a great performance. Nick Stahl was good, even though he looked nothing like the John Connor in the previous film. Kristanna Loken is awesome as the T-X. I didn't think her character would be as ominous as the previous Terminators. I was wrong.If I have any gripes, it's the pacing. This movie just jumped too quickly into the plot and it leaves some questions unanswered. I want to know how Arnold got his shotgun and how he found John and Kate at the beginning. But the ending more than made up for it. It really made me think. In fact, I better turn off my computer now before it's too late! I'll just leave by saying this: They can make as many action movies as they want, but none will ever top the excitement and entertainment of the Terminator series. Bring on T4! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of the first two movies, and when I heard that they were making a third I was very excited. Naturally, before the movie I read different reviews, many which criticized the action sequences in the movie. They compared them to The Matrix and said that the technology did not match up. Well, I would think that anyone that has seen Terminator would know that it is not about "Matrix style" fighting. I thought the action sequences were great and the interaction between the old and new characters was fantastic. I don't know how many times I've sat through a movie, and whether I enjoy it or not, sit there and think...how mich time is left?? At the end of Terminator (which is 110 minutes long), I was couldn't believe I had just spent 2 hours in a theatre. It completly flew by. They left the movie open for one more, hopefully they will take care of that opening. I would advise anyone to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ARNOLD is BACK!!! Hey, we knew he would be...he told us so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film runs close to 2 hours but with the pace of the action and the interesting storyline I found the movie to be over so quickly.You can tell right away that T-3 was directed by someone different than the previous two. There is a different style. This movie has great atmosphere and doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters poke fun at themselves which makes this movie seem very fresh even though it is a 3rd installment.After a long dry spell and some health issues, ARNOLD is BACK!!! He makes his entrance into the movie with a nude scene similar to the opening of the prvious two Terminator's. You'll probably think as I did..."Wow, he looks ripped for 55!!!" He has shrunken from his prime. You don't see much of Arnold's muscle after the first scene. He wears heavy black leather which can make one of those anorexic Tyra Banks model wannabe's look big. Most of Arnolds fight scenes are actually chasing scenes not requiring him to do much physical activity. Sure he is hanging from a crane be dragged through buildings but we all know that those are special effects...and not really him, let alone any other Mr. Universe.Said all this the movie is fresh, very entertaining and is the best of the big action movies so far!!! It does it's job and makes a case for a T-4. One question...if Arnold loves Hummer's so much why is he driving a Toyota Pick-up the whole movie? It would have been much more entertaining to see him ripping around the streets in one of those new Hummer H2's...GM could have brought out a special edition and call it an H3. You saw it in T3 now you can own your very own H3. Come on!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant! Better THAN I Expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watch T3. And I didn't know what to expect from this movie or anything! I believe that it isn't BETTER than T2 but just as good as - BUT TOO SHORT. I think TX was brilliant and the new Terminator was good (darker than the last Terminator etc.) John Conner was ok I suppose yet disappointing not to see Edward reprise his role.The ending, I must say was quiet sad in a dramatic way, considering the EFFORT they put in to save the world was pointless ONLY to realise that they couldn't save anyone...-- BUT!!!!!Now that he knows of these events. I'm sure he can send someone back to prevent SKYNET EVER going online - That would be his mission and he would surely save everyone. Its OPEN for a fourth installment and I must say that I loved TX - Kristanna was AMAZING and SEXY! The terminatrix was sexy. Not often you meet a girl who can make her breats bigger.The Special FX was great. I wasn't sure if the future sequence were all models of CGI - They were good but I didn't like Nicholas playing older John in the future...I like the fact that the Terminator that killed future John protects the past John (that's funny) - It has its humurous moments. The ending IS FANTASTIC from the last 2.Don't expect it to be better than T2. Just sit and enjoy it all - A fantastic sci-fi film. Maybe a classic...dunno. Be entertained - I think most original films have past now. At least it isnt falling like my favourite ALIENS franchise. That needs to be saved.Fatastic. But my favourite is the ending and the TX.9/10 JUST SIT BACK and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to try to do my best to make it sound like I'm not on Arnold's payroll. This was quite a remarkable movie. I liked it better then T2 because I thought the dialog was better in some places. T2 has in inkling of cheesyness in some of the dialog, but nothing that reaches the heights of cheesyness we had to endure with Cameron's Titanic. I also though it had more solid acting, for the most part. Kudos to Arnold for being able to whip himself into shape for this role! Does this man ever age? One thing I wondered about is why they never explained why this cyborg was female. Also, isn't it a step backwards from the robot we saw in the last movie? I thought the liquid metal guy was much more scary. Despite these niggles, it's still a great flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Was Perfect-Ignore ANY NEGATIVE Reviews!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was probably the best movie ever made! Period. Maybe better than Finding Nemo, or The Lord Of The Rings movies. Definitely better than the Matrix movies. It was a 15 out of 10 rating-wise. It had non-stop action for 2 hours. (No boring philosophy discussions for 20 minutes at a time to slow the movie down.) It was hilarious!! Lots of funny one-liners and sight gags, Arnold is getting better as a comedian. The Special Effects were unbelievable! The BEST EVER!!! The best vehicle chase scene in a year filled with movies full of chase scenes!! (The chase scenes in this movie were BETTER than the one in the Matrix 2 Reloaded, better than ones in 2 Fast 2 Furious, The Recruit, or even Cradle 2 The Grave. Or The Bourne Identity from last year.) The newest female terminatrix was the best ever, even Arnold (an emotionless robot) seemed to fear her, because she was undefeatable it seemed. (You'll have to see the movie to find out if she was ever defeated!!). The movie had lots of scary parts where we think the good guys will die, and the evil bitchy terminatrix will destroy everyone. (I loved how Arnold converted their car into a convertible topless car.)So there you have it: Non-stop action, greatest FX ever, greatest vehicles chase scenes ever, funniest action film of all time, Arnold in his finest film role ever, perfect script, scary, EXCITING, a SURPRISE ENDING!!, great evil parts, and the ending was not totally happy, but it was sort of a downer, but still there was hope (for the world, and for another sequel too!) The most PERFECT movie ever made. But after watching this movie I am afraid of the internet!!!I could not think of any way this movie could have been improved, EXCEPT if it had free admission!! I thought the most hilarious line was Arnold's "Talk to the hand!" You'll have to see the movie to understand why this line IS SO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls short of the first two in intelligence, but it's excellent summer fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't quite reach the levels of the first two installments, and, indeed, it often seems like little more than a quick cashing in on those films, but Terminator 3, for everything it's not, proves to be one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters in recent memory. The action sequences are a lot of fun; they are unbelievable and preposterous, but that doesn't detract from the visceral entertainment they provide. The Terminator and his enemy, the T-X, get the hell banged out of them as they are hit by numerous vehicles, are thrown about, and live through enormous explosions. The T-X does lack the menace of Arnold Schwarzenegger's original Terminator and the liquid terminator of T2, but, heck, I'm all about sexy terminatrices. Kristanna Loken is not a good actress, but she's sexy. She gets to wear red leather through the whole movie, and she can even increase her bust size on command. This film has a great B-movie quality to it in that way. An element of humor has been added to this film. In a way, I like the seriousness of the first two films. Terminator is a study in narrative economy, and it doesn't take time out to joke. Terminator 2 sticks to its convictions, however paranoid, and that was refreshing for a film of its type. Terminator 3 is a little smarmy with its humor, but, for the most part, its jokes succeeded in making me laugh. I love how he gets his leather jacket in this movie is very funny. I could have done without the endless parodying of Schwarzenegger's famous lines from the first two films, especially `I'll be back,' which has a dozen variations here. As for the acting, not much is required, of course. I'm very upset that Ed Furlong isn't back for this one. What better did he have to do? Nick Stahl is a poor replacement, and this is probably my major complaint with the movie. Clair Danes is a weird creature. I've always been biased against her ever since she starred in My So Called Life. She isn't a particularly good actress, but she's been improving, however slowly. What's especially odd is that she's actually getting more and more gawky as she ages. She was beautiful as a teenager, and, while still very attractive, I'd take the younger version. I suppose it's unfair to critique her looks. Her performance is fine. Nothing special, as with the other actors. The script generally writes itself (it's more or less a constant chase, much like the first movie), but it does have an inspired third act. If you enjoy action movies, jump into a matinee, enjoy the air conditioning, the popcorn, and the explosions. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judgment Day for Arnold's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was simply awful. The first 2 Terminator movies were pieces of scifi history. This contrived piece of crap is nothing more than a standard action flick. Arnold delivered comedic line after comedic line after comedic line. That might not have been so offensive if this was Commando II. However, for a Terminator film, it's insulting to its legacy. The absence of Cameron and Hamilton is noticeable, and Stahl and Daines (who appears to be 35 now) are unconvincing, at best. Arnold attempts to carry the movie with standard action stunts and one liners, but there's no meat to this sandwich, folks. The story is lame, and the characters are worse. The ending isn't a surprise to anyone familiar with the scifi genre, wherein surprise "unhappy endings" abound. If you can, avoid it at all costs. Personally, I hope Arnold doesn't come back for any future cinematic outings. Not until he's gotten a better agent.</fullReview>

Like alot of ppl I was doubful and even scared this film was a huge risk. THANK GOD it turned out to be FANTASTIC...almost equal to a T3 by Cameron. Mostow defintely did make a few errors..like the use of comedy but oh god Terminator 3's action sequences and special effects make the other Terminator movies look obsolete. The story in on par with the second movie. Its a grand experinece..this third movie. You MUST watch it with your family/friends...For me this movie is a bonding of my friends cos the same people I watched the first film with, I watched the second one with and now the third one. Thank You Arnold Schwarzengger. Thank You Warner Bros. Thank You Mostow. You guys promised we would not be disappointed and you were right....TERMINATOR 3 HAS BECOME MY FAVOURITE SCI-FI MOVIE OF ALL TIME. CGI is used sparingly...70 % of the stunts were done by Schwarzenegger himself...hence him getting injured frequently. The actions and effects look real......BEACUSE THEY ARE REAL. The Matrix Reloaded can learn alot from Terminator 3.... I take my hat off to T3 and say "Its been worth every second waiting for this movie the last 12 years"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostow Terminates Cameron!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would it have been better if Cameron made it? Probably. Would you as the viewer have preferred to never get a "Terminator 3" being as Cameron wouldn't do it??? I personally would have preferred to have one, regardless of who made it. Allow me to explain before you interpret my review as good or bad. I just got back from the movie. It was absolutely mind blowing. It had fantastic dialogue and comedy, and the fight scenes took my breath away. It was so epic to see Arnold back again as the Terminator--A site I never thought I would see. Jonathan Mostow did a superb job, as did generally everyone who worked on the flick. The plot is very secretive, and I will not spoil anything on my review... but rest assured there are many things that happen that you just would never have seen coming. The suspense was abundant when John was being chased by the T-X, and especially so when the Terminator 850 attacks him. I had no idea what was going to happen. It tied the two previous movies together nicely with this latest installment. Yes Cameron could have done better, this is his creation--However; Mostow had the guts to take on the supreme challenge of following in his footsteps. And in that Mostow was smart to not try to copy Cameron's style. No one would have said he was better, or even adequate, so why try? Instead he used his own style, which, while different from the previous two movies was still awe inspiring. The tone of the movie was unique, and felt simply like an extremely well done modern action movie. Cameron didn't want to come back, so I have no respect for him (not that I did after "Titanic" anyways) and I hold Jonathan in the highest regard. James Cameron has never been good for directing anything but action anyways. And action indeed he is amazing at, but the scenes in between action sequences in all of his films lack something; some of the dialogue he writes is cheesy (eg: Terminator 2 when the guard outside the mental institute is shot he yells at the Terminator "Ah you shot me you b****rd!" and if you think about it, if you were just shot, would you be mouthing off? It's small things like that in my opinion that drops Cameron's level of skill. He is still one of the greatest directors of our time, but Mostow however handles all elements with expertise. This movie was the best I have seen in years. There was only two things I would change; tone down the amount of comedy that happens at inappropriate times, and have a little more blood--as it is an "R" rating anyway. But overall I walked in not knowing what to expect, but regardless my expectations were high. So high I knew I was in for a letdown... I was not let down. Terminator 3 passed my expectations and then some!Want to see what a one-hundred-seventy-million dollar budget looks like? Go see Rise of the Machines. And no don't wait for video regardless of how much you liked or disliked the previous entries. This is a movie that demands to be viewed on the big screen.My rating: 10/10 regardless of whether I would have changed a thing. I always look at it as "Don't critisize unless you personally could do better." It deserves a ten for the simple fact that you go in there with your expectations as high as mine and walk out with more than you bargained for? That right there deserves a ten. See it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By god they did it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I entered last nights screening of Terminator 3 with utter trepidation. No Linda Hamilton, No James Cameron and no skynet. I wasn't sure how they could ever continue the story when Judgement day was avoided at the end of T2.Thank god though, they did it. By the skin of their teeth they managed to convince. It didn't look good at one point. The movie starts fairly drably. Some tired cliché's are rolled out. People's shock at seeing a naked person walking at night, Arnie kicking some ass, leather, sunglasses (with a neat twist). What hits you straight away is that this movie is a product of 'new' hollywood. The camera is shy of any on screen blood letting and manages to cut away just before the rot sets in. While obviously a concession to the censors, it does also have the knock on effect of watering down the brutality of the terminators. You just don't get that sense of ruthlessness that the movie's predecessors had.Unfortunately, the next emotion you get is one of total dissapointment at the new Terminatrix. Her entrance is cringeworthy. I'm not sure how a wooden Terminator is supposed to be scary, but this new villain is so devoid of personality It has the most detrimental effect to the power of the machines. At this point I thought all was lost but from here on out things only get better.We meet John Conner, and it is a very satisfying introduction. John has been permanently scarred by the events in 1991. And has lived a life of solitude and anonymity to avoid being tracked down by any remnants of skynet or the machines. Fat lot of good it did him as fate puts him right back into the path of destruction. And then the chase begins again. And what a chase it is. John hooks up with a girl from his past by means of a plot contrivance that isn't anywhere near as hard to swallow as it probably should be, and they both do a runner together (reluctantly at first) under the protection of the haggered and obsolete T-100. This iteration of John conner (played by Nick Stahl) is very convincing. He looks like a man who has been alone for most of his life. A man who misses his Mother yet resents her at the same time. And when he explains to Claire Danes's character Kate Brewster what is going on, there is a glint in his eye that suggest that although he fears that it is all beginning again, he is quietly satisfied that he maybe isn't crazy after all, and more than that, that he isn't alone anymore.One of the beautiful things about this movie is that Arnie's age, iconic status as 80's action hero and subsequent fall from grace all add up to make him the perfect Terminator for this movie. Hopelessly outdated by the new bells and whistles terminators, past his prime and unloved, the movie sometimes seems like a metaphor for Arnie himself. Seeing him throwing a CGI monster through walls and numerous panes of glass is almost like a the old guard saying "yes, you have all the fancy gadgets and computer power, but at least we didn't mind getting our hands dirty". &gt;From the moment the chase begins, it doesn't seem to end. It is action all the way. And boy what action. CGI is used sparingly and cleverly. The show off camera trickery is kept to a minimum and it all has a very old school feel. In fact, it all feels very true to the Terminator universe. Pulsing music rather than full blown orchestrations, mass civil destruction, utter disregard for subtlety, the action scenes in this movie easily stand up to those of any of the other movies. And they seem far less contrived to boot. My only criticism would be that they were all that little bit too familiar. Chases on bikes, trucks, helicopters etc. These are all conventions of the Terminator universe that T3 happily borrows, but the movie seems reluctant to invent any of it's own.The one convention it does try to instill, or maybe develop from T2 is morality. There are scenes where the Terminator is forced to make Moral choices and show traces of humanity. While some in the cinema found this all a bit ridiculous, I actually found it fairly touching and a nice addition to the story. Arnie's internal struggle almost seeming more than that of circuitry and processing power.About the story. It's the strongest of the 3. By all rights it should be laughed right out of town, but they actually get away with it. The existence of skynet and the rise of the machines is brilliantly explained using some very clever twists and reflections of current society. In fact, I would like to have seen more of this side of the plot. It is only there to facilitate the action set pieces but it had enough weight to carry the movie into more philosophical territory, rather than just another (albeit very good) chase movie.There are faults with the movie. I kept waiting for an explanation to why exactly the newest Terminator is a woman. Something about it being easy for her to infiltrate the very male dominated society of the future, or mans one weakness being their libido. Anything would have sufficed and the material could have used some philosophising on mans weakness to the opposite sex being it's biggest downfall in the war against the sexless machines. Alas, no such reasoning is given. It is just accepted and john Conner refers to her as 'The Terminatrix' as if she is an old family member. Also, as the arch villain, she just simply is not very menacing. Partly due to woeful acting and a script that is wholly recycled from Robert Patricks turn in T2, but also partly due to the fact that she is actually a bit.rubbish. Why, after the liquid metal killing machine of 1991 do the machines go back to making an exo-skeleton robot? It simply makes no sense. She seems like a model way down the evolutionary chain from the T1000. Even her flamethrower hand is far from intimidating and more reminiscent of the teachers in the B-movie schlockfest 'Class of 1999'.. Also, humour. Arnie has too many one liners. The Terminators are a girly girl and a stand up comedian. How scared do are we supposed to be? We want ruthles, not sexy and cute.Also, if I have to see another secret underground base in a movie I'm gonna shoot someone. Hoolywood take note. Audiences aren't impressed with styrofoam rocks and banks of flashing lights. Setting the final act on a dodgy set with bad Doctor Who style robots will impress noone. Just once I want to see a movie like this end in a big tropical forest or a desert. Anywehere that doesn't have a self destruct sequence and really annoying alarms.Other faults include plot goofs that make certain meetings and situations unbelievable. For example, Claire Danes's character has to go to her place of work at an ungodly hour in the morning, whereby the Terminatrix shows up to execute her. But why would the Terminatrix go there in the middle of the night when her target is not supposed to be there?But all these are small niggles swept under the carpet by the majesty of the denoument. I won't ruin it, but the ending is ballsy, jaw dropping and unexpected. Not only that but it does 100% justice to the integrity of the series. It marks the end of a chapter and it does it in style. They could never make another Terminator movie and the trilogy would go down in history with the Star Wars' and the Die Hard's (as apposed to the Alien's and Jaws'), or they could make another and take it in a whole new direction. It is a truly great ending. Not just satisfying and fitting, but great. The kind of ending people will talk about in 10 years time.I'm very happy to report that the story is what makes this movie work. Which makes a surprising change for a summer blockbuster. I had very little faith in this movie, but it sits proudly alongside the first two to make one of the best action trilogy's in hollywoods pantheon. What a relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, T-3: Rise of the Machines was fun to watch and after finishing it I walked away smiling. The movie is technically brilliant, the CGI makeup of the terminator on the good side is outstanding, the film has outstanding wit and the action is exhilarating. My favorite scene of the entire film is the particularly good action scene where the good terminator is fighting against the nasty T-X near the end of the film in the toilet room and that scene was punchy entertainment. And how nice that a woman leading character is given a chance in this movie to prove to us that women in movies are capable of a few things and don't always need to rely on men leading characters for help. Youhou, go for girls' equal rights oh yeah. However I think that her character and character's role in the story would have been better and bigger if we saw her do more brave and/or responsible thing(s) rather than just one act of bravery and responsibility. Another flaw that T-3: Rise of the Machines has unfortunately fallen prey to is that it lacks the ruthless, scary and sharp feel of the dark future for which the good characters are fighting to prevent, from the previous two films. And I also need to mention the script which is soulless as a piece of storytelling and obvious and doesn't give away anything special like in the previous two films and that can also include the characters and emotion(s). Not only that but the dialogue in the film is simplistic and there aren't enough dialogue lines between the two main characters of the movie: John Connor and Kate Brewster. Still, despite T-3: Rise of the Machines not being a perfect movie it is a worthy addition to the Terminator franchise, there is no doubt about it. Thank you very much Mr. Jonathan Mostow for delivering us exactly the type of thrills we want. Everyone, rise your champaign and give toast to... T-3: Rise of the Machines. My rating for this movie: 7.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed the highly underrated T3 more than T2!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know hardcore T2 fans will call it blasphemy...but IMHO, 2003's TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (T3) is a more ENJOYABLE movie AND a BETTER film than T2! I re-watched T2 to get a handle on it's praise and conclude that it can ONLY be for the incredible special effects. T2 literally comes to a screeching halt for a good hour and that is one tedious hour filled with cheesy dialog, rambling, and pontification. And the plot of T2 is paper thin! Everything that happens feels staged. It is probably the least necessary film of the "trilogy".T3 follows a similar formula to T1 and T2 and again has the "good" Terminator, the T800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger in his last big film role before retiring from acting and going into politics) arrives in early 21st century LA. I'm glad to report that Arnie is SPOT ON in T3! Arnie is as iconic to the 80s and 90s as an action star as Clint Eastwood was to the 60s and 70s. Great to see the legend go out on a high note! Amazing that the past middle-aged man could light up the screen in a great action movie as well as he could 20 years earlier.Ironically, the T800's task this time is not to save John Connor, but to save Katherine "Kate" Brewster (played by Clare Danes in an underrated performance). Kate is John's future wife and a key member of the future rebellion against the machines. Danes in T3 reminds me a lot of Linda Hamilton from T1, a sweet, vulnerable character with an unexplored inner toughness.The evil Terminator this time is the highly advanced TX (played excellently by the incredible-looking Kristanna Loken; that's right, a Terminatrix!). The TX can not only take the form of people she comes in contact with (like T1000 in T2), but also she is equipped with a weapons arsenal that is able to do damage to Arnie's more obsolete T800. I don't know what movie the naysayers of this film were watching, but Loken is out and out terrific in this role and not once did I think she was anything but a machine (albeit a sexy looking one!). And I think that her performance is lot more attributable to Loken over the CGI, whereas a great amount of Robert Patrick's role in T2 was DUE to CGI.Never fear, because John Connor is in this, too! John is roaming LA as a vagrant (taking odd jobs to survive) to conceal his identity from any more Terminators that may come to find him. John's introduction in T3 is rather unsettling as it appears he has lost all hope and may be ready to end it all. John is played superbly by Nick Stahl, in a truly under-appreciated performance. Stahl delivers a very subtle, nuanced performance. I found his actions and reactions to be authentic. Also, Stahl ACTUALLY looks like he could be the product of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton from T1, resembling both actors, which adds to the authenticity of his character; you can actually see parts of both Reese and Sarah from T1 in Stahl's John! Stahl is the glue that holds T3 together for me.The Terminators arrive at the same time as John at Kate's vet clinic and the T800 saves John and Kate from the TX, then a chase ensues. T3 is very similar to T1 in that it's tone is fast-paced and bleak. I'm not putting T3 on the same level as T1! T3 is a bit closer to the modern action movie than the sleeper low budget art film that T1 turned out to be, but it has a lot of heart, just like T1 had.Being a sequel, it borrows situations from T1 and T2, like the obligatory opening scene of Arnie confronting yet another "lowlife" to acquire clothing. But I was amazed at how deftly this, and many other, scenes were handled. The director Jonathan Mostow did a great job of generating wit and humor from cliché situations, mostly due to the efforts of the deadpan Schwarzenegger.T3 seems like less of an "epic" film than T2, which I don't think a bad thing, and is amazingly short for a modern day Hollywood summer movie. The way that Doomsday approaches and the machines take over is a tad spotty for me, but the ending of T3 is one of the better, most provocative ones I've seen in a movie in YEARS and actually serves as a fitting end to the franchise (of course there are more sequels out there!).Last but not least, T3 has some GREAT action scenes! The early big chase scene where the advanced TX operates all those vehicles in unison is a contender for BEST action sequence of the decade! The climactic scenes, including the big showdown between the T800 and the TX, are pulse-poundingly good! The feasibility of T3's action scenes stem from real stunts/effects and limited, spare use of CGI.Again, I think the characters are easy to root for in this. Stahl and Danes give John and Kate a pleasant innocence yet underlying toughness and evolve convincingly during the film and prove to be worthy to hold the mantle of saviors of the human race. And Loken, if a bit sexed up in this film, is quite convincing as a robot. Believe me, this could have EASILY been a laughable performance and she is surprisingly MORE THAN GOOD. Finally, the legendary Mr. Schwarzenegger proves that he could still handle an action film in his final acting days!The fact that James Cameron didn't direct this is a plus as far as I'm concerned. I think most of his movies after T1 are immensely overrated. He's not the best storyteller and T2 was proof of that. In the end, T3 is an excellent action movie worthy of being part of the Terminator franchise...My two cents!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How dare they!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering what happens at the end of 'T2', everything that happens in Terminator 3 is impossible (don't even get me started). This fact alone should be a good enough reason why not to make this movie and rob the other two films of their dignity. Terminator 3 does practically everything wrong, but the worst thing it does is leave the story open for Terminator 4 (or what we now know as Terminator Salvation)The best way to summarize Terminator 3 is to say that this movie shows us how the war between man and machine begins, and how John Conner becomes the one who is destined to save mankind. This may sound like an exciting premise, but it results in a movie that does not belong anywhere near Jim Cameron's genius creations. The script is rubbish. It literally steals plot points from Terminator and T2, and then attempts to make a better movie out of them by adding more mindless action and special effects, neither of which is remotely useful to the story. Instead of being thrilling and epic, the action sequences are confusing and rather dull. The acting is terrible, and the characterization is even worse. The protagonists do virtually nothing but fight, and fight, and fight, and try to survive. It all happens so fast with no character interaction, no suspense, no adventure, and no emotion. Terminator 3 isn't worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely inferior, but it's not THAT bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So yesterday I watched Under Siege 2 and today I watched Terminator 3 for the first time since I saw it in theaters when it was first released. I remember being hugely disappointed when I first saw it, but I noticed that I enjoyed it much more the second time around. It's better than I thought the first time I saw it, but it should be noted that there is no arguing with the fact that, even though it does a good job of furthering the Terminator story, director Jonathan Mostow is just not taking it very seriously. That becomes clear almost immediately, as the Terminator walks into a bar during ladies night and has a run-in with a gay dancer, ultimately walking out of the bar clad in leather and putting on a purple pair of glittery star-shaped sunglasses. The entire movie became one of those rare theater experiences where everyone is laughing out loud and making jokes about the movie but nonetheless enjoying it, and no one seems to mind all the talking and giggling. It's immediately clear that Arnold is just not the same guy he was only ten years earlier. For some reason, he seems a lot more than ten years older here than he was in Judgement Day, and to make matters worse, his English seems to have slipped. His accent is much stronger now than it was before and it affects his performance. It's hard not to laugh out loud when he approaches Claire Dames and says, "Catherine Broo-stuh?"In the movie's defense, I loved the addition that it made to the Terminator story. We are given believable reasons for why there are still terminators even after the only chips were destroyed at the end of T2, and the "rise of the machines" is also well presented.The biggest problem with the movie is the casting. Claire Dames is good in her role of Catherine Brewster, a key element of the humans resistance against the machines, although she is just a little too recognizable. But Nick Stahl? Are you serious? From the very beginning of the movie, where he is shown as an older man in the future, Stahl is wildly miscast as John Connor. Why didn't they just cast Eddie Furlong again? He's not the same guy he was back in 1992, but I can't imagine anyone else fitting the character as well. And surely he wasn't too busy, unless he was more interested in acting in the disappointing and instantly forgettable crime thriller "3 Blind Mice" than making another Terminator film. Such a thing hardly seems possible.The other problem is that Kristannak Loken, who is undeniably beautiful, just doesn't understand the nature of her character, nor does director Jonathan Mostow. In the original film, Reese explained to Sarah Connor that the first Terminators had latex skin and were easy to spot, but the new ones had real organic tissue and looked exactly like normal humans.Nevertheless, every time the Terminatrix is on screen, it's hard not to picture Mostow just off-camera saying, "Do it again, and this time, try to act more like a machine!"Wasn't the whole point of the newer and better Terminators to look and act more like humans and not like machines? At any rate, it just comes off as over-acting here. But still, like the new Indiana Jones movie, the entertainment level is high, and there are certainly some good moments, like the Terminator telling John, "Desire is irrelevant. I am a machine!"I have a feeling that part 3 is going to be a low point in the series, which I'm not sure when it will end. I am thrilled to know that Christian Bale will take on the role of John Connor in Terminator: Salvation. It looks like the series is heading in exciting new directions?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Love The Terminator films! they are truly unique &amp; revolutionary, why? They were a perfect mix of Sci-Fi and action that had a dark &amp; chilling tone to it. It was almost a warning to humanity about our over reliance on technology. Now we have this new chapter in the saga, Terminator 3. After leaving the theater I left feeling man that was awesome, but afterward I really started to think about the movie and how it compares to the first two films. For all it's great action &amp; adventure it just isn't on the same level as The first two. Many fans will be upset cause it doesn't offer what we loved about the other films.1.) It took too long to make Terminator 3: Arnold is the only actor who can be The Terminator, but now he's getting too old and can't be expected to continue being the terrifying cyborg much longer, not to mention he has become involved in politics so his dedication to making good Terminator films is gone. Also James Cameron wasn't back to direct, Big Problem! James Cameron was a man with vision, he knew exactly how to make The Terminator movies. I'm not sure why he didn't come back to do T3 but he hasn't done much directing in a while. Had T3 been made earlier not only do I think Cameron would have had the energy to direct, but he and Arnold could have come back with time do do a fourth. 2.) Bad tone: This film almost seems like a parody of the Terminator Films. It's far more comical and less serious in tone. Like I said before The Terminator films are darker, more grim, and have a clear morale message.3.) Poor Casting: I hated Nick Stahl as John Conner! he came across as whinny, immature, cocky, and self-absorbed. I mean come on he's suppose to be the leader of the Human Resistance that saves humanity! grow up already! He seemed nothing like Edward Furlongs's John Conner in T2. Claire Danes seemed miscast, this isn't her kind of work and she too came off as whinny &amp; immature. Kristanna Loken is Hot as hell, but she's no Terminator. Having a female as an evil Terminator just seems too awkward, she just wasn't intimidating like the original Terminator or the T-1000 (T2). It was wonderful to See Arnold as the Terminator, he was great as usual.4.) Bad Dialogue: Too comical, and stupid. Couldn't take seriously.5.) A crap Story Line: Too many plot holes. I mean the time line didn't add up, when compared to events of Terminator and Terminator 2. Ultimately the writers wrote a script and came up with a story that underachieved. The Terminator films tapped into societies deepest fears about Nuclear War &amp; artificial Intelligence, the film makers were more concentrated in action, entertainment, and awesome special effects. It also failed to deliver what we really wanted out of T3. I wanted to see the chilling &amp; terrifying recreation of Skynet in the aftermath of T2. Not to mention the other movies were kinda scary with the take over over the machines, T3 failed to capture the true horror and the terrifying possibility of a machine take over, I Robot was better doing that! So what was so great about T3? well the action sequences were fantastic, better then that of the first Terminator but not as good as Terminator 2. Personally I'm glad that Judgement day happened, humanity just had to push it didn't they? After the event's of T2 when Skynet was destroyed it should have ended there, but mankind rebuilt skynet so there for humanity deserved to be pushed to extinction for it's ignorance &amp; stupidity in redeveloping the computer that would destroy them. T3 did deal with our anxiety of future events, cause let's face it we are fearful of what the future holds for us. No matter how hard we try, we cannot avoid our destiny and that has been the one constant about the Terminator movies. And then of Course there's Arnold, without him this movie would have really sucked. T3 was missing many of the people &amp; elements that made Terminator &amp; Terminator 2 so legendary, but Arnold has always been the key piece of all three films. Terminator 3: Rise of the machines was a great action adventure film, it was fun &amp; entertaining, but unfortunately it's just not on the same level as the other two.Now with Terminator 4 coming out sometime in 2009, Arnold as I thought will not be reprising his role. I now fear the Terminator series will take a further nose dive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crap. Just crap. Terrible dialogue. The first 2 were great but this is just a big piece of crap that is only fit for idiots that are fans of Battlefield Earth and people that think that every sequel is better then the previous installment. The Termanatrix sucks. The T-1000 is a better Terminator then that one. The TX is played by a frigging female. Terrible performances except for Arnold's. But that does not stop it from being the worst in the trilogy. Sarah Conner is dead. I think that Jonathon Mostow should be ashamed of himself for ruining(for give me) the series. If you have only seen the first 2 and you think you have seen it all then your right. You have. This one is so skipabble that I think that the movie thinks that the extreme dumbness of the movie is amusing. If you have not seen any of the Terminator movies then watch Part 1 and Part 2. Skip Part 3. I do not recommend you on buying this film. I do not recommend you renting this film. I do not recommend you on watching this film. In my opinion, the series is still 2 movies. I enjoy to pretend that this film was never made. It should have never been made. The 2nd worse time travel movie, next to Time Chasers. Avoid this piece of crap at all costs. Terminator 2 should have been the last one. Personally, I would like to send a Terminator back in time to stop this movie from being made. That is how bad this movie was. Just stay away. If you think that all sequels are better then one before, then this is for you. otherwise, just stay away. 3 out of 10 stars. Another CGI piece of bullcrap. If you have only seen the first 2 then you have seen it all. Do not watch this. I am doing you a favor. Please do not watch this. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than T2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard Jim Cameron wasn't directing this version of The Terminator, I dismissed it as a money-grab flick. I was stunned to find out how good it was. The attraction of the Terminator films has never been in the excellence of their FX, but in the brilliance of their time-turning plot twists (which we could discuss for DAYS). Based on that criteria, I think this is almost as good as the original, and far superior to the FX-laden but plot-challenged T2. The ending is incredibly, and suitably, fatalistic. Having said that, the FX in this film are great! And best of all -- no Robert Patrick to stink things up! Absolutely brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid if flawed follow up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people thought this movie was a bad idea before it even materialised which meant that there was always going to be hostility to the finished product. Personally, i thought it was a cool idea - provided the filmmakers could come up with a good story. The end product beats the expectations of the haters but falls short of producing a truly amazing follow up.The plus points of this movie are the amazing fx and chase scenes. The crane truck chase is one of my favourite action movie scenes ever, and is timed perfectly. The story line has been pushed along, with the realisation that Judgement Day cannot be stopped. This comes true at the end of the film with the bombs going off while some gentle classical music plays in the background. It's incredibly poignant for a Terminator movie and a great way to end the film. And of course, seeing Arnold as the now iconic Terminator when we all thought he'd bogged off to be a politician is a very welcome sight.There are however, a lot of niggles that add up to a fair amount of disappointment for the true fans. Nick Stahl takes some getting used to and Claire Danes is just terrible with her granny hair cut and bad clothes. The return of Dr. Silberman is unnecessary, as is the gay sunglasses joke. The most annoying aspect is in the continuity - the van that the good guys are driving hits at least 2 other vehicles at high speeds and gets squashed between 2 cop cars as well as being spun 360 yet when it is seen afterwards for a good few scenes it is intact! I can't believe this terrible blooper made it through! Its so obvious, even on first watch that it spoils the film for me.Yet despite it's flaws T3 is a good solid action film, just like the recent Die Hard 4.0 - you know what you're getting and OK its a bit old hat, but for thrills alone it's definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judgment Day. The End of the World. It's today. Three hours from now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably going to lose instant credibility by saying this, but I think that T3 is the best in the series. Yes, T2 and the original are brilliant but T3 is simply all action from start to finish. It's a breathless, relentless thrill-ride that doesn't let up until the shocking, refreshingly downbeat climax.Nick Stahl easily steps into the role of John Connor, vacated by Eddie Furlong and surpasses him in terms of acting and character development. T3 takes place over a couple of days but the actors still get enough out of the sudden, fast-paced plot developments to prevent them from simply being furniture. I was surprised at how emotional and engaging Nick Stahl's performance was as I had previously thought he was totally inappropriate for the part.T3 has Connor as some sort of Ronin type character, living separate from the rest of humanity, paranoid that Skynet may be able to track his footsteps in the future and send a Terminator to kill him. He knows he destroyed Cyberdyne and everything SHOULD be okay, but something else just stops him from keeping in touch with the world. Plus Sarah Connor is dead, leaving a John alone in an unstable time.Computer networks are failing across the planet and there seems to be a giant ghost in the machine. Everyone seems oblivious to the brewing trouble until the T-X and the T-800 step out of the time displacement field, hellbent on blowing each other and the city to smithereens.Amazing special effects, stunt work and CGI make up the rest of the movie, which is essentially one huge chase. I found it to be pretty seamless when I first saw it but upon repeat viewings you can tell what's fake and what's not. But only if you look really hard. T3 uses its effects to make a good movie, not just a pretentious trailer. Something that so many shallow effects movies do.Of course there are problems. As always in a film with such a white-knuckle momentum, plot coherence is sacrificed for timing. Why is Kate Brewster and her boyfriend shopping in the middle of the night? How on earth would Connor's Leutenant's have survived Judgment Day when they clearly live in the middle of LA and would have been fried to a crisp? There are also some continuity problems with the first 2 movies not the least of which are the wildly incorrect character ages. But even James Cameron himself didn't define this too clearly in T2. And why is Arnie's Terminator model now called a T-101? He's a T-800: Cyberdyne Systems Model 101. A couple of quick exposition scenes could have made all this nice and neat. But they couldn't be bothered I guess. This is probably why so many fans of Cameron's entries turned their noses up that T3.I find it unlikely that there will ever be a Terminator 4. Arnie is too busy to commit himself to a time-consuming project like that and it just wouldn't be a Terminator movie without him. Despite being 55 in this he still looks pretty good (if only the same could be said for Seagal eh?) for an obsolete model.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faithful add-on to Terminator series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with open-arms and was rewarded with a wonderful action film (the best in the year) that totally lived up to the hype and my expectations.The CG is far superior to T1 and T2, and the acting never had any embarrassingly corny lines--like Terminator 1 (and the romance never did it for me in that film).The new Terminator (TX) is played rather well by Kristanna Loken, and the design of this cyborg is fantastic---a noted improvement from the T-1000, who I thought was a bit of a wimp.Of course, this movie belongs to Arnie, who commands the screen and has some very good scenes. As for Stahl and Danes, they are perfectly cast, and Stahl is a relief from someone who thought the Edward Furlong John Connor was pretty painful.Those two actors really do play second fiddle to the action here, which looks spectacular, and sadly (for some) does not leave as much room for character development as T1 and T2.However, if you're interest in the Terminator series is generally for the action and less about whether Terminators "really can love and learn the value of human life", then you will absolutely adore this movie, and without a doubt find it a welcome addition to the former 2.If, you are an aficionado of the series, you will be hard-pressed to find the human elements of the former two movies, although it goes without saying that there is a ton of information about the Machine uprising here that you would do well to take into account.I personally loved this film, and, while not yet considered the classic of T1 and T2, it is only a matter of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading a lot of negative reviews and that really saddens me.I too did not like it that Cameron did not want to direct this movie. But that is his mistake. I would have done it as it would have been a sure hit and it was a huge box office hit. But it is also a good movie.The story is excellent. Sure it does not match the story from the first two movies but that is because the future was changed because of the interventions from the first two movies. With Cyberdyne destroyed a future was also destroyed.But Judgment Day was or rather is inevitable and that is where the movie shines. I mean Judgment Day IS coming. And it is not some movie thing but the future of humanity. Our arrogance will be our undoing one day and the first two Terminator movies made me realize that. This movie ends in the only way I feel it could have ended. With the near destruction of the human race.It was a new ending and a most controversial one. But I loved it. Not a crappy ending where the humans stop the evil machines or alien invasion. But an ending where we are on the losing side. It was most unexpected but that is what I loved.I also liked the T-X. It seemed right to have a female Terminator and Kristanna Loken played her parts nicely. And Arnold was great as his usual character. Of course the older Terminator model stood little or no chance against the T-X but that was not the point. The Terminator's mission was to ensure the survival of John and Katherine and not to fight the T-X.It seems a bit odd for the resistance to send such an old Terminator model back trough time but this was probably the best they could get. Which would make sense as the T-X is probably a prototype and/or very costly to produce. The T-101 's are foot soldiers so obtaining one of those would be easier.John and Katherine were well cast and played their roles perfectly. Stahl really looked as if the weight of the world was on his shoulders.There were a few minor complaints such as Dr. Silberman. It was neat to see him again but he was head of a entire mental hospital. How did he get to work for a Sheriff's office? I guess seeing the T-1000 really drove him over the edge.I also missed the few key phrases such as "I'll be back." "Or Come with me if you want to live." I mean the first is one of the best movie quotes ever so having it omitted in this movie was a downer.But the story and action scenes were excellent. The story did not measure up to Terminator or Terminator 2 but was still excellent. There was not a dull moment in the movie whatsoever and even though it was rather straightforward the ending made it perfect.Thanks to the T-X's ability to control other vehicles, the chase scene could be expanded upon greatly, having several vehicles chase the heroes which was a very cool idea and well executed. The other action scenes did their part as well as did the fight scenes.By the way, I loved those. Sure it may be silly watching Arnie fight a woman but it makes sense. Generally woman are seen as the "weaker" sex although there are a lot of woman whom that does NOT apply to. But still, a woman tends to blend in the crowds easier than a big muscle man such as Arnold. Which seems to be what a Terminator does best.She could of course take on the form of other humans and at one point she could have killed Kate in the guise of her fiancée but instead reverted to her normal form. Seeing how Kate needed to survive this error was necessary but I like to think that the T-X was just over confident and changed back or perhaps needed to do so in order to access its weaponry.And I am not really a nitpicker because then one can nitpick about a lot of stuff. I mean, in Terminator Sarah is last seen with a dog just in case a Terminator does appear. If John is so worried about the future (and trying not to be registered anywhere so to avoid being tracked), why does he not have a dog himself? I would have one.So I ignore those little tidbits and focus on the good stuff. Which this movie has in spades. I know it is not Terminator 1 or 2 but this movie is still a great addition to the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 destroys the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to the prospect of a third instalment to the Terminator series, but when i read that it was to be a 12A rating, i was outraged. There's no need for it, is there. If you look at the 3rd movie it tells you all. It has an edgy and out of touch storyline. It's not directed by James Cameron, it was left for 12 years to be revisited, it has no Linda Hamilton, no Edward Furlong(they left it to late for him, not seeing the inevitable, that he would end up in rehab)and the main attraction and the only attraction is a 56 year old Terminator who is on the verge of bowing out of the industry(Arnie). These are not the things that frustrate me in a big way, i'll tell you what it is, it's the films disgraceful attention to detail: 1) Nick Stahl(John Connor) says that the Terminator visited him first when he was 13, when anyone who actually watched T2 will know that John was 10 in the 1995 based Terminator 2, and he would have had to have been 10 because his mother, Sarah fell pregnant with him in late 1984(shown in Terminator). 2) It says on Sarah Connors coffin that she was born in 1959 and died in 1997 from leukaemia. She wasn't born in 1959, she was 19 in 1984, that was explained in T2, she had to be born in 1964 or 1965. 3) John says in T3 that his mother contracted Lukemia in 1994, and died from it shortly after the predicted Judgement Day. Now if that's the case why wasn't this mentioned in 1995 based T2, well i'll tell you why, they didn't expect Linda Hamilton to turn down the 3rd movie role, so they created some bull crap story to cover up her disappearance. I didn't reckon much of Nick Stahl's dry performance and i think that Director Jonathan Mostow &amp; writers John Branicato, Michael Ferris &amp; Tedi Sarafian should give each other some hard slaps and be cast out of the movie making industry for ruining a franchise by making the third instalment having never watched the first two movies. They just wanted to make money, they don't care about those hardcore fans, they don't love films, they mock the industry. 12A gets the kids in, gets the money in, takes the brilliance out.

The terminators Arnold and kristanna were good it was good to see a girl terminator this time and the action was OK but nearly every action sequence was used with computer effects and that just disappointed me at least in the last two the action seemed more realistic. Seriously the only reason i watched this was because of Arnold's character who i have always loved but the story and action was pretty weak...if only James Cameron made T3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this film 'Terminator 3' Rise of the machines wasn't as good as the first two Terminator films, I can still say that I enjoyed this film. Considering how very few of the original actors were in this film, that were in the first two Terminator films, other than Arnold Swartzeneger the Terminator and Earl Boen(Dr.Peter Silberman) who was Sarah Connors Psychiatrist, I thought this film carried itself extremely well. I thought the lighting and special effects were superb and the directors choice of making the new Terminator into a woman was a great and original idea. In many ways I found this sequel somewhat more humorous compared to the other Terminator films, a humour that the other films lacked. The scene when the Terminatrix(Kristanna Loken) breasts grew larger after looking at the large breasted women on the billboard poster and when Arnold Swartzeneger(the Terminator) walked into the strip club in the nude, for everybody thought that he was a stripper hired by the nightclub, I found extremely funny. I did, however, find it unrealistic when the Terminator was deprogrammed by the Terminatrix to become bad and then mentally fought his deprogramming to remain good and managing to shut his system down. That was so unreal! Why - because the Terminator is a Cyborg, not a person. It doesn't have feelings of its own. Its programmed to follow his orders - nothing more. As all Terminator fans know, that John Connors father(Kyle Rhys) who was one of John Connors Sergeants in the future was sent back in time to the year 1984 to save Johns mother(Sarah Connor) from being killed by the Terminator. It would have been good if the Terminator named John Connors fathers name(Kyle Rhys) to John Connor(Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster(Claire Danes) when he was telling them the listed names of the Terminatrix' assassin hitlist, who were John Connors top Sergeants/ Lieutenants in the future, that she was planning to kill. That would have been ironic for this film, for his father(Kyle Rhys) was one of John Connors top Sergeants in the year 2027, but unfortunately his name wasn't mentioned on that list. Then again, it was only fair that he wasn't on the hit list for Kyle Rees wasn't alive in the year 1997 as he was born in the year 2006. Despite the ways I feel this film could have improved, I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend anybody to watch it, as this film had amazing special effects, exciting action scenes and most of all had a fantastic storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small masterpiece ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trilogies almost never work. Few franchises have enough steam to get to #3 without a misstep ... frankly, I can't think of any other examples.But T3 breaks the trilogy curse. The smartest move the filmmakers made was deciding not to try to outdo T2. T2 is an epic masterpiece, and trying to take that to the next level would have been near impossible. Instead, that brought things down a notch, made a smaller story, added more humor.The result is a small, wonderful film. Well, relatively small anyway. It still delivers on the action -- the big chase scene code be the greatest car chase ever committed to film. And the ending ... it's the most powerful conclusion of any film in the series.Kudos to the mind behind T3 for taking a project that could have been a disaster and making a terrific piece of cinema out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a terrible letdown for what were an incredible first two films. It has used a name "Terminator" to make millions on a story that realistically is not worth the paper its written on. Im surprised that Arnold would even attach his name to this film, but undoubtedly a six figure number probably helped. It is rubbish. Poor acting coupled with a poor script leads to disastrous affects! as we clearly see in this movie. The fact that we have a woman terminator making mince meat out of Arnold (the figure) that James Cameron spent so much time making a legend of in the first to films. Instead of being the man of steal that we admired in the first two films Arnold is now more like a cross between Ricky Gervais and Vinnie Jones. Shame on whoever developed this film for letting an amateur (Jonathan Mostow) take the steering wheel of something that has over the years earned massive recognition only to smash it with what was to be known as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. POOR.</fullReview>

To cut a long story short, this is simply the best "part 3" movie of all time (including 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones').Forget about all the bad reviews you've read. This is Terminator in all its glorious super-scale-destroy-all-vehicles-and-residences beauty. This is Arnold Schwarzenegger looking almost as he did 10 years ago.

		<shortDescription>What a Turkey! Brings the Terminator series and IMDB to shame..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me, my girlfriend and two others were on a week holiday to Amstedam when we decided to check out Terminator 3, which I had been looking forward to for a long time; I like (futuristic) action movies, I liked the other Terminator-movies, and this movie had gotten a pretty decent IMDB rating.We stepped into the cinema, and.. what followed was a chain of disappointments and to be blunt - extreme annoyances.Here are some of the "goodies" what you can expect when you go to see T3:1. jokes and humour with references to previous films - which very quickly grow very, very old ("she'll be back"). 2. far too long and tedious action scenes (and I love the Matrix, T1, T2, etc and action in general). 3. plot holes with a B-movie, low-budget quality to them. MANY of these.This is the one film where I cannot get myself to agree with or understand the IMDB rating it has gotten. One of the worst, dullest films I've ever seen, has at this moment a 7.1 IMDB rating. IMO it deserves something around the 3.0-5.0 mark. This really shocked me, because IMDB has usually been very trustworthy in this matter.I do not recommend you to see this movie! But good luck if you do..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hasta la vista, Arnie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two "Terminator" films were classics and, given the disappointments of Arnold Schwarzenegger's more recent movies (such as "End Of Days" and "The Sixth Day"), it was obviously enormously tempting to return to his most famous and iconic role, even after an interval of 12 years. But it was a wise decision - Arnie has shaped up (literally) and cleaned up at the box office in a return to form that might yet prove to be a platform to political success that terminates his 'acting' career.Director James Cameron has now left the scene and his role is taken over by Jonathan Mostow who - as we know from the history-twisting, but action-laded "U-571" - is a competent producer of exciting movies. Like all sequels, "T3" is formulaic -a repetition of the key elements of earlier movies in the franchise with a few variations. But it is a winning formula and the obligatory road chase sequence is really well done, while the main twist - a female terminator - works effectively with Kristanna Loken looking chillingly attractive. I especially enjoyed the use of new machines.There is no real plot or character development, but the storyline remains honest to the original premise that Armageddon is inevitable. Above all, it thoroughly entertaining as, as Arnie comments at one point: "Your levity is good - it relieves tension and the fear of death". A couple of lines leave open a possible return to the franchise and, since terminators obviously come in many forms, this could even happen without Arnie if he proves to be busy running California. One way or another, I'm convinced he'll be back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With The Future Already Written, What's The Point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Question: Can a sequel get much worse than T3?.... Answer: I think not.Regardless of its whopping $200 million budget, T3 (which, of course, focused on violence, explosions and mass destruction) (Well, what did I expect?) certainly turned out to be some of the absolute stalest storytelling that I've had the displeasure of seeing in a mighty long time.If you ask me - I am utterly sick to death of Arnold's "Terminator" shtick. And, this time around, Arnold's performance (that featured some of the lamest one-liners imaginable) was a total embarrassment on all counts.After being paid a ridiculous $30 million to star in this "Save-The-Future" clunker, I seriously think that Arnold should be absolutely ashamed of himself for delivering such a crappy portrayal of a T-101 bimbo.With T3's story simply going over the same, old, tired ground, again and again, the viewer would have to be a totally clueless nitwit not to see that this idiotic, action yarn was going nowhere, fast.Anyways - I thought that Nick Stahl made for an utterly pathetic and completely despicable "Saviour" as John Connor. And having the super-upgraded TX model be a hot-looking woman was the absolute last straw in Sci-Fi stupidity that broke the terminator's back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After two excellent films(if anyone is contesting that, hey, I'll hear you out, just be sure to bring impeccable points against them... or it can of course be a matter of taste, which there's no accounting for, and I have no beef with anyone who uses that as a reason to not care for them) we get... this. No, really, *this*. What is it? Does it even know, itself? It's certainly not a Terminator film. Do I even need to explain that one? Take a look at pretty much any moment of it and compare to, yes, any of the earlier two. Go ahead. I'll wait. In the meantime, let's go over what else this could be: A parody of the others? Yes, that really could be it. Was the self-irony in T2 not the exact right amount and tone? Did anyone want what this had in that area? Even if you do laugh at the initial sunglasses bit, you're likely to, a second or so later, go "wait a minute...", and that's not the last of it. Add to that, there is a Road Runner gag in this. You think I'm kidding? Check for yourself, around half an hour in. The "humor" largely consists of stupid stereotypes, trying to get cheap laughs. No... in truth, I know what this is. A popcorn flick. And it shouldn't be. Like its predecessors, it's got action, and it's big. Unfortunately, now you can also add "dumb" and "loud" to that description, and that does not belong in the universe of these. You want that type of cinema experience? Heck, go for it. I do, too. But that is not what this franchise is. The shoot-outs and car-chases are simply not that exciting, and every time this tries to recreate or mimic something in one of the previous entries, it's awful at worst, and dull, never reaching the height of them, at best. The script is daft. It holds a handful of interesting concepts or ideas, however, none are terribly utilized or followed through. More noticeable are the times that the writing is convenient. And somehow, after a kind of light, easy to take in running time, this ends in a depressing(not to mention abrupt, unsatisfying and pointless) way(sadly, Boen's role in this can be described that way, as well). I agree with what Hamilton said when she declined this. You can tell James Cameron had no direct hand in this. I will say that the effects are mostly well-done, though a few are hideous. The character of Kate was annoying and unnecessary. John manages to have a higher pitched voice than he did as a 13-year-old(!) at times in this. The acting varies, it's not all bad. The leads do convincingly(fingers ought to be pointed at the screenplay, instead). They didn't particularly think of anything new for the the cyborg. And before anyone asks if I could come up with such, hey, maybe not, meanwhile, you do not see me going out and making a sequel to T1 and 2. Kristanna did give this an effort, and clearly got into it, and the fault does not lie with her. The T-X is instantly and infinitely obvious in why that was their choice. Did they have to stoop to that level? There are at least three separate occurrences that were put there for no other purpose than to attract male teenagers, and could be taken out with no loss to the rest of it(the key-words give clues). Thus this is the first of these to have aspects that are gratuitous. The sexuality, the nudity, the language, the violence, heck, the whole bloody thing. Apart from cashing in, why was this released? The DVD has some specials, including a marvelous documentary, outtakes(fairly low on the list of hilarity-to-length ratio, if you ask me), featurettes(one with Todd MacFarlane, who is a blast to listen to and view), a commentary track(they're informative enough) with only Mostow, and one where he's joined by Arnie, Stahl, Danes and Loken(although they're recorded separately, so there is little to no back-and-forth). For that last one, I'd go with the Director's Cut of Judgment Day's, instead: The track for that is an interesting case... it contains almost thirty(!) people, and while that obviously seems quite bombastic, it's handled well. There is a main speaker, and it would appear that everyone else who says anything has done so in interviews, and the parts that fit with specific stuff(shots, sounds, effects) are then put in here, briefly introduced(occasionally after they've already spoken) by the... producer or who it was. I'd give that a listen if you care for such. Back to what there is on the discs of this...They range in quality, but I'd say that the one that stands out, to me, anyway, the sole thing that even begins to justify the existence of this, is the Sgt. Candy Scene. I'd watch that even if you have no other contact with this. I recommend this to those not attached in any way to the prior movies that share a title with this, and/or people looking for something to turn their brain off to. I don't have a problem with entertainment pieces of that sort come to be, nor that they sell(again, I am one of the buyers), I merely object to using this established name for that. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of the Terminator saga. And a smart movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most general people, and movie goers liked this movie quite a lot and so did I. Anymore we hear a few people online say it sucks, because that is all they can say about any movie any more. And for some reason these negative online nerds some how make people scared of movies or make them say what they want them to say. "Yea it sucked" stuff like that. Most of the people that bash T3 contridict themselves time again and again.People whine about how it was too much like T2, then the next sentence they said it was not like Cameron's T2 at all. People are just mad because T3 did not have Cameron.FACT: JAMES CAMERON LOVED THE MOVIE!In July in a BBC interview he said he loved the movie and thought what Mostow did was true to his series and well worthy of his saga.And James has more of a reason to hate it then anyone even more then the most die hard fan.And we all know James is not one for BSing he tells things like it is, he is powerful enough to do that.The movie was made for fan/general audiance. The General movie goer, even the big nerd ones will watch it see and action movie that was good but lacking detail. A true Terminator fan will see all these small details here and there even with in the action, that besides the age mistakes on Sarah and John really fit in to the Terminator saga. Everything that was done in T3 if you look very closley it was said in T1 and T2. Some say how can T3 be, well most fans know that T2 ended with a paradox. If John was still alive, the Terminators/Skynet must still exist due to the fact that Skynet made the Time Displacement Equipment and he sent back Terminator's, then the resistance stole the Time machine and sent Kyle back to protect Sarah from the Terminator then he concived John. So if there are no Terminator's there is no John, some people just don't get that.Story: Not as detailed as the others, but it has more meaning then some see, and really follows what was talked about in T2 and T1, including how Cyberdyne would become part of the military. In T2 the Terminator said "In three years Skynet will become a huge military supplier." Well everyone knows T2 takes place in 1995, and 3 years would of been after Judgement Day, so the Terminator always knew that JD would never happen until 2007, or when ever T3 takes place. Very good story. Too bad that the execs took out about 50 minutes of story/character develoment, we will see that in the T3 Ultimate Edition DVD.Visual Effects: Easily the best this year. Yea maybe it does not have as much as Reloaded or LOTR but it has smaller scales, and more realism. Some things people would never guess were CGI until you told them. Including all...thats right ALL even the close up one T-800 endo's in the future scens are all CGI.Sound: Will blow you away. The music was much more human/mechanical instead of Fidel's techno that gets boring. Marco did a wonderful job. And the sound effects in the whole movie will blow you out of the water.Acting: Well done, Stahl was the best in this and the Terminator did a great job as being the T from T1 and T2 combined. Most don't understand that Mostow was trying to de-construct the father figure the Terminator had on John by making him more machine like so that in the future he could fight them more. Kristanna did a great job as a villan. Bravo to all.Editing: Though great I will complain as a huge fan we know there was 50 minutes including a long end fight and 10 minute future war sequence cut out. And a lot of the story scenes left on the floor. I bet if all the scenes were left in T3 would of been hailed as much as T2 by everyone.Bottom Line. T3 was superb, doing what the fans wanted it to do. Making a good ending and not just some yipiee the good guys save the day again ending. A ending that left you quiet and in awe. Making you wonder if we will do something like that some day. T3 was art, it was not verbaly a detailed movie like T1 and T2, it had the detail in between the lines. And if you can filter out the great action, you can see this story and how deep it is. A must see for anyone despite the few nerds bashing it, because they don't understand it.9.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**1/2 Minor fan might think that this is a nice stand off for a trilogy but hardcore fans might take it as an insult. I am however a hardcore fan but I don't consider this movie as an insult. For me the problem was that this film basically ignores the first two films. It's like the The Exorcist: The Heretic, it completely ignores the main events of the first part. If you are going to make a sequel, make sure that you include the events in the first part. Aliens did but again it was an action movie, not a Sci-Fi horror film like the first part was. Plus I think it was a good idea to have a female antagonist but it doesn't mean anything if she does the same thing over &amp; over again. T-1000 from Judgement Day didn't do the same thing like T-800 did in the first Terminator film. All in all though, it might be a good film for some others but not hardcore fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent sequel without James Cameron!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film amazed me. Johnathan Mostow did a good job keeping James vision alive. Even though, there are continuity errors and some incorrect dates, the movie was still able to capture it's audience. I have to admit that some sound effects were annoying and humor was used heavily in this movie. I watched it for the third time and it gets better. I suggest that you watch the film with an open minded and not too high of standards because this is a different director and screenplay writer this time around.If you look at this film for what it is, you will like what is has to offer. It contained much philosophy about the future and fate, just like it's predecessor.Please rent and watch this great movie. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the series since I saw the first one at the cinema this film was a massive disappointment. I own the DVD's and have watched them many times.There has been a trend over the last few years to substitute a well worked script for lots of actions shots and this film just about represents the pinnacle of this type of movie making. I was saddened by it. What a waste of an opportunity to finish off the series on a high note.As a technical achievement it is exceptional but the script is flat and lifeless. It seems that James Cameron's part in producing the script must have been very small or he's lost the plot. Add in second rate music (the first two having first rate music!) and the result is all gloss and no substance.Sure this type of film is all about a action but it does need a good script to work well. Just adding in bigger explosions and more carnage just ain't the way to do it.Such a disappointment, I really wanted to enjoy this film.</fullReview>

The difference between T2 and T3 is incredible. one has strong acting, good effects, clever and smart dialog with humor injected at just the right time....and one has none of these things!!!!!! Effects are supposed to get better with time , not worse! Didn't anyone watch this before they released it and say "Is this a parody or a sequel"? Major disappointment on all levels.

		<shortDescription>A tragic continuation of two astounding films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I beg of you not to pay to watch this film. Doing do will only encourage further series-destroying sequels.The inventiveness, the atmosphere, the sincerity, the tension and so many other attributes of the first two films are gleefully swept away by this trash. Perhaps James Cameron is not the finest director in America, but after 109 painful minutes of this film you realise just what Cameron could do, and Mostow can't.The attempt to inject humour into this film at every opportunity was severely misjudged. Cameron's screenplay for the first and second film kept the tension high, explained the story without becoming over complicated and involved us with the characters. No fear of any of this with Terminator 3. After about twenty minutes I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of the characters, and Nich Stahl's acting is so lamentable that you are left to wonder who could have possibly been worse in the role.Mostow's direction is a mess, with scenes shot too close, removing style and clarity from chase scenes and reducing them to a bewildering array of explosions and broken glass. Eyes quickly glaze over, and you just know everything will work out in some way for our dull heroes.The special effects in this are not a patch on other recent productions, and the glossy computer animation of the terminators, especially during the opening future-war scene and Loken's weapon attachment are lacking all the ingenuity of the sublime T-1000 effects from 1991.Add to this mix an appalling score by Marco Beltrami that is instantly forgettable (surely a recognisable theme would have been the first priority in such a hackneyed film) and a complete irreverence for the story of the previous two films and you're left with a movie that makes you wish you hadn't seen it, and wish that the studio had left Cameron's work alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie left me(huge terminator fan) disappointed **most likely some spoiler or two**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok. I am a HUGE sci fi fan and I love Terminator and T2. I had huge hopes for T3 but it just left me feeling REALLY REALLY EMTY.1st. The movie felt like it was cut. It felt like it was heavily cut. The movie runs for about 104 mins.. T2 ran for well over 2 hours atleast.The dialogue was at zero. And I suspect alot of plot never really got explored, like when T-X is sent to kill Connors officers.. She kills 2. And thats that.Furthermore there is no suspense no nothing like that. Remember T2? We didnt even know who was the good / Bad Terminator until Well 25-30 mins into the movie. Here The Biggest scene in the whole movie with the crane chase is well underway after 25-30 mins. It just feels like they rushed everything. Do the movie companies really give us so little credit nowadays so they think we wont sit thru a film unless it has action ALWAYS??Now to my biggest concern which ties to the cutting.The movie is basicly just ACTION non stop ACTION. I know you will say ok well its a good action movie. Yes i agree But this is terminator.. they had 12!! years to come up with a INCREDIBLE script. What we get is a script that is nonstop action no dialogue no plot no nothing except mindnumbing action.I mean first its the fight at the veterinarian, then they drive for what? 5 mins then they fight at the cemetary, then they fight at the military complex then they go to the fallout shelter and the movie is basicly Done. There is so minimal dialogue (ok i know im repeating myself) that I could puke. This is a Terminator movie not a action movie they should have done more.And now to the minor stuff.Whats the deal with all these stuff that makes no sense. Like when he puts on these silly glasses the male stripper had then he takes them off and crushes them. Ok hes a ROBOT, does he have some coolness program he must obey? If he has a directive to wear glasses he should have worn these it would have made complete sense.Then whats the deal with counting how many cops hes killed?? I hate how movies these days have aboslutely no balls. Like when Spielberg replaced the rifles in E.T with walkie talkies.. This terminator was Sent fro the future he had NO directive not to kill cops he repeats his directives More then once i think and its solely to ensure that connor and his wife lives.This movie was made for the fast buck and it sucks because they destroyed possibly the greatest line of movies everThanks for the rantSue</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning possible SPOILERSAwful. Dumb. Insulting. Terrible. There, I just spoiled this lame piece of &amp;%*%! Those are the good points. I hated this film more than life itself. Let's point out some of the astronomical sized holes in this dung heap:1. First film - 1 terminator was sent back to kill mother of future resistence leader. Humans blew up the 'time machine' after sending soldier through to destroy terminator.Second film - Ooohh, actually a couple more terminators were actually sent b4 the machine was destroyed (I mean the first one made so much money and we can't really come up with a good ORIGINAL idea so we'll just do the same thing again EXCEPT will make one of the terminators -arnie- a good terminator sent back to destroy an improved edition) I'm not sure why we just didn't send the liquid metal guy the first time around since he probably would have gotten the job done, but were just stupid machines making movies for REALLLLLLLLYYYY STUPID AUDIENCE.THIRD 'thing'- AAAwwwhhh, comon folks, you know how stupid movie goers are! Just tell them that there was actually 5 terminators and one human that were sent back in the time machine b4 we blew it up. In this one we'll send a female termy that has a smokin' arm (face and bod) against an even older version of the first 2 mechanical terminators -arnie- and what we can do, no-no seriously listen up for a second; we'll just remake the second movie with this female termy and people will buy it up. They'll even write posts on the IMDB using words like 'AWESOME' and 'AMAZING' and 'INCREDIBLE' to describe the utterly wretched piece of vomit that we produced. WE CAN'T LOSE!! WE'LL MAKE MONEY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE REALLY STUPID!! NICE, BUT STUPID!!2. Expanding breast... hmmmm, so why would a terminator stop for a traffic cop, why would she expand her breasts if she's gonna kill him?3. Arnie in a biker bar looking for clothes again (ohhh god this is gonna be painful).4.Arnie and the sunglasses (robots are, after all, fashionable).5. Arnie finds keys where furlong boy said to look (don't worry, i know he's not the same robot but you see people are so dumb that they'll just think its cute)6. "I'll be back","She'll be back", "I'm Back"... ohhh mother this is going light years beyond LAME!7. Daddy, I know that you're head of the most top-secret defence base / system in the world but i can just run inside with my friends and some guns anytime i want, right daddy?8. You know you're way around this secret base really well daughter, just go along the old path and you'll find all you need along the way; planes, electro magnetic pulsar generators - for immobilizing female terminators with inflatible breasts, donut shops etc...9. This is the pentagon, What's going on over there are entire defence network is down, have you been playing Starcraft again? Just put the worlds most powerful nation, all it's resources and half of the worlds nuclear weapons in the control of that mega computer thing-a-ma-bob and we'll cross our fingers and hope the audience is dumb enough to accept this!10. You mean to tell me that this whole movie was pointless! That, essentially it was all an excuse to have a couple car chases and an aging, talentless, has been, hummer driving, president wannabe, republican to actually have a movie that makes some money? Hey people bought that Matrix Reloaded thing too!My god! The above doesn't even come close to how stupid this movie is and what an awful excercise of excess this load of @#$% is!Hey you!

		<fullReview>being a huge terminator fan since a young age, i can honestly say when this was released, somewhere in the back of my mind, i wasn't looking forward to it, but then again i gave it a go at the cinema's.as most should be aware the story ends at t2, and the fact both are made by Cameron, it is clear he had no intention of continuing a story that had no other plot needed. also note most of the actors did not show up in t3, i think they knew it would kill their reputation, but i guess Arnie knew he would get some degree of fame.Now did i like t3? oh dear no! i agree with other reviewers, its just one big chase scene, confusing and senseless. apparently the leader of the resistance sent the cyborg twice to ensure the future which he occupied ceases to exist! huh????? i couldn't help noticing the music was dull and not captivated, the fear and keep in suspense qualities that was presented in the past. i honestly got bored waiting for that something to happen, but it didn't! now i found out they will have a fourth instalments. oh dear! simply put, good action scenes from an otherwise rubbish and insult to Cameron's babies. i just imagine to myself this movies has no relevance to terminator itself.It kinda kills the beauty if you catch my drift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3: A systematic breakdown on why this film sucks from a Terminator FAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reasons why this film is crap...1. The Terminator (Arnold) is a T-101 in Terminator 3...(bashes Mr. Mostow in the skull) NO! NO! NO! In T1 &amp; T2, the Terminator is a T-800: Cyberdyne Systems MODEL 101. If you can't get the BASIC facts straight, you shouldn't assume the helm of any major and beloved franchise! 2. Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor) turned down an initial version of the script because T3 portrayed Sarah Connor as a weaker character while maintaining the "weak" John Connor.3. Make way for Katherine Brewster, John Connor's "Sarah-Connor-wanna-be" wife, who saves his ass constantly. Yes, saves John Connor, the future military leader! The character, John Connor, is completely subdued in T3.4. The gay stripper at the male strip club with the star sunglasses? No! The whole reason the Terminator ever started wearing sunglasses is in T1 when he had to disguise his face after his eye cover was damaged and he couldn't "blend in" with society. In T2, the sunglasses weren't necessary either, but the Terminator didn't have the glasses on for much of the movie. Talk to the hand? Completely unnecessary and an ancient phrase at that! 5. "She'll be back?" Stop with the catch phrases of "...be back." 6. The premise of the Terminators in the past is to blend in with society while hunting and killing their prey. The T-X is a "down grade" from the T-1000 in T2. She has weaponry built in (doesn't fit in at a dinner party) and an endoskeleton under liquid metal. One aspect made known in T2 was the fact that the T-800 endoskeleton could be harmed and wear-out opposed to the T-1000 which was pure liquid metal, no skeleton to be beaten. The T-1000 could take tons of Damage and no sign of being harmed.There are a few more reasons. I know people will attack this post, but I am fundamentally correct in my statements. Audiences crave seeing films like T3: Rise of the Machines and Superman Returns even though they are pretty much, but not completely, crap because people just want to see Superman fly again or see the Terminator back in action! Damn the good characters and the good story lines that made people love the original films to start with. The more things change...the worse they get!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks direction, humanity and complex characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After over a decade of waiting, wondering what came next in the masterful Terminator franchise starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in his most famous and iconic role - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines made it's premiere in 2003 but this time without James Cameron at the helm. In his place a competent action director in Jonathan Mostow (U571 and Breakdown) to continue the legendary mythology spelled out so meaningfully in the previous classics. No pity, no remorse - no fate but what we make, right? Wrong.Terminator 3 works as a stand-alone action film or straight up popcorn flicks for teenage multiplex hoards but as part of the acclaimed Terminator franchise it's an insulting, unintelligent and insignificant re-tread lacking direction, humanity and complex characters. If anything this devalues the franchise beyond recognition essentially back-tracking, rewriting and corrupting the mythology painstakingly established by James Cameron before trying to compensate for its lack of creativity with explosions and poorly placed slapstick humour.Its one thing to unnecessarily build upon another movie's story, but to rewrite the entire meaning behind another movie is just cheap and nasty. The story itself offered nothing besides the beginning of Judgment Day which was already the way we knew the series was headed and instead of moving the logical way, which is forward, the writers tried to implement bogus twists and instead took some rather pointless and dull steps backwards essentially reversing the entire mythology of the series.The notion desperately put forth in Terminator 3 is ridiculous, not to mention a complete repudiation of the themes and ideals spelled out so eloquently in Terminator's one and two. This is bad writing, tailored to suit an uninspired little story. How the writers felt adequate about avoiding the questions everybody has been asking for over a decade but more importantly how is it they live with themselves after re-writing the entire meaning behind such a classic mythology? 'Judgement Day is inevitable' is not an explanation. This one line shows how little talent, vision or depth the writers really had when put up to the take of writing such a large-scale film on their own.Now to character development and relationships. Terminator 3 missed so many opportunities to establish it's characters and established no atmosphere whatsoever. The score is as dry as a bone lacking little to no emotion like Brad Fidel's and if anything, anything at all the film should have emphasized even more on the character of John Connor. You know the saviour of mankind, the leader of the human resistance like Sarah in Terminator 2 but failed to because there simply wasn't any time to between the breaking of key scenes with slapstick humour by clown Arnold or more pointless action. The opening voice over with Connor was the only real development throughout the movie but can you really call that development? I'd call it an easy explanation. The opening voice over is all the insight you really get into the mind of John Connor (who gets his age wrong) and unfortunately its not enough to warrant a great character like Sarah Connor, though Stahl's performance was firm.How we went from the Terminator in 1984 to this is beyond me and while they may have the rights to the franchise but you'd think in having the rights to create such a high calibre film they'd first take the time to understand it and its importance. The writers (Brancato, Ferris) were completely void of any real new ideas and basically had re-tread old information with one original idea in mind for the movie, the oh so 'shocking' conclusion which was just another tool for yet another 'inevitable' sequel by these hacks who forgot to hold dear what Cameron's films made so memorable. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instructions on how to fix something that isn't broken: 1. Take 2 amazing films. 2. Take the plot and storyline. 3. Take the FINISHED story and try to CONTINUE it with a rubbish excuse 4. Take away lots of violence so that it can be rated '12A' 5. Include some un-scary CGI scenes and acting 6. Make too many jokes an take away the seriousnessYour outcome.. Terminator 3. Its hard to know where to start. Lets get the good pints out first. Kristianna Loken, who plays the T-X - a part machine, part liquid metal robot that makes Arnie, the T-101 look "obsolete". Loken does an excellent job an takes the character really well. I think thats the only good point.. Flaws fill this film from start to finish. You can partly blame the new directing that has modernised this film too much, and turned it into some scenes as a joke. Their are no gloomy, well filmed fight sequences as in the previous 2 films, and the jokes in this film are quite utterly poor. The worst idea of the lot was at the start, where Arnie (T-101) walks into a bar and gets his clothes of a gay stripper. Oh dear.. And it gets worse wen he walks out of the bar and puts on a pair of pink sparkly star glasses. Are we honestly expected to believe that a super-intelligent robot, with a database of millions of facts an information would put on these glasses? Thankfully, he sees sense and stamps on them. A slow start to a slow film. Their are plenty more of these stupid jokes, but lets avoid them. The fight sequences are actually not bad - you sense the feeling neither robot will win as they go on for long times. However, the CGI lets the sequences down a little, as with many parts of this film. In Terminator 1, you could become scared through stop-motion animation and real props and makeup. I'm afraid computers seem to have replaced that. No longer do you get shivers down your spine, but more of a sense to laugh. The only good CGI sequence is were the T-X transforms from being Katherines boy friend to her normal self. Its a really realistic scene, and shows what we can achieve in the special effects department. But there's a point you just have to stop. Whats more, this film shouldn't have even been made! In terminator 2, all the computer chips were destroyed along with Cyberdyne. Therefore its impossible to continue the saga. Nooo, because Arnie has a perfect excuse; "Judgement was inevitable". More like "I wanted more money, just like the film company and the box office". I'm sure everyone got enough money when the film was produced to be rated a 12, so it just so happens that adults and kids can watch it, equalling more sales. You could analyse more problems with this film all day, all I have done is picked out the big ones. For any Terminator lovers that enjoyed the previous film, you may feel almost embarrassed. For first time watchers, you will probably enjoy, as you have not seen the quality in the previous films. The only way to enjoy the whole Terminator saga is to not watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action movies usually don't manage to develop a deep and interesting storyline. And most of them don't even want to. That is fine, since there are a lot of people who like to watch an easy entertaining movie once in a while."Terminator 2: Judgment Day" proved that action movies can be so much more. Sometimes it would seem to you that incredible special effects don't let any financial room for a script (see "Waterworld"), but T2 had it all: Awesome directing, award-winning special effects, a very becoming soundtrack, actors who did an incredible job (Linda especially) and a story that made it my all time favorite.That is why Terminator 3 fails. The team might have produced a decent action movie a la "Predator", but in this case, they hit a whole franchise right in the face. The soundtrack is boring, the movie goes against principles that the first two laid out, the Terminator acts ridiculous, the pictures are nothing compared to the most of the time impressive and artistic scenes from T2.Makes one wonder.. why was this movie even made? The ONLY reason is profit. I know that the goal of every movie is to make money, but if you can feel that there's no love for the project involved, it's crap. There are people who say it is not fair to compare T3 to T2, but what else would you do with a direct sequel?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Cameron had nothing to do with this...and you can tell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The future is not set. There is No Fate but what we make for ourselves. I wish I could believe that...but I don't." The very opening words of this movie set up the attitude that it has towards the two movies that came before it: "Ya know those brilliant films that James Cameron created? We're gonna throw it all out the window." Action movies are often not very memorable. The reason behind this, I believe, is because those involved forget about character and story in favor of special effects. They regard character and story, the two most important elements, as an unfortunate necessity in story structure to give their filmed action sequences some semblance of coherence.James Cameron did what only a select few action movie directors have done: he remembered that character and story are what make the action memorable. The best action sequences are ones where you care about who's going to win, who's going to lose, who's going to survive, and who's going to die. You have to get your audience to care about the heroes so that the action actually has meaning beyond showing off your sky-high budget.Like I said, so few directors actually remember that, especially as time goes on. Michael Bay forgot about that when he made TRANSFORMERS. Cory Yuen forgot about that when he made THE TRANSPORTER. And Jonathan Mostow forgot it in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.The story's basic enough. John Connor didn't stop Judgement Day after all. He just postponed it.There. That does it. Basically, the first two movies become meaningless with this movie around because they throw away the "No Fate" concept that was integral to the first two movies. But why is "No Fate" not true? Could they think of a logical, thought-provoking reason? No. The reason they came up with is, "Because we need another movie." John Connor? Unlike Edward Furlong's portrayal, which showed a young, courageous, compassionate, intelligent, punk-attitude wiz kid who could easily be seen leading the Human Resistance years from now, Nich Stahl (a good actor with a bad script) shows a John Connor who cries and complains at every turn and does nothing remotely heroic throughout the entire movie.The Terminator? Although Arnold once created one of the most menacing villains in the history of the silver screen, and later a computer-programmed killer capable of learning and caring, here he is reduced to a one-line spouting source of "comic" relief.I prefer to think that this tarnish to Cameron's legacy was never made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****MINOR SPOILERS BELOW***** How many faults with this film? I can put up with over the top action which Hollywood loves now it has digital stunt men but action flicks are becoming just too stupid and T3 follows this trend. Arnie takes more of a beating in the first few scenes than in the previous two films together and comes out without a scratch. T1 and 2 despite their sci-fi fantasy still adhered to real life rules such as big metal robot hitting walls will cause damage, not in T3. We've all seen a Terminator endo-skeleton and the pistons controlling the neck and head so how does Arnie put his head back on after the TX lops it off?T1 and 2 were classic thought provoking films that reminded you of the fragility of human life and made you feel sad about the state of the world, T3 has none of this, instead relying on action and dumb jokes that are out of place.If you want to watch a film matching the quality of the previous installments then you'll be disappointed, if you just want an easy to watch mindless action movie then enjoy.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3, what can I say... It's probably one of the most difficult movies to have humble expectations first time around after seeing the previous movies of the franchise. How can you not expect it to be great as the prequels were - this is The Terminator we're talking about, right? Right?Ever since seeing Terminator 2 I always wondered if there would be another entry. How would they follow it up and possibly top them? As time passed there were various rumors here and there, but never anything concrete for a long time. James Cameron was involved, then he was not and so on and so forth. There were comics that I found to be quite interesting and served as tie-ins to both T1 and T2, in which you would for example see where the T1000 got his look from and what happened in the future war with its own twists and turns of events. I found it to be solid material that could be used for reference when making a third movie. After all, the future where the war with Skynet is happening and both Kyle Reese and the terminators are send back in time is the least covered part in the previous movies, and at one point did happen either way, wherever it was avoided in T2 or not. So to me it was the only logical way a third one would've been made, if at all, and it sort of would be both a prequel and sequel.Then, after a too long time when the hype kinda laid down, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines came along, and right of the bat it looked like they didn't have any new ideas. Even from the trailer I could tell that they were playing it safe and pretty much rehashed the second one. Watching the movie for the fist time was like playing the waiting game, when would something wow me? We're still stuck with the same, old characters that are supposed to be humanity saviors only this time completely without any notable development towards it. And when the end-credits rolled I was left unimpressed and thought to myself "well, that's just a so much weaker version of T2". It didn't do anything new, at all. At that time I couldn't even point out a single thing that stood out to me. It was just one giant "meh". Thrill and fear - completely gone. Creativity - huh, what!? Character development, emotions, purpose - not much here. Moving and powerful music - absent. Fear inducing and horrifying villain - nope, you just get this sort of T1000 with T800 parts and gimmicks tacked on that's here just for the action. No message, no meaningful conflict, no nightmares, no deeper meaning, nada, niente.Instead of everything mentioned you get: good action with some notable scenes and enough oomph. Campy humor that is often too much on the nose and more than once feels like a spoof of the second movie, almost reaching Scary Movie-like levels in some scenes. And a overabundance of the same one-liners now with slight variations. Seriously, people loved them in T2, but that wasn't by far the main thing. It was rather the cherry on top and way better implemented in small amounts and way more natural. Here it seemed that everything happening is for the purpose of forcing as much as possible of them down your throat and blowing sh*t up for the sake of blowing sh*t up. It's like they misunderstood or didn't bother to understand the appeal of the Terminator movies and just went with the f-yeah action.But after watching it a few more times I came to appreciate it for what it is. Had it been completely unrelated to the Terminator saga it would be much easier to enjoy it and pass it as a decent popcorn action flick. The main problems are the truly giant steps it has to fill in and the pressure while making it must've been immense. Jonathan Mostov actually does a fairly competent, sans the humorous parts, job and at certain times it does feel slightly like a Terminator movie. Its the writing that is just so incredibly lazy. Maybe it was indeed the smarter move in playing it safe as the perfection the previous movies achieved is truly something that does happen very rarely, so it may have underwhelm either way. It's not a bad movie, but it just tremendously pales in comparison and is hindered by having to live up to two of the greatest movies of all time. The ending is solid and a good way to lead into the dark future - it fits surprisingly well into the whole saga, however anything before that was, sadly, completely unnecessary and spread thin to the movies run time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, at Times, but Overall a Rehash of T2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Jonathan MostowWriters: John Brancato and Michael FerrisStarring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna LokenRelease Date: July 2, 2003MPAA Rating: R for strong sci-fi violence and action, and for language and brief nudityRuntime: 1 hour and 49 minutesStudio: Warner Bros. PicturesWith T2 becoming such a big success, both critically and financially, a sequel, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was made. It was the first Terminator film to not include James Cameron (writer/director of T1 and T2) and, unlike the first 2 films of the series, T3 whilst well received by critics, was not well received by audiences. I do believe that T3 has entertaining moments, but is overall very underwhelming and never reaches the quality of the first two films.The plot of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines takes place roughly 10 years after the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. In the year 2004, adult John Connor is now living life as a drifter and tries to erase his identity, after his mother, Sarah, died from leukemia. This is because, even though Judgement Day was stopped from occurring on August 29, 1997, John has visions of war between the humans and the machines happening. Unable to locate where John is in the past, Skynet sends another terminator, the T-X, which is more far powerful and advanced than the T-1000, to eliminate as many other human resistance members, as possible, including John's future wife, Kate Brewster. However, the T-X accidentally finds John, but luckily, a reprogrammed T-850 model 101 Terminator is sent back in time, by the resistance to protect John and the other resistance members.Coming to the performances, the standout is, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger, being still incredibly conniving as the T-850 here. Nick Stahl plays John Connor and I thought he was pretty good in the role as a character who is afraid of the potential war that could happen in the future. He also shares solid chemistry with Claire Dannes, who is also solid as Kate Brewster, though I didn't find Kate to be an interesting character. Kristen Loken plays the T- x (which is modeled as a female, by the way), and although she doesn't have many lines, in the film, she still gives a menacing performance as the T-X. However, she is not as memorable as Robert Patrick's T-1000 from T2 or even Schwarzenegger's villainous Terminator from T1.The action sequences are pretty cool, though, with solid direction from Jonathan Mostow, and some pretty incredible set pieces. I mean, how can anyone not like the scene where the T-850 smashes through a building, whilst hanging from a crane? The effects are also great. although a good portion of it is CGI, it's at least very convincing CGI, for the most part.Screenplay wise though, this movie pretty much fails, right down from the film's main problem: the plot is pretty much a rehash of T2's plot, despite a few differences from its predecessors. This movie also has some very interesting ideas, on paper. I thought some of them were well executed on film, such as the T-X being able to control other machines. However, some of them didn't flow well with the film, such as killing Sarah Connor off, between films. I do think that it's a pretty ballsy move to kill off an important character between films, but this idea goes nowhere. Also, whilst the T-X is supposed to be stronger than the T-1000, she doesn't seem much stronger, and doesn't feel as threatening as the T- 1000. This movie also has lots of attempts at humor and it is pretty hit-and-miss, to me. There some jokes that made me laugh, such as the past where the T-850 tells a store clerk to "talk to the hand", but the rest of the humor falls flat and comes of as just plain silly, namely the infamous moment when the T-850 tries on glasses with lens that resemble stars (it only got weak chuckles out of me).The best part about T3 is definitely the ending. I don't want to spoil it, but I will say that not only does the ending help in the character growth of John Connor (I won't tell you how, to avoid spoilers), but it also sends a great message about having to accept fate even if it is a terrible one.Overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is nowhere near as good as the first 2 films and has huge problems, mainly the rehashed plot and rough screenplay. That being said, the film has entertainment value, at times. Still T3 is not a smart or original film at all, though it's never boring, at least.I'm going to give Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines a C (5/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symphony of Steel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is a movie that revels in the sheer power of steel, metal, and iron. The action scenes (and the movie is almost one continuous action scene) are like a symphony of metal pounding on metal. The two combatants are advanced killing machines from the future. The T-X's mission is to kill John Connor; the Terminator's to protect him. In carrying out these missions, they pound one another through walls, cars, helicopters, and even toilets. The T-X pursues John Connor in a crane truck, the truck's wrecking ball smashing dozens of cars. The Terminator shoots rocket propelled grenades into the T-X, the grenades blasting her down an elevator shaft. And the sound effects amplify every explosion and clash so that you feel enmeshed in a world of steel.Perhaps all that sounds like a giddy fanboy's reaction to an action movie. And perhaps that's fair. There's much to criticize here. The human characters are unbelievable. Nicholas Stahl as John Connor doesn't seem like the inspiring hero he will become. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster comes off silly and shy when she should be tough and grimacing. Moreover, the Terminator's one-liners are, well, corny. But this movie is like a heavy metal concert; the lyrics don't really matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't match it predecessors, but a good action film nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Terminator film is a classic example of an intense action/horror scifi film done just right. Everything is perfect from the bleak setting to the depressing storyline about a future where the machines have taken over and their only salvation is to try and mess with time itself. The second film, also directed by James Cameron, was more of a straight-up action film, but just as great as the original, if not even a bit better. And then there's the third one.It's not as good as the first two. The lack of James Cameron shows in the lack of vision. It's not as ambitious as the first two, the actors aren't as talented - Schwarzenegger though once again shines in his trademark role, though nothing new about him is uncovered - and the story tries to patch some of the plot holes of the previous movies, but only manages to create new ones in their stead. Even the character of John Connor, played by Nick Stahl, the centerpiece and lynchpin of the entire saga, suffers from being reduced to a whiny little jerk. I much preferred the determined kid of the second movie to this fatalist loser.That being said, this is still a really good action film. One of the best I've seen in the new century and well worth the price of admission. The movie suffers from the common sequel syndrome of trying to do everything bigger and better, even if it usually ends up jumping the shark, so to speak. However, in this case we get Arnold "Real-Life Hulk" Schwarzenegger in his last honest action superstar role, really flashy fight sequences, cool chase scenes and lots of dakka. The hotblooded male in me refuses to regard this as a bad thing. And quite honestly the ending manages to reach some of that bleakness that coloured the first two films and made them so jarringly touching. It's not quite there, but you get hints.I rated this movie quite high because I honestly think that it's a great action film. If you're looking for a worthy successor to Cameron's Terminator films, this isn't it, not really. It's still quite an enjoyable ride if you're just looking for a thrilling action piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This third entry in the Terminator series finishes off Arnold Schwarzenegger's involvement, and also brings the Skynet/Judgement Day story full circle. It turns out that the destruction of the Terminator chip at the end of Terminator 2 did not put Skynet off trying to terminate John Connor: nor did it stop Judgement Day, it simply delayed it. Back comes another Terminator (this model emulates an attractive young woman, Kristanna Loken), and back comes another Schwarzenegger Terminator to act as protector again. John Conner (played here by Nick Stahl) is living a hobo-type existence off the radar. Sarah is dead from cancer, and vet Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) gets caught up in the running and trying to escape (it turns out that her involvement is very much not the accident it appears to be.This film is much more of a romp than 1 and 2, with some elements definitely played for laughs (the reappearance of Earl Boen's psychiatrist Dr Silberman, for instance). The action is excellent, with some terrific set pieces, and all the principals please although I could have done with vet Kate being a little bit less shrieky and hysterical, not that I blame her.This film is undoubtedly good, solid, action fun. But it doesn't have the "Wow" factor which its predecessors had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say that I really hate people that write long reviews of movies. After all is just a movie is not like a vital part of history. So I will keep it short.Not a bad movie. The action scenes are well worthy of a Terminator franchise. The main problem I have with this film is mostly the character of "John Connor". Maybe it was the writers or maybe just the actor who was wrongly casted. I don't know.In the first film they start with this mystical image of the one man responsible for the survival of the human race "John Connor" In the second film we have a smart, witty and somehow strong representation of the kid who will become the leader of the resistance against the machine.However; in this film we have a sissy, insecure, scary cat with an amazing lack of confidence dude by the name of "John Connor". The portrayal of the character was pathetic. Are you telling that this joke of a man will be the saviour of the human race. Sad.Then the other problem I have with this movies is that stupid scene was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 ?It can't be bargained with" and now John did just that. Sad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.Anyhow, I promised I would keep it short so I will.Seeya</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"a decent action film that doesn't let you down if you separate it from the other films in its franchise."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are problems which plague any sequel in a franchise. Primarily keeping the tension by increasing the apparent level of danger the characters are in, usually this will involve a new enemy or more enemies.Terminator 3 attempts to do this by introducing us to the TX. Whether it is the new director or the actress herself the TX somehow doesn't feel right.And not feeling right is the real problem with T3. The original terminators had something terrifying about them, something dangerous but none of this is present in T3.It is a decent action film that doesn't let you down if you separate it from the other films in its franchise.There is one note to add. The ending is magnificent, beautiful and brave. In my opinion no other pop corn fair that i can think of has ended in such an excellent, thought provoking and visually stark manner. T3 deserves a lot of credit for this.A special mention must go to Marco Beltrami's brilliantly used soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown action yet story carries it till the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A TX (Loken) machine from the future is sent back in time to assassinate John Connor (Stahl) in a bid to wipe out human kind's chance of survival.12 years had passed between the crowd pleasing sequel Judgement Day and the release of this 3rd part and at a time of technical revolution, that prevailed over story in this disappointing if still watchable sequel.The Matrix had broken minds, Lord of the Rings was epic swiping Oscars for all departments and such, the science fiction genre itself was a stepping stone tester for digital effects which this film justifies right from the off.As the previous films started with two naked men appearing in an electrical storm this film uses the same effect with a stunningly blank Kristanna Loken and the usual coolness of Arnie. Before this there is a reasonable opening as Nick Stahl's John Connor, a depiction of insecurity and hurried decisions, sets the game straight for us that had forgotten. The Terminator had tried to kill Sarah Connor in 1984 before remerging years later to terminate John Connor himself. Arnie, again the good robot, is programmed to protect John Connor and new character and significant protagonist of the future Kate Brewster (a fairly composed character from Claire Danes) The story moves along with its futuristic ethics and mythology that were used in the previous two films, though without the conviction and importance Cameron laid down so easily, and his presence, and lack of it, is certainly profound here.Every term spoken by the T101 feels action orientated with a heavy weight. He burdens everything with a macho ideology whilst the camera shoots him in a hero motive. There isn't a free flowing spontaneity about the terminator, which is a dreadful shame.The opening stages of Connor laying the current situation down are good, giving the film a dramatic implication as he reveals his loneliness and depression over the lack of happenings since the postponement of judgement day. The scene on the bike with the animal in the road was well shot, very simple and capturing the feeling of bad luck perfectly.But after that director Jonathan Mostow simply over indulges the film with a hyperbole of action sequences that would never ever happen in their presentation of realism. The big truck (trying to capitalise on good technique from previous films) sequence is so over blown and unnecessary whilst the final sequences and scenes in Skynet are all perfect timing and minimal chances have an alternative action orientated drivel.As Terminator Salvation showed as well the science fiction genre has become fixated with special effects rather than using the plot to the advantage of the story, which this justifies. Whilst the essence of the terminator origins sees this one through there is little salvation in that this is not a match for the previous two releases.</fullReview>

We spotted them easy, but these are new. They look human... sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero on him. Sarah Connor: Look... I am not stupid, you know. They cannot make things like that yet. Kyle Reese: Not yet. Not for about 40 years." Okay Thats About All The Flaws...The Plot Is That More than 10 years after 'Terminator 2', John Connor now exists only as a drifter - living 'off the grid', so no more Terminators from the future can hunt him down. Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful &amp; advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems &amp; is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers &amp; leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?

		<shortDescription>Not a scratch on the originals, but T3 rounds off the trilogy nicely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I'd like to say I'm a huge fan of Terminator and T2, unfortunately T3 is worlds away from the quality of them. It's not an easy task to live up to two of the best sci-fi films ever. However, that doesn't mean it isn't worth a look because there is a lot to like.Jonathan Mostow takes over from James Cameron in this installment and deserves big credit for carrying on the Terminator journey well and creating exiting action along the way. Some of the set pieces are breathtaking, including a brilliant fight that involves a crane and the graveyard scene is very good as well. In the action stakes, not much more could have been asked for is probably the films best strength.As for the casting, I'm sorry to say that its mostly bad news. Arnie seems too old and didn't have the same impact on me as he did in the previous films. He looks a little bit out of place in some of the action scenes as well. The T-X, played by Kristanna Loken is OK but by the far the weakest villain of the trilogy. Loken is not bad in the role but the character could have been much better. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster seems out of place and is definitely miscast. But there is Salvation (ha!), Nick Stahl is excellent as John Connor and carries on from Edward Furlong easily. I was disappointed not to see Furlong back as he was brilliant in T2 but Stahl is good and was unlucky not to be offered to reprise his role for Terminator Salvation (you can hardly argue with Christian Bale though).Overall, Terminator 3 is an above average action film and packs some great action into the running time and has an interesting plot with a few surprises I didn't see coming. Another high point is the excellent, downbeat ending that leaves you wanting more. Don't expect another film as good as Terminator or T2 because you will be disappointed, just enjoy the thrills, the story and the excellent action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, if very unnecessary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Terminator movie continues in the line of classics by starting off very similar to how the first two did - opening with our main characters, and then introducing a Terminator, appearing in the nude and obtaining clothing and a vehicle quickly. This whole film can kind of be likened to a past-his-prime wrestler trying to overcompensate for his age, as it does kind of seem to be riding on the trends set by the first two...but hey, it's the goddamn Terminator, and this movie is entertaining as hell.Okay, okay, this movie is very unnecessary and goes against every moral the original two Terminator movies stood on. It takes a 180 from the moral of the last two, which was that you can choose your own destiny, and now apparently says that you CANNOT do that. I guess nine years off changes a film's direction a bit.I think another weird thing about this is that the Terminator series has always balanced humor with serious moments, but this movie is way darker than the others in thematic alone, with a more bleak outlook in general. The others were sort of hopeful in their darkness and chaos, with a light to guide our heroes out of it, and an overall triumphant feel, but this one is just dark and depressing. As such, the humor is a lot more vibrant and stupid this time around, clearly trying to lighten the mood of the overwrought plot.But really, this is just all about the high-octane fist-pumping action scenes, which are maybe a little more dragged out, but they still draw the viewer in with skill and class, with the first half of the movie being unbelievably good at it. T3: Rise of the Machines is not a classic, but it is a very good movie that I don't think Terminator fans will want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember guys not everything is as it seems. The atmosphere is fine for pure action, I didn't see anything serious or catchy as a sci-fi. The worst I think was the easy repetition of the Terminator's plot (a hunted human with super assistant, a super hunter, and a hunt through the city). It's nearly the second one again however with a lady cyborg this time. Which's cool and modern. But made it so predictable and transformed the whole matter into slasher movie with big explosions ! The whole unseen-story about the end of the world has gone too far, too complicated, and too exploited ! (Originally the matter of the doomsday in 1999 as false happening is truly laughable and such a disgrace to the first 2 movies). The climax wasn't up to what preceded it. The CGI was good, but for sure not a milestone like the sequel of 1992. Director (Jonathan Mostow) makes good "noisiness" along the way, actually there is nothing more to offer. Despite looking a bit weary and old (Arnold Schwarzenegger) hands in nice performance, but as just a funny take on his persona from the previous 2 movies. (Nick Stahl) is annoying as John Connor (could it mean that the future leaders would be boring !?). (Claire Danes) is great but with nothing great to do. I liked the way (Arnie)'s trade mark "I'll Be Back" had been handled without hackneying (I'm back, she'll be back, .. smart), still the Terminator's gags are the most enjoyable moments in here. I recall well that early at the time of its release, it was one of the most smuggled movies ever. Also, at the IMDb the first rating was something like 9,8 !! That what made me learn about the IMDb's ratings as not always the golden truth, hence nothing is as it seems (After 6 years it's now 6,7.. Would fairness win eventually ?). All in all, it's fair action, with funny moments, but there is nothing more even as imaginative work, otherwise: Talk to the hand !</fullReview>

It's not enough that the writing and the acting sucks, among other things. It just doesn't feel like a "True" Terminator movie. It's more or less what Joel Schumacher did to the Batman franchise. Kristanna Loken as the female Terminator added absolutely nothing to the role; she's merely a stop-motion puppet with a pretty face parading around in vacant, dramatically vapid scenes with no genuine flair or excitement.Nick Stahl is pretty much a wimpy John Connor rather than a leader. Not even Arnold's role as the titular character can save this train wreck of a celebrated franchise. In fact, the only good thing about T3 was the ending. My advice: Watch the first two films and never, EVER watch this crap fest. The third times not the charm for this one. AT ALL.</fullReview>

He drives recklessly at night on a bike, in short John Conner is in something of a rut. In to his world the film introduces a new Terminater or 'Terminatrix', dressed in a red leather outfit and tightly pinned back hair Kristianna Loken is the machine a teenage boy with a Sn'M fixation would have built. She severely scans her environment, killing her targets with a sadistic smile playing across her cold, model looks. As a machine she doesn't match up to the other two. Her technology seems neither as intimidatingly huge as Arnie or as strange or sinister than the T2. The special effects are OK ,but nothing unique and the action sequences seemed neither plausible or particularly spectacular. Claire Danes as Johns future wife irritates with her shrill whining, and has little chemistry with her two other leads. Nick Stahl is a talented actor and brings a introspective, confused element to the older john conner. Arnie worked hard to regain a younger mans physique, but there is no hiding his age. More ill advised 'Terminater humour' fell flat with me, and was a poor replacement for a darker tone considering the films theme of a nuclear Apocalypse. The films script has huge plot holes in it and inconsistencies which other reviewers have pointed out. Sadly T3 fell foul of the ringing cash machine behind the script and with a 18 certificate, more adult script it could have been so much better. Since it is inevitable that they will make a T4 i hope they at last make the film T2 and T3 should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's pretend it didn't happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We could almost unanimously agree that Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best action movies ever made. Having established that, I understand that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had a high standard to live up to, so it should have been no surprise if it didn't quite reach the level of its predecessor. I've watched T3 twice now, which tells you that it's not entirely the disappointment that sequels often turn out to be. The action sequences definitely rival those of the other movies in the series, and in fact surpass those of many other action flicks, which is made possible by the fact that the characters in the high-speed chase with multiple crashes and explosions are not human and thus can survive any crash. Kristanna Loken is HOT as the Terminatrix. The movie dishes out the characteristic ironies of time travel and glimpses into the future, although none quite as powerful as the revelation in T2 that the Terminator crushed by Sarah Connor in Part 1 became the prototype for the machines that would eventually terrorize humans. It is interesting to see John Connor grown up, living with the paranoia that comes from his experience with the Terminator, and his feelings about his destiny as the leader of the human race. He is not quite the adult John that I pictured after seeing the trash-talking, street-savvy teenager in T2, but I can accept that people may change, especially after a traumatic experience of nearly being killed by a machine. The movie does not forget the more memorable moments of those which came before it, including a variation of "Come with me if you want to live," and the recurring character of Dr. Silberman, although Arnie's delivery of "I'm back" makes me cringe and think that sticking with the good ol' "I'll be back" might have been less cheesy.All in all, it is a good, though not great, movie as long as the viewer remembers that sequels rarely live up to the ones before it, and yet...this film leaves me with a disturbing, unsettling feeling that it should never have happened. It feels like an afterthought, which we all know it was?one last blockbuster in a fading acting career, one last attempt to make some money on the phenomenal franchise. More than that knowledge of Hollywood, however, I feel troubled as a fan of the first two movies and of Sarah Connor. While I understand that Sarah is only a fictional character, this movie seems an insult to her memory. The fact that the Terminators still exist, are still trying to kill her son and take over the world, makes Sarah seem that much more tragic. After watching her nightmares in T2 which portrayed nuclear explosions with horrifying realism, and cheering her on while she overcame the impossible, I cannot stomach the thought that the machines still come into existence and try to take over. It makes me glad that "Sarah Connor" did not live to see this film.In summary...it's a decent movie and worth a couple viewings, but when you go back and watch T2 again, just pretend that T3 never happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Terminator Trilogy is terminated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Terminator, which was released in 1984 was spectacular for its time. Although, some of the special effects may seem outdated today, it is still an outstanding movie. It told the story of Sarah Connor and how her son would one day be the leader of the world resistance against the machines that have taken over the world, the last chance for human survival. A Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back to 1984 to kill Connor before her son is born, but Kyle Reese (Michael Beihn) is also sent to protect her. It's a simple storyline, but it was still an effective movie. A sequel to this movie was inevitable, thus the spawn of Terminator 2: Judgment Day in 1991. The special effects were better and the story was expanded. This time around, the terminator once again played by Schwarzenegger, is the good guy to protect John Connor, now 13, and the T-1000 is sent to kill him. It was pretty much the same movie, but with bigger and better effects.Even still, both of those movies, directed by James Cameron, are one of the best sci-fi action movies ever made. Jonathan Mostow, director of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, could learn a thing or two from him. The original storyline was massacred. The entire theory that "The future is not set" is ignored. It is paraphrased in the opening as "the future is still not written", but the writers forgot about it because from the plot twist at the end, the nuclear war is inevitable. There is no stopping it. So, then, that means that the future is set and there really is no use in trying to change it. "Fate is what we make of it" no longer applies. The writers should've researched the previous Terminator films before starting on the third.What this movie lacks is James Cameron's direction. I give it a six out of ten stars only because of its action and the fact that the villain is now a hot and sexy female robot. I hear a fourth one is in the makings, and this is a mistake. Domestically, this film did not do well, so there is no hope for Terminator 4. I still like this movie because the action genre is my third favorite movie genre. I recommend this movie to any action movie lover, but not for Terminator fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first "Terminator" is still the best, but T-3 is a very good sequel.Terminator-2 lost much of the frantic pace of the first movie. the Terminator villain played by Robert Patrick was just not menacing enough for my taste.Linda Hamilton ruined her character by shedding the terror and eventual quiet courage she displayed in the first movie.In T-3, Linda Hamilton is absent and John Connor is now an adult living "off the grid" in order to hide from any new Terminators sent from the future.Nick Stahl does a good job replacing Edward Furlong in the role of John Connor.Stahl plays John Connor as a reluctant hero, who tries to avoid his inevitable fate, until the very end of the movie.Arnold Swarzeneggar will never be a great actor, but he IS "The Terminator".Arnolds robotic, monotone delivery is often hilarious in T-3. In one scene, Arnold is driving a demolished hearse, when he calmly states: "We need a new vehicle". Kristanna Loken is excellent as the female cyborg.I hope to see her in the next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than I expected... and I had low expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came in knowing it would be a lesser movie than its predecessors, but I was unprepared for the unadulterated travesty that it turned out to be.T3 invalidated the end of T2, and threw away the whole idea of "No fate but what we make". It also had a radically different tone from the first two. Where they were dark and intense, albeit leavened with some humor, this installment was self-satirical and rife with gags and misquoted one liners.The acting was nothing to write home about. Arnold was a better actor when they didn't let him speak much. Nick Stahl made of John Connor a whiny idiot who I, personally, wouldn't follow in traffic, much less a war. Kristanna Loken was attractive but brought no life to the role. And poor Claire Danes suffered through perhaps the worst miscasting I've ever seen. Her character HAD no character to speak of.I'm troubled by rumors that a fourth movie is in the works. I have this to say in response: LET IT DIE, YOU JACKALS! THE FRANCHISE HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH! IT'S WRITHING IN AGONY ON THE FLOOR, BEGGING FOR DEATH! HAVE MERCY!I give this steaming pile of movie a 3 out of 10, and so high a rating only because Kristanna Loken is hot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving face...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800, this time sent back to take on a far superior model that is programmed to destroy other terminators, however also the fact remains that destroying the data and chips merely postponed judgment day and John Connor (Nick Stahl who replaces Edward Furlong) tries to follow in his mother's footsteps in preventing the war but finds his attempts are futile. Also there is Claire Danes who is also targeted with Connor for termination and who will also grow up to be his wife. Terminator 3 can be seen as somewhat of a comeback for Arnold after witnessing what could possibly be the longest slump of an actor's career. After True Lies, Arnold made what has to be some of the lamest action flicks of his career (And that isn't even counting his embarrassing ventures into comedy and the Batman franchise) Terminator 3 can be seen as a comeback as it is superior to everything he's made since Terminator 2 but generally inferior to everything before. (Let alone the first two of the series) One peak at the title and one is somewhat shocked at the negative emotions regarding this film, a glance at IMDb's forum labels this to come up every now and then as Arnold's worst flick. (Let's not even get into the fact The Terminator and Commando fall behind Eraser and End Of Days in the best category (Shudder)) but this is not the case and Terminator 3 holds up fairly well in the story department which is handled very well. The action sequences are also exciting and Arnold is in good form. The main flaw is the new villain who just isn't as imposing as Robert Patrick or Arnold Schwarzenegger from the original. The novel touch here is that the machine is a female but clearly she doesn't do anything the T-1000 didn't do and even though Loken is adequate, it becomes obvious that she couldn't really hold her own against Arnold. Also the return of Earl Boen (The holdover from the first two movies) is wasted and is basically forgotten soon. Indeed the whole movie feels rushed and seems to indicate that the pace is quick because the director is on a deadline. Indeed usually you want movies to be shortened but for once I would have liked to see it longer so I could have found out more about some key moments which aren't developed due to the main plot. In other words Cameron could make a movie compact and complex. Jonathan Mostow can only make the movie compact and although Terminator 3 is worth watching for the genre fan, it goes without saying that it doesn't hold up when compared to the first two. Which is of course a given.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real shame it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard there was going to be a third installment of the Terminator movies, I had high hopes, because T1 and T2 were both absolutely great. My first thought when I heard the title 'Rise Of The Machines' was that the movie was going to be about the war against the machines, because that would have been entertaining, not thinking about the story then. But I was wrong. It's another movie about a Terminator that was sent back through time to kill John Connor. In T1 and T2, that story fits. In T3 it doesn't, and that's because of some major plot holes and disturbing story lines.T3 is a good and descent action movie, but it just wasn't supposed to be. After seeing T2 it was clear that the war against the machines was prevented by the T-800 and John and Sarah Connor. But apparently it wasn't, and that's actually the biggest plot hole of all. In T2, when the Terminator and John Connor are driving to Byson in order to stop Sarah Connor from killing him, the Terminator says 'Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war'. In T3, John Connor says 'You shouldn't even exist. We took out Cyberdyne over ten years ago. We stopped Judgment Day', and the Terminator says: 'You only postponed it. Judgment Day is inevitable'... So in T3 he means that, whatever happens or whoever gets killed(including Byson in T2), Judgment Day is inevitable. That's the exact opposite thing that was claimed in T2. And actually, the fact that a T-X was sent back through time, isn't possible according to the story of the previous films. Because in the beginning of T2, Sarah Connor's voice says "The computer which controlled the machines, Skynet, sent two Terminators back through time". So there can't be a third terminator. I can imagine some people might think 'But maybe they didn't know that a third terminator was sent back?'. Yes, that is a possibility. But that wasn't the intention of the story. Otherwise Sarah would have said "Skynet sent three terminators back through time". It just doesn't make sense. I wish it did, because I like Arnold and I know Jonathan Mostow is a talented director. And that's why I think it's such a shame that this movie was directed by a very smart man, who blew his reputation by directing T3. Breakdown and U-571, two amazing movies full of suspense, both directed by Jonathan Mostow. I was very impressed by both, and from then on I knew Mostow has got what it takes to make good movies. With T3, he probably saw his big chance of becoming one of the most popular directors in this century, but I think making sure that T3 would be an amazing film was too hard for him. He thought he could, but I think he overestimated himself. James Cameron is a legend and has already made 2 of the best movies ever with T1 and T2. No one could have done a better job, including for the sequel. Damn it Mostow, you're such a talented director, I wish you said no to T3.I can understand why Schwarzenegger agreed to play in this film. Actually he did a pretty good job. It's not his fault that his character 'had to be' different than in T2, he just did what they asked him to do. In T2, the T-800 said that he can learn things from humans. But what we saw in T3 was a bit exaggerating... First of all, the T-800 couldn't have known that the car keys were above his head. In T2 John showed the T-800 that some people hide their keys there, but nobody said this to the T-800 in T3, so he couldn't have known that. They didn't teach him a lot of human things like in T2, so the scene in which the T-800 couldn't kill John and chose to shut himself down, is actually pointless. Conclusion: this movie shouldn't have been made. I just hope Jonathan Mostow realizes his mistake, and hopefully he'll get another chance to prove he really is a good director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ya when the original creator doesn't make a sequel, it generally turns out bad.Terminator 3 is really rushed and plain. It focuses more on action and suspense rather than story like terminator 1 and 2(even they had a lot of action to go with their story).The director couldn't get Linda Hamilton to play as Sarah Connor, so he had to eliminate her from the story...............ya thats not a good idea.Basically the whole story is about Arnie saving John and his future wife from dying.............thats it, have a little action in between and thats terminator for ya.Though the movie is bad it has some good. The Special effects were very nice, and the action sequences were intense.Fans of the originals will be really disappointed with this movie.P.S. Arnie doesn't say "come with me if you want to live" and "get out" in this movie, even though he did in the originals, these are classic lines man!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film played better for me on subsequent viewings, but I never have been able to escape the feeling of "what is the point"? I mean, we basically end up at the end of this one no further than we were after the second one. Sure, time wise we were carried further and we learned some things about John Conner. But I think they did the character a disservice basically showing how pathetic he becomes after the second film.Performances are good in this and the effects are top notch, best of the series. I think in the end, had this film actually taken us to the events after the rise of the machine and given us the battle ensuing, it would have made for a better film. As I said, as is, the film just kind of leaves you in the same place the other two left you in and I know for myself, I was really hoping for something more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subpar Terminator 2 Rehash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that struck me most about Terminator 3 was how liberally it borrows from T2. Once again, we're trying to stave off judgment day. Once again, a shape-shifting robot who is sent back in time to kill John Connor, and another Arnold is sent back in time to protect him. There's another vehicle scene, the initial confrontation between the terminators, etc. The problem is, the plot just isn't all that interesting because we've already seen it all done and done better in T2, with better actors too. It's too bad Edward Furlong was dropped from this project because I have a feeling it would have been much better with him onboard reprising his role as John Connor. Having Linda Hamilton and maybe even Robert Patrick would've been nice too. As it was, though, Claire Danes and Nick Stahl just didn't really cut it, in terms of likability or chemistry. Kristianna Loken was not a convincing villain as the T-X either. In a nutshell, I think T3 was a so-so rehash that attempted to one-up it's predecessor and fell flat. You might as well just watch T2 again instead...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than The Terminator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit ever, the T-X, arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines. The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, the T-850, that is sent back by the human resistance. Together with John Connor, it must stop the rise of the machines or all humanity will fall.Like i've said in my past reviews, I never appreciated the concept of people going back in time to do all these things so this will happen in the future as much as other people did. However, the second movie decided to top it off. Nw the reason to watch this movie is to find out why is there still a Judgement Day and what happened to John Connor's mother.Well, they decided to take the easy and risk-free way out of it, turning this into a big, fun, and loud action film. Well, it's worth it. Although it doesn't put the mind into the plot, it certainly is (ironically) a better movie than the first.Now you guys might go crazy because I said this. I just like it a lot more than the first film, although not as good as the second. The action scenes are tons better than the first two films and the CGI really done well. The plot is still the same as ever and the dialog is campy and fun.So the general word in this film is "fun". Don't take it too seriously. It has a lot of humor and equal drama. The action sequences are fantastic and has one of the best car chase sequences I've ever seen. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a bigger and better role in here and Kristanna Loken, playing the new Terminatrix, has a perfect performance. Her role on the Terminator is great! It's just that good! The other two (Nick Stahl and Claire Danes) were also good.The score, although not the same as the first two, is good. The direction by Jonathan Mostow is good, although this sequel is unnecessary.If you would just like to have a good fun time on a popcorn movie, this is the film for you. It's, not only a worthy sequel, it's a great film.</fullReview>

I as American Shadow Vice President Brad HD Morgan joked back "Nick stall?" Nick Stahl is the actor who plays the Future American leader Connor. In a previous bunker joke during the Cuban Missile Crisis President Jack Kennedy said "I hope you know there's not enough room for everyone in the White House Bunker." to a response of great laughter to support President Jack Kennedy and his joke.

The whole point of the first 2 movies is to stop the machines and Sky net. Why couldn't they create a virus to take down skynet.

		<shortDescription>A great addition to the Terminator series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was amazing.I'm not exactly sure how somebody can 'fool themselves' into liking a movie just by being a die hard fan, but that's not the case with me. I was a huge Ninja Turtles fan, but still think the third movie was horrible. As much as I liked the first two Back to the Future films, I believe that the third in the trilogy isn't good at all. Alien 3? Don't get me started.The Terminator trilogy, on the other hand, happens to be the best in my opinion. Each movie in the series is by far excellent. The first one is great because of the intriguing storyline and dark feeling; the second being awesome because of the several scenes of hilarity and sweet special effects; the third belongs with the first two because of the mind-blowing action that slams you in your seat. The ongoing storyline that continues throughout all three movies is awesome.The action scenes, I guess, are where I'll begin. The chase/fight scenes were absolutely remarkable. If anybody tells you that the effects looked cheesy, shoot them in the face if a gun is available; if not, bludgeon them with the nearest blunt object. The special effects were by far better than they were in T2, so every action scene that occurred (which was very often) was stupendous.For true Terminator fans, consider T3 a treat for including several references to the past two movies. I'm a gigantic fan of the Terminator series so I was able to pick up on several small references, which was really cool. Some cameos from previous characters were nifty (including Dr. Silberman).The storyline isn't really a rehash of the first two movies; it went on a different pretense. The TX's mission parameters weren't only to assassinate some of the Resistance leaders, but to also see to it that Judgement Day begins.I don't understand many people's big gripe with the ending. I would discuss it, but I won't give out spoilers to people who haven't seen it yet. But I'll say that the ending was invariably appropriate, in my opinion. I guess you'll either like it or hate it. It's not that I feel it's a brilliant ending, but I do think that it was the best way to end this particular film.If you really like the first Terminator movie, you'll most likely appreciate Terminator 3. If you didn't like the first one, then it's hard to say. Either way, expect to see some of the greatest action sequences you've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but it feels recycled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard they were making a third Terminator movie, I was expecting it to be absolutely horrible. Fortunately I was wrong, but T3 still isn't great. T1 impressed audiences with its dark and gritty style, and T2 awed people with its spectacular action scenes and special effects. T3 is merely a passable summer action flick with a recycled story. Sarah Connor is dead and John Connor (Nick Stahl) is in his twenties. Judgment Day never happened, but John is paranoid, and is constantly looking over his shoulder. The film gets going when a new female Terminator called the T-X (Kristaana Loken) is sent back in time to kill Connor, his future lieutenants and his future wife Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes). Again, Arnold is sent back to protect them. Arnold explains to John that Judgment Day is inevitable, but John and Katherine can't accept that, so they attempt to stop Judgment Day once and for all. Again. And there you have the film's biggest weakness: Deja Vu. T3 brings nothing new to the table, except a daring ending.T3 has the most lighthearted feel of all the Terminator films. The sentimentality from T2 has been replaced with jokes, most of which are misses in my opinion. The performances here are merely adequate. While the T-X is by far the most powerful of all the Terminators, Loken still doesn't exude the predator like quality Arnold and Robert Patrick had. I do like how the T-X beats up The Terminator from the start. The good guys feel outmatched, which Terminator 2 never quite achieved until the end. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are satisfactory in their roles, but I can't say I miss Edward Furlong. Arnold has more of a drill sergeant attitude here as opposed to the "friendly" Terminator in T2. His attitude here is much more believable IMO. He also deserves credit for getting back into perfect physical shape. The action scenes are fun, but some are overblown to the point of absurdity. Stan Winston's makeup and robots are very impressive, and the endo-skeletons are scarier than ever. However, the film's greatest merit is its ending. (SPOILERS) Mostow took a big risk ending the movie with the start of the nuclear attacks. He could have gone the safe route and given the movie a happy ending. Now there is an opportunity to make a fourth Terminator movie that does not follow the same formula as T1; it can just be about the war against the machines. I just hope a studio will have the guts to make it without Arnold.</fullReview>

Whiney John Connor is still complaining that his life sucks and that it is going to end with judgment day. Well duh!!! we figured that out in the last movie. Then there is the TX. My god, what a way to attract movie viewers. The director and writer must have been thinking "this movie needs something raunchy, something hard core. Hey i know! BOOBIES. Even better, boobs in a hot tight leather jacket." My friends came walking out of the theater saying the best part was when the bitches boobs expanded to a triple e cup. Plus the ending is sour.Everyoneknows judgment day is coming, why over dramatize it? Everyone knows that kate and john are going to win the war against the goddamn machines. This whole movie was a wasted opportunity. They should have gone with a whole new plot that involved something different than judgment day and a female terminator. So I am asking nicely directors and writers, if there ever is a T4, think about us, the fans, and how much we will despise you if you make another T3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Terminator had good special effects and a good plot. The second had really good effects and a decent plot. The third had great effects and a weak plot.The explanation at the end is what really bugs me about this movie. They claim that they couldn't shut down the machine brain because it wasn't just in one place, but existed spread out in servers all across the country.The thing is, that's stupid. If that were the case, then the artificial intelligence would have died shortly after it launched the nukes, because all those servers would have been destroyed. It would have been like taking a large knife, trying to remove your nose by jamming the blade straight into your skull. Sure, you'd get rid of the nose, but it wouldn't help your brain much.Also, the idea that the Terminator had killed Conner in the future and was sent by his wife is flawed. Way back in the first film, we learn from Kyle that the human revolt against the machines had been successful, they had already won. Sending the Terminators back was a last-ditch effort to prevent that defeat. Therefore, there should have been no Terminator sent after John years after the machines were defeated.Also, in the first movie Kyle says that the time displacement equipment was to be destroyed after he went thru. From T2, it's obvious that they sent the second one after he went. However, it's hardly likely that they would change their minds and not destroy the time machine after that; they already knew what a problem they were facing with just the two Terminators that had gone through already.Also, if John's learning that he's going to get killed by a Terminator in the future (which he was told), then he should be able to avoid it.Not to mention that a nuclear-safe bunker set up for VIPs wouldn't have obsolete computers, radios and other equipment; restocking and updating it would be a periodic activity.There are so many basic plot flaws in this movie, the only value it has left is the special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Noisy Sequel Starring Lots of Crashes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see "Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines" at the recommendation of my older son, who I had introduced to the "T" series on video. But I bet I was the only one there for the continuing story, as I was the only who seemed to get the comments and jokes in reference to the past movies so I guess they hadn't seen the other "T" movies. Arnold's lines were pretty much just replay references to the older movies. I'm not sure I got all the plot points in the quiet dialogs, such as they were, in the lulls between car crashes -- sent back to do what, when, by whom? And while the vehicle chases were now construction cranes and fire trucks, it was just metal upon noisy metal upon more noisy metal. It's becoming common in sci fi these days to have the best way for an alien enemy to infiltrate humans is in disguise as a gorgeous blonde, let alone an indestructible one.But what made the movie for me was the wonderful in context line in the midst of one counter-attack: Nick Stahl as the grown-up "John Connor" looking in wonder at Claire Danes: "You remind me of my mother."(originally written 8/31/2003)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap - to the Nth degree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK well, there's not much i can say that hasn't already been posted. i'll not go into detail about all the obvious goofs and down right mistakes! i think everyone feels this film is a big let down in regards to the other films in the series, and i feel the same. i think it's how you feel no emotional connection to the characters, they're just there and gone. do big dramatic, emotional ending to the terminator, it just blows up and the film continues on. and another downfall, which i think was one of the biggest blunders of the film - the TX, an extremely advanced "female" terminator. first of all, a female terminator, nobody wants to see a female terminator being more advanced and stronger than arnie as the t-800. i mean, if this was all real life, i would say the T-1000 was a much deadlier enemy and could take down the TX (who seems rather stupid) no problem. but back to reality. i remember reading about this TX before the film was released and how it could reprogram other terminators and i was thinking, this is a great idea. but what became of it?- the TX reprogrammed the t-800 (which you didn't even see) and it came to get john with a very odd painful expression on its face, but ended up bashing that car to bits - WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! i don't understand that bit, was it just trying to bash that car until his system was back to normal?? but i think the biggest mistake in this film (for me anyway) the part which when i saw it made some vomit actually come up into my throat was when in the convenience store he actually said - "TALK TO THE HAND" to the clerk. what the sh1t was that all about?! the terminator turns round and shoots the guy, thats whats meant to happen! or at least throws him or somethin! but i suppose that started when he was in the gay bar and he grabbed the guys hand and spoke to it. no bloody start to the film, like the other ones. sadly this is just a basic action film, with no depth. the only good part was the ending. i wont say stay away from it because I'm sure anyone who has seen the first two films will certainly have already seen this. so i'll end this by saying, this film only ralates to the other 2 films by name and by nothing else. i'm giving it 5/10. simply because for an action film it was alright.p.s. does anyone think Paul Verhoeven would direct a good Terminator??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no future without ammo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find a lot of the comments and flubs mere coincidence compared to the major accidents of intentional filmography and story telling. I have several major arguments with this film, as with many adventure films. How can so many rounds of ammo be fired by alleged professionals and no one gets hit? Why do they throw away expensive gun magazines and guns that run out of ammo, as if it's an old head of cabbage? And, most of all, where do these slim robots carry all the fuel to fly, and all the ammo to fire continuously for 30 seconds? There is never any sign of a fuel tank nor ballistic cache. Will Hollywood please employ an engineer to design these devices instead of an SFX jockey; or worse, a director. As an actor of 35 years, I can faithfully tell you that directors make actors do really stupid things we cannot control unless wealthy enough to have point options. Even Liam Neeson, one of the greatest actors of the 21st century, has a hard time battling directors. Those who get their way: Sharon Stone (on the outs), Julia Roberts (considered mostly bi-polar), Dustin Hoffman (with no debate, he commands), Jeff Goldblum (ad-libbing since inception and basically playing the same Dustin Hoffman/Robert Blake "Let me try to throw the other actor in the scene off balance so that I look great" garbage -- Will Smith beat him in ID4). I can't tell you how many times that kind of sufferage has been pulled on me by another actor/actress. Jeff Goldblume deserves a kick-in-the-crotch lifetime award. Dustin Hoffman deserves a one-man show award. Really. Any performance the man has ever done was a one-man show and he needs to stop harasing the entertainment industry with his single-minded self hero worship. I tell you...; Robert Downey Jr is better than every actor. Truthfully. Drunk, stoned on crack, and a week without sleep, he is better than them all. Why do you think he keeps getting stoned? No challenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's back. So what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To give you a taste of how I feel about the latest addition to the Terminator franchise, let's have a look at the memorable lines that came out of them.Terminator 1: I'll be back.Terminator 2: Hasta la vista, Baby.Terminator 3: Talk to the hand.There's one of your problems. The first two lines are cool, but the third one is not, just like the movie. It doesn't even come close to measuring up. (the fact that "Talk to the hand" conjures up images of Fran Drescher really doesn't help it either) This movie is a very lame descendant of the other two. Everything good about this movie has been done even better in the last two, with the exception of the new villain, who is hotter than a four alarm fire. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are okay. The problem here is Arnold. Whatever gift he had for playing this role is not here. Instead, he just looks and sounds ridiculous in this movie. Now, as far as the plot is concerned, what happened to the feeling of hope and the message of "No fate but what we make for ourselves." It is lost in this film, replaced with "No matter what we do, we're gonna get screwed by Judgement Day, anyway." Bottom line: This movie is not a worthy successor to the other two Terminator movies at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Terminator equivalent of Jurassic Park 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Terminator 3 finally launched in theaters, my friend and I were beside ourselves with excitement. After all we were and still are two of the biggest Terminator fans on the planet. T1 and T2 were superb! Awesome story, awesome action, awesome visual effects. Too bad T3 ended up mediocre... While boasting the most impressive visual and CGi effects of the trilogy (this is evident by the increased number of T800 Terminators on screen at once at the beginning of the movie)the script was basically just the T2 script taken and changed here and there. Its the year 2004 and John Connor, leader of the human resistance is now in his 20s. Even after the destruction of the Cyberdyne computers in T2, John still feels unsafe and so is a simple bum who lives off the grid so no computer network can locate him. As with T1 and 2 a Terminator (TX) arrives from the future to hunt down the human saviour and terminate him. Thankfully Big Arnie is back, and once again steps up to the plate as Johns protector. The movie is basically then just degraded into a bunch of highly explosive and action packed sequences, eventually leading to the flicks climax when Skynet becomes self aware and begins taking over. If i haven't already said so, T3, Like Jurassic Park 3, disappointed me a hell of a lot. While boasting the most impressive spesh fx of their respective trilogies, the overall qualities of the films is subpar, and T3 is degraded into a simple beer-and-pretzels action romp. Average at best, though still worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In watching this film i had indeed had high hopes, sadly yes i was disappointed but there is something a story there underneath the surface which had promise. The Terminatrix is an interesting addition to the series, some may say pointless and merely a backwards step, however this is not the case. The Terminatrix is a mixture of both the Terminator models from the first movies and has additional inbuilt weapons would do make for a more powerful enemy. However this is not very well executed and with more work and direction could have been an astounding piece of film folklore in a similar way to the T1000 from T2. The action sequences whilst fun, did not rival the impact of sequences past. This is primarily where the movie fails. With more focus these sequences could have been key in establishing the movie as a must see film. The music score is also passable at best. Whereas in T2 again, the music score built the tension up and made you feel that you were along for the ride as well. In this movie however, you will barely notice that it is there, this is a massive disappointment. The film also is very short, the previous two films being well over 2 hours, this goes little over 1 and a half and feels rushed. The ending of the film however is a shock to the system and a completely UN-Hollywood ending, a very good surprise which leaves the door open if necessary for another sequel. Overall, the ideas are good, with more work and care it could have stood out like its predecessors, however sadly it falls rather flat. Check it out but do not expect more than an average flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch T1 then T2 you "hope" no one will attempt to make another sequel unless they can match 1 and 2. Unfortunately T3 does not meet this line, in many areas. 1st - there's too many jokes for Terminator where it should have been left out. 2nd - Not being sexist but a female Terminator having a fight with the Terminator doesn't go well she should have been a support character or something and we could have seen some excellent fight scenes. Although her character was made to be "tougher" than the Terminator it still makes you laugh. I see this as a serious movie not one where you crack some jokes - not at least at the Terminator's expense.On a positive note this may set up a base for T4 and hopefully someone may bring it back to level we know it as.......The movie is enjoyable but for me, not as 1 and 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable But Dumb And Unnecessary Second Terminator Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Connor, a resistance leader of the future, is being pursued by the T-X, an ultra-sophisticated terminator cyborg sent from the future with a mission to kill him. He and a childhood friend are being protected by another terminator while trying to escape the T-X and avert a nuclear holocaust caused by Skynet, a US military computer network.This movie has the standard modern-day Hollywood blockbuster virtues and vices - it's great-looking, fast-paced and has some terrific action and special effects, but the plot is a lame rehash of another movie (in this case, Terminator 2: Judgement Day), the characters are uninteresting and the film lacks any kind of depth or atmosphere. If only they'd stop making movies by committee, with three writers and nine producers, and give the director some creative control. However, there is a lot to enjoy in this film - Loken is wonderful as the sinister T-X, cheerfully murdering people and reprogramming machines to do her bidding, and it's fun to see a petite girl in a jumpsuit throwing big Arnie around. The stuntwork by Simon Crane is fantastic, as are the visual effects by Pablo Helman, Don Taylor and Stan Winston, and there are some great sets, costumes and chases, especially when the T-X hijacks a crane and destroys half of downtown Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger gives it his all (this was his last movie before being elected Governor of California) but was much better in the original movie as the bad guy, romantic leads Stahl and Danes do what they can with their ropey dialogue ("It all makes sense now !!"), and Boen has an offbeat cameo reprising his character from the previous two movies. An enjoyable flick, but check out the original The Terminator instead - that movie had a tiny fraction of the budget of this one, but a great story, real characters, style and atmosphere. Remember kids - just say no to Big Budget Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the originals, but still pretty good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is set in John Connor's(Nick Stahl) young adulthood with Judgement Day pulling closer. Sarah Connor is now dead and he is nothing more than a junkie. Now, a newer model of the terminators called a Terminatrix is after John Connor, an childhood friend of John named Kate Brewster, and others before the beginning of Judgement Day. And once again, the terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger)is back to protect.The movie is the third part of the story making it a trilogy finally and it, like most trilogies, isn't as good as the originals. Although it's not as good, the movie is still quite entertaining. The effects are just as good as Terminator 2: Judgement Day and the movie holds twists that make the movie quite sensational. The movie was just all around good although it had multiple cheesy parts in it. But its a Sci-Fi movie, so just look past that. Overall, the movie was well done and you will enjoy if you look past the flaws and let yourself be entertained.I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Make, Same Model, New Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2nd sequel to the original '84 sci-fi thriller and follow-up to the '91 sequel was a long time coming, perhaps a few years too long. That could be the main reason the Linda Hamilton character is missing. They managed to eke out a respectable big-budgeter still superior to most of the other action thrillers coming out in the nineties, and especially nowadays, but right off the bat it lacks some of the innovations in the previous sequel. Arnold just duplicates his cyborg character from 1991, perhaps even a bit less human in quality. The new TX super-villain, in female form, is just a bit more advanced than the T-1000, with fancy new weapons and an ability to control other machines (wow, who saw that coming?). The first few minutes essentially duplicate the beginning of the '91 film. The writers seem unable to come up with anything new at this point, even though they had a dozen years. I was dismayed to hear the TX utter one of her first lines and realize it copied one of best lines in "The Hidden"(87), which itself emulated the first Terminator film. Or, she's just copying the T-1000. Same difference.Another big drawback is the central character of John Connor (Stahl). You get the sense that if he wasn't forced into his destiny as a military leader and messiah, he'd end up as a typical loser in a dead-end job, if not homeless. It's as if he's given up or something; where is the kid who could out-think most adults in the previous movie? I guess it's fashionable to create these loser-type characters in Hollywood's screen writing 101 classes who then do a miraculous turnaround, but it's also tiresome. Connor obviously feels something bad may still occur, otherwise he wouldn't be living 'off the grid.' Shouldn't he be using his brain and talents to keep track of developments in advanced computers which may pose a danger? This seems a motivation not thought out, as in the previous 2 pictures; does he think Judgement Day will happen at the start of the film or not? Of course, it's revealed his mom passed away not long ago, which may explain his despair, as Arnold calls it, but it's never delved into.All that being said, Stahl does a pretty good job of conveying the world weariness associated with someone too young to have so much baggage. You warm up to his character very quickly and are following along through his eyes most of the time. Danes is surprisingly energetic in a role she nabbed in the last minute, I hear. And Loken as the new Terminatrix? She sure has the look; I suppose it's interesting to see a female figure with so much power. The FX are consistently impressive. Mostow is a very good director, and this film could be a case study of seeing the difference between a very good director and a great director (James Cameron). It's fascinating to wonder how much more, if anything, Cameron could have done with the existing material. As mentioned, this film lacks some of the surprises and suspense of the first two; for example, there's never any doubt as to who is the heroic cyborg and which is the nasty one. Mostow basically steered a straight course toward the one point where the audience is unclear of what may happen, the very conclusion. There is where you may find some surprises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the last two masterpieces, I had no idea on how to grade this movie. While I enjoyed it very much, it doesn't reach the levels of the first two. Jonathan Mostow did the best job he could, and told his own story. Arnold was good as usual, and his jokes were very funny. Nick Stahi was great as John, and Claire Danes was surprisingly good as Kate Brewster. The real star of this movie is Kristanna Loken as the Terminatrix, she really kicked some ass in this movie. Her evilness is covered with her beautiful looks and perfect body. The screenplay is well written and has a good story behind it that made the first two classics. Do not assume that this is going to be as good as the first two because it won't, just think of it as a new beginning for the series with a new director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original film was "WOW!". The first sequel too but with an lighthearted injection of fun. This second sequel (T3) inspires the same exclamation but purely for the mystery that it was ever made at all. OK that IS a bit rough, but forgive me for ever thinking the T2's "Dark Road At Night" ending provided some finality to the story! According to Terminator 3, you can't beat fate after all, and Arnie is back for the ride. Skynet was of course smarter than the heroes thought and is up to it's old time traveling tricks again. This time it sends back a girl Terminator and 'luckily' the good guys manage (again) to send back their own as well, in the form of Arnie (again).Yes, a whole manner of repetition, but sadly the greatness of the first two isn't part of that. Granted, there is some great action such as a fantastic car chase, and there are some good one liners from Arnie (isn't that a given?), but the story is beyond 'paint by numbers. Most of the characters exist only to the further of the plot and many of those advancements are just end up being far too convenient. Finally, without spoiling it, the ending just isn't as well thought out as it could have been. It poses an idea that while clever at first, falls apart under scrutiny.When it comes to the crunh, Terminator 3 is a simpe action romp with some great effects and visuals. It is good to see Arnie reprise his role as the T800. However, to be part of the Terminator series, I feel that a film has to more than that and more sophisticated than this derivative sequel. Watch for the sake of completion, but just like Alien Resurrection, this film is a bit of a blight.****SPOILER****The rationale of the film was that Skynet used the Internet to survive destruction, by copying itself onto thousands, if not millions of computers around the world. The idea is that, like the Internet, Skynet couldn't be destroyed completely - break one part of the web and the system can connect via another route. It is a great idea but after the world is decimated by nuclear war, where does all the electricity come from to run these computers and thus maintain the Internet? Forget for a moment that the infrastructure the network depends on would be severely damaged. Skynet, future ruler of the world and humanity, is going to try to take control on a handful of Pentium 2's with dial-up connections? Remember, it is 1999 in this film.****SPOILER COMPLETE****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a piece of trash. It's nothing more than a film that tried to outdo the action sequences of its two predecessors. No characters development. In fact, it more features character un-development as we see Jon Connor go from amazingly cool kid with budding leadership qualities in "T2" to whiny 20-something wuss in this movie.And it also seems that the director went to great pains to undo the time travel logic of the first two films. Time travel stories naturally have to deal with paradox, but you can't resolve paradox one way then turn around and throw that reasoning out the window in favor of another explanation. They did, and it completely undermined the reasons why we were told the first two stories happened. As it stands, Jon Connor had nothing to fear from the Terminatrix. If fate is after all inescapable as Arnold declared, then Jon could've walked right up to the Terminatrix and planted a big IL' kiss right on her lips and she would have still not been able to kill him because he was fated to be the leader of the future resistance having survived nuclear Armageddon with knowledge of how to fight the machines. Stupid.If they'd wanted to keep in line with the idea that fate can be changed, then here is a much better idea that could have been a plot device to make an exciting "T3" movie:Jon is in his 20s. A third T-100 comes back and informs him that new information uncovered AFTER the dispatching of the first two protectors is that one last Terminator was sent back, but its primary mission was to first protect Cyberdine's existence, then eliminate John immediately following the nuclear strike. Cyberdine executives, understanding how radical the research their company was doing, had made extensive back-ups of the information thought destroyed in the previous movie. After the destruction of the main lab in T2, further research was shifted to the military when Cyberdine reformed as an exclusive military contractor whose existence is classified so as to be protected from future "terrorist" threats.The plot could have been just as exciting and action packed, but with a new formula. Instead of running AWAY from the enemy terminator, John, the T-100 and supporting cast would be on the offensive actively trying to bring Cyberdine down while the T-1000 or T-X or whatever is disguising itself as a military/Cyberdine big shot and doing everything to ensure Judgement Day and still try to eliminate John so he can't lead the humans to victory 20 years later.Ah, what could have been...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the Community are Complaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a few edited parts of Terminator done by the internet forum community. So I will address this. The major theme that seems to hit hard and what the community has done was to re-edit the entire movie where the T-X original program was to upload the virus program onto the mainframe as one of the beginning sequences, and her first choice after that was to find John Connors FIRST, instead of running around shooting high school students which is what supposed to be after that. In fact the internet community, and I agree with them, is that Kate Brewster was an absolute drag to the entire movie and as a result was completely removed from the original movie remake done by this small fan community. Most people who are fans of Terminator aren't the kind of people who watch it once or twice, they can watch, 10 or 20 times. Whenever that is done several scenes become extremely irritating, too long or too short. They kind of stand out like a sore thumb. Those include, Arnie wearing Elton John's Sunglasses, T-X machine's breast size increase, and corny lines about "I like your car/bike", and "you got a big gun". Cheesy lines simply won't do. It didn't display any intelligence as "I'll be back" as in the original Terminator 1 franchise. Overall, if I have to see this movie, I really have to watched the re-edited version (done by myself or community) or it's a torture to watch. The biggest problem I have regarding Terminator 3 are: 1) John Connors is Stupid and way too weak 2) Kate Brewster's a real drag to the entire movie. and 3) T-X machine is too busy killing small cockroaches (e.g. John Connor's friend) instead of trying to find John Connors first or show she was uploading some virus program. The movie, I believe runs too short and the scene where the crane runs demolishing the city is way too long. It's an overkill and cheesy. The decision by Arnie where he wanted to add the extra scene was helpful when his body is crushed through the crane going in the building. Unfortunately the rest of the city demolishing is unnecessary. Kate Brewster scene can be eliminated entirely. There's no place for her in John Connor's life (romance with this woman is out of the question), at least for Terminator 3, because it makes John Connors look like a wimp. This is not just my opinion, but a opinion of a fan community that has to gross out and watch this movie over and over. Mind you, it's a minority who does this, but certain parts really are irritating. How would you like to see Arnie wear Elton John's Sunglasses 20 or 30 times like me? LOL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how do you re-invent the wheel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that James Cameron wasn't helming this third installment, I didn't expect it to be very good. And I was right. How do you re-invent the wheel with the shock waves he brought us with Terminator 2? (Still one of my favorites). At the end of T2, there was an element of hope that was instilled by the actions of the Terminator, John, and Sarah Connor and the destruction of CyberDyne. Well, fast-forward to this movie, and the writers simply tell us that "judgement day is inevitable". Okay, then I guess that means we should have another sequel to milk this franchise for everything it has. I wouldn't be surprised if this turned up as a Saturday morning cartoon, too. So back to the important point that the writers probably thought the audience wouldn't realize about the future: time is always in transit in motion- and the future is compiled by what happens in the present. There is no set unprecedented event that will happen regardless.Another flaw that was never explained (not much really was in this film and instead left to clever one-liners, "talk to the hand"), was how did the government all of the sudden after the demise of CyberDyne conjure up all of this spectacular and much more sophisticated technology on such short notice? And why did the Terminator have to go into another bar as soon as he arrived, get the same kind of clothes, and the director even threw in a comic relief gag when leaving...Hmm, I keep thinking of the second one...John Conner was a whiny wimp, and I never believed for a second that this was the future leader of the free world. Claire Danes had more balls than him. I'm not saying Nick Stahl wasn't a good choice (I saw him in "Bully"&amp; he was a bastard), but if the writer(s) gave him a front-row seat (like they did with Edward Furlong)instead of playing the helpless b$#ch, I think it would've helped in becoming a better film. Claire Danes was on her way to becoming the next Sarah Conner, and the TX wasn't very threatening. No special powers to speak about aside from controlling machines. Did I see that once on the Sci-Fi channel? Once again, it was the work of the writers/producers condescending to the audience thinking sex appeal would sell more tickets. I think it did. The film had a look to it as if it were an early-eighties, made-for-TV flick, whereas T2 had blues, metallic greys, and shadows. This didn't feel like a Terminator movie.I really hope they don't make a Terminator 4 and chip away some more @ Cameron's reputation and our intelligence.A day or so after I saw this, I was talking to someone about it, expecting them to tell me how they were disappointed they were in the flick, but they said the opposite! Guess they don't get out much!And I guess she's the kind of person filmmakers of this dreck want in their test audiences. You really CAN fool all the people some of the time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where is story line? I have always loved the Terminator movies (women know why) but this just lacked the story line! It was just Arnold kicking butt, which we see in every Arnold movie. I have to admit the special affects were great and the cleverness and creativity was not that bad but the story went no where. The only thing that kept you watching the movie was to see the stunts, affects, and violence. Definitely not a movie for kids under seven. Nick Stahl, playing John Connor, does a fantastic job! Bravo!Bravo! Encore! Encore! But like I said before no story line, James Cameron is losing his touch. Everyone who has seen the first two movies can only guess what the third is like.

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie, yet A Flawed Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of Terminator 3, I must say that I was surprised. Didn't the second one sum everything up nicely? I went to see the film with a large amount of doubt and misgivings. However, I was surprised. The acting was pretty decent (except for Claire Danes, ugh) and Nick Stahl does a decent job of portraying John Connor. The Terminatrix is sleek and powerful, and the creativity behind this machine is very well thought out. However, there is a major hole in this story. One of the beginning lines is this: John Connor says that "when I was 13, another Terminator was sent to kill me as a teenager. I was protected by a Terminator." However this cannot be true because of the simple fact that in T1, it begins in May 1984 (dialogue between Reese and the cop says so) so therefore Sarah could not have given birth to John until 1985. In fact in T2, when Robert Patricks liquid terminator character looks John up in the police computer, it says John birthday is 2/10/85. So, when John was 13 that would make the year 1998. Wait just a minute though. Judgement Day, according to Arnold's character, occurs on August 27, 1997. Whoa, talk about not thinking through the entire story before you write it! Holy snap! Also, in T3, Sarah Connor dies in 1997. Believable, only except for the fact that John says in T3 that Sarah battled Leukeimia for 3 years after the doc gave her 6 months to live. So, if the T3 storyline is true, Sarah died when John was 16! In 2001! But she couldn't have died then because in T2 Judgement day was supposed to happen August 27, 1997. Yes, I know they stopped it and all that, but apparently, the writers in T3 had that happen in 1998. So apparently the writers could have done a lot better job. In fact, another thing is John is supposed to be 23 in this movie. That would make the year 2008. So if John was born in 1985 (according to information given in T1 and T2) that would make the information (age-wise) accurate. So why the heck couldn't they make everything else accurate? Let's just hope that for T4 (which is in production) that they think the script through a little bit better, and try to keep it true to the story that James Cameron developed. Let's face it, his was a lot better.The SFX were incredible, especially the high speed chase scene about half an hour in. The story (except for the flaws mentioned above) was touching and remarkably well done. I loved the ending scene, where you see the nuclear warheads falling at various locations around the world. Overall this was not a terrible movie. I don't think it held up to the first two, but it is a good continuation. My Rating: **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Conner, now an adult, in fear of the events that took place at a young age, lives off the grid--no phone, no job, no credit cards. After failing twice, SkyNet sends their most advanced machine to date, the T-X or Terminatrix, to not only kill John, but his future wife as well. Once again, a Terminator is sent to protect John and his future wife. Not knowing how these terminators were sent, considering he thought he destroyed SkyNet, John will soon learn something that will change his life...forever.James Cameron does not return in writing or direction, which could be one of the main problems with the film. Jonathan Mostow now directs and turns this into the average summer action movie that keeps you entertained and puts a good finish on the series (even though there are plans for a fourth and fifth). Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator. Nick Stahl is John Connor. Claire Danes is Kate Brewster. Kristanna Loken is The T-X.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Spoiler for T2 as well- You know why James Cameron wasn't directing, right? Good, we can get straight to the point then.In the ending of T2, John Connor and Terminator eliminated all possibility of Skynet and Judgement Day happening. Thereby changing the future by altering the past, a popular SFI-FI time travail concept.The series would have been fine if they left it, but they didn't, they had to go into the other time travail concept; You can't change the past. So they just HAD to bring back the Terminator, completely screwing up the canon of the series; "They sent back two terminators" (Opening lines of T2) and they also just HAD to have a female Terminator, which is fine, but with the whole "you've got to travail in the buff" thing, they also probably HAD to focus on TX's behind, I don't remember if they did or not though.In fact, they only real good parts of T3 were the special effects, which were nothing special.T3 is not my first choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Above all, this movie even failed to create (for me) any real sense of urgency or excitement. Which is the essential point behind an action movie.Some of the problems inherent in Terminator 3 1. Essentially, the plot is wrong. Terminator 3 negates the positive vision of the previous two movies (that Sarah and John Connor can prevent or at least seriously influence the future). T3 abandons that vision for a entirely fatalistic one (that, in fact, Judgement Day cannot be prevented or even really influenced).2. The timing and pacing of the movie just seem off. The car cash sequence runs on too long, the battle in the bathroom runs on too long, the robo-tanks are boring, the Skynet "planes" are easily destroyed, etc.3. The new Terminatrix is essentially the same as T-1000 in T2, so she's literally boring, whereas the T-1000 is really new and exciting in T2. You're frequently surprised by the T-1000 in T2 whereas you're just bored by the Terminatrix in T3. The acting by Robert Patrick was quite good (really effective in being scary and mechanical), whereas Kristana Loken is just.........well, I just wasn't scared or even impressed.4. The plot was muddled so that it felt both boring (repeats in many aspects T2) and just messy, so you never really felt the suspense which was very pronounced in the first two movies.5. Claire Danes was a poor substitute for Linda Hamilton. Again, Linda Hamilton brought an unusual range of depth of emotion for an action movie. Claire Danes was just your archetypal cardboard damsel in distress.6. The action sequences were simply not that impressive. If you notice, while in T1 and T2, the characters were really fighting for their lives - they're wounded, bloody, covered in debris and sweat, really battered. In T3, the only thing the hero John Connor suffers is that the Terminatrix breaks his leg at the very end of the movie. Kate Brewster isn't even scratched. You never get the sense that their lives are truly in danger. In fact, the Terminatrix and John Connor only come face to face twice (both for extremely short segments) and she doesn't even wound him (until the very end of the movie).Overall, this was a really mediocre movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, I really liked Terminator 3, but no historic milestones here. Kristanna Loken, now my favorite evil cyborg, is also easy on the eyes. Like Arnold, her acting leaves something to be desired but their characters are emotionless machines, after all...well almost. T-X departs from the standard set by Terminator 1 &amp; 2 in that she IS equipped with RAGE. Previous Terminators were supposed to be unfeeling killing machines determined to carry out their directives, although Arnold's character does develop a degree of compassion starting in 2.Great special effects, gratuitous cyber-violence, and even a surprise ending combine to make this one fun to watch. The prolonged fight scene in the restroom has comedy; the T-X instantly rolling back onto the moving truck is wicked cool, and Arnold hanging from the crane is both!</fullReview>

I always feel a bit fooled the second time I watch one of his movies because they suddenly feel so empty. All the splendor is gone. T 3's main characters actually feel like humans - not like the caricatures that Cameron tend to rely on. The movie also has a nice Japanese feel to it. There's both drama, fun and serious action in a good combination. Excellent photo, effects and editing. I'll give it 4 of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to go to the cinema and watch Terminator 3 I was afraid that this new sequel will be nothing but pop corn cinema. And I was unfortunately right.Does anybody need this? The entire concept has a main fault. In Terminator 2, the robots failed to kill John Connor as a kid. Why are they sending a robot back into the past when he is grown up? He will probably be more prepared and ready for facing another terminator. I would have sent the new terminator into the past when Sarah Connor was a kid or even earlier when she was being born.What I liked were the old terminators in the movie and Nick Stahl was really great.What I did not like was the stupid sun glasses joke, the action scene in witch the T-101 is hanging on a vehicle which is just the equivalent of the truck chase in part 2, the scene when the T-101 has a malfunction and tries to eliminate John Connor and the entire movie... ... this is just pop corn cinema ignoring the higher needs concerning an intelligent plot for the real fans of the Terminator series. I was really disappointed. Will part 4 be an Alien clone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lots of fun, though no T2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go into this expecting a fun action picture that is not going to be at the level of the first two movies, you'll probably have a good time. There are some fun action scenes, a fair amount of amusing jokes referring to the previous movie and a really hot evil robot played by a model whose vacuous model stare works perfectly in the role. But no, it's not as good as the first two. Those movies moved like lightening, moving at a breakneck speed that kept you from catching your breath. T2 was a thrill ride from beginning to end, and T3 never works up that sort of momentum. Its holes are easier to pick at than the previous movies (although not terrible by action movie standards) and the ending is downright disappointing. But if rather than comparing it with two of the best action films ever made, you compare it with more typical action flicks, it's superior to many, a good but not great movie that is energetic fun most of the time with some terrific moments here and there. Yes, it would have been better directed by James Cameron rather than some director so obscure that I don't know how he finagled the job, but it's still effectively directed. Just lower your expectations a little bit and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People are complaining about Jonathan Mostow. I think he is a very good director. What people should be complaining about is the Clare Danes character. I was rooting for the bad guy..girl all through this movie because of her. Someone said she is in danger of becoming like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Don't insult Jennifer, she takes chances with her roles and she has never annoyed me in the way Clare Danes does in this movie. SPOILERS!!! Other then her the movie is pretty good as far as movies like this are concerned. We have Arnold returning again and again and again...he must of been offed in this movie about 400 times but he comes BACK. The Terminatrix is pretty interesting, she is a lean mean killing machine who Arnold says in indestructible but we know different. This movie is basically a Fail Safe type movie. Computer virus takes over the worldwide defense system (skynet). And it turns on itself so it can annihilate all humans. So of course Clare Danes and John Conner are the only 2 people who can thwart this and Arnold has to save them so they can have children and lead the resistance. There is some anti war Dr Strangelove type ending pasted on. All I have to say is if John Connor has to be stuck in a fall out shelter and spend the rest of my life with the Clare Danes character I would take my chances with the nuclear bombs if I was him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To add a third installment to a very good film and it's even better sequel takes a lot of doing,particularly if you are going to press on with the project without the director that is responsible for the success of the first two.James Cameron is no where behind the camera for T3,and this will be obvious to anyone watching.Also absent is Linda Hamilton,another big reason for the success of the previous two films. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger,the man we have come to know and love as the T100,doesn't quite seem the same anymore.The computer generated special effects are just a little too obvious for my taste,and the entire film takes on the feel of a small,made for cable,or straight to video dud instead of a big screen blockbuster.I don't watch very many sequels, because they all too often disappoint me and ruin my memory of the previous film.I thought,in this case that since the second film surpassed the first in terms of quality viewing,that this third installment would at least measure up to one of those two.Much to my dismay,I was wrong.If this film could not have been directed by Cameron, it should have been given to someone on the same class as him,such as Ridley Scott.Perhaps it would have stood a better chance of being good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...of course, my expectations were not that it was going to be better or even as good at T2. There was just no way that would happen. So I was expecting it to be as good as Demolition Man or something(which I thought was just ok).Turns out, T3 was way better than Demolition Man! And I personally thought it was as good as the first Terminator movie.We had awesome action sequences(especially the chase with the crane!), witty one-liners(which every Arnold movie MUST have!), and a decent plot that didn't seem as depressing as one would think it would be. Nick Stahl was great as John Conner. He's a better actor than Edward Furlong, although he doesn't look much like what Eddy looks like. Claire Daines' character was a good new character too. The T-X was the hottest robot I've ever seen, and she was one tough machine! But I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of her, and focused more on the plot of judgement day. [SPOILER]And the twist of the T-800(Arnold) killing John Connor in the future, as well as judgement day actually happening sets us up for a great new kind of new Terminator movie for T4(if it gets made), because it could take place in a post-apocolyptic world with the human surviors battling against the machines. It wouldn't be the classic "good terminator gets sent back in time to protect Connor/bad terminator gets sent back in time to kill Connorz" scenario. It could be taken to a whole other level because of the plot of T3!Good movie, great set up for T4![END SPOILER]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to pass Judgement on the Day I saw T3?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********** Spoilers ********Well, what can I say? It's still Terminator chasing Terminator and John, plus a host of new chracters. Mind blowing Action and FX and Arnold back in his Terminator boots is good enough for a funtime movie with popcorn.However, that not what I expect from a T movie. I am a siccccckkk fan of T movies, and to speak the truth after watching T3, I was not sure whether I was dissappointed or satisfied.I was very happy to see that it wasn't a complete dud like the Matrix Movies and also in the fact that making a Terminator sequel (especially after the emmensly successful T2), would be a very difficult proposition (especially with mentor Cameron not around), it doesn't fail to catch attention.What makes it disappointing is that it tries to make a mirrior image of T2. Now it's impossible to make something similar to T2 and not get criticised. T2 was perfect. And one can't beat perfection. And after waiting for all these years and watching T2 for around 100 times, I really wasn't hoping to see another T2 look-alike.Arnold's grown older in the years and he seems tired, but still delivers. What makes the film so weak is the script. It just looks like a concatenation of great action sequences one after the ohter. By the time you start comprehending it, lo! it's over.The film should have had a much longer run-time with space given to character interactions, which is totally absent in the movie. Plus, there are no sub-plots which takes your attention away from the main theme as so cleverly applied in T2. what made T2 stand alone shining in spite of T1's brillance, was the fact that it ultimately showed a new aspect of the Terminator, which was not viewed in T1. So that given away, and the audience knowing more or less all about T800 thanks to the previous movies, there was not much that T 800 could bring new in this movie. Especially, what I hated most was the slap stick humor of the terminator which is not expected from him. I mean, c'mon he's a killing machine deviod of any human interaction, how can he have humor? The T's humor in T2 stood apart beacuse it was incorporated situations where his brutality and ignorance of humans made it look humorous, rather than making it crack ludicrous jokes like "Talk to the Hand". I mean, if someone asks a terminator for money, what do u expect from it? Either, it kills him or if he's a good terminator gives a stare such that the quails way from him! but not here.Also, there are couple of situations in the movie which has been borrowed straight from Arnold's Commando. The car driving downhill amidst trees and the line "I lied". Not original at all! Again, some of Arnold's one liners are really inappropiate to the situation.Consider this: kate's father has just been hit by TX, T800 blast her off an elevator shaft, and while Kate's dad is in death thores what does he do? Does he go near him and tries to see what the injury is all about? No way- he stays there and says - "She will be back". I mean who gives a damn at that instant for that line!Now coming to John Connor! well, if this idiot is to be the leader of human resistance, God save us! The John we witnessed in T2 shows a rebelious quality and self proficency that made the audience feel like that he could be a leader in the future. Even at that age he single handly escapes the T1000 in a bike initially and gives insights into what needs to done correctly at times even when the adults were faultering (one instance that stands apart is the sequnces of T800's chip destrcution by Sarah!). Well, the T3 John is a confused mess. Not only does he try to scare Kate with a phony Gun, but also gets locked up by kate in a Dog cell! now, if you know that JD will not happen , you should be happy about it and go on with your life as a normal person. Again, if you are apprehensive about JD you should be doubly cautious about your surroundings, rahter than being a mess as portrayed in T3. Even at the finale, it is Kate who tells him what they were actually doing in the shelter! the idiot couldn't derive it on it's own. Also, if the leader of human resistance gets killed by a Terminator during the war beacuse he had "weakness" towards it, maybe skynet should not have bothered to sent 3 terminators in the past to kill such a wreck!Next: Sarah Conner is missing having died of Leukemia! kate tries to fill in as a proxy for that strong female lead, and to tell the truth she does much better than John. but of course, she's no Sarah conner! maybe, if the script had been a bit more strong it would have had a better potrayal of her, which once again bring us back to the script! Was it really necessary to make T3 after such a brilliant and conclusive ending in T2? For my money: No. but then, T3 does bring in some refreshment in terms of concepts (it adds to a lot of confusion and inconsistencies as well!). It does try to put in the humanity angle a bit more than have been shown in the earlier T movies (totally absent in T1, but then t1 wasn't about humanity, it was about T800). They could have tried to propound it more in the movie and cut out the humor. (T movies are not meant to be funny). The greatest zenith in the movie is of course the TX. i mean, when you are going ga ga on a killer over it's sexuality, it's really impossible to fear it , something that was inspired by the previous terminators. And to be very frank, I could not see how Tx was more efficient that T1000 in weapons department except for it's hand doing some funny things. The intrinsic superioirty (if any) of TX over T1000 can never be seen ( Maybe the script wrtier could not come up with something better, viz., a lump of energy as was previously thought to be done). when you watch T1000 you directly see how superior it is to the previous T800. Well, i could see much of TX being superior to T1000. If someone do see it pleadse let me know!Finally, after all the bad pionts, the good point: the ending. Poetic, brilliant, but a comes a bit too late to repair the damage that has been done before, a saving grace one can say for the T series. It is totally open ended and gives a very good platform for anothet T movie. Now I know, that pulling it a bit, but if Mr. cameron can once again reprise his role as the captain of the terminator ship, and given due hard work, T4 will stand better than T3. And only then can the existence of T3 be justified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start? I tend to agree with other reviewers (and James Cameron) that there was no really compelling reason to make this film. This one, thematically, mirrors the previous one. And also, like, for instance, the third "Lethal Weapon" movie, this third "Terminator" film becomes partly a self-parody. But to give credit where credit is due, the action sequences were very impressive, and the crane chase will be a classic scene. (However, chases in inappropriate vehicles are sort of a trademark sinking into the self-parody mentioned earlier.) Schwarzenegger has found a character that certainly matches his acting ability. It's sort of too bad that he will be too old to ever make another "Terminator" film, although that probably wouldn't stop the studio if they thought the money was there. Claire Danes was pretty good here, as was Kristianna Loken. There is plenty of room to quibble about the various time travel paradoxes, and some other plot holes. I have to give the filmmakers some credit for the lack of a typical Hollywood feel-good ending. If you liked the other "Terminator films, you have to see this one, although it isn't quite the classic that those others are. Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely the Best Terminator Movie of them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the entire trilogy back to back to back. This one was definitely the best. In the first, the music was like something out of a video game and it was more of a ridiculous love story than a science fiction action film. The second film was a little better than the first because it focused more on the time travel aspects and the war in the future. I liked the fact that John Connor was a bit of a motorcycle punk. That's the kind of guy I'd elect to be a military leader, but I didn't like the idea that Sarah Connors was in the insane asylum. In "Rise of the Machines", however, it made a terrific link to the war in the future. The terminator (Model # T-X), who was both more powerful and hotter than the other two, had multiple targets and most of them were killed. Therefore, its mission was mostly a success. The only down side to this movie is that the creators brought back THE Terminator, Arnold Scharzenegger. I don't think that Arnold really should be in any more of the Terminatory movies. Finally, after watching this movie, I felt that it could be a good ending, but it could also be added on to. For example, the fourth terminator movie, if there ever will be one, could deal with John not having all the generals he would have had for the war and how humankind can overcome its follies with machines.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. For Terminator fans and general Sci-Fi fans, i would highly recommend this movie. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it to little kids, tho. Hence, the R rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By what right does the third installment of a series whose last entry wrapped ten years ago - a summer popcorn feature, centered around a "hot chick," and produced absent the writer/director who made the legendary originals - have any business being as objectively great as this film?Take away the laugh lines - of which there were, admittedly, too many - and you have one of the darkest and most violent science fictions films ever made. From the brutal assassinations of teenagers in their fast food jobs and make-out parties, to John Connor jamming a loaded pistol into his own temple, to the rampage of the prototypical Skynet killbots, and the inevitable and unstoppable nuclear holocaust, this was far and away the bleakest of the Terminator series. Nowhere near the emotional weight of the second feature, but also nowhere near the obnoxious childishness it also displayed in parts - had anyone in the audience of T3 felt anywhere near as much loathing for the person of John Connor as they had in T2?What action there was, was indeed brilliantly produced - the crane sequence is the best chase filmed in the series to date. The action, however, was secondary to the critical advancement of the base plotline - we now, at last, have had Judgement Day, and the only place the series could possibly go from here, is to the War of the Machines, for which we have all been waiting.I had expected little from this film, and avoided it in the theatre. It's a prejudice I now regret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few more short comments...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi all,After reading some of the other comments on this film, I have determined that most people feel that this film's overwhelming flaw was the absence of James Cameron from its production. I have already given my reasons for standing up for this GOOD film, and I'm not going to go over them again. However I would like to comment on Mr. Cameron's blind hero worship that most people seem to be guilty of. James Cameron is a filmmaker, NOT GOD! Hell, I'll even go as far to say he's a good filmmaker (and that's pushing it). But lets all keep things in perspective. All three T-movies are nothing more then shoot em' up, car chase action fests. To imply that there is any serous drama injected into any of these films (even the first two) is just silly. All three films have the combined dramatic warmth of a monster truck rally. James Cameron brought no real "SOUL" to these films... for how can one bring something that does not exist? We all watch these movies for the same reasons, because we like to see people break really expensive things. Lets not try to legitimatize the fun of watching an car chase action film by implying that it is dramatic masterpiece. Every time that happens, I'm sure somewhere an English Lit. Professor is crying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to start off by saying to anyone who hasn't seen this movie watch it, it is the best movie ever(well next to blade runner and the truman show) anyway watch it it's awesome.Now i went to see this 4 times at my local theatre, i was the first one to get the dvd at wal-mart the night it came out. This movie has had a profound effect upon my everyday life and it's the reason i started to love scfi again.Because as of late there has been a shortage of great or even good scfi on tv and movies, with the exception of a couple movies here and there over the last 10 or so years it's gotten to be the forgotten genre of movies.Well, T3 brings back that feeling of scfi and more. I mean i was blown away when i saw this movie it's the best movie of the year and the best scfi movie since well since T2 came out in 1991.it brings everything full circle and rightly so. But, i do hope there is a T4.I give it a 10/10 it's scfi pie. Way to go Mostow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining and well-paced action film that gets better with repeated viewings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003)THE GOOD:MAJOR SPOILERS--The third time is the charm in the way of action sequences. "T3" is packed with exciting action set pieces. All of them are brilliantly filmed and executed, with heart-pounding suspense and terrific effects. The movie has a number of different action sequences and each has its own style or technique. My personal favourite (though all of them were spectacular) was the crane chase, it had so much going on, the atmosphere was intense and it was filmed and directed flawlessly.--How cool is it to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back being Ah-nuld, being the T-101? It's awesome that's what! Arnold once again gives the performance all he's got and it pays off. The dude is rockin'! He makes lines like "get out" and "I'm back" sound kick-ass! He is backed up by a good supporting cast. Nick Stahl is perfectly cast as John Connor, he has the right look for the part and also is a good actor who needs to get more roles (he was also terrific in 2001's "In the Bedroom"). Claire Danes gives the film that good ol' classic female elegant touch. She has a lot of range as an actress and I sympathised with her somewhat tragic figure of a character. She was having a happy, normal life until her fate intervened and killed many of her relations. I also adored the hot, hot, HOT Kristanna Loken as the TX; she has a lot of presence and was pretty threatening as the villain for the film.--"T3" takes the Terminator story to a new place, with Judgement Day finally happening. This was a shocking move I certainly did not see coming but I was impressed that it did because it showed how willing this new crew are to take the series down a different direction. It also shows this film isn't as formulaic as many of the action films these days. It doesn't have a big romance story (it is more suggested) and doesn't end on a kiss with all things being happy and the hero having saved the day. The movie has a pronounced sense of dread and ends with a big shock that changes the series completely. I have to applaud the writers/director for choosing to be unique when it is so easy to go down that cliché road these days.--Throughout the film the idea of fate is played with in an entertaining manner, questioning the audience as to whether everyone's fate has been laid out before them and we are only helpless to succumb to that fate, or is fate an option? THE BAD:MINOR SPOILERS--To an extent I was annoyed that the Judgement Day story had been changed, and found it a little lazy that it was all resolved with a simple line - "you haven't stopped Judgement Day, you have just postponed it." It didn't bother me as much on second viewing but it still is an annoyance that, to some degree, makes the second's film plot a little pointless in the grand scheme of things, though "T2" is certainly a brilliant film, one of the best action movies ever.RATING:8/10 - A well-made and highly entertaining sequel that gets better with repeated viewings. I hope there is another, if not many more, Terminator sequels. They certainly are a possibility, as John Connor said, "the story has only just begun".IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:The Matrix Reloaded (9/10) The Matrix Revolutions (7/10) Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (9/10) The Terminator (8/10) Terminator 2: Judgement Day (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to expectation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about Terminator 3, I was ecstatic. I have loved the first two films ever since I was a child (my older brother's watched them a lot). But when I heard that James Cameron was dropping out, and that John Connor wouldn't be played by Edward Furlong I was a little disapointed, but still excited. However, I was right to be disapointed. Terminator 3 is a good movie in general, but compared to the first two movies, it's crap. There are some OK moments, most movies have them, and even I thought the beginning part with the sunglasses was funny, but the movies aren't made to be funny. They aren't made to mock the first two. The only thing I really liked *****SPOILER***** was seeing the psychiatrist (Dr. Peter Silberman) from the first two films. The ending was also very depressing. If Judgment Day comes anyway, what were the first two films for?************Anyways, I think that they should have left the Terminator franchise alone. Big budget movies, do not always make good films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is a good action movie but nothing more. Everyone knows that T3 obviously had alot to live up to being the sequel to one of the best movies ever made so the director decided to take no changes and just put together a story as simple as it gets and fill the gaps with action and humor. Which makes an entertainment movie but nothing you will remember, it´s one of those movies that you forget as soon as you walk out of the cinema. Terminator 2 was full of memorable quotes and scenes but T3 is a crap film with a clowninator that does not scare you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll admit, there were a few parts when I thought I'd like the movie, but those feelings passed quickly, replaced by depression and anger. Those of us who have awaited the release of this movie for so long, have been cheated.I have no idea why they didn't stick to the idea of Chyna (Joanie Laurer) playing the "Terminatrix". If it has to be a female, I think it'd be better for it to be a muscular one.I also haven't the slightest idea why they chose Claire Danes to be one of the movie's co-stars.The comedy elements are bad, but somewhat tolerable. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the rest of the movie.The absence of most original characters also weakens the movie, as one doesn't feel like they're watching a Terminator flick, they feel as though they're watching a Cinemax 3 AM b-movie.The few good elements it did have, weren't shown, weren't played out, enough. In the same sense, the bad elements were given ridiculously long time.I Rate This: 0/10 (Don't watch: Even if you're a huge Terminator fan)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T2 was better than T3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 was just not so deep as T2. The difference is that in T3 a female plays Terminatrix and believe me that's really all. What I liked therefore were the special effects, the sounds and the wonderful picture. But I missed the cool soundtrack from T2. What I didn't like was the art of her arms that Terminatrix used in the action scenes and the dialog from Arnie "She will be back"; oh yes she was every time back without any wounds. Nick Stahl as John Connor delivered an amazing performance and he should have won the Oscar!Again I have unfortunately to say that sequels of nowadays are better not to be done and if then, please with much more creative ideas. I have terminated.My wife gave 5/10 and I 7/10 = Average rate: 6/10. TERMINATED.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was prepared for the worst ... but hey it was pretty good! I'd give this movie about 7/10 ... it could have been 8/10 or better ... were it not for the badly scripted role of the John Connor character. In this movie John Conner is an impotent, indecisive, half-wit!After the T2 you'd think this guy would be more clued in! Yet in here he seems pretty confused by the whole scenario. He even goes and has a little hissy fit in the mausoleum "why me? why me?" ... idiot your mom's been telling you this your whole life ... now's not the time to act like a pathetic twit! This is the guy who's going to lead the human race? He was supposed to be trained to be a soldier and a leader ... yet he's reduced to the role of a spectator in most of the action scenes! In some of the most climactic scenes Connor is portrayed to have no sense of urgency! There are several scenes where, in the face of danger, he hesitates and stares dumbly at the approaching menace before running away rather impotently. There's even a scene where he and his 'future wife' are frozen in shock as the TX approaches ... and all the while a gun is lying on the ground in front of them. Guess who picks up the gun? The girl! By the end of this movie I want John Conner to die! I don't care if the whole human race will die with him.If this is the best leader we can come up with its about time we're all replaced by machines.</fullReview>

The film misses cameron, had he been a part of it i think it would have been a classic like the previous two. Arnie was boring in this film, didn't have the same spark as in T2, i guess though in this film he is a different cyborg. But either way arnie is one of my fav actors.

		<shortDescription>T2 remains the best movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is still a great movie, and there is a lot to like about it, and I still really enjoyed watching it, however there are some problems with it that make it disappointing for me. Reading some other reviews from people, I can see I am not the only one who had problems with it, and perhaps if James Cameron was on board with this film, it would have been much better.First, Edward Furlong should have been back for John Connor. I'm not trying to take away anything from Nick Stahl, because he did a great job. In fact, he looked somewhat like a younger Kyle Reese, and at times, even looked like Furlong himself, but why didn't they just get Ed back for the 3rd - it would have been that much better if they had.Next, was the fact that the T-101 was still trying to be like the T-101 from the second film, despite the fact that it was a different cyborg. Why was it still copying the behaviour that it's predecessor had been taught then, such as not killing humans and looking for the keys under the sun visor?Finally, the movie didn't seem to go for long enough, and the story was quite shallow. Elements of a fantastic story were there, but were only brushed over. The whole thing seemed very rushed and actually I was disappointed when the credits began to roll because I thought there needed to be more to the story.Having said that, T3 is still a good movie, by all means, I would recommend you see it, especially if you are a fan of the previous 2 films, or love Arnie. However T2 still remains the best film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Bag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gave me the impression that it was made mechanically (by Terminators??), with no real thought put into it; a rushed production. The timing/pacing was average, but was probably limited by a weak script to begin with. Despite plenty of action scenes, I nearly found this movie to be. . . boring". Although there were some novel action scenes, they were nothing really spectacular, and the people scenes lacked interest due to the weak plot. I was struggling to retain interest by the end. Kristanna was miscast for the role of T-X, as her performance was not convincing as a Terminator. The remaining principle character performances (including Arnold) were not entirely convincing at times either. Again, this was probably due to the weak script. Technically competent. Artistically, this movie was limited. Overall rating of 6/10.</fullReview>

None of which is explored, only mentioned and died out. The 2 bright spots of the film is The T-X (Loken), who looks hot and deadly at the same time, and the return of Dr Silberman (Boen), even though it was brief (And he being in a state of denial over what happened in T2). Other than that, this is not a good way to end a series (They should have left it alone with the 2nd film, but that's Hollywood for you), and I hope to God that they will end it here!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is exactly what movies are about. Going to the cinema to enjoy a top quality blockbuster. This movie has it all, smart acting, food for the eyes and the ultimate ending. This has truly been one of the greatest years for movies I have witnessed to date. Arnie comes back and does exactly what he should have, a good rock steady performance. Everything about this movie is spot on, from the chase scenes to the humour. When I go to see a movie in the cinema I want to be entertained from start to finish, so that I can forget about the fact that my leg is cramping up because my seat is poor quality. This does it for me. I'm one of the biggest fans going when it comes to the Terminator series, yet I have not been prejudiced against this movie from the beginning just because James 'Titanic' Cameron wasn't involved. Its his loss not being a part of the 3rd and hopefully 4th movie in some small way. Why do people frown at the thought of a sequel coming out. It extends the emotion that was had in the first movie, which if only small can't be a bad thing. After all it costs about ?4 to go see the damn movie, how can that not be money well spent when the package is this good. So in final if you don't like this movie, you can 'talk to the hand', because this is top quality entertainment. What more needs to be said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally i found both the first and the second film quite enjoyable, not the greatest films i´ve seen but good nonetheless. When i first heard that T3 was in the making i was actually quite pleased and thought that after such a long time they would have developed an interesting plot. What i was expecting was a much darker film than the first two, and perhaps one that would be more of an epic, great battles between men and machines, more thoughts and reflections concerning the issues that lies as the foundation for the movies. I was however, greatly disappointed with this film for more than one reason.Firstly i found the humour awfully misplaced and inappropriate. I couldn´t believe that they would do this to a movie that quite naturally had high demands from the audience, to me T3 is close to being an action/comedy, and that´s not meant in a good sence... Secondly the story is just bizarre, it´s all action and nothing else, mindless action with no substance. Maybe my expectations were too high but i just can´t help being so disappointed, the underlying theme and thought behind this movie could have made it great, but right now i´m thinking that the time i spent watching T3 is never coming back to me, makes me a little bit angry actually....</fullReview>

Even more ridiculous is the featherweight female terminator who never smudges her makeup, and can run 60 mph in high heels. She never seems threatening, perhaps because she's never shown killing anyone; her catty expression always accompanied with ominous music (lifted from Mr Liquid Plumber, or a whomever was the 2nd Terminator) just doesn't cut it.

There are many "cringe moments" but ultimately it is a lot of fun with some great action scenes. I liked it in spite of myself. Nick Stahl as John Connor was better than Eddie Furlong, Claire Danes was believable as expected and Kristana Loken was eerie. The worst perfomance came from Arnold-whose character was poorly and cheesily written. The ending was terrific though and redeemed the film alot. The car chase was probably the most pointlessly obnoxious action scene ever...needless to say, I loved it. Anticipating a sequel. 7/10 Oh yeah..."Superman 2" is terrible and a shadow of the brilliant "Superman: The Movie"- watch them both again and you'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]John Connor, the future resistance leader that would lead the human race into resistance against the advanced machines who will try to wipe them out in the near future. That future draws nearer and nearer, even though John helped destroy what would cause Judgment Day. John was currently a drifter. Moving on and on; One fateful quiet night in Beverly Hills in a brilliant flash of light, a female arrives from the future. She is T-X, a new and very advanced Terminator machine. She's made from liquid metal like the T-1000, but she's far more advanced than T-1000. Immediately she kills a female motorist and steals her clothes and car. Meanwhile out in the desert, another brilliant flash of light occurs and an orb appears. It shatters and out comes a T-805 Terminator machine. He acquires clothes from a nearby cocktail lounge. T-X goes around and terminates certain people for no apparent reason; John Connor breaks into a veterinarian office that night and pops some animal pills. The veterinarian, Kate Brewster, comes down to the office to see what's up. Apparently she and John were old classmates from way back when.Unfortunately T-X arrives then and tries to kill Kate for an unknown reason. Fortunately, Terminator arrives at that moment also. He locks Kate in back of her truck and John escapes with her. Terminator "borrows" a police motorcycle and follows them. T-X steals a giant crane truck and gives chase. She has the power to manipulate other machines so she made a bunch of unmanned police cars chase John as well. The end result is a massive auto wreck that levels half of downtown Los Angeles. Terminator joins John and Kate. Terminator didn't recognize John from before because this Terminator was not the one they met before. This was it's twin. Well, Terminator "acquires" some supplies at a drug store then they set off to a cemetery where John sees his mother, Sarah's grave. Unfortunately, she had passed away. But she was cremated so her tomb was full of weapons which Terminator, John and Kate use to escape T-X and a horde of cops and FBI. Dr. Silberman arrives also to console Kate, but he runs off when he sees Terminator. Terminator explains why T-X wants to kill Kate as well: she's John's future wife as well as lieutenant! Her father, Robert, is in the air force and he and his team of scientists have perfected SkyNet, the defense computer than obliterates 3 billion people on Judgment Day, which would occur THAT day in less than three hours!John ordered Terminator to take them to Robert and stop SkyNet. Terminator refused. Kate ordered and Terminator complied, this is because she was the one who reprogrammed his CPU in the future and sent him back. So they "borrow" an RV and head to Robert. Hopefully T-X wouldn't get there first. She does. Robert is ordered to upload SkyNet immediately to stop a computer virus that's been running rampant on all machines. Robert hit the button. SkyNet uploaded. UH OH! T-X activates small, early versions of HK's: T-1's. The terrain vehicles with mean gatling guns. The flying HK's are also deployed. Terminator, Kate and John arrive then. Terminator and T-X engage in a vicious battle, while John and Kate avoid the HK's. Poor Robert is shot, but he was able to tell John and Kate how to stop SkyNet before he died. He was for SkyNet originally, but after hearing what would happen to the human race, he was overwhelmed. John and Kate head to Crystal Peak where the main SkyNet systems were while T-X decapitated Terminator and reprogrammed him to terminate John. He fails. He overrides his system and helps John and Kate. They soon arrive at Crystal Peak and go underground while Terminator blows the above ground bunker along with he and T-X to smithereens. John and Kate find the underground has nothing but a 30 year old fall-out shelter. Then they learned that there was no stopping Judgment Day. It was inevitable. On the surface, the machines began terrorizing the humans while the missile silos launched the nuclear missiles that would cause the obliteration of 3 billion people. Perhaps the future has been written, but there's no stopping it. We must live it...Together.THIS MOVIE ROCKED! Terminator 3 beats the pants off Terminator 1 and 2! Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as Terminator. Nick Stahl takes over the role of John Connor. Claire Danes is Kate and she is beautiful. So was Kristanna Loken as a sexy T-X. It was a good idea to make the evil Terminator a girl in this one. You'll notice that James Cameron did not return to direct this movie, but I thought Jonathan Mostow did a great job. So, if you want a movie filled with dazzling special effects and as much action as Hollywood can dish out, then I recommend you go see Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines today! Can we expect a Terminator 4? Maybe. Though Arnold is thinking of running for governor of California. Do you think he'll make a good governor? Who knows. Anyway, see T3! I really liked it. I sat right through the end credits, but then the lights came on and the theater cleaning people came in so I had to leave. I loved the effects and all the action! I urge you, see Terminator 3. You Terminator fans will love it!-</fullReview>

The crane scene was good, that's why I gave it 2 stars, but the whole rest of the mess surrounding it kept me squirming in my seat. I care about as much for the fate of John Conner as I do for the fate of John Rocker. So all the terminators of Arnold's vintage speak with an Austrian accent and age like a human? Maybe after all the humans are killed off the machines can come up with a plot. I can only hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked it better when it was called T-2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew chunks, wanna know why? Cause until the very end, it was practically identical to T-2. The chase scene was nothing but destructive, other than alot of buildings and vehicles getting demolished it was ho hum.....I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat or anything. Basically, a more sophisticated terminator, T-X, comes from the future to kill people, namely John Connor and his future wife. Arnold, comes back as the "has been" terminator (same model as in the other 2 movies) to try to stop the "faster, stronger, more advanced T-X". Ooooooh the drama.....wait this sounds familiar. The only difference was that this time the "bad" terminator was a female. Haven't we seen this plot line already in T-2???Let me just say that I loved the original Terminator, and I really thought that T-2 was ahead of its time back in the day, and I enjoyed it almost as much as the 1st one because of that. But Cameron directed those two, not the 3rd one. These guys look like they couldn't come up with a new way of filming, so just followed the same basic principles that T-2 had. Trust me when I say that if you've seen T-2, then you've seen T-3 already. *******************Spoilers*********************The only difference is that in T-2, judgement day was averted, in this one judgement still happened, basically nukes were set off all around the world thanks to the machines. So while judgement day was avoided in T-2, it is learned in this movie that judgement day was only postponed. I swear that is the only "new" idea in T-3 that they used. It "could" have been really cool had the nukes gone off in say the middle of the movie and then we got to see John Connor and his mate still trying to survive the aftermath with a terminator after them....but no. They didn't even show the nukes going off!!!! All they did was in the final 2 minutes of the movie, show some mickey mouse grid with lines going across it representing the path of all the nukes so you could get a sense of just how many were set off. Great job Hollywood. The best aspect of the movie that you could have used, you decided to not even show. Basically, it boils down to this. The future of the humans comes down to the hands of John Connor and his future wife. After 2 failed attempts to kill Connor in the first two movies, they try again. Like the 2nd movie, Arnold is sent back from the future to stop the more advanced T-X before she kills her targets. Like the 2nd movie, it is a "struggle" and she is always right behind them just "ever so close" but yet not ever close enough to finish the job. By the end of the movie, just as they "want" you to think that the T-X is about to kill her targets (ya as if), Arnold, our hero, saves the day. Oh ya, and he spouts out yet another dumb one liner like "you are terminated" to the other terminator. There was one part where the T-X, who can control machines, got to Arnold and was controlling him against Connor and his future wife. This could have been a cool twist, like a blast from the past from Terminator the original, but no. This only lasted like a minute or two as Arnold shut himself down so he wouldn't "fail" his mission. So there went that little twist, yet another missed opportunity to make this movie unique. God I hope they don't release a 4th one because this is starting to get as predictable as the "Rocky" series. There were attempts at humor in this movie, but they were "few and far between" and not very funny even when you saw them. Anyone who pays to see this movie once can be forgiven, but if you pay to see it twice, then you should seek a CAT scan to see what is wrong with your head. Macc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that like many, I am a great fan of previous Terminator movies, and when I heard they are making a new Terminator I was very enthusiastic and imagined all the huge possibilities that movie could have.When I first saw that Terminator 3 is not directed nor written by James Cameron, my hopes came a bit down. When I saw that role of the evil terminator would be played by a model who has no acting experience I began to get the feeling how this movie would be. I tried to prepare myself for the failure for a long time. But nothing could prepare me for this... The movie was awful. I don't think I have ever been disappointed in any other movie this much.In T-3 they do everything I hoped they wouldn't do. They have added totally unnecessary humour in spots that it doesn't fit in at all. The script is terrible, and whole movie has no content. The movie totally lacks the dark and somewhat distressing feeling the previous Terminator movies had, especially the first one. When watching T-3 at some points I thought if they are serious about this movie at all. Kristanna Loken:s roleplay is plain annoying, every time she comes to screen she does something stupid... She has lines that a robot surely wouldn't say. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a bit better, but it's obvious that Cameron was the one who was keeping both the story and Arnolds roleplay together. Writers have tried to find new "legendary" comments but fail with an embarrassing way.Jonathan Mostow:s amateurish directingwork combined with low-class storywriters has made a sequel that totally ruins Terminator series and disrespects its great predecessors. All I can say is I hope I would have never seen this movie. If they do any more of these terrible sequels to get money by abusing the name, I will not watch them.</fullReview>

I'll tell you why, because he didn't have a CLUE as to how to direct. Arnold is really stretching now for a hit and this is just not it. It was more like a video game than a movie. All of the scenes at the middle and end of the movie looked JUST like a video game first person shooter.

		<fullReview>The huge car chase scene probably makes this movie, with everything else paling in comparison. The sheer scale of the destruction is amazing. I haven't enjoyed a chase this much since Pierce Brosnan took that tank for a joyride in Goldeneye.My main complaint is that with the change from Edward Furlong to Nick Stahl, John Connor went from being a whiny snot to a brooding snot, but remained a snot nonetheless. If Nick Stahl's John Connor tried to give me an order, I'd push him down and stand on his head. If they do a T4, let's see John Connor be a bit more heroic, a bit more confident and in charge of himself. In T2, Connor was a marshmallow. In T3, they added a graham cracker's worth of hardness. But to lead like his character eventually must, you need to be a sword, not a s'more.And let's forget the comparisons to Michael Biehn I've been seeing in the user comments here. The only thing Stahl's John Connor has in common with his "dad" is stubble and ragged wardrobe.- G</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines***1/2 starsLook, I don't mind the first two Terminator movies, I really have nothing against them. Terminator was cool with Schwarzenegger playing the bad guy. Terminator 2: Judgment Day was getting a lot cooler though, with the better special effects, but Rise Of The Machines was just so much better than the other two.Brilliantly written by Cameron and directed by Mostow, this proved to be a lot better than your average sequel. The new Terminatrix or 'TX' was awesome with weapons she can forge out of her hands.Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines is about John Connor who is now in his 20's and being chased after by the new Terminatrix. But a new T - 800 is sent back in time to protect John Connor and Kate Brewster who are said to be the key to the future and what they need to protect humans from the rise of the machines.One thing I can say that I really didn't like is the fact that towards the end of the movie it was getting too soft. But the acting in this movie is really good from pretty much everyone and there are so many special effects throughout the movie that it must have taken some hard work, and it really payed off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 is a sad comment on the state of movies today. I learned from the manager of the theater that I attended that the volume control in the auditorium is dictated by the studio. If you walked out of T3 with your ears ringing and your senses scrambled, and, perhaps, even noticed the befuddled state of your brain and the distinctive wobble of your walk then there may be hope for you. The first 30 minutes of this film had nothing but violence and noise, and the most ridiculous unnecessary chase scene ever filmed. I recall a friend's comment after listening to a particularly poor rock group, "If you can't play good, play loud." Terminator 3 played loud. You say you thought it was exciting, thrilling, mind-blowing, and the last word in action movies!? I say, B.S.! This film was garbage. To compare it with either of the previous Terminator movies says much about the rapidly dimming intelligence of today's movie audience. James Cameron is certainly laughing at this atrocity. If you liked this movie, you like leaf-blowers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers!! The original is a classic that I have seen one too many times, which made Arnold. The second film, left its science fiction roots, and became a special effects film, without much of a story. A lot of films have plot holes, but how could John Conners exist without the first film happening. No bratty kid, social cause and effects(ie the security guard why don't I kill, the science guy change of mind), Linda Hamilton giving a PC social lecture, and effects with no need like the truck scene. T3 had to change from the first 2, and this makes it a strong film. The over the top action scenes add humor for the film. Arnold acts more like a machine, and becomes a strong secondary character; smart move for Arnold. It shows he can step back for the good of the film. Arnold's computer behavior is comical! Most science fiction has philosophy, and this film deals with fatalism. This film answers the question why does John Conner exist. As a result of fate, the second film only delayed the inevitable. One must deal with their fate. Chaos theory with free will creates order to chaos and events unfold. The strongest part of this film is the believability with the science fiction. In 1984, Sky Net takes over, was science fiction, but with the net, and the grid cyber war, it is possible. This would damage the financial, power, communications system etc. I watched a show about cyber war on the Learning Channel, with what the NSC could do and with Sky net and the virus it is plausible. Add the sci-fi, time travel and anything is possible. The ending is mind blowing with fatalism. 7 or 8 out 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 was average at best. This film had no sense of pacing in my opinion and spent no time at all letting us get to know the characters. Cameron's absence was very obvious. Instead of taking time to build up to each climax terminator 3 just threw it all at us in the beginning and then went down hill from there, throwing chase seen after chase seen and battle after battle until the very predictable ending. The TX that was supposed to be all powerful got her ass kicked all the time and didn't fare half as well as the T-1000 did in T2. I felt like i had hardly seen Arnold in the movie and they spent practically no time on the TX at all other than a few stupid scenes where she said "hey..i like ur bike" and "hey i like ur car". At the end of terminator 2 i felt like i knew the all the character better, terminators and all. This movie didn't allow us to get to know anyone and i felt like the director didn't really care about that aspect of movie making. This movie is a disgrace to the terminator series and has ruined the greatness the series had. If i had never seen the other terminator movies i may have given this movie a 6, but since i have and i love the other two this movie gets a big 4 and a warning to all who love the terminator series and have yet to see this movie.Only watch this movie if u don't care about the other movies or ur really into special effects and explosions and you just want a action movie where no brain activity is required. I only can pray they don't make terminator 4. God help us if they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's send a robot back in time to prevent them from making this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is absolutely nothing interesting in this movie. It is a lazily assembled amalgam of plot points from T2 and lines from The Terminator. It's as though they were too lazy to think up anything interesting and instead defaulted to trying to lamely remind you of bits you liked from the first two.Yeah, there's lots of destruction in this one, but who cares? The filmmakers completely fail to create any suspense. There's no character development, there's no plot, so there's nothing to invite the audience into giving a crap about any of the "characters". Claire Danes's character shows some promise at the beginning of the film, but her character quickly becomes a simp. Even Arnold gives lame line deliveries, as though he learned his lines right before they rolled camera. Not the good kind of Arnold lame that worked so perfectly in the first two movies, it's just authentically poor***possible mild spoiler ***The police psychologist who talks to Claire Danes in the graveyard makes reference to having witnessed the Terminator assault on the police station in the original movie. But in that movie, he leaves just as Arnold enters the station. He's not even there when it all goes down! This blunder epitomizes the whole mess that T3 is - they were too lazy to get it right, they were more interested in coming up with a gag than doing anything dramatically interesting.By the way, in the "flash forward" scenes at the beginning of the movie I thought the guy was the doctor from Star Trek: Deep Space 9. But it's really Nick Stahl.BTW, Nick Stahl does look like he could be the child of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. That's about the only detail of this move that looks like it had any thought given to it. The special effects look fine, but that only matters if they're used in service of a good story. But T3 has never been within two miles of a good story.Boring! See the first one again instead. I gave this one a 2 out of 10, and that was being generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess as we see Arnold's film career spiral further down, we will have to indulge him a little more. We will have to endure his publicity stunt involving him being Governor of California and we will have to see him try to go back to something that worked for him before. So, here goes Terminator 3. Sadly, the third installment is by far the weakest of the trilogy. The character and the story has been played out. Oh sure, Arnold's character is much more hero-friendly than the the first installment and even second installment. However, as I watched this standard paint by the numbers sci-fi thriller play itself out, I just felt depressed. You are seeing Arnold try to recreate a character that he was close to twenty years ago. Oh sure, it does not take great range to do so, but still. Perhaps it is naive to expect Arnold to have matured a little bit in his acting career. However, I guess we will not see that Clint Eastwood maturation. Oh well, what is next, Total Recall 2 or Eraser II? Certainly not Last Action Hero 2, Oh Lord, please NO! * out of ****.</fullReview>

The only thing T3 has going for it is its adept special effects, but these are USELESS when the script is abysmal. Terminator 1 was a brilliant action movie, followed by Terminator 2, one of the few sequels in history to surpass its predecessor in quality. And now, eleven years later we receive a tepid, boring and laughable sequel to an action masterpiece. If you valued the first two movies, avoid this one like the plague.

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't a bad movie at all...I went in with very low expectations. I thought it was going to suck and I expected it to be garbage. But it wasn't. In fact I was quite surprised at how good it was. This doesn't even come close to the caliber of Terminator 2, and there is just not enough character or plot development to make it the way T2 did. There are't enough characters in the film and the movie seems to drown in action with a light focus on plot.Despite this, the movie IS good. The action is intense, the effects are outstanding and its an overall decent movie. There are shocking twists and a surprise ending that will literally blow you away. Don't pass this up if you're a terminator fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real letdown (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adored the first two Terminator movies. I saw the first one 10 years ago, and the second one a little while later. I was excited at first, but had a couple misgivings. I knew from the beginning that Linda Hamilton wouldn't be in T3, and that John Connor would be played by someone else. I should have followed my gut and not seen this.Nothing is explained in this movie, like what the T-X was made of, exactly. There was, I guess, a need for a sequel, because the first two movies created a paradox. If they really had stopped Judgment Day, they couldn't have done it. That is, if in T2 they stopped it, there would be no terminators, no reason to send Kyle Reese through time in the first movie, no John Connor, no damaged CPU to build Skynet on--you get the idea. If they had really stopped the future, John Connor couldn't exist and Sarah Connor would still be working as a waitress. What I don't get is why the terminators got sent back in the first place. Obviously, the reason they got sent back was because John Connor was there. Since he was there, didn't that mean they failed in the first place, so sending back machines was useless? Anyway...Back to the movie. Yes, there were some great action sequences, but all it really did was illustrate (badly) what had to happen anyway, if you just thought about it. It's a great movie franchise, but it's built on absolute impossibilities, not just pretend A.I.I'd give this movie a 4 out of 10. IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST TWO, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That line muttered by Glover's character in Lethal Weapon popped in my head when I saw Ah-nuld's naked body slowly rises from the fire of space travel. I could imagined the Terminator saying "Ohhhh boy, here I go again.....I'm getting to old for this s***"."This film is jammed pack with action - they threw everything into it, a crane, police cars, some helicoptors, some eerie Robocop-looking droids, - everything and anything. So for those who like action - you got a free run of the buffet table here.***POSSBILE SPOILERS ******But here's my list of problems I have with this flick.1) T-X is boring for the fact that she brings nothing to it. With Robert Patrick you could feel the "evil" ooze off him. With her, it ain't nothing. She's like a mannequin - ho-hum...oh she can inflate her bust - yeeeahhh - okay.2) Story is getting harder to take seriously - yes I know it's a sci-fi action flick and it don't always have to make sense but I like my films to entertain me and get my brain kicking. Too many plot holes...heck, big enough to drive that huge crane through - though it's nice to see parts of industrial downtown Los Angeles get trash to pieces with the chase sequences. So weak story, flimsy excuse of a plot.3) The Terminator doesn't do anything. Ok, yes, he does a lot of mindless damage but we don't learn anything new about him. The first one you could see the terminator thinking, processing new thoughts and ideas, he's evolving in a way - learning that life is a valuable thing. In this one he pretty much fights and fights and fights. There's a scene where John Conor says something to the line of "What, I have to re-teach you everything ?".I want to like this film - I'm a big fan of the first two but like the Aliens series, it's getting stale. If you gotta go see it, see it druing the day and save some dough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually liked this film more than I thought I would.All of the usual suspects are back-John Connor and the T-800. There's also a new Terminator model. This film continues the Terminator story. We learn much more about what happens in the future. The action is great, although much of it was clearly CGI, and sometimes it felt a bit relentless, but it had some great action sequences in it. I feel, however, that the film recycles too much from Terminator 2. Of course, there are still some delightful references to the previous films. I also felt that the plot wasn't fully developed.Overall, this is a recycled, CGI-ridden film that doesn't come close to being as good as the first two Terminator films, but is actually pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was nice seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action as the Terminator for this movie, still fresh and funny with his funny one-liners and quick wit, and still proving he can kick some major butt. The events of Terminator 2 have only delayed the completion of Skynet, which has sent the evil T-X (Kristanna Loken) to assassinate the future officers of TechCom and eliminate drifter John Connor (Nick Stahl). But the Resistance sends a T-800 (Schwarzenegger) from the future to the present time to protect drifter John Connor (Nick Stahl) and stop T-X.This film has the same destitute, war-fearing atmosphere as in the previous films. There are some intense action and cool special effects that highlight a slew of spectacular new weaponry the Terminator and T-X possess. The cast of characters is nicely assembled, with Stahl and and Claire Danes doing a decent job in portraying John Connor and Kate Brewster. The plot, however, lacks the urgency and suspense of the previous films and didn't have much character development, which would have made the characters more memorable and sympathized; you don't learn much from their backgrounds. The story didn't offer much originality - it basically rehashed SkyNet's continued threat to make Judgement Day happen, making this film just a mesh of action with limited drama.Overall, Terminator 3 is a lot of sci-fi action fun, but misses the mark in story and character developments.Grade C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as people say it is. It's fun to watch, but doesn't match the first two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a good film. Overall, it's fun to watch, has excellent, not too overused effects and has some entertaining scenes in particular. However, it's not even half as good as the first two and is different in many ways. It's not great, it's not really good, but it is good. I firstly remember seeing this back in 2004 for the first time. I enjoyed it more back then, since I was younger and didn't understand as much. I should also mention the fact that back then I was only young so wasn't as good when it came to noticing things, explaining things and seeing things throughout better. A LOT of negativity was pointed towards this film. Critics criticise it frequently and they will often point out loads of things wrong with it. They'll also explain why it's not worthy of your time to watch it or even watch part of it. But for the benefit of the doubt, I have chose to focus more on the positive things. Things such as- Arnold returns in his recurring role as the T- 800 and is still great at it. He really makes the film what it is, and despite the fact that Arnie may not be the BEST actor, or even comes close to being one of the best, as a movie star/action star he's always on top and never fails to deliver excellent entertainment when it comes to that. So that's one great things about the film. The visual effects, scenery and acting, overall is very good, and I enjoy that. I enjoy knowing it's not "All bad!". See for yourself. If you've not seen this film due to the criticism it's received, you're kind of wasting your time. Wasting it by pondering and not coming the conclusion on whether to watch it or not. Just watch it! It really is fun to watch overall, and although it's hideously terrible when it comparison to the first two, it's still a good film with some explosive action scenes, incredible effects and more. I, for one, still think it's good to watch. There are loads and loads of things that're awful about the film, however, they're not what should ruin the good aspects and parts of the film. You should watch it if you've not seen it already, because chances are, you'll still probably like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was really going to be a movie showing the events leading up to Judgment Day then it should have been in theaters between 1993-1995. As it is, this abomination was scrapped together from sloppy remnants. Only a still buff but dated looking Arnold Schwarzenegger as returns the T-800 sent back to stop the T-X from murdering Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) and John Connor (Nick Stahl). The T-X (Kristanna Loken) is an endoskeleton with built-in weapons, the same ability to change appearance as the T-1000 and she can control machines. She commandeers a woman's convertible, cop car and several construction vehicles, and begins killing John Connor's future Human Resistance lieutenants. Her ultimate mission is to infect America's computer controlled nuclear arsenal with a virus that would launch the United States' nuclear weapons. John Connor has been living a nomadic, off-the-grid lifestyle since the T-2 events. His narration mentions that Judgment Day never happened and though he and his mom had destroyed Skynet in the past, he never shook the feeling that something terrible happening was inevitable. The movie starts out well but ends being filled with bad jokes, a weak story and even worse performances. Claire Daines was badly miscast and grows so annoying you end up cheering for the T-X to waste her. Nick Stahl is an underwhelming John Connor, boring but not terrible. He looks like a homeless stoner expecting to wake up from a bad trip. Schwarzenegger is playing a role he knows very well but that's not exactly a good thing since he's rehashing an old character for a fat paycheck. Kristanna Loken is a beautiful woman and that's about it, she's a non-acting performer in this. This movie was the end of The Terminator as a relevant franchise.</fullReview>

There is a reason one of the main characters played by Linda Hamilton turned down the script.When she declined they killed her off,said she had cancer and put guns in her casket.Need I say more?Arnie tells more jokes rather than acting like a machine.The villain or Terminatrix is a mute model that offers nothing.This film marks the start of the reboot,remake and rehash of classic movies.The sad thing is Cameron wanted to do it but wanted more time.His disappointment reflects the majority of fans including me.Anyone who liked it all I can say is I hope you enjoy transformers 4;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had the misfortune of having to live up to it's predecessors' impossibly high standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standards which it could never achieve, and wasn't really meant to anyways. As a brainless action flick, it's very well made. The crane chase, no matter how implausible, was amazing and is easily one of the best chase scenes of the decade. The film's main problem, for me at least, is that it spends it's best action scene too early on in the film, and everything that came afterwards was just OK. Still, it's a good action film, and I believe people have come to respect it more after witnessing the travesty that was Terminator Salvation. Just don't go mentioning T3 in the same breath as it's predecessors.PROS: -Crane chase, crane chase, crane chase! Brilliantly set up and shot, and incredibly thrilling. This is the one point where T3 almost matches the heights of the first two films, and what it SHOULD be remembered for. Yes, it is highly implausible, but that's not the point.-Arnold is amusing, almost playing a parody version of his previous Terminator roles. You can tell he had fun.-Kristanna Loken makes for a good villainess. She doesn't even touch Robert Patrick, but she brings enough menace to the table to actually feel like a reasonable threat.-Ending. I'm not gonna spoil it but it is fittingly dark. Gotta give the director props for not coping out on it.CONS: -Nick Stahl. Dull. Flat. Boring -Claire Danes. Dull. Flat. Boring-The scale/size and quality of the action scenes following the crane chase took a big nose-dive. They are OK, but that's just it. Only OK does not pass in a Terminator film. I get the feeling that most of the film's budget went towards the crane chase, as everything else feels lackluster by comparison.-This is the biggest flaw for me. The musical score. Where in the hell did that AMAZING and GOD-LIKE score from T2 go? No, those are not overstatements. T2 literally had one of the greatest scores in film history (Brad Fiedel's masterpiece), and I'm just dumbfounded that the creators of T3 seemed completely oblivious to this fact, because T3 has an almost non-existent score. What actually is there is very flat, dull, and BORING. Why oh why did they not try harder in this department?In closing, Terminator 3 would have gotten MUCH more praise had it not been a Terminator film. 7/10 for this entertaining blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic atrocity of epic proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is absolutely horrible. Hollywood tried to cash in one of the greatest film franchises of all time, but had to do so without James Cameron, Linda Hamilton or Ed Furlong. James Cameron walked away from this project in disgust over the horrible screenplay they wrote.This film should have been based off the canon sequel, T2:Infiltrator by S.M. Stirling. It is one of the best science fiction novels I've ever read, so well written with plenty of character development, action, and plot twists. S.M. Stirling wrote this novel based on the Terminator world created by James Cameron and William Wisher, and Mr. Cameron originally considered basing the screenplay for T3 off of this book, but the studio ruled against it, so he walked away from the project.You be the judge.. -SPOILER ALERT-A few years after T2, John and Sarah Connor are living in Paraguay in solitude. Their new neighbor just happens to be a retired intelligence agent who, years later, would be captured and killed by Skynet, his face used as the model for all T-101s.Meanwhile, Skynet (yes, Cyberdyne had their work backed up at another facility) sends its greatest weapon back in time. An actual human/cyborg hybrid. She is physically human with cybernetic nano-implants and a neural net processor implanted in her brain at birth. She is a human Terminator who can think and feel as people do, but with superhuman strength and reflexes.The Infiltrator gets a job at Cyberdyne as their head of security, builds a half dozen Terminators and sends them to kill John and Sarah Connor and to insure Skynet's future..</fullReview>

It should also be forbidden to replace or miss out important actors like Linda Hamilton, the main char of the T1 and T2, and Michael Biehn (who also starred in both T1 and T2) and of course Furlong (if he was on drugs, well let him act on drugs!) Then it should be totally banned to change history of events. Fine Judgmentday wasn't supposed to happen. But it happened anyway, well WHAT REASON? there must(!) be a reason for change of history. Perhaps workers found the arm of the limb Terminator in T2 (the one cut off by T-1000 in the end-battle-scene) or some other bull, but things doesn't happen on their own! The code spreads to internet, then internet is behind the SkyNet. Aha. Nice. NOOT! And the artificially made small machines, what a threat.

This animal hospital is owned by Kate Brewster, (Claire Danes) who gets deeply involved with John and FX is out to kill the both of them. The Terminator, (Arnold Schwarzenegger) appears on the scene naked and visits a bar where it is ladies night and there are male strippers and since the Terminator is naked he fits in perfectly until he finds some male to get his clothes and starts out to save John and Caire from FX.

		<fullReview>One Remark about the basic premise of the whole Terminator Series, but particular of this last episode: The last thing that would survive a nuclear war is Machines and Technology. The Authors show no clue if they know what large Infrastructure and Economy is modern day Technology based upon.Where are the Power Supplies, Factories, Mines, where is the transportation System and the Research Facilities to give any power at all to the Skynet System? It would have nuked out its own Requirements to exist by destroying mankind with nuclear weapons. So "The rise of the machines" would have been the end of any advanced machine and technological progress on earth.Instead, in Reality, the growing Power of Machines over Mankind is exercised through shaping Society according to the needs of Machines and Technology, not by simply destroying human Lives. I would have liked to see that Twist going somewhere into the series Finale (so eg. by preventing the nuclear War, Connor actually helps the Machines to seize Control) - well it did not and the Script stayed true to the Vision of the first and second Terminator Movie.</fullReview>

And that thought serves me right; T3 is just like Bay's steaming piles, only difference is it's not directed by him. But for some inexplicable reason, the director chose to follow in Bay's footsteps and ends up making this film as if he looked through his anus for inspiration. Was they sleeping together when they made this? I can't say for certain, but maybe if I get or borrow a friend's copy, pop it in my DVD player and turn on "Director's Commentary" I may find the answer to that question(and thus will most likely return it back to the store or friend when done with such film). This is one of those films you find at a cheap motel in some seedy part of of a city populated by unspeakable horrors of "society". Not a guilty pleasure by any means, but you get the idea.

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert! Please be advised.Terminator 3 was one of the most elaborate trailers (for Terminator 4) that I've ever seen! They should have cut this film down to twenty minutes, and added the content that they will be using in T4, but then, that would only give them one box office cash-in to look forward to, wouldn't it? (Ignore the fact that there wasn't enough content in T3 to compose a mentally gripping feature).I can get over the fact that the story had no real point. Do any of the Terminator films really have any mentally or spiritually beneficial message? No. It's not expected from a film about machines that kill people. But it is a frustrating experience to sit through two hours of fluff and exploding cars only to discover that you'll have to wait for T4 in order to get to the action that the T3 trailers promised you.If you're a die-hard Schwarzenegger fan, and a sucker for the Terminator franchise, and you have a thing for Kristanna Loken, well...you'll probably still be disappointed, but like the droves that delivered a $150 million box office for the film, you'll probably still put yourself through the painful experience, so when it's over, just remember: you were warned. Next time, think twice, read reviews, ask friends, and most importantly, LISTEN, when considering going out to see any film with a "3" in the title (or, in the case of the Terminator franchise, a "4").</fullReview>

So why did somebody continue the story when James Cameron, already finished it? We might not know the answer to that, but one things for sure, it set the "low milking standard" for films like xXx 2, 2 Fast 2 Furious and Batman and Robin.

This movie has not thing to do with the Terminator Franchise.The producers simply make this movie for milking the Stupid Hardcore Terminator Fans. But True Fans like us treat this Spin-off as a funny Forgettable Crape.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Spoilers******)"T3" is the highly anticipated installment in one of Hollywood's most innovative and celebrated franchises, originated by writer-director James Cameron with the 1984 cult hit The Terminator. With the blockbuster 1991 sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Cameron redefined the science fiction/action film hybrid. This movie was from the minds of John Brancato, Micheal Ferris and Tedi Sarafian. From their story, director Jonathan Mostow raped Cameron's baby, by rechanging the last epic.A decade has passed since John Connor(Nick Stahl) helped prevent Judgment Day - the day Skynet's highly developed network of machines was fated to become self-aware and destroy mankind. But August 29, 1997 came and went without incident, despite Skynet's twice failed attempts to kill Connor and wage war on humanity. Now 22, Connor lives "off the grid" - no home, no credit cards, no phone and no job. No record of his existence. No way he can be traced by Skynet. Until..Skynet's most sophisticated cyborg killing machine T-X(Kristanna Loken) sent back through time to complete the job left unfinished by her predecessor, the T-1000. And she is exponentially more powerful, dangerous, destructive and beautiful than every Terminator that has come before her. But this time, Connor isn't the only target on Skynet's hit list - unsuspecting veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) will see her distant past and promising present collide with an unimaginable future. When Connor and Kate realize that Judgment Day is rocketing toward them - with only three hours between them and the end of the world - their only hope for survival is a replica of the cyborg Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) Connor's mysterious - and now obsolete - former assassin. Together, they must forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day or face the fall of civilization as we know it.!By watching this piece of disaster I thought, for what reason this happened? Did Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna get more Greedy this time? Or Arnold wanted a Cinematic boost before his political debut?First of all absence of James Cameron in every sense. His characters were treated badly, the Terminator punch lines were now reduced for comic relief, his visionary world turned upside down. The soul of the movie was seen as a big round hole when it comes to music. The absence of Brad Fiedel, in which the classic "Clank" sound gives the signature of Terminator, is thrown out in this version. The new replacement for Fiedel (Marco Beltrami) was the worst part after Mostow.Without Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, or even William Wisher Jr. (Cameron's co-writer) director Jonathan Mostow managed to bring a Science Fiction tale in a greater level and fails miserably. The early draft storyline was John Connor as a successful computer programmer, who ends up being instrumental in the activation of Skynet. Nick Stahl tried his best to bring up the matured John Connor who transformed as savior of the world but was not convincing. The Strength of all Terminator movies was that they had a strong villain but this one break that rule. The neither TX character nor Kristanna Loken has the charisma of the Dark Force which was portrayed powerfully by Robert Patrick &amp; Arnold in the Original movies.The only strength to the movie was Arnold himself even though he agreed to do this lame chapter. Please don't do another Terminator movie!I give this movie 0 out of 10.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines = Terminator For WHAT ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much was lacking from this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as compared to T2. I loved T2. The special effects were new and story was great. T3 has your average special effects, but the problem is the story is not very good nor interesting. I'm glad I didn't see it at the theater. Most of the chase scenes are rather boring since it's nothing new. And the new TX doesn't do a lot of cool stuff. Plus, this movie was made like a pg-13 film. There were only a couple of scenes that made it an R. The terminator films are R movies because they have blood and violence. In T3, there is a lot of violence from machine guns, but the only real blood involves the TX sticking her arm through a cop while he's driving.There is a cameo from the doctor at the psych ward in T2. He just runs off when he sees Arnie. There was so much potential for a big laugh there, but we didn't get it.And the way Arnie dies here is so uneventful as compared in T2. In T2 it was moving, but we don't even see him die on screen here. The ending does set itself up for a sequel that has a lot of potential, but they don't need to make it if James Cameron won't do it.FINAL VERDICT: If you are someone just dying to know what happens next in the terminator series, than check it out. Otherwise, it isn't that great of a film just to pick up at the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A "Terminator" film without writer-director James Cameron seemed doomed from the start and sadly the prediction would ultimately become a reality. "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" picks up several years after the events of the second film and John Connor (Nick Stahl) has become little more than a nomad, constantly moving around because of the fact he does not feel safe anywhere. Even though everything was supposedly solved at the conclusion of "Terminator 2", Stahl cannot help but feel that danger still looms. He is of course right as a new terminator (in the form of the strikingly beautiful Kristanna Loken) comes into the picture and chaos strikes. Naturally Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a re-programmed terminator sent from the future to protect Stahl at all costs. Also along for the ride is engaged veterinarian Claire Danes who has an important role to play in the future. Skynet (ran by David Andrews, who is also Danes' father) is still the governmental entity that must be stopped, altering the future for good. "Terminator 3" struggles the whole way through and nearly won me over anyway with fast-paced action and clever one-liners. However, the direction by Jonathan Mostow (a film-maker who does not hold a candle to Cameron) is never very clear and the writing staggers throughout. The final moments of the production are a huge downer too and it is made blatantly clear that there is always a chance for more installments. I was very close to giving "Terminator 3" a marginal thumbs up, but the ending was such a mess that it soured me on that notion. Not in the same league with the first installment and not in the same cinematic galaxy as the second. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sequel has finally come! Theatrecal &amp; video comments below!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines on the 4th of July 2003 and on the same night I saw The Hulk!It was an excellent experience seeing both blockbusters right after the other!It was well worth it and a unique way to spend on Independence Day!As a very big fan of the Terminator series this was a must see!The first one was dark movie and the second film was extraordinary and epic.The third one believe it or not I really can't say.Maybe it because I haven't seen this one a few dozen times like T2 but the movie just didn't seem or feel as epic.It didn't have that specialness the Judgment Day had that it was so perfect that you could cry feel.Sure it was an extremely entertaining movie as the action scenes in the new film were spectacular and some of biggest and greatest action scenes to date.The movie had some humor in it and other scenes were similar like the other two.As for the characters.Since Arnold's T-850 is different that the other Terminator he acted as if he really was different.His looks stayed about the same but with different guns and even a some what different attitude.The new villain the T-X or Terminatrix played by Kristanna Loken was a phenomenal character!She was the perfect choice to play the bad Terminator and she is much,much more power than the T-850.I don't want spoil what she can do but she can do just about anything!I really like the actress who plays her.She is a very neat looking young woman and I would love to see here in more action films.As for Claire Danes she played her part very well and yes I like her looks too just in case your curious.Nick Stahl was good and the way he played a older John Connor made it seem real.Earl Boen returns as Dr. Peter Silberman for a very brief moment and his role in this film was surprising.Unlike the beginning of T2 this beginning with the Endoskeletons looked all CGI but yet it looked great!Brad Fiedel is gone form the movie but Marco Beltrami's score is just as decent and even though the beautiful Terminator theme is gone until the end credits Beltrami has his own score! James Cameron is out and Jonathan Mostow is in.Mostow actually pulled it off!His direction was very good and I think the project was directed right.How Cameron would have directed and handled this new Terminator movie is unknown.I do hope there will be a sequel with the same cast.I think what I said above about it not being special is because I only saw it once.Overall it had plenty of fights between the Terminators and in the action scenes there was so much damage with chase scenes and it was never boring that I think it should satisfy most Terminator fans and even if your not a Terminator fan but love Arnold and action movies I think you should give this a look! I strongly recommend it!I bought the movie Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and in My opinion its is just as good and action packed as the other two. This one has a whole bunch of incredible action! Arnold was great! Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were good! I really liked Danes! Kristanna Loken was awesome as the T-X Terminatrix! She was the perfect choice to play this great villain! I hope to see this awesome looking woman in more action films in the near future! David Andrews and Earl Boen were good. The music by Marco Beltrami is excellent an is arguably the greatest score ever composed in My opinion! If you like Arnold and the other Terminator films and have not seen this movie then don't rent but buy this immediately because I strongly recommend it!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:Watch the the end credits for the original Terminator theme performed by Marco Beltrami! Also plays the cool song called "The Current" performed by The Blue Man Group featuring Gavin Rossdale! Its an excellent song!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director certainly knows how to control big action scenes as evidenced in the likes of Breakdown and U-571 yet the the scriptwriters have lost the plot when it comes to. plot, and there is far too much parody, turning Arnie into a caricature, like he is in the Simpsons.This just doesn't feel like a Terminator movie. It's more like a cover version, say The Datsuns covering an AC/DC song.Some of Arnie's lines are so bad such as `It's time', `I'm back' and, probably the most embarrassing part in the film, when he tells a guy at a checkout `talk to the hand'.We knew it was coming, we knew it was never gonna be as good as part 2, and it isn't.On the plus side, the new TX is very fit in her cherry red leather outfit and there are some really funny scenes and a couple of good action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Really Worthy Of Its Predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first 'Terminator' movie was released in 1984, the special effects were not that impressive, but the film had enough low-budget energy, enthusiasm and imagination on show that it made up for what it lacked from the technical aspects. 1991's mega-budget sequel was in many ways similar to the original, but with the wealth of spectacular, ground-breaking special effects on display, nobody really cared. This belated second sequel, however, brings nothing new to the formula other than the addition of a female 'Terminatrix'. The ageing Arnie is no longer the mean, lean fighting machine that was so threatening twenty-odd years ago, looking more like an awkward old relative that just keeps hanging about. Former model Kristanna Loken does a decent job as the 'Terminatrix' (or 'T-X'), although she doesn't really have to do a lot of acting other than looking mean and emotionless. (She looks fantastic, though!). Nick Stahl as John Connor lacks the charisma that Edward Furlong brought to the role in 'T2', but the faithful Claire Danes does a fine job as the love interest, Kate Brewster. The script, though, insistent on giving Arnie a constant stream of one-liners referring back to - or parodying - the previous two movies, only serves to keep reminding us how much better James Cameron's originals were. It does have its moments - there are some spectacular action sequences to be seen - but most of the time it only echoes what we've seen before. It may be worth seeing if you're an avid fan, but in the end it all feels a bit pointless. Rather than ending the series with a bang, it could have gone completely unnoticed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really, really bad. It is horrible in comparison to the other "T" movies. I don't know how this thing is up to a 7.0 out of 10. Where do they get these actors. The only one who is even remotely convincing (and she was indeed remotely convincing) was the Claire Danes chick. What a horribly scripted film. Arnie's lines remind me of that Vanilla Ice movie; bad one liner after bad one liner. The T-X girl doesn't even have a line. And why was she supposed to be more impressive than the T-1000? Because she can hotwire a car? And did they really kill her off the same way they killed Arnold off in the first Terminator? You have GOT to be kidding me. The only potential saving grace is the fact that this movie is so bad, that there is a lot of unintentionally funny moments, such as the T-101's "moral dilemma", and a lot of the plot is comically bad. Talk about corny. Can Arnold even act? I have seen a lot of his movies, and he tends to play the wooden meathead with limited vocabulary very well. I believe we saw it in T1, T2, T3, Kindergarten Cop, Twins, Commando, and every other movie I've ever seen him in. "She'll be back", "I'm back", "Talk to the hand": If these phrases are what you want to hear over and over, then by all means, go see this terrible movie. I believe I've heard them enough from 9 year olds imitating this movie, that I can't believe I wasted my time watching it. At least I didn't pay for it. I give it 2 out of 10, and that's only for the unintentionally comedic plot points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well its no Terminator 2 Judgement day which still rates as the best of the trilogy, but its still a good film. I think why I personally like it so much as it completes the movie cycle. In the first film we when shown glimpses of a possible future and same in T2, but in the closing momments of T3, we see the cycle complete as the Skynet takes over and starts the nuclear holocaust.My favorite moment has to be the ending, in the 2nd film we had hope for the future, and up until the end of T3 we had the same hope. All that changes the moment they realise that they are in a bunker. I personally felt the angst as they knew that there was nothing they could do to stop Skynet. I had tears in my eyes as the missiles launched and we saw humanity reduced to shreds, it was a powerful emotional ending. Director Jonathan Mostow should be congratulated for a risky ending which works.In order that we can enjoy the first two movies, this ending which was a total shock has to happen. The script I confess is a little weak and it does lack James Camerons magic touch, but i did enjoy the film and I really think its a good one to end the series. I love the terminator movies but I think it should end here.I personally rate 3.5 out of 5, not the best but still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of 2003 IMHO!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I don't exactly know why I liked it so much, but I think it was just about everything.I liked the second movie, but I that T3 had a higher level of sophistication and maturity as it ought to. There is nothing finer than a well produced movie with a full orchestra and a good, well presented theme. The themes in the first and second movies where transparent and never narrated, but if you look at T3, you will notice that the theme is so prominant that not only is it included in the subtitle just as in the second movie, but also the theme is narrated by John C. which I think is very important for setting a mood and I would say is appropriate in a sci-fi movie such as this one. Throught the whole movie character developement is strong. Arnold's character is used as both a metaphore of total annihilation and a foil for Nick's more fleshy character, John. Briliant. Additionally, the movie has great visuals and the action wasn't so quick that the projector couldn't keep up. The action was however largescale and very exciting while believable.My only beef with this movie is that it was too good to only be 120 minutes long. That's what a lot of people have been complaining about and I think they're 100% right. Let's hope the DVD has lots of extra scenes!Good Day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 is a very very fun action movie with a great story congruent with the rest of the Terminator series. A few things could have been done better such as the music and some of the picture; nonetheless it was a great film. Best movie of the year (2003) for me so far because it leaves you with little to think about after it's done. When you finish watching the movie your left with some real funny impressions from it, rather than with some fishy existentialism theory or weird feelings that make your head spin.10/10 - just for being the best this year</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing T2 on video, complete with directors cuts, I though T2 was the best movie I'd ever seen in my life. Emotion mixed with action, complete with plot and believeable characters. Great! So I was all hyped up when T3 came out, and went to see it at the first showing in my cinema... I came out thinking why was that so good? Where did the $185m budget all go? It was all just blowing stuff up. Even the T-x was a disappointment- she just didn't seem that much more advanced (compared to the T-1000). And John... the way he acted just didn't seem like John! He wasn't the way I thought he'd be... Basically, I thought T3 was pretty rubbish, and to me it was a big disappointment. The storyline was... well, nonexistant, the dialogue (especially from the T-800) sounded forced and like they were just going for the jokes. Terminator is not a comedy, so don't try and make it one! Any humour that should be in it comes naturally. And that's about all I have to say...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action but doesn't live up to the Terminator legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the action but almost none of the story...The Hollywood pattern is alive and well in T3.What pattern? That Hollywood cannot follow up classics with similar quality. That Hollywood cannot remake a movie or a legend and preserve the power or depth of the original storyline. That Hollywood will almost always place effects and action above good storytelling.T3 had good "Terminator action". As we would expect with T3's budget and current FX technology, the fight and sequences were great eye candy. Certainly, that's one ingredient of the Terminator movies. However, unlike T2, there was nothing groundbreaking or cutting edge here.As for the story; well... let me not belabor the details. That would not be fair, as T3 made itself such an easy target. Suffice it to say the story doesn't live up to the two Terminator predecessors. The overall story was pale, indeed, compared with T1 and T2. Add to that more plot holes that a T-800's flesh covering has at the end of each movie. Even the dates don't add up when John talks about his age as various events occur. It was a barely above average plot with very little care given to the details. Barely above average for movies in general; but T1 and T2 were well above average.The directing struck me as average. Sure, there were some great action sequences, especially in the chase scenes. Nonetheless, the camera angles, the lighting, the gripping photgraphy; all those elements which Cameron added in T1 and T2 just were not present in T3. The overall "artistry" was competent but inferior to T1 &amp; T2.Acting was decent, with the exception of the T-X. Loken had the look and knows how to strike a pose but when she spoke, she just didn't grip me. Neither her voice nor articulation added to the mystery or the menace which should be the T-X.All in all, this is a movie worth watching. As I mentioned, the action and FX are good. There are some great lines and a couple moments of visual humour. Where this movie fails is that it does not live up to its legend, especially after a haitus of many years. Indeed, it was reminicient of Star Wars Episode I in that respect.Utlimately it's worth watching but I would consider this installment to be a major letdown considering that we waited 12 years hoping for a movie of at least similar quality to T2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***This comment is one gigantic spoiler, so brace yourself*** Firstoff I've been a huge Terminator fan since I was the age of 6. I love both films and they're in my Top 3 of movies of all time (Along with The Godfather, and Goodfellas) Now this T3 comes along, and it's supposed to be a bigger more Badass Terminator than we already know. Rather than give my review, I'm going to give you a play-by-play of how this movie starts from my point of view.This movie starts off, no Terminator Theme, no frightening yet mysterious visions of fire, just a black screen with the casts names up there. After a minute of agonizing nothingness, we hear John Connor speak. Now this isn't the rebellious, "Doesn't give a damn," "Leader of the Resistance" John Connor we know and love. No-no-no that would be too cool. Instead he hear the first words of what would later be found to be a whiny little brat that could couldn't lead a dog to a can of Alpo. His first words are "No Fate but what we make for ourselves" (an idea that was presented to us in the first 2 films, but after getting into this 'film', we'll soon realize that James Cameron's idea will be sh-t all over, and it's ass will be wiped with dollar bills.) After we hear him yap for a while, we cut to a CGI nightmare of the future. This scene is the first major rip-off of the first 2 films, the difference is the original version (again, I remind you that it was made in 1984) looked 10x better.Fast forward a few minutes (I mean this movie has to get better,) And we see the classic scene where The Terminator arrives. Only this time it looks like a bad comic book. It literally looks like a parody of the originals. And do we get a tough, bad-ass, gives your children nightmares Terminator ? No-no, again, that would be too cool. We get some Victoria Secret model with neat hair, perfect make-up, and motherly eyes. The overdone CGI, which include the manikins melting and a 'cool' grid that surrounds the time portal is just enough to make me sick to my stomach. After she steals a car (it's a Lexus, by the way if you didn't see the 8 foot, million dollar logo) she makes a call on her (Nokia) cellphone and identifies her 8 targets. Blah-blah, runs red light, cop car, Victoria's Secret ad, boobs, likes cops gun.If that weren't enough of a slap in James Cameron's face, this will be. We see Arnold stroll into a Bar, just like in T2. But get this, it's not a Biker-bar this time, it's...he-he...I can't stop laughing while typing this...it's... a male strip club! And they all think Arnold is a male stripper he-he! While "Macho Man" is playing in the background, Arnold spots clothing that fit him...and get this...they're on a Stripper! Who would have guessed!? BRILLIANT writing. After quite possibly the gayest exchange I've ever seen in a movie (and I've seen Brokeback mountain,) I'm wrong yet again. Apparently the writers thought it would be funny if The Terminator, the same guy who mercilessly shot the wrong Sarah Connor in the face, and tried to run the real one down with a Mac truck...wore pink Elton John sunglasses. Why again did Arnold agree to this ? (Oh yea, 30 million big ones) You can literally hear the writers laughing to themselves. Only it's not a normal laugh, it's one of those geeky, nasally, Steve Urkel laughs. Next scene: How did he remember to look in the sun visor for keys when John taught to the other Terminator? I'm not going to even go into this movie any further, because I honestly feel like I'm losing braincells writing a review for it. In summary, this movie is a joke. An unfunny caricature and borderline parody of, arguably, 2 of the greatest films ever produced. Lets see if the Sarah Connor Chronicles, and T4 can clean up the mess that T3 has made for the franchise.One star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the director of T3 just gave up doing one thing that other series movie director want to do. That is, "N+1 should be better than n". Yes, T2 is fantastic, outstanding, classic of all time, or simply-invincible. Trying to make more effects, explosions will not make any good, so why not ignore T2 and tell a whole new story for upcoming T4, T5? If you consider T3 as a introductory to the real judgement day, T3 has many clues and foreshadowing which can be developed for John Connor.But I still can not imagine how John lead the mankind to fight back. With some home-make bombs? And in T3, Skynet only has some prototype of T1 in 2003, that's a little bit too weak. Remember, T-800 are supposed to conquer the Earth in early 21st! Maybe John did see 2 terminators and know how they were terminated, but that's far far away from fighting back by a resistance leader who only know how to make dynamics!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is another example on how a big budget can completely fail on making a good movie. It's a shame that this peace of garbage is titled Teminator. For me that means the Terminator franchise (if you want to call it that) is finally terminated. Thanks to a ridiculous story, poor actors like John Connor (Nick Stahl) and his friends which look like directly taken out of a levis commercial, a female Terminator that reminds me of cheap erotic action comics, and Arnold Schwarzenegger ready for the wheelchair. This is one of the cinema movies you really regret you payed for. Or in one word, this flick is dumb in every aspect.Terminator 1 and 2 were really good flicks with a intelligent story. This one here is just a joke.Avoid it at all costs unless you're the dumb or sadistic type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear god, this film is just beyond word. It has no need to have ever been made after terminator 2, which was good. The way they explain why the war wasn't stopped... really wasn't an explanation at all "judgement day is inevitable". Well, how scientific, i didn't know Jonathan Mostow put so much thought in to it there. Arnold acting in this is worse then usual, like you ever thought that possible. The CGI is credible, but not nearly enough to save this doomed film. After terminator 2, the story ended with a sense of ambiguity, almost to give the film a more realistic edge, what the screen doesn't show me, my mind makes it more powerful by imagining the outcome. The creation of this movie has ruined this mental picture, and ruined the last shred of Arnold Schwarzeneggers dignity. At least in the other films he was cool and hard, they ruined it by adding the comedy aspect (you all know what i'm talking about).

		<shortDescription>So Freaking Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I had a feeling when they were planning on making a 3rd installment in the series that it might suck, but I kept mind open nonetheless. A few friends of mine went and saw this film in theaters and came back and raved about how great the movie was. So naturally I was interested. I waited until the movie came to video stores and then I rented it. I was not prepared for one of the worst pieces of garbage cinema I have ever seen. I could go on and on about how horrible this movie was. First of all, whoever wrote the script needs to be executed. This is prime example of what not to do. Second, the whole storyline was bogus and highly unoriginal. I was so hoping to see a futuristic waist land like how they should in the first two films and to officially see the war against the machines. Instead, they gives a load of horses---. Third, the acting was so atrocious that I could feel my brain cells leaking out of my head. Fourth, not even Arny himself could make this a fun movie. I admit that I like his silly catch phrases but it just didn't work in this film. For instance, instead of saying "I'll Be Back" like in the other films he says after a fight with the T-X "She'll be Back". Need I say more. All in all, one of the worst movies I have ever seen and all copies of the film should be burned. AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most fun I've had watching an 'action flick' in a long time. Way more entertaining than the other two which are so dated and over hyped. A few of the action sequences are some of the best I've ever seen. Without a doubt the best 'car chase' scene, bar none!I also found the first two tried to be way to serious and emotional, they're action flicks for pity sake, they're suppose to be mindless fun!Watch a Mearchant Ivory picture if you want heavy drama. Nick and Claire were great too...and Arnold was...well, Arnold:)All in all I have to say it was a great film...I had a blast watching it, and after all isn't that what these type of movies are suppose to be...fun?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so crap it redefines the word crap. Why oh why did Hollywood make this piece of unhygienic waste when they could have spent more time on creating more wonderful pieces of art such as that of the film spider-man.T3 fails on all levels, storyline, direction and acting. First, the storyline is utter nonsense because of the way it depicts the future and the past. Secondly, the direction is that a dog could have done a better job and finally the actors poorly portray the characters which James Cameron has tried so hard to produce. One thing that truly makes me want to puke is that the fact that i actually liked Arnold's films before i watched this with memories of T2 still in my mind, after watching the excellent film in my childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody Awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1984 I lied about my age and sneaked into a cinema to watch Terminator. Wow! What a movie. In 1992 I saw T2 and was just as thrilled. They are both fantastic, so I was really looking forward to this. What a let down :( It's hard to find "spoilers", because there's no plot, though a lot of (gaping) plot holes. This film cost a fortune to make but it's SO bad it actually feels like a TV movie. Lots of explosions, but not much else. My biggest complaint is that it all moves far too quickly. There's no 'depth' to any of the characters and they all look as if they'd rather be doing something else. On the good side (thinking hard) Clair Danes is a very talented actress, though struggling with naff material. Arnold does look incredible for his age &amp; it's staggering to think he was 55/56 during filming, but he sounds 'weary' and has none of the menace of the earlier films. As for Nick Stahl. Sorry Nick; you couldn't act to save your life. One particular line from big Arnie sums up this rotten movie for me: "My CPU is working but I have no control over my other functions." I honestly expected him to pee his trousers at that point. I'm glad to see most other folks thought T3 was awful and I won't even be bothering to see T4 when it inevitably comes along. It was sad to see Arnold Schwarzenegger end his movie career on such a low note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember looking so forward watching the 3rd terminator as I enjoyed immensly the first too, but there was a shadow of a doubt in me, as Lida Hamilton was not part of the team, James Cameron was not the director and in general sequels suck!!!So July 31st arrived (UK premier) and with my housemates prebooked tickets so we would be among the first.I must say that I was very impressed as I was with the previous 2 and when it was released on DVD I bough tit straight away and I have watched it twice already.The story line, pretty much the same as the last two T's, two machines came from the future: one to kill john connor the other to protect him, but with nice twists and sub plot in between it was not very predictable after all. You will not get bored in this movie...far from!!!Above all are the effects: T1 and T2 are considered to be ahead of their time when it comes to visual effects and in the 3rd one...well these people have done a hell of a job to keep the Terminator effects tradition very much alive setting new standards.And on a personal note: Kristanna Loken can terminate me any time!!!Without a doubt, a must see/must have movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3 is so bad that it completely tarnishes the entire series. Why they find it necessary to go the comical route is beyond me. If any of the lame jokes that found their way into the movie were actually funny then maybe it wouldn't have been so bad but "talk to the hand?" Give me a break. That whole morality issue they tried to impart on the terminator this time was incredibly funny though. Unfortunately it wasn't meant to be. And why did they send back a wrinkly, less muscular terminator this time? Because Arnold has entered the washed up era of his career and thought that throwing together a 3rd installment for his most popular work would re-ignite his career. It's so sad when good stars go bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The terminator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the sequel to `The Terminator' and `Terminator 2.' The rise of the machines has more explosions, more action, and a better plot than the earlier two films. Terminator 3 `Rise of the Machines' is directed by Jonathon Mostow. The movie is about machines that look like people sent from the future to protect or kill John Connor (Nick Stahl). The machines are called terminators. The terminator that is sent back to keep John Connor alive is well acted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The big difference with this movie is that the terminator is not just sent back in time to protect the beloved John Connor, but is there to protect Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). The reason is because Kate and John are supposed to get married in the future and later their children will become important to mankind.John Connor is important, because he is to protect the world from the machines. He becomes the leader of the people. On the day of the ending of the world, as we know it, is very close, and he will save the people that are left. The movie has another terminator called the T-X (Kristanna Loken). She is the perfect hot chick to play the part of a terminator. She is sent back in time to kill John Connor and all of his lieutenants. The plot has thickened; John and Kate must survive to ensure the survival of mankind in the future. I believe this movie is better than the first and second films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trash. An insult to James Cameron and an even bigger insult to the Terminator story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, i generally give good reviews on lots of movies because i like to turn off from the real world and i realize that movies are for entertainment, but having said that i think Terminator 3 was the biggest load of trash i have ever seen. I LOVED the first two, the cast, the script, the storyline the effects blahblahblah everything was PERFECT, but this movie? Jesus no.Now the much debated storyline was of course a letdown, i still don't understand how something they prevented from being made (skynet) suddenly existed and how did they manage to send 2 terminators back when there isn't even a war, maybe i missed a large chunk of the movie or something, i think the idea is something to do with the war being inevitable even though theres no way all this shit could have happend in the first place, it just did, cool.as for the acting, the one liners were awful, the new enemy was a nice idea but the chick who played her role sucked :( And the whole tight leather outfit just made it even made it look even more pathetic. Thew new john conner wasn't john conner at all. I think the only good addition to the movie was claire danes, she played her part well, props to her.2 scenes which i hated were:1) bathroom fight with the 2 terminators - the tx just throws arnold across the room with no effort, why would she have a problem fighting him after? yes i know she did kick his ass but he shouldn't have been able to put up the slightest bit of a fight, they should have either kept it even or made it a complete blowout (one termiantor destroying the other) they shouldn't have done both it was just retarded.2) when arnold was approaching john outside the plane trying to resist hurting him - robots don't have emotions, IF A ROBOT IS PROGRAMMED TO DO SOMETHING IT DOES IT, NOT BECAUSE SOME GUY HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW DOESN'T WANT HIM TO. And the fact that he slightly changes his voice when he says "I AM A MACHINE" made me sad. It seems as though nobody else noticed that but whatever.there was probably a million other things i could point out, but i can't be bothered, so anyway i think that this movie was a real let down, a below par trashy movie with women in leather cheesy one liners car chases and a typical ending for marketing, they'll obviously make another, lets hope james cameron answers our prayers and brings back the magic that was in the first two.0.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1 of 10, or 2 broken thumbs.Could just as easily be a non-animated Animatrix story, though not nearly as entertaining or meaningful.It's like watching a movie of George W. Bush playing a video game he had the NSA program. Nothing new. End of the world fantasies. Same old music and video FX as previous Terminators. Just another movie by a corporation trying to profit off the Matrix's popularity.The acting and character choices don't help. The main character (hero and savior) is living "off the grid". Despite earning a living doing construction work and riding a big motorcycle, he looks like a childhood star (or son of a president) that got pampered most his life and then started doing drugs.Then there's the terminators' fight scenes. Like watching pro-wrestling. Stand there and take my best shots, then fall down, then get up, then have the other guy stand there and take your best shots. Repeat. Pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning:Spoilers Below, Contains movie detailsSaw this movie July 1st as part of a sneak preview. Special effects are the only thing worthy in this movie. A quick synopsis -Arnie is back as the Terminator. No Sarah Connor(Hamilton) ,conveniently bumped off(leukemia is the reason given by her son John),and now a female terminator(Lokken) is after John Connor(Stahl)and Arnie must stop her. Claire Danes stars as Kate Brewster who's father is the main thing behind SKYNET the computer defense system that starts the WAR to end all WARS. She ends up running with John Connor from the female TX baddie who now is not only after them but also starts killing off members of the future army that John will lead to victory over the machines years later. They must stop SKYNET to prevent the end of the World and the Rise of the Machines.I had 2 main problems with this movie Number 1 Bad acting(Stahl is terrible as John Connor-supposedly Edward Furlong who played John in T2 had a drug problem and was unavailable)Lokken as the female counterpart to Arnie doesnt have the expresions or body language to pull off the villain role(she looks like a fashion model).Claire Danes simply put is a Kate Capshaw clone(think Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom-AWFUL).Linda Hamilton is sorely missed ,Arnie does better( he does have a few humorous scenes) but still he cant carry this movie and it shows.Number 2 -Major plot holes. The machines twice have sent back robots to kill Connor ,Now,if they were victorious in the future over the machines ,why didnt his future self send a terminator back in time to stop SKYNET before it was ever created and prevent all this. In the 2nd movie isnt that what we were led to believe(they blew up that building with all the files and arnie melted himself) yet in T3 here is skynet and all these prototype terminators being made. How the hell did this happen?,Its never explained ,supposedly im guessing is that the technology was not totally destroyed in T2 when they blew up the lab. There must have been other labs but they never explain this.Also, the terminator says that he is sent back in time to stop the TX by Johns future wife Kate(Danes).Asked why ,he says that John is dead killed by him ,i couldnt figure that out since John supposedly leads the humans to victory over the machines ,its all so confusing.If the machines were destroyed how does he get killed and where does the TX come from and man it gets more confusing. The ending will just frustrate you and it leaves the door open for a sequel. If you think there wont be a T4 guess again ,they said the same thing about movies like Aliens and Jaws yet they continued to pump out sequels(pretty bad ones) yet they still made them.Lets hope if they do indeed make a T4 that they can clean up the mess T3 left behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original crew dropped out, this is what happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being that there are so many points in Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines which could make you realize its a bad movie, its hard to determine the first one that really makes you give up all hope for the remaining hours. I'll help you because its really quite obvious; When Arnold pulls out shades from his leather jacket, puts them and realizes that (Ha Ha!) there star shaped!! Then he smirks and crunches them. If he had left them on you really wouldn't have noticed because the rest of the movie is spent with the bad-ass T-1000 cracking inside joke one-liners about how "robotic" he is. In an attempt to top T2000 (from T2), they decided that the cool metal skeleton robot could be covered by the really cool liquid metal to form the coolest robot ever! Obviously they realized how stupid that was and just decided to make it a hot chick who can do, literally, anything. You know where this is going because they recycled it from the second movie. John Connors must be saved blah blah blah. The few writing elements which are new to T3 are old to anyone who's seen a movie before.Even though Arnold has way too many lines for a killing machine, he still plays a great robot. Its easy to pick apart actors who play robots but this was always his best role and he does it better than anyone else. When she wasnt the butt of a joke or timing out the perfect punchline, Clair Danes delivers the only other believable performance in T3. I guess she slipped through the cracks because Nick Stahl and Krisstana Loken text book "acted" there way through the entire movie draining life out of the already decaying script. If you could orchestrate the perfect bad movie scene by scene you would inevitabley produce T3. It was exciting to watch. Each scene that went by I grew more and more excited to see how they could possibly make this movie any worse. Amazingly, through bad direction weak acting and horrendous writing, they did it! Too bad the Wayans brothers werent involved, at least then we would have known it was going to be a spoof.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing one wonders about T3 is whether Arnie can still give the same performance he did in the previous two movies? If you watch this film, worrying about that, then you will eventually not be disappointed since Arnie's performance is top notch and is easily on par with the previous two. Problem is that the other characters in the movie were'nt giving it the same effort he was. Nick Stahl was completely inappropriate as John connor and comes across as a complete and utter loser incapable of doing anything while his pairing up with claire danes is nothing short of hilarious. Overall, there are a few good action scenes but the plot and acting stink. I can't believe that some people would even go as far as to compare this junk with T2!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could they do this? How could James Cameron let them? T2 was and is the only reason I ever give action movies a chance. Its heart and simple but powerful theme has haunted me ever since I was a child, when I would stay up all night and watch it while everyone was asleep, so not a single sound would distract me. It to me is so much more than great special effects that were astounding for their time, more than a huge action blockbuster. It was and is a portrait of humanity's struggle against the horrors we create for ourselves, of the cruelty of fate, of the power of family. It is an example of all the right elements coming together at the right time to create something so powerful and moving that it has inspired a force of loal fans who seem to feel the same outrage I do about T3.T2 ended with a sense of hope for the future, leaving us all the gift of being able to imagine ourselves the fate of the world. No one could've devised a better ending to the story. T3 (and now T4, I hear) are lame excuses to use a popular name and popular characters to continue a story in a way that sends it spiraling down from the intelligence and power it had in T2. It infuriates me that anyone would cheapen an excellent movie with unnecessary and inferior sequels. Does anyone in Hollywood bother to think up *original* ideas anymore? Maybe I should stop coming up with my own ideas for screenplays and novels and, I don't know, pen a crappy sequel to E.T. ::sigh:: The casting probably bothers me more than anything else, oddly enough, though I would have protested any superfluous sequel no matter who it starred. Frankly, Claire Danes should not be on camera. EVER. Anyone who made the mistake of seeing the trashy remake of Romeo and Juliet, made for those who can't bear the pain of cracking a book, will get what I'm saying. She acts like she's reading off a cue card, and that really only works for Arnold, who will never get my vote for betraying the Terminator story. Linda Hamilton, who gave a stunning performance in T2, was smart enough to stay away, and I hope Eddie Furlong, who did a remarkable job in T2, especially considering he'd never acted before, never sees the imbecile they replaced him with.I guess the people behind T3 thought they were terribly clever using a female villain, the reasoning being, I suppose, "Hey, she has boobs! That will make up for our utter lack of plot!" I shudder to think what T4 will be throwing at us. Maybe John Connor's future children will fight the machines a la Spy Kids, and Hilary Duff can provide the soundtrack. Sadly enough, if T3 was possible, anything is.The nightmare continues. Since sequels are proving how undefeatable those machines are, maybe they can transport me back to 1992, so I can prevent this from happening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Good To Say The Least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this at a friends house because I refused to actually pay hard cash to see it when it was at theatres. I hate to say that what I thought it would be a terrible rehash. It was. I guess it was inevitable. Sequals usually get progressively worse. Yes there have been a few exceptions which I don't care to take the time to name. Put it this way if you can't name the great sequals stop reading this comment and move on to the next. This movie along with any "John Woo ventures" was the antithisis of what is wrong with movies today. First of all movies are no longer made by Americans for Americans. They have to have a Global Audiance. In order to have a so-called GLOBAL AUDIANCE they have to be dumbed down so anyone down to a second grade education can fully comprehend the movie and not be left out. Secondly while people will rant and rave about the so-called special effects in this movie, I was not impressed. Computer Generated Effects are littered throughout the movie in places where computer generated effects have no business being. I guess I am old school but I will take a stuntman in a sweaty T shirt, or a professional model builder working on a model, over a computer geek seven days a week and twice on sunday. CGI has it's place but to not the affect it has infected Hollywood today. I love it how they try and say the computer generated stuff is so special when most of the time it is not special at all. Anyway this comment is on T3 so I will get on with it. The plot and Screenplay was uninspiring, uninteresting, and remarkabley short on imagination. The direction while technically adequate judement was poor on his choice of CGI, Lighting, Filmstock, and Casting Agent. The Acting was as good as it probably could be with the afore mentioned lacking. The attempt at comedy in the motion picture did not work. I think that pretty much does it. (SPOILERS) The one positive thing I could say is that the best part of the movie was the one minute before the bombs drop and 2 seconds after Arnold and the Terminatrix depart. For a two minute period I thought I saw and most importantly felt something special. Or maybe I just had to go to the bathroom. Well anyways, I can't wait for T4 because just like Judgement Day in the movie it is inevitable. Hopefully it can't get any worse. And if are Dear Govenor Swartzenager can pull himself away from our States Legislature to make it. I will definetely go over to my friends house to mooch another free viewing of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a HUGE fan of the previous Terminator films, I eagerly awaited this installment. Although, as the release date loomed closer, I began having low expectations for the film. Simply because T2 was so incredible. It was an action film, but not JUST an action film. The action was placed in a story about morality, human relationships, fate, and the possible dangers of the advancement of technology.While T2 succeeded on many levels, T3 succeeds in none. From beginning to end, I was just sitting there hoping it would get better. John Connor's opening narration/update made me sick to my stomach - Just start the story already! The acting was terrible from the entire ensemble. Kristanna Loken played her part like she was slapped in the middle of a B horror flick, Nick Stahl was weak, and Claire Danes (who I usually really like) seemed to have nothing to do but scream the entire time.The writing was awful, making this an "ending" to T2 that just was not necessary. Character development was pushed to the back-burner, as John Connor's character even regressed at one point. The action had the distinct feeling of having been done before.T3 belongs right next to Mostow's other waste, U-571. In the trash. 1/10...........only because I could not give it a 0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie not expecting much, afterall it lacked Linda Hamilton, James Cameron, even the man that did the musical score. Arnold was there but, hey, you've seen the type of movies he has been in lately. Lets just say you can tell this wasn't written by Cameron. Its doesn't even seem to be written to any coherent line of reason. Why would the Terminatrix go after John's lieutenants if the other two could care less in the past? Why did her hand magically fix itself when her programming told her it was broken? Why would Sarah Connor fill her coffin with weapons? How does a machine remote control cars when no such computer exists in said cars? How the hell did the Terminatrix even find and then outrun John's truck with that huge semi truck (They can't move THAT fast!) Where did the computer virus come from? How is Skynet still Skynet since it was originally a mainframe but now a software program? The original films say Skynet killed virtually everyone when they tried to pull the plug when humanity feared Skynet's sentience yet here they supposedly can't since its "software" and not "hardware". So the memory of the Terminator from T2 was false since that data came from Skynet? Why didn't this Terminator kill humans since he didn't swear to John like T2 and especially since he could only take orders from Claire Danes? What was up with the one liners by Arnold? How was this Terminator's power source different from the two prior movies? In Terminator and T2 you see the main power source is in the abdominal area with a back up. Here he has some stupid slot where he can crack it open and turn it into a mini nuclear bomb. Why did the military have multiple prototypes? Last time I checked a prototype of anything was simply that one piece to be tested and then built in mass if it worked. Why the hell did the place even have a particle accelerator when their work in the lab had nothing to do with atomics?!?!? How did the Terminatrix even pull herself off the magnet when it was never turned off? Why did John continue to hang around the L.A. area if he didn't want to be found? And this is only a few of my problems with the flick. The acting wasn't that good (John is definately not an inspiring leader), the plotting was slow, and they attempted too much humor (the growing breasts was useless and sophmoric). James should have gone with the original T2 ending of John Connor playing in the future with his daughter as Sarah watched talking of how they averted Judgement Day. This trash was far from worthy of the Terminator name and, funniest of all, I saw this movie the day after the premier and the theater was virtually empty. Is that a good sign?</fullReview>

I was expecting at least some more info about the rise of the machines and possibly time travel, so we have something new to taste... but nooo... some things i liked though, maybe the way how arnie came back in the game, the terminator woman did a great job of acting, but the movie couldn't provide the atmosphere of the previous two.If you like action popcorn movies with really expensive effects, go for it... otherwise, rather go see the second or the first in the series again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, if they couldn't get James Cameron on board to helm a second sequel to "The Terminator", they just shouldn't have bothered, but this is Hollywood and so they pressed on, engaging the services of one Jonathan Morrow, a director you've never heard of before and aren't likely to hear of again anytime soon: simply put, this is ONE LOUSY DIRECTOR! True, no one is ever going to accuse the first two films of being part of the greatest movies ever made, and while I enjoyed the first (it was what it was: fun and creepy, even) and hated the second (too full of itself, too full of its own supposed "importance", it's James "King of the World" Cameron's overbloated message movie saying 'war is wrong!'. This just in), one can say at the very least they both had a passion, that whatever their faults the director, his stars, the screenwriter, etc., BELIEVED IN IT. Not this time, baby: from the word 'go', there isn't an original thought or idea on display, either behind or in front of the cameras, and it even goes so far as to rip its own franchise off, and not too well, either. James Cameron supposedly didn't want to do this film because he felt, correctly, that "T2" completed the story, and so THIS film becomes one predictable rehash of everything you've seen before, and NOT just in "The Terminator" movies: if you've seen even just a handful of action flicks, especially in the last few years, you'll be hard-pressed not to accurately guess what happens in each scene, or each shot, right down to the FX, which, after "T2", are also derivative and seem...been-there-done-that. One could hope that its stars might make up for the director's deficiencies but that's a lost cause, too: Nick Stahl, a not-untalented young actor, assumes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong but doesn't have Furlong's sense of star-crossed vulnerability - he merely comes off cocky, and aware at every moment he's taken over a role ill-suited to him; as for the always-angst-ridden Claire Danes (seriously in danger of becoming this era's Jennifer Jason Leigh if she doesn't make a film in which she's happy, laughs, smiles, breaks wind, whatever!), she has the thankless task of replacing Linda Hamilton (this is driven home in one unintentionally funny moment when, in all seriousness, not long after Danes learns she and Stahl will be man and wife in the future and she's grabbed a gun and mowed down a machine-on-the-loose, Stahl says, "You remind of my mother", which gives proof that this film is not only written by a man but by a man who doesn't understand the first thing about women. I dare ANY man to say those words - "You remind me of my mother" - to a woman he likes or loves, then sit back and ruminate the possibility of a long, LONG, lonely existence.) Unfortunately, Danes has about 2 expressions: despair and disbelief. Both of these are understandable reactions to learning there are actual robotic lifeforms running amok in L.A. (as opposed to those making films like this), but her performance is wearing. HOWEVER, at least she GIVES a performance, unlike the Barbie doll chosen to be the Big Bad Terminator: for his role in "T2", Robert Patrick says he perfected his creepy, shark-like stare by studying birds of prey, and he was entirely successful in instilling fear; the young actress here (OK, so I forget her name - it isn't all that important since I seriously doubt you'll be hearing much about her) resembles nothing more than the over-blonde love child of Christina Ricci and Jamie Pressly, all work-the-runway supermodel swagger and pout, and ZERO menace; her attempts at trying to be "fearsome" - which consists of nothing more than lowering her chin and trying to stare through her tweezed eyebrows with her perfectly made-up eyes (apparently, in this terrible future, cyborgs - in addition to being the perfect killing machine - are also learned disciples of Estee Lauder) - are, at best, ridiculous, and often faintly hilarious. As for Arnold, well, all the concealer and pancake make-up in the world cannot hide what the camera makes GLARINGLY OBVIOUS: he's a little long-in-the-tooth for this kind of thing. At times, he practically seems to have been dipped in formaldehyde: you'll notice AT NO TIME is ANY strong light upon his face in ANYTHING but distant shots (where it may not be him, anyway), and all close-ups seem oddly darkened (Elizabeth Taylor used that trick, too: a black stocking over the lens to smooth out any tell-tale lines.) His appearance also smacks of desperation, reaching back to a role that he thought might put him back on top, after a grueling period where seemingly every film he'd made disappeared nearly without a trace. Actually, that, more than anything else, is what is wrong with this movie: the stink of desperation. Come to think of it, that ISN'T the worst thing; no...worse yet is that all concerned have succeeded in making an action film that's not just lifeless, it's dead-on-arrival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** contains spoilers (the big ones) *** *** Commenting Terminator 3: ... Well... (pause) Really... (pause) It's a sad day for all of us... (minute of silence) ...For shame...*** Explanation: The third part of Terminator is jumping out of the general outlook of the very concept of the Terminator (the thing that made it the best movie there is - by the way...). It looks like as if they didn't have enough money to pay Harlan Ellison (the one who thought it all) to tell them what happened next, so they went improvising and hired those who invented "Matrix" to help them... ("Matrix" is good, but - my point is that they aren't the same category of SF movies) (many people are comparing "Matrix" to conceptual-cyber-kung-fu-techno-ballet). It's completely confused: there is also some flavor of some strange morbid kind of feminism in the air of the movie, it looks like a women's make-up commercial or a rapper video, or an enrique iglesias video (all-together), the stench of those typically "teenage" concepts in the acting of those characters (used the wrong way too), modernistic technology and design (mis)used for scenes in this movie (it's just not meant that way (remember Terminator 2(?) - "Guns 'n' Roses", bikers, heavy greasy dirty machinery))... it's like a mocking laugh of some feminist to what they interpretate as "macho stuff" into the face of a real fan of the Terminator movie, then that "all-american patriot" flavor somehow mixed-in into the fabric of the movie (which (anyway) wasn't meant to be the crucial point in the original concept of "The Terminator"), shallow plot and unconvincing relationships between the characters, illogical developments, kiddy-wanna-see features and scenes dropped randomly into the timline of the movie... man... they buried it... (maybe just that is their only goal with this "sequal" (it seems like the only logical thing to think regarding it)) *** Statement: For shame, really... IF THEY HAVE HAD HIRED ME TO CREATE SCENARIO FOR "WHAT HAPPENED NEXT" I ("I" - and I tell that with full responsibility) WOULD MAKE BETTER, MORE EXCITING, MORE LOGICAL &amp; LESS EMBARESING NEXT PART OF THE TERMINATOR MOVIE (well - that's the easiest part of the job...) - AND ALSO I MUST ADD THAT I COULD MAKE A FEW SEPARATE(!) PARTS OF IT TOO ("The Terminator" has vast potentials, I don't know what happened with those people)... (maybe you are asking yourselves "What is this man talking about?" right now, but if you would know what I'm talking about (the scenario I see as a logical next step) then you would be saying something completely different)... I am challenging those who made it.*** Conclusion: I say - Let us all pretend that it is all just a bad dream; forget all about "Terminator 3" that currently exists in reality as a movie; discard it, and say that people who made scenario for "Terminator 3" were on some serious sedatives when they wrote it... THEN(!): make the REAL movie of what Actually(!) happened next.The first two parts of Terminator movie gave us hints of what great would happen next... the shame is that those who wrote T3 scenario were blind to see it... (a thousand shames... disappointing...) They vomited on it all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3 killed the Terminator Saga!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been an almost fanatical fan of T1 and T2 i awaited the release of T3 with much anticipation. I had purchased the special editions of the previous 2 films on DVD, and now i was awaiting for the third to come out on theaters. Then i went and saw it...Oh boy! Was it a stink fest and a half. I'm sorry, but the previous two films had developed characters, serious villains and realistic scenes (as realistic as a Science Fiction films get). T3 however took the great Saga of the Terminator films, dumbed it down to a generic action movie and did what Cameron did not want to do in t2, make the Terminator a clown. I almost walked out of the film when i saw that the Terminator kept being the butt of every joke. Sure there were chuckles in T2 when the Terminator didn't act quite human but in T3 he was just missing the big red shoes, very sad cause i like Arnold as an actor. I was expecting for the Director to take the movie seriously, but instead it seemed almost a comedy, shattering the image of the Terminators as implacable killing machines and making them comical. I guess i know now how Star Wars fans felt when they saw Episode 1. In conclusion, the thin story line, 2d characters and general atrocious scenes of random violence made this film the nose dive of the saga. If a 4th film is made i doubt it will ever come out of the gutter. Sad really, cause it was my favorite movie.</fullReview>

I don't mean to be rude but I just wonder if you have seen a completely different movie then I.The problem I have with the movie is that it offset the entire story compared to the first two movies. Now Skynet is a virus infected AI. Where did that come from ? Why didn't Reese know about it, why didn't the second terminator know about it, why didn't the third terminator know about it ?The first two were dark movies with an ever present danger, in this one all the comic reliefs make it more like a parody of the first two. To many focus on the mindless action relief. In T and T2 there was a thought with the action (T2 a bit less then the first), in T3 nothing. And what did they do with the excellent score ?In T3 they killed the essence of the first two, dark good story, action with brains and a score to match.As a huge fan of the first two I feel betrayed by this movie and would love to have it erased from my memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this movie failed it.The script was cheesy and riddled with pointless dialogue. The acting was terrible most obvious from Nick Stahl. His lines were forced and ends up being pathetic during the more emotional moments. Arnold Schwarzenegger is clearly looking rather dated and is no longer able to be convincing. There was one good performance and it was from Kristanna Loken as the evil T-X. She displayed very convincing, emotionless acting. The special effects are well done, but seem out of place after seeing the first two films.If you are a fan of the Terminator series and have not seen this one then my advice is don't see it. It will spoil your love for the previous films. Jonathan Mostow tried his best but was just out of ideas for new plot developments. It's the exact same drill as before.This movie was just should not have been made. The story was complete with the first two installments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another sequel screwing up the first 2....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard they were making Terminator 3 I shook my head in disgust. T2 is my favorite movie of all time and to top it would be impossible, not because Cameron is this all-mighty director, although he is very good, but that the movie was just done too well in T2. From the directing, acting, plot, the score, everything. T3 has none of these traits and that's what makes it a garbage movie.I hate how Hollywood lets movies like this be created and ruin the image behind the first two completely. Just like the Alien movies, the first two were ruined by the memories of the last two. It's too bad that directors would rather make money than let people remember what the good movies stood for. On to crap 3. T3- First off, where is the music? The theme that the die-hard Terminator fans have known to love wasn't until the ending credits. Not that that makes a movie but I was looking forward to hearing it in the beginning. Not only that but there was a no music until about half-way in the movie it seemed like. It was just quiet and lame.The beginning scene was total ridiculous. He goes into the male strip bar only to say talk to the hand and NOW! to his hand. It was so lame and a complete rip-off of the T2 bar scene.The movie also have a very rush feeling to it to me. There was no character development what-so-ever. The love story didn't flow at all. Her fiancé is killed and she really didn't show any remorse or sadness that he was dead for more than a few seconds. When the Terminators first come together and the truck bounces over the girl I think I laughed out loud at how stupid that was. Not only that but the TX wasn't even scary to me and seemed less advanced than the T-1000. Robert Patrick was far more freaky as the creepy T-1000 than that girl ever was. Also, the T-1000 really couldn't be damaged. You could slow him down by freezing him or shooting but he always came back together because he was liquid. The TX was still metal underneath and could be damaged, which didn't seem more advanced to me. They couldn't come up with a better idea than the T-1000 though so they create this crap of combining the two Terminators into one. Retarded.The humor in the movie was terrible and really took away from the Terminator feel in my opinion. The Terminator is supposed to be a killing machine, ruthless, relentless, careless. But this Terminator was cracking jokes and not really hurting anyone. In T2 it made sense but only because John was teaching him not to hurt people, and he still did. Also, when the Terminator was carrying the coffin and shooting at the police why didn't he kill anyone? Again, this made no sense because John didn't teach him not to do this so why didn't he kill anyone? I can't comprehend how people like this crap.I think a major clue that the movie was going to suck before even seeing it was that it was rated PG-13. Any movie called "Terminator" should automatically be rated R. The other movies were more violent whereas this Terminator was a damn kids movie. Since when were Terminator movies supposed to be funny? What are they having the Terminator cracking jokes? In the second movie it made more sense because John was teaching the Terminator human speech. In this one he was just throwing out lines with no one teaching him anything. I wanted to throw a knife at the screen this movie was so bad.One thing that I didn't get is that all of a sudden in this Terminator film he can crash through pretty much any wall, smash marble, get beaten to a pulp and he is fine, not to mention put his head back on after it was knocked off which makes no sense, and fight his programming. The film was complete garbage and frankly I'm shocked that as many people liked it as I see on this board. I read people said he was a different model from the other Terminators, but when did they ever explain that in T3? Makes no sense.I have a theory that most people enjoy crap movies with no plot and just mindless action. Sadly, this is true because people would rather be entertained than have to think and this is a prime examples of that. Just like many people liked the trashy movie Independece Day because it "kept your attention", the same people like T3 because of the lame car chase, or the fight scene between the TX and the Terminator.I watched the making of T2 and Cameron had first written the script to have T2 as the final Terminator. The beginning scenes were actually Conner and team taking over Skynet and destroying it and finding unused 101's, and that's when he sent it back in time. However, that was cut due to run time of the movie. I for one am going to pretend T3 does not exist and that they did in fact stop the war in T2 because I can's stand the idea of T3. I wish I could go back in time and stop this movie from being created. I give it -10 out of 10. Utter garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator saga should have been terminated before The Rise of the Machines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, this film should never have been made.Terminator 2: Judgment Day finished with the intention of there being NO third installment, and it should have stayed that way. The chip and the arm of the first Terminator was destroyed and it's certainly my impression that Cameron didn't want a third movie.It was disappointing that Mostow thought he could get away with inventing the claim that Judgment Day was "only postponed" by the events of Sarah and John Connor in what was 1995 in the story, and I was disappointed, that's the only word, that the Terminator trilogy ended with the end of mankind and the rise of the machines. It's kind of a bad ending, and audiences don't like them.Loyal Terminator fans would feel they have to see this sequel, but to anyone who hasn't done yet, if I were you, just watch the 1984 original and 1991 sequel, "Judgment Day". I feel that a bad sequel brings down the reputation of the whole saga, and that shouldn't be the case, because the first two Terminators were among the greatest films ever. Shame this one couldn't follow suit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judged on its own merits, this movie is as forgettable as a thousand other forgettable action flicks: They come, stick around for a few weeks and they're gone. Who cares. However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose I should grateful that we have been graced with a final installment just to tidy things up given the enthusiasm for trilogies of late but, is this one wise? I think not. Pointless and very, very disappointing is more apt. I have been generous in my rating. What Terminator 3 shows is that the absence of a good story cannot be patched up with the now all too familiar CG scenes. Arnie looks and is old and the intensity that Linda Hamilton brought to the earlier two films is gone. The plot was almost certainly written in the 1950's and Ed Wood did it better. It's as if it's a plot searching for a reason to be and hoping no-one will notice the colour by numbers patchwork that passes for a storyline. This could have been wrapped up in 20 minutes in the vastly superior T2, had it been written. In the end we are being treated to an exercise in pure capitalism. In summary if you're a fan you may enjoy it , if not avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Liked "Terminator 2,'" You'll Like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watched the first two movies in this "series," particularly the second film, then most of this should be very familiar territory. You can expect to see more of the same, meaning:1 - Some spectacular action scenes; 2 - more action than is needed; 3 - A supposedly-unstoppable villain robot (this time a female); 3 - profane and somewhat annoying lead characters, except for Arnold, of course; 4 - seeing some naked butts (odd knowing one is the governor of Califronia); 5 - humor mixed in with all the violence; 6 - great overall special-effects and surround sound.The first 30 minutes of this movie was the best part, I thought. Overall, there was so much action it wore me out but it was a worthy sequel to the last movie. If you enjoyed watching what the "bad cyborg" Robert Patrick could do in the "Terminator 2," you'll really be entertained by his successor, played by Kristannia Loken. Like Patrick, she doesn't say much....but doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, performs admirably in his last starring role (I think) before tackling bigger responsibilities in real life.I hope there are no more re-makes because it wouldn't be the same without Arnold.</fullReview>

But she had big boobs. Whoopie.The acting of the two main human characters was mediocre at best. I'm not sure what the writers and director were thinking making John so slow witted and insipid, it did nothing but irritate and annoy.I bought this sight-unseen to have the complete series, and I'm sorry I wasted my money.

		<shortDescription>Schwarzenegger And The Franchise Deserve Better Than This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography in order, I come to Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines. Plot In A Paragraph: John Connor is living off the grid, but a new advanced Terminator, is sent back to change the past once more. Luckily the humans had also sent a bodyguard back again too. Where to start...... In basically a retread of T2, there were scenes of violence and action, with some dreary talk in between. Everything was just so Bland and uninteresting. The Terminator franchise was officially becoming a bore. First of all, the writers of the movie didn't even like Terminator movies and admittedly took the job just for the money. In his own blog, John Brancato says he and Ferris took the job because Ferris wanted a new house. Why Jonathan Mostow (another with no respect for the source material or the franchise) was given the job of directing is anybody's guess, but Arnie had approval, in his mega 33 page contract written by a super Hollywood lawyer. Arnie's Terminator is a joke right from his first scene, it's almost a parody!! A total disgrace. John Connor is an incompetent fool, and the way the T-X goes around taking down her victims is ludicrous. Take the drive thru guy for example. She not only knew he was working that night, but also that he was serving at the drive thru?? PLEASE!! Considering she can change her appearance, she only does so once. Also considering this is time travel, why didn't Skynet, give her more than a few hours to try and kill 22 targets?? Even if they were all in L.A. The full thing is just full of holes!! The lack of respect for the franchise is apparent, and if the writers and director didn't care, why should the audience?? The ending saved it a little bit, but not enough to redeem everything that came before it.Arnie, wooden as an old oak beam, looks as if he were desperately wishing he was somewhere else. His performance here is miles away from the first two, and for the first time, I'm going to say he phones it in. 12 years ago, thanks to T2, he was the world's No 1 action Star. He not only laughed all the way to the bank... He bought it. But what of Schwarzenegger now. Nothing had come up trumps since Eraser 7 years ago..... There is nothing he can do, and he does very little. Throughout the whole affair he looks old, tired and bored. Audiences still lapped up Terminator 3, to the tune of a $150 million domestic gross, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of the year. I'm torn between a 5 or 6/10 on this one. It's certainly better than his last three movies, but it's an awful Terminator movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well just like John Connor says "It was never our destiny to stop Judgement Day", similarly there was going to be another Terminator movie no matter how nicely the things were brought to a closure in T2. Filmmakers are always waiting to cash on by making unoriginal sequels just to cash on the fame of the original classics. So sick, sequels nowadays are nothing but money grabbing business. I felt relieved when I saw that T2 still grossed more than this unnecessary sequel despite being released way back in 1991.Plot is again a rehash of T2 which was also a rehash of T1 but with a twist. Still what T2 has and T3 misses is a good story. I liked the concept of the Inevitable Judgement Day in T3 even though it violates the Cameron's closure in T2. Still, the film misses many things that would have made it a likable sequel like T2. One of the strongest character of the franchise Sarah Connor is sidelined from the story which ruined the experience, something like the way 'Alien 3' destroyed the positives of 'Aliens'. Arnold's Terminator character kind of feels more like human than machine. The iconic theme of Brad Fiedel is totally missing till the credits roll, even then again it is not entirely used. The terminator T-X is surprisingly pales in comparison to T-1000 of Terminator 2. The dread and ruthlessness of The Terminator was entirely missing, making the chase sequence more cartoonish than horrific. Well yes that's one thing which became enjoyable in this ride of discontent, some clichéd moments like the truck chase similar to T2 yet less appealing, Arnold putting on pink-star glasses only to find it resenting, etc. Parody and comedy felt like nice breaks in mundane action. The characters of John Connor and Katherine Brewster had some nice potential to built up in the story but no the script focuses more on not the so great T-X. Skynet's rise to become self- aware wasn't explained properly. Also they failed to portray John Connor as an effective leader and Nick Stahl felt completely lost. Even Edward Furlong was able to highlight a better and useful 10- year old John Connor in T2. The CGI isn't much special, almost similar to T2 even though T3 was done in a time of more advanced tech. The concept of time-travel can be extensively used to churn out repetitive sequels even though the whole thing is riddled with paradoxes. And that's what T3 does. Rise of the Machines feels pathetic in comparison to its predecessors. Still it has some good action sequences. Also I felt the ending was justifiable even though the path taken was disappointing. T3 is never very boring as such, you just have this feeling of pale discontent.RATING: [2/5]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a young man living off the grid as a drifter. He is still haunted by nightmares of an apocalyptic future. Future SkyNet sends back T-X (Kristanna Loken) to hunt down various people including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). She's the daughter of U.S. Air Force General Robert Brewster who is reluctant to activate SkyNet on their system. There is a computer supervirus infecting the world. Another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives to protect John. John breaks into Kate's animal clinic to steal medicine. It turns out that they knew each other as teens before the original Terminator.This is not bigger and better than the other two. That is its biggest sin in the logic of sequels. It has some good action but it's not bigger than the second one. The car chase is lots of fun especially with real action. It doesn't bring anything new to the franchise. It is merely a continuation. Nick Stahl should have been a good lead. At least, the movie NEEDED him to be good. Instead, he's merely capable. Claire Danes is much better. The standout is Arnold who looks amazing at his age. I didn't particularly like the coincidence of Kate and John being in the same place. The humor isn't as good. The lines aren't as memorable. The plot isn't as well thought out. It's just not as good overall.</fullReview>

I've even seen 'Terminator: Salvation' before this one, and surprisingly liked the film, mostly because it didn't feel like milking a dead cow, offering a different angle at an already familiar story instead.So, I finally decided to give T3 a try and I must say that it completely fulfilled my expectations... of being a cold and calculated film existing solely on the glory of its two predecessors. On the surface, it features most of the elements that made the first films: great visual effects, over-the-top action sequences, long car chases and a seemingly indestructible villain; however, it misses the key ingredients of originality, suspense, and most of all believability.That said, both the plot and the main characters seem pretty much unconvincing in comparison with the first two films. Schwarzenegger's age makes T-101 look more like a senior citizen than a killing machine, while Nick Stahl's depiction of John Connor seems more of a frightened boy than Edward Furlong was in T2 and completely fails to convince that he is going to become a great leader in near future.But, probably the most inconclusive part in the film comes from Kristanna Loken's T-X, which is all eye-candy and has nothing of the menace that made T-101 and T-1000 such great villains in T1 and T2 respectively. In fact, while the villains in the first two Terminator films were unsettling and frustrating to watch, the screen presence of T-X is actually captivating and anticipated, at least by the male population of viewers. Another downside of a female villain is reflected in direct confrontations between T-101 and T-X, where the view of a large man beating a girl half his size seems just wrong and silly.And speaking of silly, T3 uses just too many nods to the first two films to the point of spoof and contains just too many comedic or quasi- comedic scenes to be taken seriously, with T-101 becoming a self-parody at moments.All in all, T3 takes away more from the franchise than it brings to it, and the only thing that really adds to the overall story line in the Terminator universe is the mere ending, which I won't reveal here. The film is not a complete waste of time, but it's nothing more than average lifeless SF-action flick, even less compared to the legacy of T1 and T2. It's not something to be avoided at all cost, but if you're in it for the atmosphere and depth of the first two films, you're in for a bit of a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a terrible addition to such a great franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin with this crap? I will first say that I enjoyed the first two films and the second one was one of my favorite movies. But then James Cameron left the franchise to let the very skilled Jonathan Mostow take over.You can tell Cameron has left the franchise in the first few minutes of the movie because Cameron would never have a female terminator in his movie. Plus the fact that they went all out sexy on this villain is way too distracting to the male viewer to think of her as a villain. Also, this movie lacked the character development, plot, script, heart, talent, and effort of the first two films. They mostly look like they are trying to do a Michael Bay explosion/no plot kind of film, but hey, at least Michael Bay can entertain! Unlike the first two films, I did not care about the characters, heck one character was so annoying that I didn't care if she died, and could really care less about the whole plot in general. Overall, watch the first two films and do not watch this one or the fourth one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Not Good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember how excited I was to see T3 when it first came out. Being a huge Arnie and Terminator fan, I had been looking forward to it. But most of all, I remember - very clearly - how huge the disappointment I experienced was.For years, I'd pretend that T2 was the last terminator movie, because I didn't think this embarrassing mess was worthy of being part of the terminator franchise, and I was right -- I saw this movie again the other day, and... it's still s***! Utter s***, to be precise.This movie's nothing like T1 or T2.It's just lame. Especially the female terminator. This was such absurd. That woman, whoever she is, can't even act. Why did they have to bring her in? The story is ridiculous, messy, and totally boring. It was completely unnecessary. If you can't come up with a compelling story, then why make a sequel in the first place?? The characters are cheesy, dull, and unlikeable. You don't want to see more than 10 minutes of these idiots, let alone root for any of them.Oh, and... I thought this movie was made just to show off the special effects and impressive action sequences, which the movie was supposed to have (since there was no story or anything), but even that was s***! The special effect in T1 are better, for Pete's sake! And all the "action" is just lame. Honestly, there's no suspense at all, and when the terminators fight -- it's just ridiculous (like the rest of the meaningless "action" in this movie").T1 was good. T2 was perfect. T3... I'll just keep pretending it never existed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Sequel to the First Terminators</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2/4The first two Terminator movies could be called some of the best sci-fi action films ever to be created. The plot and character development was great. They took times to slow down and in a way really impact the characters.But now the sequel to the second one seemed to be nothing more than just a hyped up action film. The movie was a pretty short one but that's only because it had not much time to cool down after all the action sequences.Even though there are a lot of action scenes they don't seem very enjoyable or amazing like the first ones which really kept you interested. The first two films had a kind of different styles of action from each other. There wasn't much hand to hand combat in the first but had amazing shootouts and suspenseful parts. The second had more like stunts and hand to hand combat scenes with both terminators. But the third tries to use both too much and over does it. This can overwhelm the film and become bored if this is all the movie has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action film but pointless and tasteless re-tread of T2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3, the brave, brave sequel to what is considered by many to be the perfect film and with that fact alone it was bound to fail but was it all bed?The film does indeed have many good points. The special effect and CGI are superb, crisp and believable with what looks like early Transformers type effects in there. The action scenes can't be faulted, the now famous crane scene is pretty stunning and every fight and high adrenaline piece is made with every professionalism. Casting wise, Nick Stahl turns in a surprisingly good performance as John Conner and is quite likable in the role. No easy feat considering many fans were expecting the return of Edward Furlong to the part, but Stahl tackles it with good skill and balance while furlong is busy snorting guff off bathroom floors and generally looking like an egg. Claire Danes suffers from nothing to do with her acting skill but really Kate Brewster just isn't that much of a character to play, but she does well with what she has and what little time she had to prepare.All this goodness however doesn't take away from the fact that terminator 3 is really just a copy of it's predecessor. The story follows pretty much an identical plot and the retreading of key scenes from T2 but done with 'humour' really does sour the experience. However, the biggest flaw surely must be that the film takes the philosophy, effort and loss of the first two films and renders them completely pointless. Everything James Cameron tried to say has been taken back and replaced with a "Sorry, the first two films were wrong, this is how it is!" The best part of the film is when Skynet becomes self-aware and we are treated to early versions of Terminators and H-K's but this is over far too quickly and you are left with a severe feeling of being had by lazy writers and greedy studios. I don't blame Johnathan Mostow though. This film has studio suits written all over it and they were pulling the strings but if you were a relatively unknown director and someone offered you the chance to get paid a shitload of money to direct a Terminator film you wouldn't turn it down, no matter what these idiot fanboys claim they would do for the purity of the series.This is definitely the worst of the Terminator films. At least Terminator Salvation tried something new but Terminator 3 plods along like a crippled hip-hop star with far too much bling and not too much substance.Strangely enough I always end up watching it anyway when I go on a T- Binge but I certainly don't count it as canon.The Cameron directed T2-3D is the closest thing you'll get to a proper sequel. Seeing the Terminator and John Connor go FORWARD in time to Terminate Skynet (essentially turning the idea of the first films on it's head) would have made a great film in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3 is a cheap rip off from Terminator 2 and everything about this film is done far worse...Not a movie for fans of the first two like myself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***NEW UPDATE***The movie sucks. ******I'm a huge fan of 'Terminator' and 'Terminator 2' and for quite a while, I've been embarrassed to watch this 2003 sequel as I've heard such mixed reviews from critics and IMDb users alike. Now that I watched, I feel sorta impressed by it.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines focuses on a 20 year old John Connor who is once again under subject for termination along with his high school friend Kate. This time, an even more powerful T-X is sent back in time but like in T2, the Arnold Schwarzenegger T-101 model is back to save the boy but more importantly Kate.I found the story line in this movie both good and frustrating. It had some interesting elements such as the whole Judgment Day is happening in a few hours thing but there were also some annoying parts such as the over use of "Get out!" and the "I'll (she'll) be back" As T2 is my 2nd favorite film of all time, I found some annoying things about this film such as the T-101 going into the pub and asking for clothes. Seriously??? I was also frustrated by the T-101 shopping which just looked stupid and was a joke to our memorable character. However, I thought the basic story line of protecting John and Kate and making sure that Skynet could be shut down just in time to prevent Judgment Day from really occurring was interesting and it was nice to see Dr. Silberman's little cameo in this movie. As much as the story line fascinated me, the best thing about the film was surely Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as the T-101. No one else could ever pull this off like Arnie. I was also extremely annoyed by the T-X and I thought the director was just desperate to make someone more deadly than the T-1000 but just failed miserably. The acting in this film was pretty poor, in my opinion. The only one who did a brilliant job was Arnold Schwarzenegger so that can be passed off. However, that scene where the T-101 is packing weapons into the caravan just annoyed me as the director just wanted the conversation to really go when the T- 101 was walking back and forth. It made it really hard to focus on important elements of the story. Since the John/T-101 relationship was magical in T2, I wanted Edward Furlong to reprise his role, 12 years later, as the older John but the whole concept of a different actor playing John made me not care about his friendship and his fatherly love for the T-101.One other disappointment in the film for me was the fact that we never got to see any real machines wasting humans after the machines rose.That being said, the movie is enjoyable but is sure to disappoint many.</fullReview>

John Connor is just flat out pathetic in this movie. Both the acting and the action flat out sucked. It was seriously like watching Judgment Day again with a few changes. I also hated how they didn't explain Skynet spawning when the end of T2 changes the fate of the machines taking over. It's weird how Edward Furlong played a better Connor than this shi**y-ass actor did. All I can say is that Arnold's return as the T-101 is the only thing i enjoyed about this garbage. I was so disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a serious film, or a parody?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I go apesh.t on this film... I just need to know... Why? Who allowed this movie to be filmed? Was anybody serious about this film? Whose idea was this? Of course, no point in asking questions... here are the answers. This film is very, very bad. Johnathan Mostow needs to go work someplace else, like in circus as a clown. If he wants to be funny, give him a chance to be a stand up comedian, not to ruin a good film with this sequel. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) was one of the best movies and best SF movies ever made if you ask me... and if you are planing a sequel... give it something worthy, not this crap! The entire film also borrows from the previous film. That's mental!Arnold was good. In his Terminator element, it wasn't any of his fault! The Terminator (Arnie) here looks funny, his character was used for a entertaining purposes! In the first one, he was a dark cyborg with a mission to kill, in the second he was a protector... but here he was a laugh stock! That is a damn sacrilege! The writers and director decided to make one big campy parody of the entire film and title character. The same goes with other characters. Nick Sthal was solid as John Connor, slowly on a way to become a great military leader. But, writers ruined his character too. Claire Danes is a good actress, but here, she messed herself up. Her character was funny, from a veterinarian to warrior women over night doesn't seem right to me! Kristana Loken. OK I admit that we needed a woman Terminator, why not? But, her T-X character was too much, an endoskeleton that has a liquid metal? That's too much, an anti-terminator terminator! Gimme a break! And, of course Earl Boen makes a cameo as Dr. Silverman, also, alas... as a laughing stock. The only thing good here were special effects, the special effects were even better than anything else here. Money down the drain... don't watch it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most pointless sequel ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They just couldn't leave well enough alone could they? Most everyone enjoyed the first two Terminator films. And most everyone was probably satisfied with the way the story wrapped up at the end of T2. The Terminator story had been told. It was over. But Hollywood can never resist an easy money-grab so after 12 years of allowing the franchise to rest in peace we got T3. And the movie inevitably made obscene amounts of money so the accountants were happy. The fans? Not so happy. If you liked the first two movies the joke's on you. Not only is T3 a rather lousy movie but it also makes the first two movies, the ones people actually liked, completely irrelevant. All that stuff about stopping the machines, changing the future, determining your own fate? Forget all that. The future is inevitable. What's going to happen is going to happen. So none of this really matters. If that's the case why am I watching these movies in the first place? James Cameron had the good sense to stay away from this turkey. Linda Hamilton too. If only Arnold Schwarzenegger had resisted the lure of a giant paycheck we could have been spared the absurdity that is this movie. But alas Arnold went for the cash, Terminator legacy be damned. So we got this pointless, unnecessary, quite terrible sequel which cheapens the whole Terminator saga. Another Terminator gets sent back in time, John Connor starts running for his life, Arnold shows up to protect him and a bunch of things get blown up. The end. Story? What story? Who can be bothered with trifling things like a story when we can just blow out the budget on an interminable crane chase? The evil Terminator this time comes in the form of Kristanna Loken, a hot blond chick. This is likely in the hopes that the sight of a hot blond chick will distract teenage fanboys from the fact that the movie stinks. With Hamilton missing we need a new damsel in distress so we get a woefully out of her element Claire Danes. An action movie star she is most certainly not. John Connor is this time played by Nick Stahl, probably an improvement over T2's Edward Furlong. So at least there's one thing about this movie better than the last one. Not nearly enough to make up for the multitude of things which are much, much worse. Like Arnold's Terminator for example who just bounces from one pathetic attempt at an "Hasta la vista, baby" style catchphrase to another. I think somewhere along the way somebody got confused and thought they were writing a comedy. A comedic Terminator, yes that's what the world wants. Have these people no sense at all? Did Arnold not read this script and realize he was destroying the memory of his most iconic character? Or did he realize it and just not care as long as the studio's check cleared? The film's final insult comes with the ending which is no ending at all. The filmmakers have no resolution to their story, just a setup for another movie to come. So they rendered the story of the first two films meaningless and couldn't even bother to have any story of their own. Gee, thanks. So glad I paid money to watch this utterly pointless movie. The future is inevitable and that future apparently includes lousy Terminator movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm not the first to do this, but i feel it's necessary to mention T2. I recently watched it, and I can tell you now that this movie is unwanted. The ending to T2 (I won't tell you what it is) is one of the most satisfying movie endings I have ever seen, and is up there with films like Saving Private Ryan and the Star Wars saga. This film takes the main idea from the first two (the 'changing the future' theme) and simply throws it out of the window. When this came out we were like: "Hang on? Rise of the machines? But it ended in the last one!" And so begins one of the many problems with this movie.1) James Cameron. I see why he avoided this; they basically got his work and flushed it down the loo; claiming their's was better.2) Arnie. He was brilliant in T1, perfect in T2 (his smile at the minigun still goes down as pure genius in my eyes) but he has simply run out of steam. He was old, human and dull in T3.3) It wasn't a Terminator movie. Sure, it has Terminator in the title, but so does Terminator Salvation, and that's about as far from a Terminator film as you can get (while still using the same setting). I actually didn't mind TS, because it didn't pretend to be a Terminator film. This, however, did, and failed. I mean, it's a 12! 4) The characters. I didn't feel connected with any of them. Sorry to bring it up again, but in T2 Sarah and John Connor were brilliant, with Sarah's slow realisation about the machines and her transformation into someone less crazy and John's childishness showing through his hard outer shell were brilliantly portrayed, both with acting and writing. In this though, both were lacking in style and substance, and I found myself actually getting annoyed with John.5) A female Terminator. Don't mean to be sexist, but come on! Watching this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I am disappointed with the people behind this film for messing with such cinematic brilliance created by the first two. However, some action scenes pretty well directed, and the humour was quite funny in some places, but not T2 funny, like "He'll live". It was an uncool funny. for those reasons, it just wasn't very good.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The non-Arnie scenes are a total drag. Good thing he's in quite a few.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it a fluke that Arnie appeared in arguably half a dozen of the best action flicks in a decade? Was Arnie simply handed all the best roles? Was he given a free ride? Was he unbelievably lucky? Or is he actually a credible leading man and commanding screen presence? I think the answer for me came when I watched T3 last week. About half way through I realised what a dud movie this was in almost every sans-Arnie scene. His Terminator arrives maybe a third of the way in, and as a one guy audience the only thing that allows you to remain involved is knowing he's coming, when he departs proceedings it's 100% dullsville from there.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Like many inferior sequels the film opens with a brief narration that serves as a recap for any action fan living under a rock for 20 years ? in the future robots send back a cyborg assassin to kill a boy / young man named John Connor destined to become the fearless leader of humankind hellbent on fighting the robot occupation? repeatedly.The first time the cyborg was Arnie. The second time it was a slick liquid metal cyborg and the obsolete Arnie was reprogrammed to defend Connor. This time Arnie is once again the protector and the assassin is once again liquid metal, but this time the assassin is a hot chick ? and she has wayyyy more toys and tricks than previous Terminators.The rest is a carbon copy of T2 really, only 10 years on. Nick Stahl as John Connor is serviceable but he either did the steely-determined thing very well or he simply lacks personality, his future love interest Kathryn is played by the huge-eyed Claire Danes, the psychiatrist is back once again to continue his running joke ? but aside from all that it is Arnie standing in front of a relentless killing machine for 2 hours.That isn't to say that the film is without merit, it tackles the responsibility of copying a classic very seriously, but when you are taking on one of the best 4 or 5 films in history that's a pretty tall order.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So after Kristina Lokken appears ? naked ? as the female Terminator (needless to say if she remained naked they would have sold millions more DVDs, she is a well built cyborg) she instantly sets about killing off various members of the resistance, who are all in their teens or early 20s at this stage. Lokken's Terminator is again liquid metal but this time can produce a veritable handyman's arsenal of tools and weapons, including a big f-you cannon from her arm.Arnold arrives in the desert a short while later, and the two set about punching and shooting at each other all over the very state that Arnold would eventually lead.I must admit that the first big chase is worthy of direct comparison with almost anything from T2, there are remote controlled cop cars, ambulances, a big mobile crane ? which Arnold spends a great deal of time hanging off ? and even a fire engine. It is a three year old boy's toyset on the bigscreen (my 3 year old actually does plays with all those things). The scene itself runs for maybe 10 minutes, it has the requisite "big" explosions and collisions, showcases the new lady-Terminator's abilities and Arnie's dogged determination, and best of all it all seems quite dangerous. Too often now chase scenes are just the lazy action-filler in films, there is little in the way of adrenaline or the perception of peril, the fact that this scene was so outstanding perhaps makes the rest of the film look a little shabbier by comparison.After a couple more not quite so good chases and a shootout in a cemetery (which fell a little flat), John and Kathryn are told that Arnie must protect them so that they and their children will fight the machines later on. Seeing as how they only met each other a few hours previous, and that Kathryn up until that morning had a fiancé you could safely call that an icebreaker. Talk about arranged marriage; this is arranged kids! With Judgment Day inevitable and looming large it was a little disappointing to find the finale a little underwhelming, perhaps too clinical and formulaic, which seems obvious given I have already pointed this out as a replica of T2.Arnold and Lady-T go roboto-a-roboto and cause millions of dollars in property damage, and all the while John Connor and Kathryn seem to stay just far enough and just close enough to danger.The lady-Terminator seemed deadly but a little dumb, many times she had a target in her vice like grip and instead of squeezing them to death, snapping their bones like crackers or just pummeling them into oblivion she repeatedly threw them away.I guess even robots should learn not to send a woman to do a man's job.I firmly believe that there is another "Great" Terminator film to be made ? last year's effort was OK but hardly a classic. More than anything this frankly mediocre effort showed just how much the franchise relied on Arnie to flourish, when a 60 year old man playing a giant killer robot is far and away the best thing going for your film it highlights how pivotal Arnie really is, finding his effective replacement might be near impossible, but it doesn't mean they shouldn't try.Final Rating ? 6 / 10. The non-Arnie scenes are a total drag, but that one mega-chase elevates this up a notch. The film might not be required viewing, but that scene sure is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as groundbreaking as the 2nd one, but still passable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a decent movie, but since the previous two movies in this franchise are amazing. This movie just comes off a bit mediocre for the most part, but it still has entertainment value. It might have been better if James Cameron directed this one as well, but it's still a passable movie in the franchise. The plot of this movie is basically about how John Connor starts to become the leader the previous movies talked while building a relation with a girl, although the alteration doesn't really get completed. Even if this isn't a groundbreaking movie like the 2nd movie in the franchise and is a bit shorter, it doesn't try to be something it's not. The pacing is pretty fast and the action sequences are entertaining to watch. The movie however lack the gritty and suspenseful aspects from the previous movies and comes off a bit too silly at times. The connection between the two previous movies is done pretty well and is far from being a bad movie. It just isn't as great or good as the previous 2 movies in the franchise. Just don't expect too much after watching T2 or you might be disappointed. However the main negative aspect is how this movie doesn't seem all that legit and looked a bit cheap despite the big budget that went into this. Arnold is good with this role as before, but the guy that played John Connor sorta sucked and didn't fit the image of the leader of the resistance.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to admit director Jonathan Mostow had some balls to make this, your making another entry in the Terminator series, two of the greatest films of all time! Many people call this an astonishing summer action flick, but to me a hardcore Terminator fan this is just a big middle finger insult. The plot is it's 20 years later John Connor is moving across the world so that no more Terminators an find him. BUT! They do find him the T-800 (Schwarzenegger of course) and The T-X then it's basically the same plot as Judgment Day. James Cameron tied a knot so hard at the ending of Terminator 2 that they had to cheat the source material in this one Judgment day is not preventable and so the T-800 has to get them to a safe zone. You know for the T-X to be the newest unit it's really no where as advance as the T-1000 in the second one. The T-X might be more flexible and can still morph into people but the T-1000 can do that also he can form knives and stabbing objects to which to me is pretty badass. Nick Stahl is the new John Connor. I don't like him as John Connor at all. For one thing I thought John Connor would be this complete bad ass of a kid when he gets older, but he just seems like some wimp, plus his foul mouth language is gone, his advice to The T-800 well I don't remember him giving anything remember able to him. I mean Edward Furlong created the personality for John Connor and there was deep character development, for me Nick Stahl didn't really give me any personality for the older John Connor, I didn't feel like I knew John Connor at all, unless John was just suppose to grow up awkwardly, sure he seems less annoying then Edward Furlong but he just doesn't fit as the older John Connor, though I will admit I thought he was better than Christen Bale is Salvation. I'm glad Schwarzenegger did The T-800 again; if he did not choose to do it again then I would have never wanted to be made. He still doing what he does best, playing a badass machine, but his character kind of takes a step down because there is no character change. In the second one he went from a machine doing his mission into a father like figure for John. In this one he's just doing the mission. But he is still humorous and still fun to watch which is still good for me, but I was disappointed he didn't say "I'll be back", but with out a doubt he is the best part of the movie. There is also a new character; Claire Danes plays Kate Brewster essentially going to be John's husband in the future. Honestly I just thought she was awful. The T-X killed her husband and morphed into him. When they find each other the T-X morph back into itself, the expression on her face isn't what I expected, it looks like she saw a ghost, plus I thought she was just super annoying and I never felt she was actually scared plus she never really created a personality and the one thing she a John had in common is that they went to the same high school together and the more they spent time together I never felt they could ever get along with each other. I never saw a relationship for them. When I first rated this I gave it a 0% but I felt like I was being too harsh. To me the biggest flaw was the acting. The Claire didn't give her character a personality and Nick did awful as John Connor. In the first one everyone had a personality even Miles did and it made the movie incredibly suspenseful, you want them to stop Judgment day. In here there was no suspense and I honestly didn't care if the made it or not. Also I didn't like how it's basically the same plot as Terminator 2. They made me think that they didn't care about anything except the action in this. Now The Terminator is known to have great and I mean great action sequences make that many great action sequences. In this one for me the very best action sequence is the one where the terminator is hanging from the crane, I thought that was completely bad ass, also the part where the Terminator is carrying John in the coffin I thought that was pretty original. The other action sequences to me were just boring and didn't live up to the hype that I expected. Back then I had a lot of complaints about the action but today I just realize it was just nick-picking (if I said that right). Director Ang Lee was actually offered to direct this but he turned it down to direct the Hulk film, I'm not sure how it would've turned out if he directed this, he probably would have done a better job with the action sequences, well considering what he did to The Hulk maybe, but he is still a better director than Jonathan Mostow. Besides from Schwarzenegger still being a delight to watch and a few memorable action scenes Terminator 3 disappointed me with a lazy script, bad acting, many bland action scenes and awful character development. With being a hardcore Terminator fan if they called this anything else but Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines, I might have liked it more, otherwise I think the world would have been better without this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak and tired pseudo-sequel tries to revive the long ended franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pathetic how much this film wishes it could be T2. Nick and Claire are good actors but deliver nothing but annoying "cuteness" here (though this seems to be all the script was interested in along with the lame and very casual changes to John's "destiny" and future legacy). Arnold, while in awesome shape, seems very tired in this role. Lokken tries way too hard and is very wooden (even for a Terminator actress) and ultimately nonthreatening. Reliance on (poor) comedy only highlights how light is the human story and even the tactical story. Although the climax is pretty good, if typical, sensationalistic action and the f/x, of course, are the best in the series thus far, this is a heartless and hollow, nostalgic silhouette of an update at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Talk to the Hand'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And with that quotation is a perfect example with everything that is wrong with Terminator 3 and how is doesn't keep in spirit with the James Cameron masterpieces.Set in 2004, John Connor (Nick Stahl) is an out-the-grid drifter. Computer systems around America are starting to fail, and this is a puzzle to Air Force General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), the commander of the new Skynet system. In 2032, the machines had lost the war and sent an advance terminator, the TX (Kristanna Loken). Her mission is to kill John Connor's lieutenants, including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a vet and John's future wife. The resistance send a re-programmed Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate from the TX and the impending doom of Judgement Day. The Terminator tells John and Kate that John and Sarah Connor never stopped Judgement Day, just delayed and that Judgement Day was just a day away. This sets the heroes into a race against time to stop the event.I bet James Cameron wished he used his alternative ending, it would have stopped any sequel being made. The whole point of the ending Terminator 2: Judgement Day was Judgement Day was stopped and that John and Sarah were free to live their lives. What's the point if they is no hope. James Cameron refused to do T3, saying T2 was the end of it. Linda Hamilton refused to do T3 because Cameron wasn't involved, and Schwarzenegger only did this film because he was paid $30 Million and 20% of the profits, I don't blame him really. It also helped his political ambitions.The choice of director was Jonathan Mostow, a workman-like director who made the awful U-571. Also, the screenwriters were John Brancato and Michael Ferris, wrote Catwoman, that says it all.T3 was basically made as a re-harsh and parody of T2. They is too much humour which wasn't needed at all. The whole point of the first two films was that they were played straight as possible. They are poor lines and no good one-liners (such as 'you are terminated!') compared in the first two films,. When the Terminator steals his clothes off a male-strippers, and eyes stealing them off a fat woman, or that the TX makes her breasts bigger to stop the cops these are all very bad signs. The action scenes were well done, but nothing surprise, nor especially memorable.But the worst part of the film is the characterisation. John Connor goes from punk kid who had to battle the T-1000 to a scared young man who is really dumb, especially since he had to live through. Nick Stahl was a terrible choice to play John Connor. Arnold Schwarzenegger ends up over-acting and being overly emotional, which is surprising seeing he is an actor of limited talents. Claire Danes is a pretty good actress, but isn't served well in this film. Kristanna Loken lacked the menace of being a foe to the Terminator and the screenwriters were just pushing the extremes from large bloke (T1), to skinny man (T2), to skinny woman (T3).The screenwriters attempt to hard to make twists in this film. The only things worth seeing are Earl Boen cameo as Dr. Peter Silberman and the ending. Any true Terminator fan should ignore this film and just focus on T1 and T2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This commercialized piece of crap was a great example of how Hollywood takes something good (Terminator And Terminator 2) and exploits it all to hell.The idea of "The Rise of the Machines" is a solid one. We have other examples in cinema of when the bad guys get their modicum of revenge (The Empire Strikes back, comes to mind) But this piece of tripe sullies the good name of the previous movies in the series. My life would be better if I somehow I didn't know this was ever made or ever existed. I would be quite happy with the Terminators movies only being T1 and T2. I'm not gonna blame the problems on the actors. They were essentially hamstrung by a weak script and trying to fill the shoes (and minds of people like me that knew how good it COULD be)Its such a shame. Someone should be sued.</fullReview>

I can only hope that the next entry in this series finally gets rid of all the LAME action sequences that unfortunately got in the way of the gags in this one.

		<fullReview>"Terminator 3" is not horrible. The story isn't completely annoying although it is pretty bogus, the visuals and action scenes are awesome, the acting is pretty good, we get to see Arnold again, and it is pretty entertaining....but that is it. Tons of movies are like what I just described...and that is great, but unfortunately for Terminator 3, it had to live up to two excellent movies and restart a very much ended series....and to say the least, it pretty much failed. The story is not completely unbelievable, but face it, Terminator should have ended with Terminator II...as a fan I will solidly say it was not worth it. As much as I wanted the story to continue it simply could not. There was no way they could make it restart.It is impossible to watch this movie without the the mind set that it is a Terminator movie. My advice is just don't watch it. If you want a pretty summer blockbuster there are tons out there...you want Arnold? Watch Predator...6/10 for being a decent movie aside from the fact that it was a completely unneeded film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about the sequels... Well, why did it flop so miserably? All the elements of the winning formula are here - Mr. Gov'ner, Arnie; the bad Terminator, this time even a lady Terminatrix, T-X, and the cool plot. Oh, really? The film is unbearably boring and inevitably dull. There are two wooden facial expressions on Arnie and they are so predictable, that you can play the whole role instead of him. Kristanna Lokkn is a bad actress indeed. She doesn't even pretend to play, she just runs well, falls down well, looks in a blank stare well and then kills fast. See, anyone else can play this all. You didn't need to pay Arnie so much bucks for this trash! The very scene of the cars' chase is also very predictable and it is not even funny. The biggest problem of this sequel is a sheer absence of any humor and then totally bad play of those young actors who are John Connor and his future wife. You really miss Linda Hamilton and all her really deep work. Bad, bad film, indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It gets a 4 for the special effects only! This film starts by making basic mistakes and then progresses to bigger and bigger howlers.Let's see. Mistake number 1. The T-X. Right well X = 10. The last bad guy was a T1000. So she's a lower rated model than him then ? Any wonder when she materializes in the window of a clothes shop she ignores the abundance of clothes around her. Also it looks like she's in Rodeo Drive. And she still can't see clothes so she has to rob someone? And the person she robs just happens to be her exact size? Odds of that? Not really going to happen is it? Then the next mistake. She's looking for the lieutenants. So she accesses school records by phone (as these are supposed to be secure under the Data Protection Act it'd be unlikely their kept on a server that has dial-up access.)Then to compound that mistake she manages to locate where they work from their High School records? Wouldn't it have been easier for them to have had her accessing the IRS or DMV records. DMV as they would have a more recent picture than their high school, then IRS as it'd show where their paying income tax.She identifies Jose with a badge id and she scans his eye. Why? Like his High School records had retina information on them? No, I truly think not. Then she shoots him 4 times. The most advanced model can't kill with 1 shot from 5 feet? She must be an older model then.Then Arnie can't decide which model his robot is. Is he a T101 or a T800? Make your mind up Arnold! Also why John avoids the deer, he's an idiot. Why hurt yourself, at that speed you would have barely wobbled when you hit the deer.He seems to get a ride OK, but you'd think anyone giving him a ride would take him to a hospital. He could give a fake name and address, pay for his treatment in cash. He wouldn't appear on the grid by doing that. Another overlooked mistake.So why does the logic driven T-X go to Kate's work address at 5am? Like she's going to be working at that time in the morning. Really logical, isn't it! And again when she kills the cat lady, she fires 5 or 6 shots. An advanced killing machine that can't kill with 1 bullet? Even when Arnie said in the last film he had detailed files on human anatomy.The next chase sequence where the sun seems to rise very fast is lifted wholesale from Terminator 2. It's far too similar, showing lack of creativity. Having the Doctor from Terminator 1 &amp; 2 shows a nice bit of continuity.And the T-X killing Kate's boyfriend is just like the T1000 killing John's foster parents. Not a new idea. I had to double take and think when I saw the T-X dressed as Kate (she pulls her out of the truck near the start, that's when she touches her. Where she could have easily killed her as well). Also the fact that this multi-million dollar US Government secure installation, Kate gets into a seemingly very high security area so easily? I think not.And that they don't seem to have any bespoke Anti-virus software or any contingency plans for a virus or a system collapse? Like a back-up system, or the ability to kill all operations without using Skynet? Give me a break!The whole magnet thing was utter garbage. If the T-X was being subjected to high levels of magnetism she'd shut down. Computers and chips don't like magnets! And how did Arnie get to the surface without passing the magnet? Wouldn't the T-X use a safer route as well as she's a newer model (just another indication that she isn't the latest model).Also why Kate isn't starting up the plane as John is clearing everything from the ground. The World's about to end and their on a dead-line and she's taking her time, why? I'll assume the T-X learns where they are going from Arnie's memory when she re-programs him. Now he's in the helicopter with her so why he doesn't try and blow her up while their in flight? And she found a helicopter already with fuel in it? The end of the film is pretty dire. Skynet has gotten itself into computers so there's no core. No Big deal. It just started a Nuclear War! When bombs drop you get EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) That fries computers. The only systems that would then hold Skynet would be in the bunkers where the humans are hiding. All that means is they yank their power for a few vital seconds and then the only place Skynet could still be, is in the satellites.No worries. Just never build anything that uses those frequencies or fire a few missiles into space at them. Or get whoever is in the International Space Station to shut them down. Then NO Skynet.That's the biggest mistake of the film, none of the writers seem to know what would happen to computers and databases after a nuclear attack. Piece of cake. The so-called "inevitable" has just been derailed by me very easily. In a matter of moments, because I bothered to use my brain.Nick Stahl was rubbish. Arnie was fair to middling. Kristina Lokken was awful. Clare Danes was utterly awful. This film could have been so much better. Shame it wasn't.Hopefully the script writers read these reviews? Learn about EMP boys?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard for the first time of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (like a year before it was released, on 2002), I couldn't believed it, I mean, Terminator again, COOL! Sadly, all that hope I had died on the moment I watched the movie. It was probably the worst Terminator movie I had ever watched on my life, because the other two movies of Terminator were great, specially the scene of "Hasta la vista, BABY".I hoped to see humans fighting with machines, a real war, but NOOOOOOOO, I only saw a movie were the true origins of the war between humans and machines are revealed (didn't expect to see this).First than all, at the beginning of the movie Arnold was alredy screwed, I mean, the other cyborg machine kicked his ass and they had to run away. I'll admit that some scenes were pretty good, and the special effects were great, but they are useless if the movie sucks, like this one.My friend told me that he loved the movie, and as I'm a big fan of Terminator I said to myself "What do I have to lose?", my question was answered after the movie ended, 4.50 dollars.This movie should be really called "The Day Terminator Died", 'cause I hated this movie, as other friends.Receives a: 1/10 Could had been much, much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this one would be pretty good, but the previews did not really convey how good it turned out to be. I also thought it would be that good thanks to its relatively short running time. It turns out this helps the movie flow really fast and you never find yourself wondering how much time is left. At least it didn't for me. This one has Arnold as the Terminator once again being sent back in time to save Conner from an evil Terminator. Well I guess it isn't evil as it is a machine. Well anyway this time the Terminator doesn't have to long to protect John as the war to end the world, as we know it is really close. This one is just a great action movie, probably the best one I have seen this entire summer of 2003. There is a great car chase, one that is even better than the Matrix Reloaded, mainly cause it looks more real, like it is actually happening in a city rather than a road Hollywood built (don't get me wrong though, that one was cool too) and there are other numerous scenes in this one that just keep your attention to the screen. The T-X is rather cool, but I just don't see her being superior to the T-1000, as it seemed a lot harder to destroy. Though I thought Kristen did a rather good job similar to Robert Patrick (I think that was his name). The movie explains some of the plot points I was wondering about too, all in all this movie was very enjoyable and had quite a few humorous moments as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underhyped but over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3 is a prime example of what I'd call underhype/over-rate syndrome. We all saw the awful trailers, we all heard about the troubled production history, and we all knew that James Cameron &amp; Linda Hamilton wouldn't be involved. Suffice it to say, no one I knew thought this movie was going to be very good. I held out hope that I'd see a reasonably entertaining action movie.That's exactly what I saw, . . . barely. However, I think that the fact that the movie came with such low expectations, has somehow raised a lot of people's opinions of a very mediocre film (73% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes).But enough about other people's opinions, lets get to mine. I watched Terminator 3 with a smile throughout most of it. It wasn't a big goofy smile, or a wide-eyed look of awe or shock, but a pleasant, mildly amused smile. I left the theater entertained, but I almost immediately began to forget the movie I just saw.I started to think about why my reaction was so luke warm. I think I can boil it down to this: There wasn't one moment in the movie that thrilled or surprised me. For a Sci-Fi action movie, let alone the 3rd installment in a series, that's a fatal flaw in my book. Where did it go wrong? Here's my breakdown:CHARACTERS: - T101 - Great to see Arnold back as the T-101, I actually liked him better here than I did in T2. He has a couple of funny lines, but like the rest of the film they are mildly amusing and instantly forgettable. - John Connor - Nick Stahl is less annoying than Edward Furlong but not anymore interesting. He's actually quite bland and didn't generate empathy for his character. - Kate Brewster - Claire Danes manages to make her more empathetic and engaging than John Connor, but the two characters have zero chemistry together. Any human drama that might have made the movie more interesting is lost by this fact. - TX - A sorry substitute for Arnold in the 1st film and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in the 2nd. She doesn't pull out any awe-inspiringly cool tricks like the T-1000 did, and her stone-cold-menace factor pales in comparison to the T-1000 as well as Arnold in the original. Granted she had two pretty tough acts to follow, but if the film makers insisted on telling basically the same story for the 3rd time, they had to make up in style and cool effects what they sacrificed in lack of originality and predictability.Which brings us to STORY: I liked the 1st 2 terminator films, I didn't need to see them AGAIN during the 1st hour of this film. The first hour had no tension or suspense because I'd seen it all before, and we knew none of the main characters would be killed by the TX anyway. Had there been any spark of originality here it may have sustained my interest more than it did. During the last half hour, the story finally goes somewhere new, but by that time even these late developments are utterly predictable.DIRECTING: Serviceable job by Jonathan Mostow, the action scenes are well structured, and the character scenes are watchable enough. However the framing of the images doesn't compare with the stylistic touch James Cameron displayed in T2.WRITING: The dialog was succinct and to the point. No groan inducing lines, but nothing I'd call witty either.ACTION: A lot of people have apparently been wowed by the chase scene involving a crane driven at high speed while ripping up half the city. I'll say this for this scene, it's loud, and it certainly must've been expensive. Again, there is absolutely no tension in this scene, and visually it is not as impressive as say the highway chase in Matrix Reloaded. I've seen plenty of chase scenes in my time, and a great many of them were better than this one. A fight scene between the two terminators towards the end of the film fares much better, mostly because (gasp!) I didn't know how it was going to end, and because the film makers wisely avoided the use of CGI stuntmen for the most part. You could really feel the weight of the metal crashing against the environment in this scene.EFFECTS: Like I said before, this film has basically nothing original story, character, or action-wise, putting a great burden on the effects to offer something to keep us interested. The result is ho-hum, although I must commend the restrained use of CGI during action scenes (a practice that has cost many other movies the suspension of disbelief from their audiences).So to summarize, T3 is a mildly fun action flick. If that's all your looking for, by all means T3 will do the job. Just don't be suckered by the under-hyping into thinking this a great film that's come to rescue the summer. As a fan of the series I liked where the story ended up, but the journey there was at times an exercise in mind numbing predictability.My Rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big let down for true fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines did not do justice to the series at all. There were more plot holes and mistakes within this movie then I've ever seen in a movie with a budget of 170 million dollars. The problems are consistent throughout. First of all, and the biggest shortcoming, is the fact that James Cameron did not direct this film. This new director who calls himself a true "fan" of the series knows nothing about it and nothing about a good movie. The terminator is seen as a running gag, something to laugh at and not something to fear or respect. As far as the TX, she was not acceptable as a killing machine. She inspires no fear and creates no suspense as she chases the main characters. Although she is referred to as the ultimate killing machine, she is inferior to the less advanced T-1000. Nick Stahl, the actor who played John Connor, is not fit to be the future leader in the fight against the machines. He is scared and pretty much just a figure head within the film offering no real development in his role. In fact, no character is developed well in this film and the terminators are much too humanlike. My advice for the true fans of the series is to not bother going to see it. In fact, I am going to pretend this movie never happened. It is not a part of the series to me. After watching the film one thought went through my head, "What was the point of that movie?" The answer is to make a quick buck off a big actor and a big title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This commercial fluff was nothing but a money-maker to bridge Cameron's work with the hanging Terminator 4."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for mindless, repetitive, and hardly groundbreaking CG action sequences, T3 should give you underwhelming entertainment, and leave you with absolutely nothing, except how the script was approved, to reflect upon. Cameron would be rolling over in his grave (if he were dead) at this piece of marketing garbage. The previous movies' ability to stand on their own, and Judgment Day's excellent departures from the original to make a fresh experience. This commercial fluff was nothing but a money-maker to bridge Cameron's work with the hanging Terminator 4. Not to mention interesting and suspenseful storylines, character's that are a little thicker than cardboard cutouts, and flat out BRILLIANT action sequences, even without the capabilities of today's computer animation.The reversal's presented in the earlier films (Arnold, the traditional hero, becoming the relentless killing machine in the former, and then turning the tables to become an always-there dependable father figure) were not here. And while you can basically predict the ending's of Cameron's films, you don't see (SPOILERS) Reese or the Terminator's death at the end of each picture. The hack's responsible for this mess could have at least thought about throwing us a curve _somewhere_.As far as I'm concerned, this is nothing but an expensive and quality piece of mediocre "fan fiction," not part of the actual Terminator continuity. They stopped Judgment Day in movie two, this is just a side story.Remember: Just because Peter Jackson and the Wachowskis did it, doesn't mean you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003) *** Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken, David Andrews, Mark Famiglietti, Earl Boen. He's Back! And this time the Terminator is against a highly advanced model Terminatrix T-X (Loken, who comes across as a Swiss Army knife meets Sharon Stone out of Midol) sent back from the future to kill rebel leader-in-the-making John Connor (Stahl, replacing Edward Furlong, and for my money actually resembling the adult version shown in the last sequel's preamble) and his spouse-to-be (Danes, seemingly miscast and borderline a Screaming Mimi ala Kate Capshaw in 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom' ), by any means necessary, prior to their attempt to stop SkyNet, the nefarious weapons defense system from beginning a nuclear war. Director Jonathan Mostow (who fills in for James Cameron, who has absolutely nothing to do with this latest chapter in the lucrative franchise) skillfully handles the jaw-dropping action sequences and high tech visuals with deft aplomb (including a hairy chase sequence that rivals 'Matrix Reloaded' ) but the logy screenplay by John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian) hinders the pyrotechniques on display.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the effects might seem a bit rushed the entire film rocks and rolls though some familiar Terminator territory. The film thankfully ends on time, any more would have been flogging.The scary thing is when it dawns on you that Arnold, without much formal education but with the smarts to learn a lot of lines, wants to govern the people of California.If it happens lets get SkyNet up and running FAST!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shell of its former self</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 'Terminator' was basically a sci-fi slasher flick. Dark, relentless and scary. The second one was more cerebral and polished, trading terror for white-knuckle action. 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is merely a generic summer popcorn movie. The script is thin, recycling old ideas without any of the careful craft that Cameron originally put into them. Also missing is the crucial relationship building that gave the first two films their heart.Arnold returns, looking remarkable for a man in his late 50s, but his Terminator here lacks the cold menace of the original or the sly wit of his 'T2' counterpart. Nick Stahl is surprisingly effective as John Conner, but his character is unfortunately underwritten. "Heroine" Claire Danes mostly just screams and villain Kristianna Loken is nothing but eye candy as the eye-rollingly named Terminatrix.Though it breezes by at a fast clip, 'Rise of the Machines' is a weak and uninspired successor to the two legendary originals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No match for the first two films but it does its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Things didn't look good for 'Terminator 3'. James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, William Wisher, Adam Greenburg, Mark Goldblatt, Gale Ann Hurd, Brad Fiedel: all gone. Just about everyone who worked on the first two films is absent. The only returning players are, I think, Arnie and Stan Winston. Oh, and Earl Boen. Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl, and I think we all have the feeling that Arnie did this movie only to boost his flagging career. It could have been pretty bad.Well, it isn't bad at all. It's a qualified success, for sure, but it's not the train wreck it could have been. New director Jonathan Mostow (who did a cracking job with 'Breakdown') admits he's a big fan of the first two movies, and what he's come up with is basically the most expensive slice of fan fiction ever created. There's loads of stuff in here that builds on and riffs on events in the first two films in a way that smacks of 'Hey, wouldn't it be SO cool if...' The good news is that, yeah, it WOULD be cool if... If, say, there was a enormous chase involving a crane truck that smashes everything in its path, or if there were exciting fights between Arnie and the new model T-X (Kristanna Loken) in which they smash up both each other and the surrounding area, or if Arnie had his program corrupted so he switches from good to bad, or if he got his head knocked off, or if the T-X could control other machines and send empty cars smashing about the place in pursuit of John and his pals. Some of this stuff is nonsense but that doesn't stop it being fun.But the 'Terminator' movies have always been about more than just action, so how does 'T3' hold up there? Well, it's hit and miss. I liked the ideas of destiny, and how the characters can't avoid their fates. The ending is solid, playing out a global disaster on a very personal level, and there's a twist right before that that I liked a lot. John's relationship with Kate (Clare Danes) is interesting, and Stahl brings a kind of weary acceptance to his situation; I felt sorry for the poor guy, battered around by another Terminator punch-up when he thought he was safe from all that. The T-X's expanded mission parameters add a bit extra and hark back to the original film's phone book executions. I liked that the Terminator who protects John throughout the movie will kill him sometime in the future. 'We will meet again...' ? hey, that's neat! The fate of Sarah ? she dies from leukaemia, and what we assume to be her resting place in fact houses a ton of weapons ? is suitably downbeat. And I loved the sand melting into glass as Arnie arrives in the past.Best of all, though, is the titular rise of the machines. I got a kick from seeing the mini Hunter-Killers and the feeling of impending doom as Skynet becomes self aware, and the role of the T-X in all of this is a neat repeat of the circular logic in the original movie. The T-X is cool, and while she's been slagged off for not being an improvement on the T-1000, let's remember that the T-1000 could only form itself into rudimentary stabbing weapons, whereas the T-X has a transforming endoskeleton complete with its own arsenal, plus a liquid metal coating for disguisey purposes, so it's an improvement in that way. But not in screen terms, as Loken just doesn't have the menace that Robert Patrick brought to 'T2' and the character's abilities aren't used nearly as excitingly. But the bit where she twists her body round to clamp Arnie is freaky, and no one's complaining about her expanding breasts.The downside? Well, Cameron is very much missed. 'T3' lacks the intensity, the sinister tone, the scary atmosphere of the first two films. It doesn't have the heart or the depth that we've come to expect. After the dark and gritty look of the first film, and the beautiful metallic sheen of the second, the generic photography here is something of a disappointment and makes the film look awful ordinary; Don Burgess is usually more stylish than this. 'T3' is a much less special film than Cameron's masterworks.Most jarring is the inclusion of humour that pops up at inappropriate times and too often for my liking: there are solid laughs here, but Mostow should have reined in the comedy and cut the scene with Dr. Silberman running off; initially it's funny, as he explains away what he saw in the other films as stress-related hallucinations, but then it's all taken too far. There are laughs that play on the Terminator's stiff, implacable personality, like the strip bar scene, but it goes too far with the 'Talk to the hand' thing and the Elton John glasses.Kate's line explaining how she's able to pilot a helicopter should have been chopped, too, and I wonder how Arnie managed to make it there so quickly considering he's so badly damaged? All in all, I'd say 'T3' is an inferior but well-intentioned sequel. It was never going to beat the others, and maybe something new was needed other than another Terminator vs. Terminator plot, but the movie is respectful of the other films while building on them with some pretty neat ideas. It's solid rather than awe-inspiring, but for the most part this has been made with care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Conner, in fear of the events that took place at a young age, lives off the grid--no phone, no job, no credit cards. After failing twice, SkyNet sends their most advanced machine to date, to not only kill John, but his future wife as well. Once again, a Terminator is sent to protect John and his future wife, and has a small upgrade which allows it to mimic humans more. Not knowing how these terminators were sent, considering he thought he destroyed SkyNet, John will soon learn something that will change his life.......The film is literally a meal ticket for Schwarzenegger, Judgment Day pretty much wrapped everything up for most fans, but there's always something about seeing Arnold in his defining role once more.Enjoy it as a Big Bang blockbuster and you will get something out of this,the set pieces are notable, especially the vehicle chase that unites John and The Terminator.But there are many, many flaws to the movie. The humour is out of place, and as soon as The Terminator puts in those glittery sunglasses, it either makes or breaks the movie. It's as if there is a little pause every time The Terminator is about to say something funny like 'talk to the hand' and so on.The inclusion of Dr. Silberman seems good at first, but them it just turns into self referential parody.Although the movie was costly, it looks somewhat cheap. Even though some of the effects are wonderful, it's not as cinematic as Cameron's two outings.And then there's Loken as the T-X. Let's just say she was born to play a robot, she's awful, and brings the movie down a couple of notches.Schwarzenegger saves the movie, he's still (just) got it to make a convincing Terminator, and it's his movie, plain and simple.Its nothing compared to the first two, but its worth watching just to see Schwarzenegger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to cry tears of pain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up loving Terminator. Especially the second movie. And this movie completely sucks in almost every way.I keep trying to find something redeeming about it. I'm trying to force myself with mental back-flips into somehow making this movie not the worst film I had ever seen. The only thing good this film did was judgment day. But, that would have served better as a two or three minute prologue to T4 and T4 could have been T3 and things would be much better.(Judgment day was pro-longed but not stopped, now to the movie.) The movie tries to be funny, and falls on its face by taking treasured scenes and turning them into half-baked and crappy jokes. It tries to change storyline, in all the wrong ways. Everything feels forced. You almost wish that Arnold will stop talking because everything he says just destroys any sense the previous two movies every made. (Not that they were perfect; but T3 took 'creative liberties' to an obscene level where they were pulling crap out of their butt left and right and not even checking if it had any dramatic reason to be there, make fans happy, or even make any sense.) The took my child-hood hero that was emotionally strong and turned him into a whiny a** drug addict. I grew up watching T2 and playing with T2 toys sense I was about five. As I got older, I saw John as a role model of emotional maturity; someone with strong leadership skills that I would someday want to be.Now he's a whiny little b**ch for some reason that has never really been explained. He never was before. Had no reason for becoming. It's not like he was unstable and this was in the cards. Of all the characters in T2, T1 even, he was the most emotionally mature and most level headed; even talking his mom down from killing a man.Now? Now he'd go pop some dog neutering pills and be out for hours. Wow, did the writer have nothing better to do than defecate on my childhood? The Terminator series has always been about making your own fate, your own future. That's how things really work. That is a large part of Spirituality. The movie itself even shows that the future was changed. Skynet was set back, that itself is a change. So why does the film go on and on trying to refute how things really Spiritually work, how they worked in T1, how they worked in T2, and how they work even in this film. It just seems that John was just such a whiny runt that he gave up on saving the future.I almost wanted the Arnold Terminator to shoot John dead in the movie so he would just stop whining so damn much. Boo hoo, the future, boo hoo, his life sucks, boo hoo. How did John go from emotionally stable leader to emo drug addict thumb sucker? This film felt like those making it took personal pleasure in taking everything the first two films had ever done well, and every way positive they touched my life, and just shredded it.Part 4 does a great job it trying to put a coherent story back together after 3. I like Part 4, actually. At least it understood what it was supposed to be. But it had two classics to stand up to and a lot of baggage from 3 to deal with. So, I think Part 4 did the best it could considering and I like Part 4 a lot.As for Part 3, it was just sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if this movie isn't as good as terminator 2,it's darn close.it's definitely a worthy sequel.and as much as i liked the first Terminator movie,i think this is a much better movie.it has pretty much everything.it's part comedy,part action adventure,part drama.and all those elements work here.of course it helps if you have good actors,which this one does.Nick Stahl and Claire Danes play the two romantic leads,and both are quite credible in their roles.of course,Arnie Returns,and is great as usual,especially with his deadpan delivery of the funny lines,which there are quite a few.but to me,the best Part about this movie was Kristanna Loken,who played the T-X ,or the Terminatrix,the villainess of the piece.i think she nailed the part of the cold calculating,unstoppable killing machine.she brings a great intensity to the character.this female Terminator is virtually indestructible,which leads me to the action/fight sequences between her and the good terminator.these scenes are intense and relentlessly exhilarating.at least i thought so,any way.the more i think about it,the more i believe that it's too close for me to call whether this movie or part 2 is the better movie.maybe i'm crazy,but i have to give terminator 3:Rise of the Machines a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>T3: I knew it would be bad, I had heard what James Cameron thought about it so I was sort of prepared for a couple of hours of utter nonsense.To sum it up this film just feels cheap the whole way through. I don't mean the budget (which I am sure was 10 times the first one) but the acting the story the... well the whole film. If you were to remove the action scenes (which just didn't have the same richness as with James Cameron's in T1 and T2) you were left with a basis for a good film.There were some nice ideas, it's just a shame they left the idea of possibly making an interesting, intelligent classic masterpiece like the first two and went instead for the big action scenes to please the masses...As a Terminator film T3 sucked. It was appalling and I have no wish to ever see it again thank you very much.To try and be at all positive, if you ignored the fact that this film has ruined a potentially awesome trilogy (eg: ALIEN ALIENS ALIEN 3 not inc Resurrection) and look at it as a comedy it's not that bad. There are some quite amusing parts from Arnie. But like I said, it's not a touch on the first two and I don't want to see it again.Someone else on here mentioned the fourth film may be better but I think it's best to put it to rest. Some things are best left alone.We have found out that no one but James Cameron can do it, unless he is allowed to make his own version T3 lets save us any further embarrassment and bury the Terminator before it's too late.It is my fondest wish that Arnie wont be back...Thanks.Monty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest disappointment since Batman Forever (many spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film not expecting much and yet this film still managed to deliver even less that that. This was by far the biggest let down since Warners let Schumacher loose on the Batman franchise.Firstly, when did the Terminator films become comedies. True there were a few jokes in T2, but this was criminal. From Arnie donning the Elton specs to "I'm back" I was cringing throughout this hell.Next, I know it's impossible to watch a film about time travel without noticing flaws, but this film was beyond the pale such as the fact that Cyberdyne has been destroyed yet the Terminators still resemble Arnie and have the Cyberdyne serial no's. Plus there were all the classic story flaws such as the TX being a vast improvement on the t-1000. OK, I might be wrong but she seemed to take a beating, from her weapon malfunctioning to being crushed by a helicopter (the T-1000 walked away unscathed from a helicopter crash in T2).I don't mind a few plot points being delicately nudged into a film, but this was shocking. Where did Arnie's explosive cells come from. Surely this would have been a hazard when he dropped into the lava at the end of T2. My favourite by far, though, was Clare Danes shouting, "it's my father's plane, I trained in it". Phew what a relief, if she hadn't they never would have made it to the thrilling finale.All in all this was a shocker, from the stilted screenplay to the shocking filming (no need for slow-mo every scene Mostow). I was expecting an average film and a bad Terminator film but what I got was a terrible film and an insult to James Cameron.</fullReview>

The acting was nonexistent, and the script seemed geared mainly to get the viewers from one overblown set of special effects to the next. (SPOILER NEXT) And the idea that the very place that has been squirreled away in the middle of nowhere and prepared specifically for a nuclear disaster would A) be deserted at the moment of truth and B) have nothing but a ham radio and a podium for the President to speak at is ludicrous even by modern-movie standards. I am normally a fan of Schwarzenegger's work, but this one had me wondering how badly he needed the paycheck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold rules, but where's Cameron?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After leaving T3, and viewing T2 again over the holiday weekend, I realized the key thing that gives T1 and 2 the edge over this recent blockbuster. James Cameron, co-writer and director of those first two, knew right away how to do the action sequences, how to make them exciting, and even how to top himself in the sequel. But what he was keen on was the story, the characters- for a world such so hard-edged and desolate as in these films, the overall humanity has to be all the more noticeable in order to feel for the main players. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was made without anything to do with Mr. Cameron, and because of that there is a slight feeling of aloof, even as Jonathan Mostow and his writers try their best to make an impact on the saga of John Connor and the Machines.Here's the good news- the action in this film is still exciting, in the sort of dumbdy-dumb dumb flow of this season of movies, and one of the pleasures of seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger in nearly all of his films is that he can bring a laugh and a grin at the most dire of sequences, not to mention his catch phrases (some are corny "She'll be back", others are amusing "Talk to the hand"). And the new Terminator (T-X), played in a strikingly impervious and sensual efficiency by Kristina Lokken, is a good counterpart for the model 101.The bad news is that there isn't as much to take in as far as interesting new roles and situations and such, the dialogue revels in cliches instead of juggling around with them as in the other 2, and the actors who play them aren't the wiser- Claire Danes as Kathryn Brewster is convincing to a point, pushing the thankless boundaries of the helpless maiden; Nick Stahl's Connor looks and acts as much like Edward Furlong as Jodie Foster looks and acts like Julianne Moore, and the purpose for Earl Boen's Dr. Silbermen is purely for gag value at this point.The story-line takes us in this chapter as that this is the new Judgment Day, with Sky-Net on a roll to domination. Fair enough, but the writers don't overcome any of the subtle, and not so subtle plot-holes. For instance(s), after the Terminator goes out of the funeral parlor with the casket, gets shot at by bullets that don't leave a mark on him (which did in the last films), he shoots back and explodes some cop cars and then reading on his monitor that there wasn't one human casualty. The reasoning for the Terminator not committing any human casualties worked in part 2 since young John Connor made him swear not to kill anyone, and in this one it isn't the same Terminator as in that one, so why is he still an "anti-terminator terminator"? For an R-rating there is something fishy about Arnold as a semi-pacifist trapped inside of a cybornetic organism. And Sarah Connor dying of leukemia in 1997 will be a bit of a contradiction as to what's mentioned in the T2 book.And yet, these I suppose are my problems with such a film, and I can guess I am probably not the only one with them. Indeed even the most shallow of movie-goers will see this is the least effective of the three in the now Terminator trilogy. But for this summer's crowd of movie-goers, being fed the assembly line of sequels and re-fashionings of part efforts, it's certainly not indigestible, and it may keep some hoping for a part 4. As Mr. Connor says in the film, "there is no fate but what we make of it". Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so not worth a watch.Summary: We speed up in time and join the loner John Connor, now an adult unaware that his time is approaching to take control of his life and the lives of others to survive judgement day. A new terminator, the TX has been sent back to destroy all those who were commanding officers under John Connor, but John, along with the help of an allied terminator go on a rescue to save his future wife from being killed by the new improved terminator TX and to stopping judgement day.The ending is not what you would expect, the new TX was very cool although she had 2 lines in the whole movie and as for the rest of the cast, Arnie is back butt naked again as the allied terminator, but apparently isn't the same one that died before... he's a new one and he only takes commands from Kate Brewster... John Connor's future bride, but the kids here have some history, which Kate keeps bringing up at odd times. The first Terminator movie rocked, the 2nd one rocked more but the 3rd one rolled over and died. The only highlight is the new TX, who is described by a close friend of mine as being "hot". I've rated this a 4 out of 10, but just barely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wasn't the entire point of Terminator 2 that 'there is no fate but what we make for ourselves'? It was a good message, as humans have always had the tendency to deal with their anxieties by attributing inevitability or some sort of cosmic plan to future events. While this may be true, I find it most prudent to subscribe to the view that the future is not set and that it is in our hands. It allows you to live your life to the fullest and to die knowing you spent your life trying to make a difference.I loved the ending of T2. The sacrifices made by the protagonists have proved that future CAN be changed.Unfortunately, when a sequel promises a safe way to earn lots of money, it does become inevitable.So what is the message this time around? That future is inevitable anyhow, and no matter what you do the universe has conspired to entrap you and make you a helpless pawn in a grand scheme where life, death, even love are pre-determined. This is a rejection of everything the previous two (excellent) films have stood for.Having rejected the essence of the previous films, T3 goes on to reference more marginal elements from them, because that's what the audience wants, right? Give us Arnold as the Terminator, give us those beloved references. Let us re-live some of that past awesomeness! But it's a pale copy. The film does not feel genuine in any way, and it is less competently written and directed than the previous installments. The antagonist is a useless bimbo that is in no way menacing, and the protagonists are made to say stupid lines and either sit in the back of a van or run around aimlessly.So what is good about this film? Well, Arnold, of course. He is the reason we are watching this. The rest is just nonsense we have to endure so we can see Arnie do his stuff. And he delivers, although he can't do anything to fix a poorly written script.Going back to the script, now we learn that Connor's wife is suddenly a major player in the resistance, which was never even hinted at in the previous films. Moreover, their children too are important. You can just tell they are making up stuff just so they can squeeze in new characters and make it possible to extend this franchise forever. And the original myth about John Connor? Who cares. If we think we can make another sequel by inventing Connor's relatives, ex-wives, cousins, children, grandchildren, math teacher, pet dog, etc. we will shove these characters into the plot.As we have seen, T4 further distanced itself from the original film and now anything goes. As long as there is a robot that looks like a human skeleton in it, you can call it a 'terminator' movie and start making money.The bottom line is that T2 was the end of this story. It was nicely wrapped up by the creator of the original film and there was no need for a sequel, or a prequel, or a reboot. It's time for filmmakers and studios to start creating original stories and characters and stop cynically exploiting the original work done by true filmmakers decades ago. We need to start voting with our feet and avoid movie theaters in protest. Get yourself a blu-ray of the original film and watch it at home with your friends or family.</fullReview>

It has been made simply for the money (look at its certificate compared to the first two, its clearly aimed at the bigger target audience); it's been made for the sake of being made. It is an insult to the first two excellent movies. Personally I would of preferred it if they simply left it at two movies, this third instalment makes fun of a lot of the stuff that made the first two movies cool. It is more of a comedy than anything else and a bad one at that. Its rating certainly doesn't reflect this movies quality (or lack of); I think it gets a lot of votes from kids who know nothing about the original movies and just like it for its big budget special effects.

Static dialogue and conflicting emotions does not a great movie make. I'm sure everyone got paid well and there's food on the table, that's great, but if the movie industry ever wondered why people pirate movies its so that we don't feel so ripped off when we shell out 15$ for a mistake. The most entertaining part of the movie was counting the explosions with my cousin, cause then we came up with explosion subcategories. Explosions that are caused by realistic existing incendiary devices ie. gas pipelines, and then there's the non realistic ie. dirt and concrete. Apparently concrete and dirt are actually flammable, huh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a real 'middle of the road' movie. It was not as good as I had hoped but it also was not as bad as I had feared at the same time. Like most other people, I was skeptical about this movie. I mean Terminator 3 without James Cameron and Robert Patrick as villain but an yet inexperienced director and girl as villain instead? I feared the worst but at the same time I hoped that the movie might become as good as it's predecessors "Terminator" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". It surely had the potential and budget for that. In the end "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" might not be as good as the previous two Terminator movies but at least it's just as enjoyable.Basically this movie is just a great action-flick. I already knew that Jonathan Mostow was capable of directing a good action movie after seeing "U-571", so I might not had been as skeptical as most others about Mostow directing this movie. "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" also is a wonderfully directed action movie that has some highly memorable and well constructed action sequences in it. It really is due to Mostow's skills that this movie is better than the average action-flick. The movie features so great shootouts, fistfights and car chases, of which the one with the large crane truck the most memorable one. The high budget is notable in the movie and lots of stuff blows up and gets demolished. Budget well spend in this case, I say!It's not the story that makes this movie a good one. Even though it by no means is a bad story, it just lacks any real depth and emotion. The movie however sets things nicely up for a "Terminator 4" movie. I for one, am really looking forward to this movie, if it ever gets made. I also certainly wouldn't mind seeing Jonathan Mostow returning to direct, if James Cameron is not available/won't do it.The movie is well cast. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role of 'The Terminator'. He however is given a lot more dialog this time, which perhaps was not the most wise choice, since Arnie's acting skills are highly below average. But perhaps that's also part of the charm. He yet again delivers some cheesy one-liners and the movie as a whole is surprisingly comical at times, especially when compared to the previous two Terminator movies. I think it's great that they actually picked an actor to play John Conner, who actually looked like Edward Furlong, who played John Conner in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". Nick Stahl is a great new John Conner. He also has some nice chemistry with his love interest played by Claire Danes. Kristanna Loken tries very hard to surpass Robert Patrick's performance from "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" but she unfortunately hasn't got enough charisma for that.The movie is just nothing more than an awesome action flick. Action movie fans will absolutely love this movie. But the movie does get a git unnecessary violent at times. The movie features lots of killing of innocent persons. It's a bit too much and over-the-top perhaps at times, even for my taste, even though I'm used to seeing a lot worse in some movies. This movie simply just didn't needed that. The special effects of the movie are just great and work convincing. The nice action musical score is from Marco Beltrami. Marco Beltrami is a great and talented action movie composer that hasn't yet got the recognition which he deserves.Perhaps not as impressive and good as the previous two Terminator movies but as an action-flick this movie is just totally awesome!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T3: the well-predicted disappointment (no spoilers in this review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read the posting by "J Akerberg from Sweden" and agreed that T3 peed all over the original Terminator movie. Dialogue and acting was atrocious. Special effects were good, but then we've all learned to expect that these days with the amazing advances in computer animation, etc. However, T3 was fraught with so many technical mistakes. Anyone notice the huge white "X" in the middle of an intersection when during a chase scene, the car spun about in the middle of the intersection - obviously directed to do so on the conspicuous X. What about when the Terminator (Arnie) was walking back and forth at a campground fetching weaponry while John Connor and what's her name yapped. That scene must have had live audio recorded because with those heavy combat boots Schwarzie was wearing, his voice jarred with every step. If he was the robot he was advertised to be, his voice would not falter while he walked (oh, unless someone wants to argue that the machines had thought of every way to emulate human physical dynamics). No. Had real thought been put into this movie, it could have been much better and much scarier. I loved the original Terminator movie. This sequel was (as my gut instinct told me it would be) a disappointment. So I just sat back and enjoyed it for the FX and I replaced some of their dialogue with my own ideas that would have made it funnier. Some business, this Hollywood. It seems to make money on whatever it stamps out of its assembly lines. Just goes to show how low the American public's expectations are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The day before its opening in theaters, I was just so excited. Terminator 3 who could believe it, it was amazing, could it be even better then Terminator 2? The answer was, NO!! What a disappointment, I felt like sh*t after the movie finished. What did they do to it!! Terminator was no longer the serious and heroic character, he was a stupid clown in screen! They messed it up. The movie s*cked not a little, but just a lot! Great special effects indeed but almost all day light scenes, comic and stupid look for terminator, lost characters, no emotion, no intensity, no fear, nothing. All the great master piece created by James Cameron in Terminator 1&amp;2 was lost! I'm sorry to say but if you have not seen the movie and loved the first 2, don't watch it, trust me! This movie was made with one thing in mind, MONEY. They did not care about the story, the thriller or the characters. Just the money. NO wonder Cameron did not direct the third part, he wrote the story for and to finish in 2 movies, they just wrote on top to do the third one!Terminator 3, is not just the worst of all the terminators but a waste of time to watch. Other low budget action flicks, including Terminator 1 itself do 10 times better than this. I just hope that they do not go for Terminator 4, I would not take the risk to see it. Terminator 3 is just "rubbish" to see. I give it a 4/10 because of the special effects and Arnold, its not his fault after all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 'Terminator' series has always had its plot going against it. Time travel is finicky business and, unfortunately, 'Terminator 3' takes an already convoluted and mixed-up time plot and changes it around.Instead of a fairly well planned plot, we get a mixture of "Terminator 2" with "The Fast and the Furious". There really isn't anyway they can top the previous movies without going overboard in one department and lagging in more critical ones. T2 proved that. How many different ways can they make the same car chase?Jonathan Mostow is competent as a director, but he lacks James Cameron's legendary touch. "B-o-o-h-o-o." Arnold, to quote Danny Glover in "Lethal Weapon", is 'getting too old for this sh**'. His Terminator role lacks the villainy of the first movie or the sympathy of the second. Everything else is unfamiliar and inferior.Overall, an unnecessary sequel. Correction, make that an unnecessary sequel with a tremendously overblown budget. Warner needs to know where to put their money next time. I give this 1.5 out of 5 stars for being blatantly stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator, the original was a great movie. It was dark and atmospheric. The acting was excellent. I felt Michael Biehn(sp) and Linda Hamilton's characters had chemistry together, the story was good and the action was amazing.Terminator 2 however, blew me away! How the characters had grown! The future still dark... The action sequences were even better! I waited, and waited so hopefully for the sequel... then finally I saw it, and it had nothing in common with the first two serious films other than the vague following of the plot. The whole film was a joke, and if it had been marketed as a farce or comedy I may have liked it, but it was presented as a serious sequel somehow! The female terminator was hilarious, not menacing... the original terminator looked ready for a rest home, The guy who took over Furlongs part was also very amusing with the dumbo ears and white hair when they show him in the future and the girl was a waste of film altogether... she screamed well, I guess...I'd have to give her that...It was noted on Linda Hamilton's website that she refused a small part they offered her in the beginning because she said the film had no heart or soul or something like that, and she was right. The first two did and are classics, the third, well, it should never have been made, but the greed and the lack of talent are great in this world...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003): Dir: Jonathan Mostow / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken, David Andrews: Money all over the screen without a shred of screenplay worth its budget. It is about man at the mercy of what he created. In this case the audience must suffer for what was created here. It repeats the same exhausted setup with hero and villain terminators falling to earth. What follows are endless scenes of violence with an ending that bears reference to the much better original. Director Jonathan Mostow previously made a much better thriller in Breakdown but here it is the production that matters. This is easily the worst film in the franchise and nowhere near as good or even provocative as the original film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is still effective as the terminator sent to protect John Connor and Kate Brewster but the issue here is that he is merely reciting what he has done before and better. Kristanna Loken as a female terminator is a great thought but its seductive nature is nothing more than a joke. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John and Kate are hardly interesting. They have all the personality of a rusty nail. The film exists mainly for its budget if anything at all. It seems to terminate everything else. Linda Hamilton's presence is sadly missing but then again, so is the screenwriter's. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unrefined, Unimpressive &amp; Unnecessary Addition To The Terminator Saga.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unrefined, unimpressive &amp; unnecessary addition to the saga that was fully told by James Cameron in the first two films, Terminator 3: Rise of Machines arrives as the second sequel to an already finished series that tries to kill the validity of a highly influential franchise &amp; succeeds to a certain extent, and remains one of the most disappointing sequels in cinema history.Following the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the story of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is set in the year 2004 in which Skynet once again sends another Terminator back in time to kill the future high-ranking members of human resistance after it is unable to locate the position of John Connor while a reprogrammed T-850 model arrives from the future as a protector of John &amp; his future wife, Kate.Directed by Jonathan Mostow, Terminator 3 is an insipid, stupid &amp; inferior sequel that lacks everything which made its predecessors two of the most groundbreaking films in the genre of action &amp; sci-fi. The screenplay is marred by its poor storytelling, dull dialogues, complete lack of depth, terrible characterisation, forgettable villain &amp; soulless action, which gets even worse with the lifeless performance its cast puts up.Despite the advancement in filmmaking technology over the years, its technical aspects are no match to the first two chapters of the franchise. Camera-work is all over the place, for it is impressive in a few sequences &amp; absolutely dodgy at other moments. Editing makes the film a tedious affair to sit through, visual effects is highly inferior in comparison &amp; the score by Marco Beltrami isn't that captivating either.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Kristanna Loken &amp; Claire Danes and not one of them manage to leave a lasting impression. Schwarzenegger's character is ineffectively handled, Loken's T-X is a major step back after the indestructible T-800 of the first film &amp; the invincible T-1000 of the second while Stahl &amp; Danes are very mediocre in the roles of John Connor &amp; his future wife Kate, respectively.On an overall scale, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one sequel that had no reason to exist other than to dent the legacy of the remarkable universe its first two films created. It only goes on to show just how vital James Cameron's input was to this series &amp; without his vision, it's just another cashgrab sequel trying to milk out the franchise for all its worth. The film sure has a couple of stunning moments but for the most part, the process of sitting through Rise of the Machines feels wholly redundant. Worth skipping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hasta La Vista to this Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the brilliance in Terminator one and two there is no way Terminator three can be a disaster, right? It has such a strong foundation it is literally impossible to screw up. Or so I thought, then Terminator Rise of the Machines was made and oh how I wish it never was shown to the public or even to deaf and/or blind children.There are probably 10-15,000 problems with this movie. I heard it was bad but I went in with low expectations and the first thing I see is the producer and director's names. I couldn't believe it wasn't James Cameron. I thought if James Cameron was involved then it couldn't possibly be that bad but from the title screen I lost a lot of hope. James Cameron is the main reason these movies were a success. He created this story, the characters, and through his vision these movies came to life. Now somebody else is ripping off his work to make a buck and he destroyed this franchise.Problem number two, the beginning. It is cookie cutter by now to have Arnold appear, naked, and look for clothes and throw some bodies, but now the evil Terminator is a woman. I saw her and I was devastated. I'm not being sexist and saying a female can't be in this role but this a man's movie. An action packed man experience and seeing a girl follow up to the T-1000 was impossible for anybody. She does the exact same thing as the first two with the emotionless stares and few lines. The intimidation factor was down and she wasn't too special or more advanced from the previous model. In the third installment we revisit the character of John Connor and the way this man turned out was so disappointing. The kid in the second movie was ten times better than this clown. This guy stopped Judgment Day, or so he thought, and he is a coward. He runs and runs in fear. I hated his character and the way he was written. His lines were weak, his acting was weak, and everything about his character was stupid. I thought Sarah Connor would have still taught him to be an intimidating beast, or at least a man. This guy is embarrassing to the supposed to be hero of humanity. On a side note I hate what happens to Sarah. I won't say what happens because I think it is supposed to be a surprise but I was so angry. A character as awesome and dedicated to the story as her deserved better for this film. The main problem with this story is that it probably should never have been made. I was perfectly happy with the ending if Terminator two. If anything this movie takes away the impact of the previous movie. "You didn't stop Judgment Day, you delayed it." That one line ruined everything. Everything done in the second movie was basically for nothing. I would have probably been happier if Arnold was not in this movie. He and John had a strong bond as a kid and when John sees the new Terminator he acts really odd. The chemistry they built up in the previous movie was also for nothing. "I guess I have to re-teach you everything." So many things disappointed me in this movie it was hard for me to find any positives. If I had to say at least one good thing I guess t could be the climax leading to the ending. Skynet is back and we learn a lot more about the beginning of the end. We see the end begin with the fatal mistake and the idea of the impossibility to change the future is still interesting. The last ten minutes or so I had mixed feelings about. They build it up to be something epic and it turns out to be something unexpected. At that point I didn't really care about the ending and I accepted it for what it was. It left off with the strong possibility of another movie, and there is a review will be here soon. Finally I will touch upon the special effects. Well, they weren't that good. In the beginning there is another crazy car chase with cars flying everywhere and way too much destruction. A car crashes into a wall at high speeds and it somehow explodes. Just because a car crashes into something doesn't mean it has explode. The shots with a Terminator being lit up by round after round of ammunition by cops get old. Every action scene in this movie has been used in a similar or exact same way in one of the previous two films. If I have to play devil's advocate I will say I did love the giant robot inside Skynet tearing apart person after person and everything in its path that was awesome. Overall, Terminator Rise of the Machines did the impossible. It was almost impossible for this movie to fail and it did on almost every single aspect of a film to fail. There was poor writing, awful characters, and ridiculous action. If the story had to continue anything else would have been better. I am glad I saw this movie at least once just to say I saw the entire franchise to date, I obviously had to watch this before Salvation and Salvation has also been seen, but I will probably never watch it ever again. Before I give it the WillyT rating I hope you noticed I didn't mention the girl in the story. That is probably because I just remembered her. She is awful, adds nothing to the story, also poorly written, and I hated almost everything about her. There that should be enough ranting for one day. This disgrace of a Terminator movie gets the WillyT Seal of DISapproval.</fullReview>

I know he is a billionaire, but he still likes to make money. If he had any integrity as a 'real' actor he would have turned this role down. But we all know he's not a 'real' actor.The girl terminator they sent back in time could have been better cast by most people on the street, as her only real dramatic skills involve tilting her head in every other scene.Good movie if you aren't looking for a good movie.</fullReview>

This whole concept is really lacking imagination. The TX visual display screen is really lacking imagination. Kristina Loken is quite attractive but she is not scary in any way.Claire Danes is the best part of this movie. Her character makes ridiculous choices but thats because of the bad screenplay. She plays good.Kathleen Brewster's father is really miscast.Some of the action scenes were quite enjoyable. The jokes are cheap and recycled from previous Terminator movies.The camera angles are wrong, T800 is not shown strong. Editing is wrong. (A lot of boring dialogue could have been left out.) The scenes are too clean. (Where is all that dark and gritty future?) The car chase was pretty cool. The CGI snake is fake. The music has no bass and low frequencies. The movie feels dated already. Stan Winston has done a good job with the endoskeletons but the camera is not capturing it. Too much stuff is copied from T2: Judgement Day. This whole thing reads like some kid's school paper to me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third film in the franchise would be quickly forgettable if not for it's ability to depress and disappoint fans of the originals. What feels like more of a spoof than a genuine addition to the previous films is full of genuinely unfunny "jokes", huge plot holes, and unimaginative scenes shamelessly recycled from James Cameron's previous work. Somehow the Director manages all of this while at the same time avoiding any thought provocation and emotional content, something viewers tend to overlook in the previous films, even despite the dark subject matter of impending nuclear holocaust, inevitable unchangeable fate (which in itself contradicts the message well delivered in the second film of free will and writing one's own future), soulless killing machines hell-bent on murdering individuals, etc. Indeed despite all these gripping themes (hijacked from the previous films and not the directors own work), the director only manages to present to us an uninspired ret-con of the story presented. Where before we are told the terminator cannot learn in order to limit his free will, the terminator in this film shows clear signs of learning and imagined "wit" as he spouts one liners in a way unfitting of a killing machine. I don't see this as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who clearly does his best to play his quintessential role in the face of terrible direction. This new terminator is presented as something to be laughed at in funny situations, as in the scene where he takes his clothes from the male stripper, and is somehow stripped of all that made him menacing even as the hero of the second film. The female villain of this film was full of emotion, sexiness, and wit, which only serves to discredit her as a terminator. She clearly enjoys killing, and her only defining feature is turning her arm into an assortment of guns, one trick to an otherwise unimaginative pony. John Connor neither resembles nor acts like he did in the previous film, and comes across as a loser. Despite this, he does somehow manage to expertly activate a particle collider in one bodged scene. His new romantic interest is of so little importance or character I won't waste your time writing about her.All in all, Terminator fans should probably avoid this disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Terminator fans will HATE this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(www.plasticpals.com) Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best sci-fi action movies ever made. It was a perfect blend of all the right ingredients: a gripping story; spectacular action scenes; bleeding-edge special effects; and it managed to spin on its head the age-old adage that a sequel cannot, by definition, outdo the original. James Cameron made a masterpiece, and I doubt you would disagree. So when Terminator 3 was announced ? and that James Cameron would not be directing ? alarm bells started ringing.James Cameron had already proved with Aliens that a sequel to a great film by a different director can actually work. So it's not like Terminator 3 had to be bad ? but unfortunately, it is. Sarah Connor, the 2nd most important character in the series next to the Terminator, doesn't appear in the film. T3&#x2032;s excuse for Linda Hamilton's non-participation is that Sarah died of cancer a few years before the events of T3. If this is true, who is going to train John to become the leader of the resistance? The John we see in T3 isn't Edward Furlong (who wisely passed on the role), it's Nick Stahl, and he doesn't seem prepared to lead a revolution against Skynet at all. He's a total loser who basically "lives off grid" to protect his anonymity in the event another terminator comes back to kill him. And it's made clear from his complete lack of reflexes, let alone military skills, that he hasn't spent his time on the edge of society wisely if there's an apocalypse coming.Schwarzenegger reprises his role of the T-800, and who can blame him? Well, I do. I blame him because if he hadn't signed on to this trainwreck it probably wouldn't have gotten financed to begin with. Arnie's return for one more milking at the cash cow was a disgrace. His adversary is a female dominatrix terminator called the T-X, played by Kristanna Loken.Kristanna LokenShe's sexy, but her athleticism is a bit too obvious for the part ? ironically, Claire Danes would have made a more interesting casting choice. Besides the fact that the T-1000 was a much better (and seemingly more advanced) villain, the idea of a female terminator is wasted on this film. She isn't even liquid metal, which would lend itself nicely to the sanguine female form (as evidenced by Dural from SEGA's Virtua Fighter), and would lend weight to the idea that a smaller, more agile model could tango with the lumbering lugnuts T-800 model.Instead, Claire Danes gets caught in T3&#x2032;s web of fail as John's would-be girlfriend, Kate Brewster. In an unbelievable coincidence, Kate happens to be the daughter of the military commander of Skynet. And the guy who penned that has the audacity to call himself a writer! Terminator 3 also delights in taking a giant dump all over the hopeful optimism of the first two films. A recurring idea in the first two stories is that the future is not set. No fate but what we make. This concept is destroyed in T3 when we are shown that regardless of the characters' actions Judgment Day is inevitable.If this was just some throw-away action movie I wouldn't care that much, but as a kid who saw T2: Judgment Day at around the same age as John Connor in that film, it left a lasting impression on me. T3 has no excuse to suck. It could have been a bullseye but it completely misses its target, shooting itself in the head. Do yourself a favor and forget this film ever existed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disgusting mess or cinematic wreckage, and abusing the fantastic talents of Nick Stahl and Claire Daines. This is a horrible cruel and stupid film in which every single thing and person on screen gets smashed. One absolutely vile sequence sets the scene for future woman beating where two terminators, a woman and a man beat the cogs out of each other culminating where the man smashes the woman's head onto a toilet bowl shattering the porcelain. Whio made this imbecile crap? What's it's market? Blood and cruelty perverts? I am aghast at the whole production that seems intent in showing the worst of any behavior, robotic humanoids or not. The toilet fight and beating is the worst on screen bashing of a 'woman' by a 'man' I have ever seen... and this vile film is scrap like the rubble of the metal on screen. Headache inducing 'action' and imbecile violence galore. I hope Nick and Claire got well paid but it is as awful a paycheck as Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsdale agreeing to work in the equally disgusting porn cruelty horror VACANCY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, so much for "No fate but what we make." 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' proved that we're not up to our own destiny as 'T2' proved otherwise. Be prepared for all the events in the previous installment to be thrown out the window in 'T3.' The perfect comparison is the transition from 'Aliens' to 'Alien 3.' (By the way, I don't think there's much of a coincidence that both 'T3' and 'Alien 3' are bad movies that followed part 2's directed by James Cameron; apparently no one knows how to follow him up, or even if they should.) (Spoiler following) In 'Aliens' Ripley spends the entire movie protecting Newt, Hicks and Bishop and stopping once and for all the alien race only to have 'Alien 3' open with Newt &amp; Hicks dead, Bishop to die later and the aliens breeding again like nothing happened. 'T2' taught us, we are in charge of our future, and 'T3' says, "nope, the set future is 'inevitable.'" And I haven't gotten to the worst aspect (even worse than the dialogue, 'Talk to the hand!'): this is one of the most pointless sequels of all time. It's almost a line-by-line, shot-by-shot remake of 'T2.' Schwarzenegger is a good T-101 sent back to protect Connor, and a liquid metal Terminator sent back to kill him. There's the daylight street chase. There's the gun round-up. The one-liners (only, in 'T3' they were extremely painful to listen to.) Etc, etc. I give it an extra ? star for the special effects. Unfortunately everything else ? the acting, dialogue, originality, inconsistencies, plot holes, laughable characters (that were supposed to be taken seriously), was so far under par, it was unbelievable Cameron even let this get green-lit. And trust me: you'll feel every bit of Hamilton's absence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>T3 is an okay movie, I guess. It has some glaring errors, lapses of logic and inconsistencies with its predecessors, but it has its moments. The best of those moments send shivers down my spine because of the way they echo the predecessors.Yes, the best this movie has to offer is that it's built on a pair of awesome movies. They lift it up, make it touch greatness, and in return it spits on their memory.I guess my problem with T3 is that T1 and T2 make up a legendary, unparalleled, not to mention complete story. T3 has nothing to add to them. T2 ends on a positive note, building a fragile hope that the future might not be lost, and T3 smashes it by not only showing that the apocalypse was inevitable all along, and nothing the earlier two movies accomplished amounted to anything, but also shows the nukes flying and the world ending, substituting hope for mindless destruction.I am constantly revolted that people seem to think this movie is a valid part of the Terminator series. To me it feels like fan fiction, an untrained artist lacking a vision of his own finger-painting his unskilled additions on the Last Supper. With permanent colors.That is to say, I urge you to judge this movie on its own, do not throw it in with its predecessors, for it is not worthy to stand in the presence of such as these. Judge it on its own and notice how utterly it fails to stand on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't give T:3 a very high rating as a movie, but I will give it a high rating for entertainment, especially for action junkies. During the first half there is an inspired "chase" scene that is like nothing I have ever seen before, from its sheer audacity to the unabashed destruction in its wake. Arnold Schwarzenegger, now California Governor, seems to have been born to play the Terminator. However, although he looks much like the Terminators in the prior two installments, tells us that he is in fact a different edition. Nick Stahl is the 20-something John Connor, object of the killing cyborgs of the two earlier editions. We remember that John Connor is supposed to be the savior of the world after the destruction by the machines, and once again future machines have sent one of their own to the present to exterminate him. (I don't know why they didn't send one back to a time when he was maybe 3 or 4, seems he would have been an easier target then!)The exterminator this time takes the form of beautiful model turned actress, Kristanna Loken as T-X. (Reports are that she bulked up with muscle for this role, and she looks quite menacing, in a good way!) She is ruthless in her pursuit of her targets, but it seems she sometimes fails to take good opportunities to exterminate certain targets. But it is a movie, after all. So, once again the movie is about the two terminators from the future, passionless, one programmed to kill John Connor, the other programmed to protect him. Which one do we think will succeed? Claire Danes also has a good role, as Kate Brewster, assistant veterinarian, who also has a father Robert Brewster, a military man, who has leadership of some future state of the art computer network system.This movie is a broad comedy and the lead characters play it that way, especially Schwarzenegger and Loken, the cyborgs from the future. It is a dark comedy, to be sure, because there are a few people killed in cold blood. Not a great story, but an interesting one, and it has more action than one person needs in a 2-hour viewing.SPOILERS FOLLOW. The machines have manufactured a sophisticated computer bug which systematically begins disabling all systems worldwide. No more communication with defense installations gets the Pentagon nervous and Robert Brewster is forced to put the prototype intelligent computer network in service, trusting it will find and defeat the bug. Instead, it becomes all part of the machines' plan, to launch an all-out war of destruction. John and Kate end up being directed to a safe shelter in the mountains, designed years earlier for the President, and they are destined to be the two to repopulate the world and continue the fight against the machines. Cool stuff!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming from a sick fan who's been waiting a minimum of five years to see this film, let me tell you...it doesn't disappoint!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little low-budget film named "The Terminator" hit the streets in 1984. This extremely low-budget actioner was about a machine "terminator" sent back in time to assassinate, or "terminate" the soon-to-be mother of the future world resistance leader, who would fight back against Skynet's machines who would fight for their dominance of the earth.19 years later, and one sequel later, comes "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," the massive differences between the original film being the budget, special effects, and action pieces. Being a long-time "Terminator" fan, of both "T1" and "T2," I can tell you this baby don't disappoint. I have been one of those nerds on the Internet who had an old desktop wallpaper that said "T3: Summer 2002" on it. I have been waiting for this flick for years and years and years, a minimum of five years at least. When production finally started, and was delayed to 2003, and started again, I held my breath and expected the best. After the trailer I expected the worst. Now I got the best. This film blows you away, it's the best sequel of the year and James Cameron's absence from the film, though visible, doesn't hinder it.Judgment Day never happened. The world never got hit by nuclear bombs, the machines took over, and now a twenty-something John Connor lives "off the grids," with no home, no telephone, no nothing. Just in case the machines happen to take over one day in the future and try to assassinate him again.Of course, the machines DO come back again, as without them there would be no sequel. One is a sexy terminator called the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), whose mission is to assassinate John Connor's future lieutenants and his future wife, a current veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), since the machines can't find where John Connor is (that's where the off-the-grid stuff comes in handy for him). However, John Connor happens to meet up with Kate Brewster the same night the TX tries to kill her (and now him since he is a primary target for termination), but the T-800 model cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also back to protect them, who has been sent back in time by Kate Brewster in the future after the protection cyborg murdered John Connor...in the future, that is...err...confused yet?Wow, what a thrill ride. Give me a moment to catch my breath. Action non-stop throughout, great special effects, everything. It's nowhere near as great as the first two films, but as far as summer sequels go, this ranks in as one of the best.Arnold is back in fine form after "End of Days" (I liked "The 6th Sense" and "Collateral Damage"), and for a brief moment in the film (when he throws Kate into the back of a truck), the way he is outlined against the night sky makes him look just like he did in the first film. His haircut is very much the same in that shot. Anywho, he's back.Nick Stahl takes over for druggie Edward Furlong in this installment, and by George he is great! Claire Danes doesn't do much but scream and run around and look pretty, but there's more purpose for her being there than in most movies like this.Like I said before, James Cameron's absence from the film IS visible, but new director Jonathan Mostow does a great job of taking over from him. The film is lacking some of the human elements that made the first so great, and it feels more like a regular action blockbuster than the predecessors. "T2" set a new level for action films; "T3" is more of a follower than a revolutionary film such as the first two. The special effects are impressive, but just like all the other films out there nowadays. "T3" in no way is as vicious, dark, or amazing as the first two films, which are both some of my favorite films, but Jonathan Mostow has done a great job handling Cameron's baby, and it shows, making "T3" neither disappointing nor bad; it's the best film of the summer, and one of the best action films in a long line of dull flicks. And in conclusion, I can honestly say that he'll be back. Trust me. So stick around. When he's back, I'll be back. But for now, hasta la vista, baby.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior continuation to the Terminator saga lacks excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this second sequel set ten years after the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day when John Connor and his mother Sarah Connor seemingly stopped the occurrence of the war between war between mankind and Skynet, John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) is 19 years old and is living as the drifter with no place to live, paranoid about being found by another terminator. However, Skynet sends T-X (played by Kristanna Loken), a powerful and sinister android who's bent on killing Connor. Aided by his future wife Kate Brewster (played by Claire Danes) and CSM-101 (played by Arnold Schwartznegger), another terminator resembling T-800, John Connor must find Kate Brewster's father General Robert Brewster (played by David Andrews) who is capable of shutting down Skynet as it spreads a deadly virus across the globe that would lead to nuclear war and ignite the war between humans and the machines. Racing against the clock, will John Connor succeed and save the future of mankind, or does mankind have a dark future ahead of them?The first two films were quite impressive, the first film dealt with the Terminator traveling back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor and her then-unborn son John Connor to prevent the war, and the second film followed the next terminator traveling back in time to protect John Connor from being killed by T-1000 as he was supposed to be the future resistance leader in the war against the machines. This film, directed by Jonathan Mostow, continues the story of the franchise, while this demonstrating some pulse-pounding action sequences and a compelling premise, it sadly falls short of the excitement that made the first two films entertaining. This movie continues the story on a rather middling note. From the first ten minutes, we are introduced to the evil robot T-X driving around town and executing these targeted civilians who serve no relevance to the plot. Then we are introduced to CSM-101 who arrives at a strip bar to steal the clothes and car keys of a bouncer, similar to what we saw in Terminator 2 with T-800. There is also the intense, but exciting special effects-heavy car chase scene with CSM-101, similar to the motorcycle chase with John Connor and T-1000. These two scenes, while full of excitement, play a great homage to the events of the last films to where it almost feels it is repeating the same events from the previous movie. From there on, the plot becomes less and less interesting, the action becomes less compelling, and the characters seem a bit tiresome. The main thing the characters are lacking is good dialogue and writing. Thus, they end up becoming less memorable. While the actions manages to keep the film standing, this film itself suffers in many places, especially the ending which I found rather anticlimactic, even though it sets the tone for the next film.Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines did not live up to my expectations and fell inferior to the last two films, especially the second one which I consider the best of the franchise. I believe this could have been better if it was handled by James Cameron who was responsible of the last two movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bad Follow-Up To The Best Sequel Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So we're through with T2, probably the best sequel ever came out... Now it's time for the third one in the franchise: Rise Of The Machines. Before watching this film, I took a look at the cast, writers and the director. When I noticed the changes, I knew I'm going to see an average Arnold film. It wasn't better than my expectations, nor was it worse than that. I'm just glad it's not awful. Let's start with the positives first: The directing is pretty great, the script is also good, the dialog was good at best, the action was fantastic and the comedy was well-handled. Now the let's talk about why it's not perfect: Some characters didn't get as much screen time as they should've, the first 40 minutes (!!!) were just an unexplained action exposition, the story wasn't that great, and it was pretty hard to feel bad for their characters, even though we learn about them as the film progresses. Overall, it's a pretty awesome action film. If you're only looking for awesome action scenes and comedy, you won't be disappointed. If you want a good story and expect to see what made T2 one of the best action films ever- forget about this movie and move on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of time and space, a true turd after the diamonds of Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. This is the worst kind of sequel, in that it kinda poisons the memory of the films that came before it a little bit, negating the perfection they left in their complimentary tales. But there's more bad than that. Nick Stahl registers zero as John Conner, and Claire Danes is miscast in a thankless role to begin with. Arnold is back in the groove, but it's schtick by this point because the script feels so desperate and forced as it tries to take the franchise in a new direction. The ending is just sour and rotten and corruptive of the mythology that was nicely tied up by the films before it. T3: No fun, no smarts, no good. This is Hollywood at its worst: Milking a franchise that should've logically stopped at sequel in order to generate a few more hundred millions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay this movie really disregards the previous ones in the series. Terminator 1 &amp; 2 basically said Judgement Day could be prevented whereas this movie basically says it could only be postponed. So what was the point of the first two movies of doing all that fighting against the terminators if it would only lead to Judgement Day getting postponed?Lines of dialogue where really cheesy, I mean the terminator says to a convenience store clerk who confronts him for shoplifting, "Talk to the hand." Seriously. The film also felt like it was directed by Michael Bay rather than Johnathan Mostow due to all the freaking explosions and other excessive destructive special effects. Yeah I know there's going to be destruction inherently because that's what the war of machines is about but to have all this repetitive focus on it makes it annoying and boring rather than cool and emotion grabbing.I felt John Conner and Kate Brewster were rather lame characters in this movie, I mean I just didn't feel the awesomeness that they were supposed to portray. So in conclusion, the plot, characters, and dialogue of the movie SUCKED and didn't hold true to the previous movies. The music, effects were about the only thing that were good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cameron should have slapped the director's face with a rubber chicken because this so called T3 project insults Sir Cameron's Terminator projects. The lame villain was duller than the previous villains. Action is not the only attraction. It is the precise words that characters give to one another. The male leader AKA John Conner appeared as if his interesting personality when he was a kid from T2 was slaughtered off. There's another insult to the previous Terminator classics. Yet, the kicker here is that legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger could NOT SAVE THIS FILM WORTH A DARN. I just felt like my childhood T1 &amp; T2 cult classics were disgraced because of this movie. Honestly, the 4th movie was better a bit than this movie of theatrical plight for Cameron's reputation. However, the 2 Terminator projects before T3 occurred will always have a good reputation for some folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>after the phenomenal sequel judgement day it took twelve years for the third film in the franchise and I wish it never happened and they should have left it with just the first two films. The premise of this film sees a terminator sent back in time to protect John Connor and his future wife from being killed by a future terminator and also to try and prevent judgement day from truly happening. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the terminator and even though he does an alright job this is not the same performance as the terminator as before. He just seems like he is exhausted at times and can't be bothered and this was the first film where they really started to parody the terminator and make him a joke. They recast John Connor with actor Nick stahl and he just was not a good fit for the character. I understand where the character was he just didn't portray him very well and he didn't develop at all in the film and i never saw him getting closer to the leader of the resistance. Claire Danes is in the film and she is alright in the film and develops in the film with her performance being good. Also the villain the TX was a good villain and the character was perfect as the evil terminator of the film. The story didn't work either with it becoming way too convoluted and to a certain extent it takes away from the previous films. It has some decent ideas but really fails to deliver them and I feel like the characters didn't grow on me that much. The script is awful with the dialogue not hitting with any of the characters and they don't allow the characters to expand and become more interesting like previous films characters. There are some pretty cool action scenes like the truck scene and the church scene but then there are some over the top cgi scenes that just look really bad. Overall this is a poor film that you won't like unless you are a huge terminator fan and very forgiving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is the 2003 follow up sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day, it was directed by Jonathan Mostow and was written by John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris, Tedi Sarafian. This movie is quite not good, having not been directed by James Cameron. However after thirteen years of waiting we have a new Terminator film. John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) (Nick Stahl should have had dyed his hair black to match Edward Furlongs but the script writers messed up that too instead bleaching it blond.) is how in his twenties and we find out that Judgment Day was only prevented, instead of terminated. Sarah Connor has died from acute myeloid leukemia? Huh? and we thought she was supposed to be a strong warrior yet the script writers just kill her off with no appearance whatsoever.The script writing is quite bad adding comedy to the 'serious movie'. Nick Stahl should have had dyed his hair black to match Edward Furlongs but the script writers messed up that too instead bleaching it blond. Anyway, The Terminator X is played by Kristanna Loken (That's right a female!) who doesn't say much lol.This film doesn't match the seriousness of the first two films. and the script writing is bad and not a good movie in general. I give it a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie. I knew that James Cameron didn't direct this. Why?, you may ask. James Cameron makes GOOD movies. I was expecting this movie to be awesome, and since it was a Terminator movie, it had a lot of potential. I'm not really surprised, though. 3rd movies are always the worst. For example, Godfather 3, Poltergiest 3, Alien 3, Back to the Future 3, and Karate Kid 3. The only good 3rd sequels I can think of are Goldfinger and Return of the Jedi. I was expecting an action movie with a good plot line and character development and good acting. The robotic Terminators in the first 2 movies also were kinda realistic because terminators are cyborgs. But here's how this one was. There was no good acting, there was only running and screaming, Arnold wasn't as awesome as he was in the first 2 films, and they replaced all the special effects from the first movies that are realistic because of terminators being cyborgs with CGI. I mean, why not replace robotic looking robots with computer animation? To make it look better?! CGI looks awful. I'm real mad at James Cameron for not directing this movie. Maybe then it would be decent. However, the first two movies are so good that I almost forgive James Cameron for not directing the latest ones. James Cameron, I forgive you because you've made too many good movies to slander your reputation.</fullReview>

Poorly cast, Stahl and Daines (who are respectfully quite talented) fail to bring a sense of urgency when required, at times the dialogue is stilted and even the characters seem bored. Only one line devices have carried over from the previous installments, all of which feel tacky, like biting into yesterdays bread. i would mention that the work of Stan Winston in this film is excellent, and the only saving grace. This film offers nothing new, breaks no new ground and requires you strangle your disbelief rather than suspending it. A cash cow indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea how James Cameron, assuming that he did see this, did not reach for his sleeping pills. Michael Bay &amp; Paul Anderson are unjustly derided as the worst directors working today; none of their films, with maybe the exception of Pearl Harbor, are less than watchable. The crown must belong to Jonathan Mostow, who with this mega-abortion proves himself to be the most soulless capitalist whore of them all.It wasn't necessary that this film had to be so abysmally bad - it could have been watchable and reasonably competent even without trying anything radical. But the brazen approach that Mostow and the producers have chosen, to rehash all and change squat, to deliberately aim for the lowest possible denominator, this is the epitome of the most abhorrent and depressing attitudes in mainstream film-making. Of course, these smug a-holes can get away with it because they know there's a ready market for car chases &amp; special effects that don't alter from one film to the next. There's a ready crowd of idle, passive, self-professed "fans" who can be whipped into a viewing frenzy by means of bombastic advertising, plus industry-endorsed film pundits who only care about their paychecks, and nobody will be the wiser. The loser at the end of day is the average movie-goer who has no idea he has been film-flammed by marketing.T3 takes place entirely in movieland, where nothing is real or plausible or of any consequence. Its the passive film-viewer's most delirious fantasy come alive. It has "cash-in" plastered all over it. The thing couldn't possibly get worse, till you notice that this film scores 6.7/10 at IMDb and 70% at RT. The "tongue-in-cheek" humor that everyone was clamoring about is revolting. Was that what the first two movies were about ?? Anyone who rates this higher than 1/10 deserves to have their film-viewing license revoked.</fullReview>

Only, of course, Arnold must be a good guy."The Terminator" was kind of cute and fun, what with it's inventiveness, lack of preciosity, it's high-speed chases through night-time Los Angeles, and Arnold finally being turned into the robot he was always intended to be.This one sucks. The jokes aren't funny and they're self referential. The high-speed chases only pause for breath now and then. None of the characters convince, although Claire Danes is a decent actress with strong features a bit too fleshy to qualify as beautiful by Hollywood standards, one of the reasons I find her appealing. And, as I say, she can act too, as she did in Coppola's "The Rain Maker." But she has no more of a chance here than any of the other performers, maybe less because her character has been shoehorned into the plot.The explosions are bigger and better. And why not? As Mies Van Der Rohe said, "More is more; and MORE is more and more."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Connor (Nick Stahl) is an young man riding his motorcycle without destiny. He has an accident in the road and reaches Katherine Brewster`s (Claire Danes) veterinary clinic, trying to get some medicine for his wounded leg. Meanwhile, a female terminator, called T-X or Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), is chasing John as primary target and the other future members of the human resistance. Another T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is programmed by Kate in the future to protect John and is sent back to the present days. John and Kate, supported by the T-101, try to avoid the attack of the machines, shutting-down the computer network in an isolated mountain. Only today I have watched this movie. I really believed that it would not be worthwhile, but indeed it is a great sequel. I was afraid that this third part of this excellent story could be as terrible as the sequences of Matrix are, but using state-of-art special effects, lots of action scenes and a good story, it is an excellent entertainment. The fans of Terminator movies will not be disappointed. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `O Exterminador do Futuro 3: A Rebeli?o das Máquinas' (`The Terminator From the Future 3: The Rebellion of the Machines')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator 3 (2003) *** 1/2 (out of 4) With Judgment Day looming, another Terminator (again played by Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) who is now a pill taking junkie. The two must also protect another woman (Claire Danes) from a new form of killer in the T-X. This third film in the series gets mostly mixed reviews but I found it to be the perfect way to end the original series and a great way to start up the battle of the future. The movie has some flaws in it but overall this is everything a summer blockbuster should be. We get some nice characters, good laughs and plenty of non-stop action but we also get a good story thrown in as well. I do think the story is a step down from the previous film but then again so is everything in this movie. It certainly doesn't live up to the previous film but not too many can so that's not a reason to bash this one. In terms of action this thing is a homerun as we get one great sequence after another. The highlight of the movie has to be the crane sequence where Schwarzenegger gets attached to it and they make for some great damage. This entire sequence is jaw dropping and really packs a terrific punch in terms of action. I also loved what they did with the ending. I certainly won't ruin what happens but I thought it was handled in a very good way and didn't pull any strings. The one flaw in the movie is Stahl and Danes. Both are fine actors and both are fine here but to me we needed people a little stronger or perhaps their characters should have just been written better. Schwarzenegger is in good form and has plenty of nice one-liners as well. I'm not sure if this will ever gain the classic status of the previous two films but it's a good way to end the original series and we'll just have to see what the future films, taking place in the future, holds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Type of Terminator ---86%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FIRST IMPRESSIONSI just couldnt imagine a better sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which is probably the best action movie of all time. But, after seeing T3: Rise of the Machines, I came to one conclusion: T2 and T3 are different types of movies. And T3 ends up on top.SUMMARYThe famous John Conner is all grown up now, and yes, you guessed it, is still being hunted down by robots sent from the future. But this time around, its no ordinary robot. The Terminatrix is far more superior in speed, strength and intelligence than John Conner's only chance for survival. Yes, the Terminator is back, but he has to protect not only John Conner, but also a mysterious young woman whose purpose throughout the war with the machines appears to be unknown.FUN FACTOR: 95%This movie is one fun thing to watch. Probably the most exciting movie to watch this year, and that includes The Matrix: Reloaded. Every scene in this action masterpiece, even the dramatic scenes, is vividly interesting. I remember when I was watching this movie in the theater, and halfway through I dropped my hot dog on my shirt. And it was nasty, all this relish and onion and ketchup all over. But, I didn't really care; I just kept on watching. Maybe, I'm just crazy.ACTING: 85%Well, lets start with none other than The Terminator. With a far greater arsenal of humorous lines and actions (the reoccurring scenes with the sunglasses), the Terminator's "personality" is far more expressed in this film than in the previous two. And the new additions of Claire Danes and Nick Stahl efficiently make up for the missing Linda Hamilton. The T-X (Terminatrix) shows as much emotion as she can, which is not much. But, hey, she's a killing robot. Still, overall, decent acting by the main stars, and great improvement by Arnold in the comedy department.STORY: 80 %What made the first two installments classics was the storyline. Its intricate plot, full of twists of time travel effects, the first two movies were not only action movies, but thrillers. And, this element is what lacks in T3. Now, this is such a bad thing. T3 just happens to be more of an action movie. The movie had some elements of time travel and the future war here and there, but not as much as the first two. Still, the end of the movie (I'm not going to give anything away) left me with a bunch of questions. And thats a good thing. A really good thing.DIRECTION: 85%When I found out that James Cameron was not going to do the upcoming Terminator, I thought this is going to be a blowout. But it wasnt. Jonathan Mostow took the job, and made an excellent movie. I have to admit, T3 has a totally different look from the last two. While the first two were darker, T3 is more explosion. Its mainly because T-1000, equipped with only his hands and the shapes they can become, relies more on stealth and close combat. With that type of enemy, the atmosphere of the movie must always be dark. In T3, however, the T-X relies on guns and, therefore, at-a-distance type combat. That creates more explosions and less blood. That's another thing, T3 is not even close to being as violent as the first two. To sum up, T3 has a lighter look compared to its predecessors, but is still successful in this transition.FINAL IMPRESSION: ---86%With an excellent cast of characters, breathtaking action scenes, and a little bit of fresh humor added in, T3 is, undoubtedly, a worthy addition to a classic series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a sequel was going to be made, then it should have had the same director as the first two, James Cameron, then maybe it would have been better than this attempt by Jonathan Mostow. Basically John Connor (Nick Stahl) has spent years hiding himself away from Skynet, no phone, no address and no destination. So instead of trying to find and kill him, the new advanced (female looking) villain machine, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) comes from 2029 to 2003 to kill his Connor's future commanders. She does eventually find Connot though, when after he broke into a pet store, run by Katherine 'Kate' Brewster (Romeo + Juliet's Claire Danes), she finds his blood (on a bandage), and she now on his hunt. Terminator also finds him and they are now on the run from the T-X. They do stop to Sarah Connor's grave (died of disease), but it is not her body, but a mound of guns. The Terminator tells them that they have to escape the blast of the nuclear missiles, which strike soon, and this will begin Judgement Day (which was only postponed), but John insists that they get to the place where Skynet will operate and take over, where Kate's father, Robert Brewster (David Andrews) is trying to stop it. In the end, after escaping the rampaging/attacking machines, and after the Terminator and T-X die together, John and Kate realise that they were not meant to stop Judgement Day, only to survive it in Crystal Peak. Also starring Mark Famiglietti as Scott Petersen and Earl Boen as a brief Dr. Peter Silberman. It is not brilliant like the other two, it is just an excuse for some giggles, the same stuff we've seen before with a few cool moments, and only Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as another good Terminator and the special effects are impressive. Worth watching!</fullReview>
