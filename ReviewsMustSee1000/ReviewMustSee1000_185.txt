		<shortDescription>A biased but beautiful documentary about a brilliant mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One never knows what to expect out of rock films. Going into Tupac: Resurrection, I half expected another mediocre blaxploitation groaner. The other half expected a gushy MTVish drool-fest out to promote the soundtrack artists, including current corporate media darling 50 Cent.Resurrection is neither. The producer is not some slick Hollywood mogul with no understanding of rap except as a source for making a quick buck. Instead, Afeni Shakur, the late rapper's mother, takes charge. As both executive producer and the dominant force in her son's short life, her personal agenda impacts every frame. Like all documentaries, this is an extremely one-sided account, and it is likely due to her input that the movie downplays the darker aspects of Pac's self-destructive downward spiral after his move to Death Row Records. Nor is the film harsh enough on Tupac's seemingly endless capacity for paranoia and irresponsibility.Fortunately, she also makes the crucial decision not to dwell on more tired hash-rehash of so called East Coast/West Coast rap war, which the movie clarifies as less of a reality than a media event. Nor does it choose to linger on the numerous rumors and conspiracies surrounding Tupac's murder.Shakur and director Lauren Lazin wisely decide to let Tupac's voice carry the film. Lazin wisely refrains from using the masterful, propagandistic gimmicks of a Michael Moore documentary. There are no distracting interviews or massively-edited montages. As a result, the movie has a lyrical, sacred tone. History has mystified Pac as a martyr for West Coast gangsta rap, although during his lifetime he only released one such album. Few choose to remember that Death Row was the twilight of his life, that he spent the first half-decade of his career recording in the East where he grew up. It is here that the film takes its cue.Resurrection lays bare a magnetic, arrogant, charismatic spirit that immediately affirms why Pac remains one of rap's only true megastars. Though the film is not hard enough on how his growing obstinacy may have hastened his demise, it does not shy away from the controversy, the premonitions of death, the sex abuse conviction, and the inflated ego. The result is a well-drawn sketch of man aware of his genius but haunted by demons, a tortured soul navigating a realm more thuggish than he was at his core, a contradiction which plays as a general commentary on rap's manufactured images.This movie's production value alone easily outclasses nearly every other cinematic work that has ever pretended to be about hip-hop. It bears little resemblance to How High or Belly or to the shameless self-promotion of the vanity project 8 Mile, which was so sanitized as to kill any revelations it might have made about its star Eminem, the most high profile rapper to yet arise. I don't understand how someone could praise 8 Mile for its beauty and honesty (it isn't) and then criticize this film.By contrast, the sincerity of Resurrection solidifies Pac's reputation as `the only rapper that matters.' It shows why he is peerless and maybe the greatest artist the genre has yet produced: whatever can be said about his music, as an intelligent personality there is simply no one else in his class. He is so much more painfully relevant than all star rappers, and the sharpness of his observations on everything from politics to poverty leaves dust in the eyes of all his contemporaries. He represents a paradigm that has become all-too-rare in a musical form now dominated by cartoon images: a constructive rather than destructive point-of-view.A ball of contradictions, Tupac is finally much more complex and brilliant than most people would expect. People are uninformed and uninterested in hip-hop probably will get little out of this movie. Those who know will realize that the biggest tragedy is that not that Tupac died before reaching his full potential, but that other young black men with similar sensibilities rarely reach his level of visibility. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and tragic (***1/2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Tupac Shakur is one of the most intriguing, fascinating personalities in pop music history. He is made up of a seemingly endless list of contradictions: ruffian / nice guy, obnoxiously arrogant / sweetly humble, hedonist / activist, "gangsta" / poet. And most interesting is that none of these "sides" of him seem at all false. He really is that complicated.Being a fan of his, especially his acting, ("GRIDLOCK'd" is one of my favorite movies) I choose to remember the admirable parts of his personality more often, but I know that he was no angel, and I'm glad that "Tupac: Resurrection" doesn't try to paint him as a hero.Made very much in the style of last year's great documentary "The Kid Stays In The Picture" (so much so that I was surprised there is no connection), it combines seamlessly edited footage, photos that "float" around to look 3-dimensional, well-chosen music, and fluid narration to create a dreamlike and slightly eerie portrait of one person's lifetime in his own words.Unlike "The Kid Stays In The Picture", though, in "Tupac: Resurrection" the narrator telling his life story is dead.Tupac is the one and only narrator of this film (through an edited collection of insightful interviews), and it's a distinctly poignant and eerie experience to hear it, almost like he is, "Sunset Boulevard"-style, telling you his story from beyond the grave. Adding to the "Sunset Boulevard" feeling is that the story starts in Las Vegas where he was killed, and then rewinds to the beginning of his life. But sadly, you know it's eventually going to end up in Las Vegas again.This is an extremely well done, gripping documentary that I highly recommend even to people who don't care for rap music. Tupac's life story is a true American tragedy, and anyone can learn from those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will tempt you to think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie kind of hesitant. A lot of albums have been put out after 2pacs death and all this and it seems like everyone just wants to make a quick dime off of him. Suge Knight more than anyone. But when i heard that 2pacs own mother had put this movie together I wanted to see it. So some friends of mine and I went to it. I've seen a lot of documentaries because a lot of documentaries interest me and though i completely disagreed with Bowling for Columbine it was interesting to watch. This documentary by far takes the cake. This movie was one of the deepest most heartfelt documentaries...wait i mean MOVIES ive ever seen. 2pac takes you through his life and what he's down and though it dragged a little in the beginning as he tells you about himself as a boy it picks up nicely as you're going through and you just can't help but think this man was pure genius. This movie is worth watching. Take a date, take your mom, take your dad, take your friends...take your kid sister. The message isnt about violence. Out of 4 stars I give it 3 3/4 . Beautiful Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary shows everything about 2pac's life, you can really dive into his character and see how complex he is. His accomplishments during a period of 6 years (pretty much) is really inspirational. He isn't a hero, or he at least didnt have enough time to transform into one, but I think the message was quite clear: Give (black) people a chance and they can do great things. That's pretty much what this movie is about and it can be enjoyed on many levels by different races simply because of - struggle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I am biased, I think the world of Tupac. That said, this is his (and his mother's) mission statement for his life and death and everything in between. I have followed 'Pac for almost 10 years now, and my obsession for him has only grown deeper and deeper as the years, months, even days have passed since his departure from the music game.When I first heard about this film, I thought it was going to be another video release accounting his legacy and mystery. I had no idea that it had a theatrical release date until a few months ago. Then I started hearing the hype behind it, and really started to anticipate it strongly. I informed all my friends and anyone else who shared the same passion of 'Pac as I, of it's existence and when it was close to release. After reading some very positive advance reviews from "Rolling Stone" and a few other publications, my anxiety only increased. It hits it's peak when I saw that ROGER EBERT gave it 3 1/2 out of a possible 4 stars. I saw the film tonight at an 8:00 showing fully prepared sportin' my 'Pac t shirt, ticket stub in my hand, and an unmistakable grin of happiness of things to come. One word: OUTSTANDING. Afeni, Mtv, and Paramount were really, really, really seriously devoted to this project!I don't want give anything at all away to either serious 2pac devotees or casual fans, but EVERYTHING you ever needed to know, or wanted to know about him, is presented in ACES. I rated this documentary a 9 out of 10 stars on the Imdb scale. To sum up, I really and truly believe it is an enormous shame that some people just don't understand or "get" how iconic and influential Tupac was on both the music industry and to a certain extent society as well. He was WAY, WAY more than just a "rapper", he was an IMPACT!2PAC FOR EVER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally...a documentary that does slain rapper justice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's about time that a documentary about slain rapper Tupac Shakur such as this be released. I've seen a number of other documentaries based on the Shakur's life and they make me sick. For one thing, those films make him out to be some sort of prophet or messiah, feeding into the myth that that's exactly who he was. However, by allowing Tupac to tell his own story, both his fans and detractors alike can finally get a glimpse of who this man truly was as a person. In this film, from Tupac's very own words, Tupac is not made out to be the monster that some people would like to easily dismiss him as but but he is also not portrayed as a saint, nor are his many troubles with the law ignored. From this movie, the clear conclusion is that Tupac Shakur was ultimately a good, well-meaning person whose flawed philosophies and poor choices in the people he chose to surround himself with ultimately lead to his destruction. However, through tenacity and hard work, he has become the bestselling hip hop artist in history, even from beyond the grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best documentaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary of Tupac Amaru Shakur's life was amazing. I am a huge Tupac fan and have seen many other stories and and biographies of his life, but this movie by far surpassed any expectations I had about it. Even if you are not a Tupac fan; you will still be amazed at the life he lived, grew up with, and his legacy. One of the film's strong parts is the fact that it really explains Tupac's mind and how he though about life. Not only that, but many people have a misconception that Tupac Shakur was just a "gangstar" that ran the streets and made music; and this film shows that he was not all bad and that he had a more sensitive side to his life and music. Overall the film captured a lot of his life through his eyes. The film isnt about his friends and family getting interviewed and recalling facts.....It's real interviews of him in the studio, in court, on MTV, personal interviews, and live accounts of him being him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>compelling look into a man's life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangsta' Rap artist Tupac Shakur was gunned down on the streets of Las Vegas in 1996, the end result of the life he led and the people he knew. He was 25. The documentary 'Tupac: Resurrection' takes an unusual and interesting approach to its subject, allowing the deceased singer to speak to us, as it were, directly from the grave. The film begins with him commenting on his own murder, then tracing back over the events of his life as a means of both setting the record straight and trying to make some sense out of all that happened to him in his very brief time here on earth.The film, directed by Lauren Lazin, relies primarily on interviews Tupac gave throughout his short career, supplemented with some additional commentary from those who knew him best. Though he became a lightning rod of controversy due to both his criminal activities and his provocative (i.e. violent, sexist) lyrics, Tupac saw himself more as a 'voice of the people,' using his music as a vehicle for reaching out to and connecting with the downtrodden, impoverished blacks living in the kinds of ghettoes from which he himself sprang. However, even many well-known black leaders and spokespersons had trouble accepting Tupac's rather rose-colored definition of himself. What's most interesting about 'Tupac: Resurrection' is the dichotomy it establishes between the violence, drug use and criminal activities which played so prominent a part in Tupac's life, and the genial, reflective, almost apologetic tone of so much of what we hear him saying. It's hard to know just how much of what has found its way into this film is really raw truth and how much is sugarcoated revisionism designed to 'resurrect' and burnish a man's posthumous image and reputation. His views on women come out particularly incoherent and unresolved. Yet, 'Tupac: Resurrection' is an intriguing documentary because it gives us a glimpse not only into a strangely conflicted individual but also into the even more bizarre world of corporate thuggery he inhabited. Like many artists who have attempted to speak for the 'little people,' Tupac became a victim of his own success and celebrity, living the kind of pampered lifestyle that most of the people he was singing about would clearly never know. It's a conflict as old as art itself, and it is one that Tupac, for understandable reasons, was never able to resolve in his own life. Interestingly, however, his brutal death at the hands of murderous rivals, demonstrated that he never made it quite so far from his roots as his lavish lifestyle might otherwise have suggested.As a document, the film traces Tupac from his early years as the child of two Black Panther members ( a pedigree that, he believes, set him on the path to social crusader early on), through his youth in poverty, his exposure to literature and drama at a performing arts high school in Baltimore, his early attempts at performing, his meteoric rise in the music industry, his years as a controversial celebrity, his burgeoning film career, his continuing battles with police, the first attempt on his life, his conviction for rape, his time in prison, and, finally, to the rivalry between his own West Coast label, Death Row Records, and the East Coast label, Bad Boy Records, which ultimately led to his untimely death. For that little bit of history alone, the film is worth watching.As someone who knew very little about the life of Tupac - and even less about his music - before watching the movie, I found him to be both appealing and repellant, frightening and charismatic. The film leaves the audience feeling as conflicted as the subject - which is what a truly successful documentary should do after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie resurrected Tupac Shakur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie very much. The documentary summarized 2Pac's life. It's very informative and it educates us. You could learn a lot by watching this movie. I'm a big 2Pac fan. I've listened to his music, read his books, and watched, heard and read his interviews and speeches. He is a standout from all the other rappers I've seen and heard throughout the years. He is more than just a rapper. He is a poet, prophet, revolutionary, activist, actor, singer, intellectual, leader, orator, and artist. He is a man of many accomplishments. That's why many fans and rappers strive to be like him. But I don't think that we will ever see another one like 2Pac. There is only one 2Pac. He was so different from the rest of us. It's a shame that he was taken from this world at such a young age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good documentary .. it gave me an inside closer look to a world I don't know much of. I've heard some stories about Tupac .. some myths too in my high school but I wasn't 100% convinced and sounded just like lies.I'm not a big fan of rap. I heard some songs of Tupac, though. I don't remember his songs but I remember that I didn't like them due to the foul language with all the swearing and the excessive use of the "F" WORD!.Anyway, that didn't mean that his life story wasn't interesting .. the movie showed me briefly the life of a controversial young man who's music was popular in many places of the world .. I'm amazed of how frank Tupac is and that he has such courage to tell his stories publicly.Good documentary..entertaining, brief and goes right to the point!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't listen to rap. The only thing I knew about Tupac Shakur before I saw this movie is that he had been shot a few years ago. After seeing this movie, I understand that Tupac had a life worth making a documentary about, but I did not like the approach the filmmakers took. I really wanted to like this movie. Parts of it were really well done, but it was so biased that I cannot honestly recommend it. It was more like a commercial for Tupac's image than a documentary on his life.Its amazing how many interviews Tupac gave in his life. We can see that he was an intelligent and affective storyteller. However, a person's life cannot be understood just by the way that person sees him or herself. A person's life also needs to be judged by other people's points of views. This could have been a great film if only the filmmakers had shown interviews with important people in Tupac's life such as his mother, his sister, his teachers in school, the artists he rapped with, his producers, etc. It was also a little difficult for a person unacquainted with Tupac's life and the world of gangsta rap music to fully understand the time line in which these events occurred.I liked the visual style of the film though (especially that 3D effect a lot of the photographs had). Those helicopter shots in Las Vegas and of the Golden Gate Bridge were beautiful too. Overall, TUPAC: RESURRECTION is a flawed film that had a lot of potential.My grade:5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very fitting documentary, perfectly created.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tupac was certainly a controversial artist, he was seen it two lights - the gangster, thug &amp; by other was seen as a humble guy, a poet and an leader in the black community.I am a huge fan of Tupac's music and 90's rap generally so I naturally could not wait to see this film. Since watching it when it was first released over 10 years ago, I have now seen it probably well over 20 times.This documentary takes you through Tupac's life, from his days as a child growing up in poverty to his final days when he was shot. It is told in his own words, using his own voice. All his old interviews have been edited and put in an order in which this story can be told, it is done so well that you would not even think that it was done this way. His mother (who created this film) did an absolutely fantastic job.As this is created by his mother, she has all the rights to his music, interviews, photos, poems etc. The way the whole feature was put together is hard to believe that Tupac had no impact in the making of it, it is truly outstanding.I don't want to say anything too much as I don't want to give anything away, just go and see it! You don't have to be a massive Tupac fan, or even a massive hip-hop fan to appreciate this. A successful documentary will show you the whole story and more importantly both sides to a story, the ups and downs and all the controversy, which is exactly what this documentary does. Outstanding.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all circumvents to "I don't give a f***" versus "Give me liberty or give me death"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tupac: Resurrection is made such a compelling documentary because rather than a documentarian detail the life, motives, and opinions of the late rap icon Tupac Shakur, old interview compilations, poetry excerpts, excerpts taken from Shakur's colorful music, and much more are played in order for him to tell his own life story despite no longer being with us. This provides for one of the most personal documentaries I have yet to see, especially considering that it would've been much easier to hire a narrator to analyze Shakur's upbringing, rise to fame, untold controversy, and his untimely death in 1996.When Shakur died, he left us with a plethora of content, some of which had been released, some of which would later see a release on his label Death Row Records. Tupac: Resurrection even contains some seldom-heard music from the man himself, and even emphasizes on Shakur's handwritten poetry, which describes his mother, who was a devoted Black Panther, and his father - whom he didn't know until later in his life - who was also an activist for African-Americans. Growing up in an unstable home, where violence was prominent and alternate living conditions were difficult to arrange, Shakur would often emulate the behavior of characters on sitcoms like Different Strokes, which revolved around a big, happy family - something Shakur craved.Shakur had the fortunate circumstance of being exposed to the arts and the theater when we was very young, and read and admired William Shakespeare throughout his entire life. He recognized his good fortune by seeing others in his neighborhood not even know who he was talking about when he would try to hold a conversation with them on plays, art, theater, or what-have-you. After leaving his mom's house as a teenager, Shakur looked to role models on the streets, which helped build the Shakur we know today.The film shows Tupac as a commanding, rugged philosopher, who would always emphasize the word "thug" and his personal motto "thug life." However, the way he defined "thug" was much different than the contemporary dictionary definition of the world. Shakur states that a "thug," in his mind, is a prideful underdog - somebody who has nothing but still holds their head up and works to make something. "What's the difference between me saying, 'I don't give a f***?' and Patrick Henry saying, 'Give me liberty or give me death?,' Shakur asks.Directly after the scenes where Shakur is defining "thug" show Shakur working in efforts to bring the East Coast/West Coast sides of the rap game together in a social gathering that served as a truce in the nineties. Shakur stands tall on stage, rapping his heart out, before imploring the people at the gathering to stop the violence and he'll continue to organize benefit concerts as a token for his appreciation.When Shakur explains his music, however, is when he can be a deeply contradictory figure. Despite his music both equal parts powerful and empowering, Shakur's actual music and his explanations and analysis of his music frequently seemed to come at a crossroads. This isn't as big of an issue as it may seem. Shakur, despite being rugged, tough, and thuggish (the word is employed here with his definition in mind), he was also incredibly vulnerable, and his explanations of his work reflect a more sentimental or compassionate side of him that may or may not have been an afterthought. Regardless, even his perspective on certain issues makes one think more than the average rapper today. In one scene, Shakur tells us that the only reason the Vietnam War ended was because we saw the horror that took place over there; with other wars, we kind of just assumed people were dying in a beautiful, civil way When the time comes for Shakur's brief but significant career as an actor to be discussed, one can see that through his methods of preparation and focus when portraying another character that Shakur was nothing other than a method actor, or somebody that invests in and studies their character for an ample amount of time in order to perfect a role. From his memorably gritty performance as the main antagonist in the street-drama Juice to the sweeter, softer side of him shown in the film Poetic Justice, Shakur demonstrated a diverse, character-actor mentality despite being so young and impressionable in the industry.Finally, Tupac: Resurrection looks at the controversy Shakur endured, not in the form of concerned politicians and talking heads in terms of what music their children were listening to, but how Shakur found himself wrapped up in several sexual assault cases, all of which he vehemently denied. With the aura Shakur had created about himself through his music and ideas, he proved that while you can be one of the smartest thinkers in a dangerous industry, you're still part of a very dangerous industry, which only further proved true as Shakur was shot and killed in Las Vegas in September 1996 in a drive-by shooting.Tupac: Resurrection is a fantastic display of documentary filmmaking by director Lauren Lazin, who allows Shakur to discuss ideas and topics "in his own words," so the film's tagline goes, and provide us access to a great deal of exceptional content from the man himself. It is one of the strongest, most powerful music documentaries i have yet to see.Directed by Lauren Lazin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say i thought it was very interesting to see this movie. I've only ever been a fan of 2Pac's music but have never taken my time to look at his life. As he said in the end of this movie "There is a Tupac in everyone" He did reach that spot in me. But I wonder if his killing will ever be solved. My guess is still Orlando Anderson. And now i really see what his contrubution has been to the world of music an discrimination. I wonder what have happened if his 3 albums where released while being alive. And if the rumors about Suge Knight had part in the plan of killing Tupac. But the next question about this man for me is would he still be famous in his world of music in the generation of music in 2006. One thing is a fact Tupac Shakur is a legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great summary of Tupac's life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching almost everything related to Tupac Shakur and his life and learning by heart all his CD's I was more than excited when I sat down with my girlfriend ready to watch a documentary about the myth - this one made in co-operation with Afeni Shakur (Tupac's mom). Since Afeni Shakur has the rights to Tupac's work this movie is filled with Tupac's music which obviously is a great benefit - compared to "Biggie and Tupac" and "Thug Angel". This movie goes into the background of Tupac and describes how a young black male came up through hard situations that sculpted his mind. There isn't a big focus on his actual murder and no theories are presented about his death but the '95 shooting is described a little bit. If you are interested in Tupac and his life this movie is both informative and entertaining. I also have to recommend "Thug Angel", "Biggie and Tupac" and other films about Tupac to better understand some events and things in his short but remarkable life. Respect to Tupac, the best rapper ever. R.I.P.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting portrayal of the man and his struggle (if not somewhat biased)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Tupac. Usually when rappers appear in movies they end up catastrophic (minus Friday and Boyz N The Hood) but considering there was little script and movie acting, I gave this a try. There is no doubt that Tupac was always a very intellectual and talented individual, and though he didn't piece this together, it was an interesting and thoughtful way of looking at "Thug Life".Though there should be no excuses for any violence and such demeaning phrases used towards women, Tupac uses a relatively unseen and very interesting viewpoint. "I rap about graphic violence the for the same reason people make war movies," he states. "I'm trying to make a point. Trying to show people what the ghetto is like in reality and how not to fall into that trap." Though it sounds a little contrived, interesting viewpoints like this appear throughout the movie, and we see a lighter side to the gun toting man we're all used to hearing about. He in fact was shy, and wrote poetry. One main message is blatant and cleverly true: never judge a book by its cover.However, the film has its weaknesses; it, though having no real voice-over apart from the man itself, seems rather biased. Apart from that, it is a thoughtful and interesting account of the hardship Tupac Sukur endured, which ultimately cost him his life.Final Summary: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for fans, all others beware.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll preface this by saying that I was not a fan of rapper Tupac Shakur when he was alive. His death (and, yes, I DO believe he is dead) hasn't done anything to make me fall in love with his work. The documentary TUPAC RESURRECTION attempts to shed some light on the young artist . The movie was produced by his mother in connection with MTV Films. The format used for telling his story is unique: Shakur is shown in various interviews telling his tale while incidents from his life are shown. Starting with his childhood in New York, born to a woman who was in the Black Panther movement. He and his family then moved to Baltimore where Shakur was enrolled in a performing arts school where he took ballet and acting lessons. Kind of a bizarre beginning for one who would become one of the leading voices in rap. Not only that, but one who seemed to embrace the violent "Thug Life" that he spoke of in his songs and had tattooed on his body. RESURRECTION follows Tupac from the Bronx, Baltimore, onto the West Coast where he began to really gain attention. Both for his music and movies as well as his run-ins with the law. As he put it "I didn't start to sell records until I had a record". Shakur claims that he was providing the voice for all of those who were in poverty and couldn't make their voices heard. All well and good, but why the violence directed at other people who were in the same boat as he was as opposed to the people in power? There is a segment where he makes known his dislike for such artists as Spike Lee, Eddie Murphy and the Hughes brothers (he was arrested for an assault on them, a fact that he did not deny), feeling that they are sell-outs and cowardly. Needless to say, Shakur's outspokenness makes him a target from both authority figures and his peers. Of course, it is believed that that in-your-face attitude was what got him shot twice in separate incidents. Most of what is shown in RESURRECTION I already knew from what people had told me and what I've read. The movie didn't shed any new light on him. My guess is that this movie is already preaching to the converted and will be a hit amongst them. All others, like me, will still be out in the cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Documentary--A Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even after his untimely death in 1996,Tupac Shakur is still cranking out hit gangsta tunes from the grave. Yes,he maybe gone from here,but still is kicking strong within the hood. This was a brilliant and excellent documentary features footage from interviews and special material about the man who would become one of the most influential rappers of all time,the one and only 2PAC. From his earliest beginnigs with his parents,who were members of the notorious Black Panther movement of the 1960's and 1970's to his childhood days growing up in parts of New York to moving to Baltimore to attend the famous Baltimore School For The Performing Arts and from there to the West Coast areas of Oakland where he would established himself within the hood as sometimes controversial,loud and proud and speaking what was on his mind about the people,the society and most of all the music industry itself that was very corrupt and distasteful. The film goes on to the times where he was on top of the throne to the rise and fall of his own empire.However,his held his own towards the troubles in his life and furthermore the trials and tribulations that would follow from the celebrities he would have encounters with including some with Arnesio Hall,Eddie Murphy,Spike Lee,The Hughes Brothers,and the final confrontation the would end his life with the East Coast/West Coast feud with rivals Biggie Smalls,P.Diddy,and mostly the head of Death Row Records Suge Knight. This film was of the best documentaries I've seen in a long while and it really kept me in tune to a individual who was not just about rapping about the thug life of drugs,guns,violence and women,but he was a poet/activist,and actor in his own right--a man whose thoughts about society as an a black man living in America and how the black man is mistreated is something to see,since 2PAC was large and had fans worldwide. The documentary is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When in his own words, wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a "Hip Hop" fanatic but I must admit that I liked this movie a lot. Tupac was a man with a charasmatic personality and a certain charm that really is apparent in this film. But it is eerie watching a someone narrating a movie as if he had already been killed. The last Hip Hop movie I saw was the dissapointing "8 mile". Prior to that "Welcome to Death Row" which I liked a lot. But Tupac Resurrection was the best. It's sad to think that we lost one so gifted so early in his life. Even those who are not Rap fans are likely to be moved by this film and even those who are not rap fans are likely to be moved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Tupac :Resurrection" gave me a little more insight into the mind of a gifted and at times troubled artist. However, the film felt less like a documentary and more like a compilation of most of the material that I had already seen on MTV and VH1. The problem is that the director fails to create a theme. The overuse of aerial "pretty" shots of sand dunes, Las Vegas and the clouds become less reflective and in short repetitive. Overall, as a Tupac fan I enjoyed listening to him and seeing his life given the attention it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Year!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and it was great! It didn't depict Tupac in a goody two shoes way but it did show me what I've always known, That Pac was the Mutherfreakin truth!!! He told us during the film that he makes mistakes. And sometimes his mouth is too big and that he can sometimes be arrogant. However, the good parts about him seem to outweigh the bad ones. And he really got to talk about being a Gemini and how we have two sides to us. A lot of folks don't understand Gemini's and think we're complex.Although I got to see it for free last night i'm definately going to go back to support it when it hits theaters on Friday. It told me a lot of stuff about Pac and even about the Biggie situation that you would have never known if you left it up to VH1, MTV, or even BET. I recommend you go and check this out if you're a fan or even if you are interested in seeing an intelligent person speak. This was the best movie I've seen all year long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2pac along with Biggie was the main reason why I started listening to Rap. Not only did he have good music, but he also had a story to tell and it influences not only his fans, but other rap artists. This documentary was very interesting to watch and I was amased to see what a strong minded man he was, which is why I respect so even more after seeing this masterpiece. Eminem, 50 cent, Jada Pinkett smith and Snoop Dogg are one of the few that have expressed their feelings towards his death. It was a tragic moment that is defenately not forgotten, but he has left us more music that gives most of us the impression that he is still alive. From his childhood memories to his career, he explains it all in his own words. This is no doubt one of the best documentaries ever to be released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great documented tale of one of my personal icons!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tupac Resurrection is a great documentary about a man who probably experienced more pain in his life than any Hip hop artist or any famous person in the world. The film gives us everything you ever wanted to know about the man himself from the stories behind his poetic music, his childhood and growing up in violent ghettos with his mother (Afeni Shakur who was a well known crack addict)and to his times on Death Row records which set the spark to the Tupac/Biggie feud. What i like most about this film though is how the narration is actually done by Tupac himself! that makes it very realistic and quite spooky in a way,especially since nothing like that has ever been done before in a documentary. Obviously to be into a film like this you might have to be into a bit of rap music and be familiar with Tupac, But if not it does not matter because the film is just a too good story to miss. The soundtrack is also hot, featuring 'Runnin' (dying to live) a song with both Biggie and Tupac recorded while both men were alive which was never released until now and a couple of other great Tupac hits only now released. Altogether i loved this film an easy 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tupac Resurrection is a MUST SEE. Regardless if you know who Tupac is or not, this film gives a deep and interesting perspective on the life of Tupac. A TRULY GREAT Portrayal OF A LEGENDARY FIGURE. This documentary/film looks at how Tupac was brought up and how his life has changed many. It is all explained in Tupac's own words, which helps add to the feel of the film. In many ways the autobiography he never got to write, Tupac: Resurrection features the artist in his own words, examining his complicated life and the controversial decisions that plagued him while he was alive. Tupac: Resurrection captures, as never before, his boundless passion, searing honesty, and stunning intelligence, and showcases a range of never-before-seen writings, letters, screenplay ideas, lyrics, poems, photographs, and personal effects, and stands as an indelible testament to the artist's astonishing cultural legacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witness the resurrection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to AMG.com, "2Pac became the unlikely martyr of gangsta rap, and a tragic symbol of the toll its lifestyle exacted on urban black America. At the outset of his career, it didn't appear that he would emerge as one of the definitive rappers of the '90s ? he started out as a second-string rapper and dancer for Digital Underground, joining only after they had already landed their biggest hit."This 2003 documentary film, "Tupac: Resurrection," directed by Lauren Lazin, is about the life of slain rap artist Tupac Amaru Shakur, and is both a testament to his career and legacy and is also an insightful look into 2Pac, the man behind the controversy.There's no question of the impact of 2Pac's legacy on rap music, and all of music in general. He's sold almost as much posthumous material as Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix combined. As a fan of the hip-hop culture and rap music, I have nothing but love for 2Pac, even though my greatest admiration of him has always been his music and his message, never his media-exaggerated persona and seemingly contradictory philosophies.But at the same time, it's very distressing for me to realize that he is best remembered for his death, much rather than his life and achievements, such as his "Thug Life" code and "One Nation" project, which was aimed at squashing East/West beef and curiously enough still hasn't gotten off the ground."Thug Life" and Black Panther political rhetoric were his signature. His "don't-give-a-f**k" attitude permeated his early rap career on records like "2pacalypse Now" (1991) and "Strictly For My N.I.G.G.A.Z." (1993), all of this following his brief stint with rap/"P"-funk heroes Digital Underground. His black militancy stance did of course catch the furor of every moral-minded politician in America, as he did also join the ranks of every other rap artist who came under fire by the anti-rap circles active in this country.Even after seeing this film, I'm reaffirmed in my beliefs about 2Pac's depth and message as an artist. He was one of the most gifted rappers that the industry has and ever will see. His performances in films like "Juice" (1992) and "Above the Rim" (1994) were thematically deep, intense, and incredibly "real," almost too real for some people to handle.Of course, 2Pac and his friend, the Notorious B.I.G., had beef, put their respective coasts on the map, and were both killed seven months apart from another - 2Pac died on September 13, 1996 (the day after my 11th birthday that year), six days after being wounded in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting; the Notorious B.I.G. was killed in a Los Angeles drive-by on March 9, 1997. Both men came to be recognized in subsequent years as the tragic symbols of the East Coast/West Coast rivalries between artists and a lesson to future generations about not just mo' money and mo' problems, but the entire industry as well.They both died so other artists could continue in hip-hop. I can recall television interviews from the time with other prominent rap artists, such as Nas, or Lord Jamar of Brand Nubian, both of whom seemed hardly overcome with any kind of grief over the murder of 2Pac, but were lamenting the fact that people were now idolizing him because of the fact he was dead.Lazin's film offers some careful and thoughtful insight into the slain rapper's revolutionary and troubled life, from being born a month after his mother, former Black Panther Afeni Shakur, was released from jail after having to face a laundry list of bogus conspiracy charges, to his impoverished upbringing, his rap and film careers, and finally his death and resurrection, as 2Pac himself narrates his own story from beyond the grave.2Pac wasn't perfect and I think that was something he frequently acknowledged and this film, using hours of archive footage and his songs, allows for the audience to see the different sides to his personality. Even in today's world of 2005, I'm still a bit angry with him because of the so many mistakes that he made, and letting his ego and emotions get the better of him especially when he seemed to know better.He made a number of contradictory statements in his songs and image, and committed a number of harmful actions against himself and others, many of which may or may not have played into his death. For me, it was his getting involved with Marion "Suge" Knight, Death Row Records, and the whole East/West rivalries that brought about his downfall, and 2Pac seemed to recognize that his own demise was imminent.Also, his frequent court troubles, like the alleged sexual sodomizing of a female fan in 1994 and his fight with the Hughes Brothers on the set of "Menace II Society" (1993), were also detrimental to his character and image. But again, I still respect 2Pac because he took the time out to acknowledge his mistakes and at least try to correct them.Lauren Lazin has directed a skillful and poignant film that lets its deceased subject matter speak for itself. The life of Tupac Amaru Shakur is an intense study of progress and change seen through the life of a revolutionary artist who tried his best to change himself and the troubled world that he lived in.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tupac Shakur ? most controversial person in the rap-game and music industryTUPAC RESURRECTION is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. There is a strong beginning, well-chosen music, interviews, good cuts, live-performances, an informative&amp;interesting contents and a good ending. What you see in this film is not just the faade; you are also allowed to look inside the house. You realize how he and his environment were and how he and his environment developed. Tupac tells his fascinating, astonishing and incredible life-story in his own words and voice.He was the king of rap, gangster, prophet, revolutionary, prisoner, actor, poet, "a Black Panther's child", America's most wanted and a victim of a drive-by-shooting.In his life, which lasted for just 25 years, he had many ups and downs and some people assume that he spent as much time in the music studio as in jail. As long as he lived he wanted to be the best rapper on earth and tried to support all Afro-Americans and thugs, especially those who lived in the ghettos. He used his popularity to shake the people and tried to make them aware of the cruel circumstances black people have to deal with in the ghettos. If I had the opportunity to meet this character it would be an honor and an exciting experience for me, because I have already read and heard so much about him ? good stuff as well as bad stuff. I would ask him if it was planned that the number seven was like a thread in his life and why he was that fascinated by Niccol? Machiavelli. In addition I might ask what specific ideas he had about society and if he thought that there was a way out of human's self-destruction. I would also tell him that I appreciate his work and his social commitment.He was one of the world's best, but not a lot of people saw this side. Most of them just saw the gangster and personified evil, but there was also the good, thoughtful and peaceful side, which wasn't seen by many people, especially not by a bunch of (white) politicians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The life of the rapper/actor/sex criminal Tupac Shakur - told in his own (beyond the grave) words.The very word MTV sends shivers down my spin. The initials could be used as a by-word for superficial with its enthusiasm for everything that is popular (however dumb or irresponsible) and its sense that its audience cannot really concentrate for very long.Boy, they must they have been shaking in their fashion casuals over asking people to keep watching for 90 minutes! However, fear not. They haven't done too badly and it is only the close involvement of his ex Black Panther/ex drug addict mother (Afem Shakur) that prevents a fair and even picture.While the film lingers over minor matters (pratting around to the camera, etc.) no independent comment is allowed when things turn nasty. Which they often do.The involvement of Madonna in his life is glossed over (legal problems?) --- one of the long line of plastic "bad boys" that got her all hot-and-wet before falling for some strange religion and the English countryside. She didn't even visit him in jail -- so this film says -- ha, that is women for you!(No.1 in the Billboard charts in a high security cell - now that is something!)I love the way dumb people justify themselves. Stupidity -- rationalisation -- stupidity -- rationalisation - round and round like a merry go round. How many rounds of this has a bullet robbed us of? God knows. At least he had an agenda (which is to make as much money and have as much fun as possible) -- which is something his blank-eyed hangers on lacked.The film tries to fit in as much of his music -- and that of others -- it can get away wit, although it stops short (thankfully) of his full soft porn pop videos.I love music and I love pop history and while rap ranks near enough bottom of my own personal league table -- some of it is OK. Usually the stuff with the wit to steal/sample classic pop. Tupac predicted his own death -- so they say over and over again here. Rather like a guy that spend a lot of time in a brothel fanning himself with money predicts that sooner or later he is going to be lead away to get laid...</fullReview>

Then another guy comparing Tupac to the religious founders of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism. Then we have Left Eye saying that she totally agrees with Tupac whom she said decided to die from his wounds because "obviously there is life after death". This goes on and on and on with catchy expressions, "you know what I mean?", linked to catchy expressions, "you know what I mean?", and linked to other catchy expressions, "you know what I mean?". No, I hardly know what you mean because all I hear is a bunch of words and concepts with no clarity.I think they were all high on something. This movie sucked so bad. I've watched a lot of documentaries and this is probably the worst ever. The sound quality is just bass, bass, and more bass; hello, if you don't have treble, the sound of speech just sounds like mumblings which is what happened here. I'm glad I saw it on DVD instead of actually paying money to see it in a theatre.</fullReview>
