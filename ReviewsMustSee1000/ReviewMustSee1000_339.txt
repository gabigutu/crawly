		<shortDescription>Underrated, but still not entirely realized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1946 film which starred Lana Turner and John Garfield is significantly better than its reputation. The script, adapted from James M. Cain's first novel, is by the award-winning playwright David Mamet, while the interesting and focused cinematography is by Sven Nykvist, who did so much exquisite work for Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. An excellent cast is led by Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, whose cute animal magnetism is well displayed. Bob Rafelson, who has to his directorial credit the acclaimed Five Easy Pieces (1970) and The King of Marvin Gardens (1972), both also starring Jack Nicholson, captures the raw animal sex that made Cain's novel so appealing (and shocking) to a depression-era readership and brings it up to date. Hollywood movies have gotten more violent and scatological since 1981, but they haven't gotten any sexier. This phenomenon is in part due to fears occasioned by the rise of AIDS encouraged by the usual blue stocking people. Don't see this movie if sex offends you.Lange is indeed sexy and more closely fits the part of a lower-middle class woman who married an older man, a café owner, for security than the stunning blonde bombshell Lana Turner, who was frankly a little too gorgeous for the part. John Colicos plays the café owner, Nick Papadakis, with clear fidelity to Cain's conception. In the 1946 production, the part was played by Cecil Kellaway, who was decidedly English; indeed they changed the character's name to Smith. Also changed in that production was the name of the lawyer Katz (to Keats). One wonders why. My guess is that in those days they were afraid of offending Greeks, on the one hand, and Jews on the other. Here Katz is played by Michael Lerner who really brings the character to life.Jack Nicholson's interpretation of Cain's antihero, an ex-con who beat up on the hated railway dicks while chasing any skirt that came his way, the kind of guy who acts out his basic desires in an amoral, animalistic way, was not entirely convincing, perhaps because Nicholson seems a little too sophisticated for the part. Yet, his performance may be the sort better judged by a later generation. I have seen him in so many films that I don't feel I can trust my judgment. My sense is that he's done better work, particularly in the two films mentioned above and also in Chinatown (1974), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and such later works as The Shining (1980) and Terms of Endearment (1983).The problem with bringing Postman successfully to the screen is two-fold. One, the underlying psychology, which so strongly appealed to Cain's depression-era readership, is not merely animalistic. More than that it reflects the economic conflict between the established haves, as represented by the greedy lawyers, the well-heeled insurance companies, the implacable court system and the simple-minded cops, and to a lesser degree by property owner Nick Papadakis himself, and the out of work victims of the depression, the have-nots, represented by Frank and Cora (who had to marry for security). Two--and this is where both cinematic productions failed--the film must be extremely fast-paced, almost exaggeratedly so, to properly capture the spirit and sense of the Cain novel. Frank and Cora are rushing headlong into tragedy and oblivion, and the pace of the film must reflect that. A true to the spirit adaptation would require a terse, stream-lined directorial style with an emphasis on blind passions unconsciously acted out, something novelist Cormac McCarthy might accomplish if he directed film. I think that Christopher Nolan, who directed the strikingly original Memento (2000) could do it.For further background on the novel and some speculation on why it was called "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (Cain's original, apt title was "Bar-B-Que") see my review at Amazon.com.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Postman is right, the second time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twice is nice. Hollywood had to try twice to get this story right. Lana Turner was beautiful in the 1946 version, but Jessica Lange was something to kill for opposite Jack Nicholson.Such raw sensuality would easily persuade a man to lose his very soul. Nicholson's part is certainly unscrupulous to begin with, but in Jessica Lange he finds a confederate with even less scruples. The legal loose ends that dangled in the earlier version are avoided this time with a more plausible chain of events... and the story ends when the story ought to end, instead of being dragged on.Wonderful character and situation development, intriguing and engaging, even when you know the story. Nice twists of the story from the Lana Turner and Italian ("Ossessione" 1943) versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie well worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I was quite impressed with Bob Rafelson's adaptation of the depression era novel, "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Jack Nicholson plays Frank, a vagabond who eventually falls in love with a sexy waitress named Cora,played by Jessica Lange, who reciprocates this love. However, there is one problem standing in the way: Cora is married, unhappily married, but married nonetheless.Aside from an intriguing story, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is a wonderfully put together film, as Rafelson does a splendid job delving into the characters and their relationships, as well as examining the problems associated with forbidden love. As a viewer, you truly feel the passion between Lange and Nicholson,(who both won academy award nominations), and you almost feel for their pain. In the 1930's women in America were at quite a different position than they are today. They were expected to stay with the husband no matter what the circumstances, as divorce was quite uncommon. Lange was very convincing as this trapped 30's woman who eventually broke free the only way she knew possible..I definitely recommend "The Postman Always Rings Twice" for any fan of entertaining and thought-provoking movies. Although the character development is not quite as extensive as some of Rafelson's early work, particularly the 1971 classic "Five Easy Pieces", the movie combines an intriguing screenplay with superb acting to make its own statement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grubby film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This novel adaptation was the second after a first movie in the 1940s. This one retains the period setting but ups the ante in terms of sexual content, featuring one of the most explicit sex scenes ever shown in a mainstream film which goes far further than any film before - or since.The plot is simple in the extreme: the wife of a Greek man who runs his own diner, bored and neglected by her husband, begins a torrid affair with a drifter her husband employs as his mechanic. From there on in, the story gradually develops in often fascinating ways as the two lovers realise that only one thing's stopping their happiness: her husband.The film is shot through with a grim and gritty emphasis, best realised by Nicholson's grubby mechanic. He's nobody's idea of a sex symbol, although Jessica Lange is quite ravishing as the object of his attentions. This focus on realism over Hollywood fantasy is what makes the film so watchable and, in places, uncomfortable as it becomes clear that the lovers have something of a sado-masochistic relationship.Things move into courtroom-drama territory later on (featuring some terrific acting work from Michael Lerner as the lawyer) whilst handing a number of blink-and-you'll-miss-em minor parts to familiar faces (John P. Ryan as a blackmailer, Angelica Houston as - bizarrely - a circus owner, cult favourite Don Calfa as a circus hand, Brion James as a thug and Christopher Lloyd as a salsman).I found the film to be sometimes compelling and never boring. It's one of those films you watch to find out just what happens to the central characters, a curiosity bolstered by the feeling that they're never going to unentangle themselves from this mess. Come the surprise climax, well...you'll have to see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an original remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1946 film, this version features Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, with a momentous white hot chemistry that can't possibly sustain itself but affords a memorable scene in the restaurant kitchen about ten minutes into the film which leads to the eventual plot to do in her older Greek husband. A story wherein neither would have the nerve to do such a thing alone, but together they make a job of it on one of the darkest nights and darkest rural roads ever. The trial for the murder features another couple of great performances by Michael Lerner as the resourceful to a fault defense attorney (if you were on trial for your life, you'd want this guy for a lawyer), and his investigator who becomes a menacing presence later in the film, played by John P Ryan. Very nicely photographed in color, it's set in the coastal hills and valleys north of LA, dotted with live oaks and capturing the rich earthy tones of the late afternoon golden hued hillsides that nicely contrast with the desperate story of the two lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw, Gritty &amp; Explicit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to understand how attractive it must have seemed to make a 1980s movie of "The Postman Always Rings Twice". James M Cain's famous depression-era melodrama had already been successful as a book (1934) and a movie (1946) and a 1980s version could obviously benefit from the advantages of being made in colour and at a time when censorship constraints would be far less strict than they had been in 1946. The result is a production in which this story of lust, adultery, murder, blackmail and "the hand of fate" is told in a style which is far more raw, gritty and explicit than the 1946 movie.Frank Chambers (Jack Nicholson) is a drifter who stops for a meal at a remote countryside diner / filling station somewhere outside L.A. and decides to stay a little longer after catching sight of the establishment's attractive cook called Cora (Jessica Lange). Cora's the wife of Nick (John Colicos) who's the considerably older Greek proprietor of the business. Nick offers Frank a job as a mechanic and soon Cora and Frank are involved in a passionate affair.After the couple fail in an attempt to run away together, they decide to murder Nick. They succeed at the second attempt but soon Cora is put on trial for the crime. The prosecuting attorney succeeds in getting Frank to betray Cora but some slick work by her lawyer results in her being acquitted. After the trial, Frank and Cora resume their relationship and a succession of surprising developments culminate in a tragic conclusion.Frank is a man whose misfortunes don't simply emanate from his weakness or the consequences of making a wrong turn in his life. He's a violent, petty criminal who's driven by lust, but nevertheless, seems more in control of his destiny than is typical of a noir protagonist. In this version of the story, in an interpretation which is probably more realistic, he's more cynical and brutal than John Garfield's 1946 incarnation and as a result is a far more unsympathetic character.Jessica Lange's Cora is also different from Lana Turner's as she seems much too strong and spirited to be as trapped as she claims and also doesn't have the kind of mystique or ambiguity which makes it seem credible that she could've been harbouring dark thoughts about killing Nick for some time.The ways in which the characters of Frank and Cora have been changed is interesting to watch but the same can't be said of the changed ending which lacks both the irony of the original and its significance to the story's title.This movie is strong on atmosphere and intensity and convincingly evokes the period in which the action is set. Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange are excellent in their roles and the supporting cast (particularly John Colicos) is also very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She's tired of what's right and what's wrong...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immensely watchable, this remake of the 1940s classic is sexed up by writer David Mamet and director Bob Rafelson. Jack Nicholson is a drifter who ingratiates himself into the lives of roadside diner/gas station owner John Colicos and his impossibly sexy wife Jessica Lange. Soon Lange and Nicholson are having sex EVERYWHERE...and plotting to bump off Colicos. Aided by great cinematography by Sven Nykvist and very evocative production design by George Jenkins, Rafelson manages to capture James M. Cain's ironic novel and all it's sordidness. Nicholson is terrific but Lange gives a career making performance...this is the movie that put her on the map after the KING KONG debacle. There are times when she acts Nicholson off the screen. Colicos is fine, if a bit old for his role and Michael Lerner is in it too. Anjelica Huston has a really odd cameo as a lion tamer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This comment may contain spoilers *** It's the story that James M. Cain might have written if the period had permitted it. Here is Jessica Lange, sensuously kneading dough on the baking room table and practically radiating oestrus. Here is her husband, Nick the Greek, oily, drunk, spitting his plosives all over everybody. And here is Nicholson as the reckless drifter who eases himself into Nick's confidence and forces himself into Lange's pants.The engine behind the plot is raw sex that turns to a rocky kind of love affair and then to murder and tragedy. Cain couldn't write the sex scenes in this movie, not even in Snappy Stories pulp magazines, the kind with covers showing some gorgeous doll with the shoulder of her dress ripped and a bra strap showing and some goon with a gun lurking in the shadows behind her.You can't help comparing it to the 1946 version with John Garfield, Lana Turner, and Cecil Calloway. The earlier movie is much sleeker, more compact, and brought up to date, and the characters are sketched in with greater simplicity.This one is a period picture. The time is the 1930s and the production design is just fine. They're always tooling around in cars. What cars they had in those days -- that yellow Model A convertible roadster with the rumble seat! I loved the one I once owned, even though I could never find replacement parts for it. The old days are gone forever. (Sob.) Anyway, neither Nicholson nor anyone else loves the cars as much as Nicholson winds up loving Lange, and vice versa.There is a slight problem in this bond between the two of them, namely Nick the Greek. He's a nice enough guy -- trusting, not too bright, has ties to a vibrant Greek community which we don't see much of. As a matter of fact, except for some occasional run-ins with the law, this curious trio seems to live all alone at the Twin Oaks Roadside Stand.Nicholson is required to show some range and he does a splendid job -- by turns dumb, sleazy, and horrified. Lange doesn't quite do the job that Nicholson does but she's more than adequate. When she finally gives in to Nicholson on the butcher block table she makes us believe it. The writers, though, have given her a strange and unanticipated quirk. After she's just watched Nicholson bash in her husband's head with a giant socket wrench, and she's just been severely punched in the face (twice) and knocked to the dirt among the shrubbery, she gets a case of the hots and invites Nicholson to join her in an al fresco romp. It just doesn't belong. Neither does Nicholson's brief tryst with Angelica Huston as a comic circus lion tamer. And it IS a little hard to swallow the notion that Lange is converted into a law-abiding, pregnant, willing Hausfrau because of her mother's death -- given that, until then, we didn't even know she had a mother.But those are relatively minor issues. Overall, this is a superior movie, "gritty", as they say. Nicholson, unlike Garfield in 1946, looks like he really works at his job. What filthy hands. Not much can be said for his mind either. By the time he and Lange are reformed, the postman is at the door again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic story and i truly loved the film because i did not know why on earth it is called the postman always rings twice until right at the very end. The film made me think and it gave me goosebumps when i discovered at the end when the title and story of the film fitted perfectly together. I recommend this film to people who have a love for great movies. But it is always great when you have no idea what is about to happen and if you have not read the book or seen the original. Jack is always great to watch and this film is one of his best projects. I thought the sexy scenes were great and they portrayed a vast amount of passion. To be honest, unfortunately i think that evil wins in real life but i like the idea and message that the film sends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passionate movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Postman always rings twice' can qualify as a very under-rated movie. Despite its flaws, it's one of those movies which have touched my heart. The complex relationship between the two leading characters is one of the most intriguing relationships that I have observed. The movie is about a bond which is formed between Jack Nicholson &amp; Jessica Lange. Jack is a vagrant who visits a highway hotel owned by Jessica Lange's husband, an old commoner. He ends-up seducing Jessica Lange who falls for his charm &amp; his attractive demeanour. They carry their relationship, the same way till a point, where they decide to kill Jessica's husband. After his murder they, they undergo an investigation &amp; later realize that their relationship is not as rosy as it used to be due to their oversight of each other's shortcomings. But they still manage to hold on to each other due to a bond between them &amp; because of their affection. It ends in a tragedy with the death of Jessica Lange, which is sort of an anticlimax, but it is presented in an original way. The movie gave me the same feeling which I got from reading the novel 'Love Story' by Eric Segal. The best aspect of the movie is the performance of Jack Nicholson &amp; Jessica Lange which are astounding. Their love making scenes are the most passionate love making scenes I've ever seen in movies &amp; their chemistry is simply awesome. Jessica looks like a million bucks in this movie. It is one of those rare movies which is definitely worth watching for someone who is a fan of character driven movies with complex relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank and Cora, Oh My!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Spoilers Ahead]Hapless Frank Chambers happens into the Papadakis roadhouse and mayhem ensues. Apparently, Frank discovered and exploited the lusty Cora into a disturbing affair. Remarkably, the ex-con, yet low key Frank is taken aback when Cora decides it's time to rub out the husband, played expertly by John Colicos.Colicos' Papadakis is everything that Frank and Cora are not. He is hard working, simple, and foreign. Our malevolent protaganists are homegrown, lusty, and starwandering. However, when they decide to rub out Papadakis, they do it in such an imbecilic way as to warrant failure. Despite initially feeling remorse for the botched job, their supposed "love" is worth a second try.After succeeding, Frank and Cora end up in the slammer, for a time. A sharp lawyer, Mr. Katz, played well by Michael Lerner amazingly gets them from facing the gallows. In fact, they walk.You would expect a happy ending at this point. Well no, not exactly. It seems trouble follows Frank and Cora like the plague. Of course, all of this trouble stems from their own poor decisions. I had to keep reminding myself, "hey don't root for these folks, they are killers and conspirators." Unfortunately, they are so pathetic, compelling, and desperate for happiness that I could not help but rooting for these rotten apples.The thirties atmosphere is shot exceptionally well and adds to the positives of this film. Also, look for a very exotic looking Anjelica Huston in a brief appearance. I rate this film at 6 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't hear him ring once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing is the first word that comes to mind after sitting through this sexed-up noir remake of a 1946 film of the same name based on a popular novel. This critic has neither seen the original, nor read that novel, so he is forced to take this film on face value and evaluate it on its own merits. That said, The Postman Always Rings Twice failed to come close to my expectations. You won't care a lick about drifter Jack Nicholson and bored housewife Jessica Lange who start a torrid love affair behind the back of her husband, and then look to kill him off. These two amoral jerks are all dressed up with nowhere to go in this script, and once the deed is done, the story really jumps the tracks. This was an intriguing premise, but the many talented people who made this film have all done much better things.The biggest selling point for this film was its steamy sex scenes, and there are indeed a few. But something is missing. Something that should be fairly obvious to those of us who have had sex in our lives. Nobody is ever nude during them! Save for one brief scene where we see Nicholson's rear, there is a jarring lack of nudity. At times these people seem to be having intercourse right through their clothes! I've heard Nicholson is a legendary lover, but is he strong enough to.... I'll stop there. What happened? I'm sure they at least negotiated with Lange about perhaps a topless scene or something. I guess she said no. Look, one does not need nudity for a sexy scene. The only interesting scene in Random Hearts is a testament to that. But when you advertise your picture as a steamy, sexy thriller, you pretty much have to go all in, or the whole thing is a waste.Aside from the sex scenes, this film seems confused about what its characters are supposed to do once the husband is out of the way. And the conclusion is so abrupt, its almost like they ran out of money and just decided to kill one of the leads off and call it a wrap. The acting isn't bad, but thats about all the film has going for it. Lange is her typical self... not great, but not bad either. Nicholson is born to play this type of character, and he doesn't disappoint. You may remember John Collicos from TV's Battlestar Galactica. Angelical Huston is on hand for a cameo that they probably just gave her when she was hanging around the set to be close to her main squeeze Nicholson. This film is really just a waste of your time when you consider all of the better pictures these people have made. Avoid it. 4 of 10 stars. And what does the title have to do with the movie, anyway? The Hound.</fullReview>

Even without comparing to the original classic this movie is waste of time.It starts out great but after half an hour later it wonders around aimlessly. What annoys me the most that things happen almost spontaneously without much explanation,while in the novel the attraction between the two leads is clearly elaborated.Here just 20 minutes into the movie and both of them jumps on the kitchen table ,makes passionate love as if they knew each other for eternity. The worst thing is ending,which left things unexplained.In the original classic the ending was so beautifully explained,making sense of the title.Whats the use of watching the movie if you have to ask ,what the title means.

There is no passion in it or any sort of build up that leads to it. They just jump each other and that's it. The scene is pretty steamy but not really going into a story. The whole plot has absolutely no build up or any sort of planning involved. In the original, there was so much scheming and plotting going on and now in the remake, they just go through the motions. There is also no reason to drag the part of the neon sign on and on. I was glad that it just ended and from now on, I'll just stick to the original version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of a drifter working on a by the road dinner, and the owner's wife, disenchanted with her marriage sets upon herself to seduce the drifter in the hopes of a more satisfying relationship.This is the base of the script, in which Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson shine in their performances bringing different dimensions to their characters and, in true, bringing them to life.Frank Chambers (Jack Nicholson) is a bored drifter, with some jail time under his belt not looking for anything in particular. He gets enchanted by Cora (Jessica Lange) and ends up doing everything for them to be together.I think Jack Nicholson is an outstanding performer and it shows here some glimpses of what he will put in The Shining later on.I also particularly liked John P. Ryan in the small supporting role of Kennedy where we can see in him the double-stabbing typical that he will show in later roles.All in all it is a good movie, but I don't consider it as being erotic. Maybe for 1980's standards, but even so I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Studio always makes twice (at least)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wasn't there some significance to the title in James Cain's novel and the 1946 movie version? It's a long time since I visited either so I can't be certain, but I seem to remember the postie's propensity for ringing twice was at least referred to. Unless I missed it, it gets nary a mention in this lethargic 1981 remake of the original, making the title somewhat meaningless.Anyway, Jack Nicholson reins in his trademark rakish, devilish attitude to play the role of the drifter (previously played by John Garfield) who conspires with luscious housewife and gas station-diner cook Jessica Lange to do away with her annoying Greek husband, Nick. Nick takes his wife for granted; he has a Stavros accent and buys himself silk nightgowns and so deserves to die. Jack and Jessie make a convincing couple ? probably more so than Garfield and Lana Turner, although that's the only respect in which this version surpasses the original. Their attraction is animal, their love-making more of an adversarial duel than a demonstration of intimacy as they tear at each other on the diner's kitchen table. It's easy to see why Cora falls for Frank, even as his ardour cools. He offers a way out from the drudgery of her life with Nick. But for Frank you always get the impression (until the end at least) that it's more about the sex, and that he never really knows what he wants.The story is slow in unfolding, but drags fatally once the killer couple get away with their crime. Perhaps that's deliberate, to demonstrate the aimlessness of their relationship ? or of any relationship that isn't fuelled by love. The couple blow hot and cold with each other as they wait for Cora's brief probation period to be over so that they can move away from the scene of their crime. You get the impression that, if Cora's life hadn't been cut short, they would have ended up either destroying one another or drifted aimlessly through life long after any love they feel has been extinguished, wondering why the hell they stay together. Either way, you don't really care that much whether their end is happy or tragic.If you have a choice, watch the original (or the Italian movie, Ossessione, another version). If you don't, this one's OK but it's nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sexy Version of James M.Cain Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this story was told a few times in the past, being one of the versions the classic of same title starring Lana Turner and John Garfield, one of the most acclaimed stories of all time "The Postman Always Rings Twice" becomes a sexy, romantic and sad tale on the hands of Bob Rafelson ("The King of Marvin Gardens"), yet this work resurrected the film noir genre in the 1980's, giving new forms, exploring a more sexual and violent side which wasn't possible to be presented in the golden era of noir.With the same story as the 1946 adaptation of James M. Cain's novel, the film stars Jack Nicholson as Frank Chambers, the drifter who fell in love with Cora Papadakis (Jessica Lange), a simple housewife who helps her husband Nick (John Colicos) to manage a roadside diner in the East Coast. But they have a plan to kill Nick and live together forever but the destiny has some tricks, up's and down's, twists and turns to make their lives complicated each time their plot fail again and again. The difference between the seductive and classic version of this same story is the approach given by writer David Mamet, who made the love story between these two characters something sexy, animalistic, a full exploration of the senses with a lustful couple ripping each other's clothes, having sex on a kitchen table (one of the most iconic moments of the 1980's), something almost gratuitous but very effective for most audiences nowadays. While Tay Garnett's version was a provocation that could never go too far in its sensuality, only showing short kisses but very effective tender moments, this update is more of a visual film made to present something exciting, thrilling. And Nicholson and Lange have the chemistry and quality in their wild performances here.To me, comparing back to back both films they're equally great just as the novel. They have their differences, specially concerning about the characters characterization and performances of actors, the way they were written. Examples: Nicholson is more believable as a hobo than John Garfield, in the way he's dressed, the way he talks and moves; the Cora played by Lange was something new, more passive and quite joyful which is nothing similar than the one of the book and 1946 film materials, who is very smart, dominating in the relationship with Frank; but the most striking difference was the friendly Nick, played here as an rude and irritating man, therefore, the script is basically giving a reason for us not like this guy and cheer that the horrible plans of Frank and Cora become successful. The George C. Scott rule of not giving awards to actors unless the play the same parts is useful here to see in which films the acting worked better. If only we could team Jack Nicholson and Lana Turner together....we would have something explosive and very interesting. On a minor look to the film, I really enjoyed the ending with a devastating moment, without the trial and that whole depressive conclusion (although it ended sad the same way, but this time the viewers will make their own conclusions instead of having the title explained at the final and moralistic scene as MGM's version). Also enjoyed Sven Nykivst colorful cinematography with a right use of darkness in the most tense moments. The melodramatic soundtrack works one time or the other but for the most of the film is just silly. The importance of this version of "The Postman Always Rings Twice" is the fact that it brought back the film noir with a new style, new faces (ok, Nicholson was in "Chinatown" in 1974, so it doesn't count) and more baldness. After this film, we had "Body Heat", the parody/homage "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid", and plenty of others. Take a look and enjoy it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lange &amp; Nicholson's Prefabricated Sex Scenes Sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And, I ask you - Can you actually imagine a big-name, Hollywood, crime film that (as its #1 selling point) arrogantly boasts about the torrid sex scenes that take place on-screen between its 2 stars.... And, then when it comes to these apparently heavy-duty scenes, they are (get this) delivered sans nudity? Ha! Well, that's exactly what this disappointing, utter mess-of-a-remake did.From its truly laughable "kitchen table" rape sequence, to its utterly demented courtroom dramatics, to Lange's grate-on-your-nerves hysterics and Nicholson's nitwit histrionics, The Postman Always Rings Twice (TPART, for short) was about 100x worse that I had ever imagined that it could be. I found that, for the most part, I could barely stay awake throughout TPART's almost unendurable 2-hour running time.From start to finish, I rank TPART as being nothing but a putrid pile of pure cinematic excrement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the "original" from 1946 but anyway - I am not into black-and-white movies, with the exception of those with Chaplin and Lloyd perhaps. Thus, I decided to watch the one in question, besides, Jack Nicholson (as Frank Chambers) and Jessica Lange (as Cora Smith/Papadakis) are much more known and admired by me than John Garfield and Lana Turner... Their performances were really good (although not among their best), they had sizzling mutual chemistry, but it seems that the topic/script has become timeworn, seen at present as a rather trivial crime thriller, as the main theme - lovers trying to get rid of (rich) husband - has been exploited a lot. The plot does not run smoothly and the inclusion of e.g. Anjelica Huston as Madge Gorland did not provide any additional value; on the other hand, bigger inclusion of past history of the protagonists could have been interesting. The ending was also too abrupt and when the end credits appeared, one could feel confusion about the meaning of the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitter Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981) ** (out of 4)Considering the talent in front of and behind the camera, there's really no way to look at this adaptation of the James M. Cain novel as anything but a disappointment. In the film, Jack Nicholson plays drifter Frank Chambers who enters the lives of Cora (Jessica Lange) and her much older husband Nick (John Colicos). Soon the drifter and Cora start up a sexual relationship, which leads to them planning the murder of the husband. This here would be the fourth version of the classic story and the second one filmed in America. Unlike the previous versions, director Bob Rafelson didn't have to worry about censors but even so this version isn't nearly as hot as the earlier one with Lana Turner. Outside a rather intense sex scene towards the start of the picture, this thing really never takes off, which is too bad because they've got a terrific cast and some beautiful settings but in the end the film is just flat. I think the first forty- five minutes are the best thing in the film as we see the love triangle set up and there's no question that the director has the look of the era down perfectly. I thought the setting really added a lot of atmosphere but sadly very little else happens. Nicholson was the perfect choice to play a drifter but the screenplay really doesn't give him too much to work with. Lange is clearly the best thing in the movie as she delivers a sexual charge to the thing. Colicos is also extremely good as the husband in a strong supporting performance. What really hurts the film is the second half because the director never really makes us believe or feel anything for the two leads. Are we supposed to hate them for what they've done? Are we supposed to be rooting for them to get away with the murder and live happily ever after? The entire second half of the film features way too many dialogue scenes that lead no where and in the end the "romance" that starts to bloom towards the end just never fully works. The film isn't nearly as bad as its reputation but at the same time there's no question that it's a major disappointment and a bitter feeling takes over when you think about what could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pornographic remake of a film noir classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eroticizing the tale of two killers previously made in 1946, director Bob Rafelson took out the subtlety and innuendo that made the original so hot. By adding sadomasochistic sexual activity between Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, he cheapens the story that could have been an interesting pulp fiction update of James M. Cain's story. In the original, John Garfield and Lana Turner really did have heat that didn't need to show the audience what the two did in bed. Their power burnt through the screen, but if there is any steam between Nicholson and Lange, sadly it is only dry ice, not timbers smoldering.Nicholson, then one of the hottest actors in Hollywood, plays an obvious sleaze-bag. His character is never likable which dissolves any sympathy towards him. Garfield played the role as a victim of circumstances with a past which made him more interesting and complex. Lange, however, does provide some heat, and shows the potential of becoming one of the biggest stars of the 80's after a weak start in the 1976 remake of "King Kong". She lacks Lana Turner's glamour (and the famous white shorts and halter top with matching turban), but making her more earthy adds a different dimension to her character that Nicholson's lacks.Rather than a Cecil Kellaway type as the cheated-on husband, the producers added a more ethnic flavor to the character played by veteran character actor John Colicos. The same year he made this movie, he made soap immortality as the evil Mikkos Cassadine, the world's wealthiest Greek, on "General Hospital". On the soap, he victimized the world. Here, he plays a lower class Greek who married a younger woman. Unlike Kellaway, the age difference isn't grandfatherly, and works better. Michael Lerner is very good as the attorney who defends Nicholson and Lange for murder, and a young Anjelica Houston is seen briefly as a circus owner involved with Nicholson. She utilizes the same accent she would later perfect in the hysterical "The Witches".What really makes a color version of the story work is the not-so-sharp photography that really makes it look like a pulp fiction magazine come to life. The ending drags a bit, but it is ironic to watch the two characters slowly destroy themselves and each other. That's what film noir is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is it a remake or just another version of Cain's text? you decide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say that one-line statement having yet to read James M. Cain's original (short) book, or the 1946 film starring John Garfield and Lana Turner. So I have now seen the Postman Always Rings Twice directed by Bob Rafelson and starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange twice now, and see it on its own terms without much to really compare it to. Perhaps my perceptions could change once I see the older Hollywood film (even though Luchino Visconti's own version of the book, Ossessione, is one of his masterpieces), but for the moment this is a fairly competent, sometimes exciting, and usually sensual story of lust, murder, thick plots and a few tight twists and turns. Nicholson's Frank Chambers is a sort of blue-collar wanderer who wanders into the life of Cora (Lange, rarely been sexier), who is married to a gregarious, overbearing lug, Papadakis (John Colicos, perfect in a character-actor bit), who with his wife run a little restaurant. Chambers works his way into not just Papadakis's good graces as a worker, but Cora's undergarments as well, so to speak. Soon a plot thickens between the two lovers over what to do with the other. Right out of the best film-noir, there's quite a sequence that spins as their scheme unfolds, which includes money as well as each other. That everything doesn't go quite to plan makes this film both captivating and cool, while sometimes frustrating.Here Rafelson has his cast really locked in place like it can't go wrong. Nicholson as a street-wise tough guy who falls for a woman with whom there's immediate, sexual magnetism, but also has some flaws that come with the package- almost too easy for him but not a bad performance. Lange brings some dimension to a character that could be either a real prize or a true femme fatale. And character actors like Michael Lerner (only better in Barton Fink) and even featuring Angelica Huston in an early performance, add some good weight to the cast. The sex scenes years later are still enticing, and the ending is a true whopper that is part of the story's best catharsis, though in its own formula still tragic. If then it doesn't feel really as successful as the best noir of the 40s and 50s its almost hard to say. Sometimes scenes kinds of come and go, and the flow of the story sometimes gets jammed up after the midway mark goes by. It turns more into a domestic drama than something more exciting in the suspenseful turns early on. Just when Rafelson has his crew working to put life into some scenes, a few are a little flat in comparison.Still, even if you have seen the original 40s takes on Cain's novel, it's never less than interesting what goes on thanks to the nature of the story. It's a look at very flawed, psychologically cruxed people who attempt at happiness in ways that change them for worse and for better (possibly more the former). Occasionally the sex could be in danger of veering off the more stylish side of the lust in the 40s noirs into soft-core land, but it's balanced out by its general professionalism and the acting randing from so-so-to-better-than-average. It's a like it or hate it film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Jessica Lange,you really nailed the working class femme fatale, Cora. It really was a stellar performance from you. Your use of body posture (for example: the way Cora sat on the ground during the picnic) to convey the character's unabashed rustic charm was very commendable. The cinematographer paid special attention to your rough hands and almost muscular arms. I think your performance is superior to both Lana Turner and Clara Calamai. While Turner looked too sophisticated to be a working class woman, Clara Calamai was overtly bovine and unattractive.Jack Nicholson was terrific as always, there are few actors who can match his screen presence. But he was too old for the role. And while the sex scenes between you guys were true to the book, I did not find them to be too erotic or anything. This was a bit of a drawback. While there is something satanic about Nicholson, he is not someone I would think about if I was making a movie with some really hot love making scenes.I liked the film's pastoral setting. There are some really pleasant shots of rural life that expressed the idyllic nature of the character's lives. The house and café where the events unfolded was a great set piece. The drawers with all that beautiful canned food stood out.However, the film's languid pace was in direct contrast to the succession of explosive events in the book by James.M.Cain. The film was too long at 2 hours.But it was still very engaging especially due to your presence, Jessica.Best Regards,Pimpin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest Hollywood rogue &amp; maverick directors, represented in grand persona of Bob Rafelson, (who was given a free hand by Lorimar on this one) did a mighty good job in adapting famous Cain novel for the big screen. Packing a whole lot more wallop then the original, constrained in studio system - censorship dictated, straight jacket, Postman of 1981 is the movie with outstanding performances, that let us feel every throb of passion and excitement, overflow in doomed love story, of two lost souls, Frank and Cora, that are brought together by sinister faith, their carnal desires and bad luck. They plan and go through the murder fueled by greed and sexual desire. The murder plot is almost silly but it's dictated by the level of their intelligence.There's something about the irony of two people who are caught by passion to begin with, and then transcend it, but can't elude the karma of their passion. That is very attractive to viewer who understands and feels their despair. They escalate each other's thoughts all the time,neither of them is capable of doing that audacious as murder, or even conceiving of their lives as anything but what they are, without each other. They're equal partners in their crime, their adultery and their murder and their love for each other.This movie shows all this and it shows it vividly, the way 1946 version never could. That's why, Rafelson film is the ultimate embodiment of James Cain novel. Cain never wrote about very intelligent criminals. He wrote about desperate outcasts. Frank and Cora are those in the truest sense, and only Nicholson and Lange, could make you not only see, but feel their emotion, hopes, dreams, and their ultimate loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't Surpass the 1946 Version, But Worth Watching!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adulterous lovers, avarice and cold-blooded murder propel the ambitious 1981 remake pf "The Postman Always Rings Twice" with Jack Nicholson as the knockabout drifter and Jessica Lange as the roadside diner dame who conspire to kill her older husband. "Five Easy Pieces" director Bob Rafelson and playwright-turned-scenarist David Mamet stoke the sensual fires between Nicholson and Lange in this sexually charged rehash. When Nicholson and Lange come together, they grope each other like lusty animals in throes of passionate fury. The scene in the kitchen where Jack takes Jessica on table sprinkled with flour dust makes it clear that the Rafelson remake wants to treat the material with greater realism. Moreover, this beautifully lensed and produced melodrama never stoops to prurience. Even during the kitchen table scene, our leads never display their private body parts for our greater amusement. Jessica Lange does not have a wardrobe malfunction. Later, he shows Jack indulging in cunnilingus. In another shot, Nicholson is shown sprawled across a bed belly down with his buttocks bared. The ending differs drastically from the 1946 version. Surprisingly, Nicholson's character, who committed murder, gets away with it.In most instances, the 1981 remake follows the 1946 American original. This example of neo-noir appears to be set a little earlier in time than the 1946 version. This time around Frank Chambers (Jack Nicholson of "Chinatown") hitches a ride with a salesman (Christopher Lloyd) to a roadside gas station/diner owned by Nick Papadakos (John Colicos of "Raid on Rommel"), but he pretends that the salesman stole his money and left him high and dry. Nick gives Frank a job as a mechanic. Like the M-G-M version, this movie shows the hero and heroine as they try to kill Nick when he is bathing. Of course, a poor cat dies when it tampers with a fuse box and gets fried. Nick recovers from this accident, but he isn't so lucky with the other accident. Frank and Cora get him drunk and then take him up into the mountains and topple the car off the mountain side. Initially, neither of them believes that the sedan looks appropriately smashed up enough. Frank climbs into the vehicle and his additional weight sends the automobile crashing down the mountain. The district attorney constitutes as the closet thing to a villain, but District Attorney Sackett (as played here by William Traylor) does not haunt the periphery like Leon Ames did in the M-G-M version. Sackett intimidates Frank and convinces him to sign a confession. Later, Cora's attorney, Mr. Katz (Michael Lerner of "Outlaw Blues") pleads Cora guilty and gets her to spill the beans to one of his own men, Mr. Kennedy (John P. Ryan of "The Missouri Breaks"), who is masquerading as the district attorney's assistant. Cora calms down once she understands what Katz has done. The slippery Katz works out a negotiation between the two insurance companies involved in the car accident. He gets Cora off with probation and Frank is clean. Cora's mother dies and she has to leave the diner. Frank shuts the place down and hitches a ride with a trucker delivering big cats to a circus. Frank has a fling with Madge. The scenes with Angela Huston's lion tamer is a major departure. When Cora comes back from her mother's funeral, Frank picks her up and takes her home. She surprises him with news that she is carrying his child. Not surprisingly, Kennedy tries to blackmail them and Frank roughs him up. While Frank is getting the copy of the confession that Kennedy stole from Katz, Cora discover Frank's infidelity. She points out to Frank that she cannot be tried from the same crime. However, he can be tried for Nick's murder. Frank catches Cora making a phone and fears that she may be ratting him out to Sackett. After a passage of time, Frank announces that he wants to marry Cora, but she believes that he only wants to shut her up. In the 1946 version, Cora's attorney, Mr. Keats, persuaded Frank and Cora to get married so that Sackett could not prosecute them on a moral charges of living together out of wedlock. Frank and Cora tie the knot. Cora feels ill and Frank takes her home. During that trip, Frank swerves to avoid a collision with a truck and Cora falls out of the car into the road. Frank smashes into a road sign. When he gets to Cora, he finds her dead and weeps in tragedy. Rafelson's version is less literal, too. Rafelson and Mamet emphasize ethnicity in the Greek proprietor Nick, who owns the diner where our heroine slings hash, and the ending does not put Frank on death row.Everything visual about "The Postman Always Rings Twice" looks opulent. Acclaimed lenser Sven Nykvist, who photographed some of Ingmar Bergman's best films, steeps us in the detail of the period and imparts a spontaneity to each moment. The production values are solid and atmospheric; production designer George Jenkins makes you believe that it is the Depression Era 1930s. The car crash scene looks exemplary. Despite all of the stellar things going for this remake, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" rings hollow. Rafelson paces the film well enough so that it does not wear out its welcome or stall along stretches. Altogether, the Rafelson film does not overshadow the 1946, Tay Garnett-directed M-G-M feature with Lana Turner and John Garfield, but it is an above-average opus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I certainly think Jessica Lange was a great-looking woman in this picture, but having to top Lana Turner was just too great a task to pull off. She certainly looks ravishing, though, as the young wife of a gas-station owner yearning to have a life with loner Nicholson. This film is notorious for it's heated sex scenes, but they can not mask the emptiness of this film where, to be honest, Nicholson just seems lost to this role. He seems to be sleep-walking. Colicos plays the Greek husband for whom Nicholson's drifter Frank and Lange's Cora plan to kill.I mainly wanted to see it because it has a pretty solid director helming it in Rafelson, but it was mainly because I desired to see Sven Nykvist's cinematographic work. The period atmosphere worked for me as well. Still, the film lacks the bite of the original film and I could never quite get into this film. It seemed to lumber along and it doesn't help that the film doesn't quite gel cohesively as a whole. What I mean by that is, it seems Rafelson and company want to get as much of the novel in as he can so the film feels uneven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I once said in another review I made that movie re-makes are a tricky thing. In the case of this remake,the trick was far from magical. In fact,from the get go and throughout the entire film,I knew exactly what was going to happen.Not because I had seen any other version (which I hadn't,but I have read it)but from the moment Christopher Lloyd leaves Nicholson behind,it was obvious he was going to try and get with Nick's wife. That they would pack up and try and get away,would try later to kill him and get figured out...and that either one or both of them would perish in the end.We're even given a little preview of how Cora will lose her life,when on the road part way through the movie they have a near miss with another car but they're okay of course. In the meantime they successfully bump off Nick but a mishap with the car injures Frank even more than the fake injuries Cora inflicted before to make it look like they were thrown from it.They're scheme is found out and a series of shady deals between lawyers and insurance companies gets them off the hook. Not before a media circus (1930's style) ensues. Cora's business picks up and she's now a famous murderess,quite a sick notion,but things like that happened back then. The thing that bothered me about Frank and Cora is they're constant see-sawing between love you /hate you. Then again,every time they get close to getting together permanently,something interferes or they do something to the other to screw it up. The title,if you didn't know,is a metaphor for "what goes around comes around". It seems all the bad that Frank and Cora put out there,comes back on them ten-times worse and pretty quickly too.There's some good drama here,especially in the shady dealings done to save to obviously guilty people. A good look at how crooked things can get behind the scenes in justice. Also the deception of Cora's husband Nick who's absolutely clueless about his wife and handy-man. Even the part where their lawyers partner,now unemployed,tries to blackmail the couple for $10,000 because he took down Cora's confession and kept it in a safety deposit box. Nicholson defeats him easily after Cora knocks him down and Frank beats a confession out of him.Otherwise,the rest happens as you expect it to happen right up to the ending. Six stars out of ten,for that very reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A travesty of a fiasco of a disaster. A simply awful 80's remake of one of the toughest, sexiest and above all best acted noir thrillers. Yes, I know Garfield and Turner would be hard to beat but Nicholson and Lange aren't even in the race. You can see old lumbering Jack thinking his lines before he speaks them, while Ms Lange's acting goes right off the scale, rarely to return.The film has no pacing to speak of and no dramatic arc at any point in the story. It also makes unaccountable narrative jumps which if I hadn't seen the original would have made little or no sense at all. Then there's the downbeat epilogue the point of which I'm still trying to fathom, right alongside Angelica Huston's appearance (I won't elevate it to cameo status) as, get this, a circus lion-tamer who promptly beds the errant Jack before depositing her pet puma on Lange (no, I don't know why either).As for the infamous sex-scene on the kitchen table, it comes out of nowhere with no hint of sexual chemistry between the couple beforehand and I found the fact that Nicholson pretty much half-rapes Lange to make his point, as offensive as it was gratuitous. As for Lange's dimwitted husband, Nick, he leaves no impression at all so that you don't care when he meets his end at the lovers' hands.I've rarely seen such a poorly edited, acted and scripted so-called major Hollywood movie. Without trying to be too much the Minister for The Bleeding Obvious, by-pass this mess in favour of the black and white original every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made and well-acted, but what was the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is a well-made film on a technical level and all of the performances were excellent, there was a certain something missing from this remake that left me wanting. Based on the novel by James Cain, the story is about a drifter, Frank Chambers (Jack Nicholson), who visits a rural diner run by Nick Papadakis and his wife Cora (Jessica Lange). Frank and Cora begin an affair and then attempt to kill Cora's husband, but fail. In true film noir fashion, fate eventually gets its way and tragedy befalls the two lovers in an unexpected way. For me, the 1946 film adaptation starring John Garfield and Lana Turner stands as one of the best film noirs ever, and there was almost nothing this 1981 remake could have done to really live up to that. The only new or different thing this adaptation does is ramp up the sexual content and violence, and mixes them in a way that was kind of off-putting at times. Perhaps it was this way in Cain's novel, but the way in which sex and violence are intertwined in this film was more than a little disturbing. With that, and a slight adjustment to the ending (and of course, being in color), it hews fairly closely to the story as presented in the 1946 original. One might ask, "What was the point?" and you'd be perfectly justified in asking that. I have no idea what possessed them produce this remake, but for what it's worth it's not a bad film. However, if forced to choose between this and the 1946 version, I'd pick the 1946 version every time. This one was just a little too nihilistic and lacked emotional depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This gat misfired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In March 1927 Long Island housewife Ruth Snyder and her lover, Judd Gray, joined together to murder Snyder's husband, Albert, for the insurance money. Both were caught, tried, convicted, and swiftly executed. A notorious case, the Snyder-Gray affair became pop culture legend when Thomas Howard, a New York 'Daily News' photographer, surreptitiously photographed Snyder's death in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison. Published in the 'Daily News' on Jan. 12, 1928, the photo caused such a sensation that the newspaper had to print an additional 750,000 copies. Six years later James M. Cain's novel, 'The Postman Always Rings Twice', fictionalized the Snyder-Gray case to critical and popular acclaim. In 1946 Cain's book was brought to the screen by M-G-M with John Garfield as Frank Chambers (Judd Gray's counterpart), the glamorous Lana Turner as Cora Smith (the Ruth Snyder figure), and Cecil Kellaway as Nick Smith (based on victim Albert Snyder). In Cain's novel, Nick is Nick Papadakis, a swarthy, rather venal Greek greasy spoon proprietor. Interestingly the 1946 film version softens Nick's personality and elides his Mediterranean ethnicity but retains the fact that he is considerably older than his wife (at the time of filming Turner was 25 and Kelloway was 52). Bob Rafelson's remake, written by playwright/screenwriter David Mamet, is a more faithful adaptation of Cain's novel and?15 years after the collapse of the Hays Code?is also vastly more sexually explicit. In Rafelson's version Jack Nicholson is cast as dissolute drifter Frank Chambers, Jessica Lange is the bored, oversexed wife, Cora Papadakis, John Colicos plays Nick (restored to his full, greasy ethnic unattractiveness), and Angelica Huston appears (gratuitously) as Madge, a circus tamer of big cats who has a fling with Frank. With solid acting, sure direction by Rafelson, superb production design by George Jenkins ('The Parallax View'; 'All the President's Men'), and outstanding cinematography by Ingmar Bergman stalwart Sven Nykvist, the 1981 version of 'Postman' should have been a neo-noir classic. Unfortunately something fails to click?most probably the chemistry between Nicholson and Lange, which depends too much on simulated high-octane animal attraction and not enough on real simpatico. While quite good, Rafelson's version is strangely flat and uninvolving; we end up not caring very much what happens to Frank and Cora. VHS (1993); DVD (1997).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic Tale of Fateful Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the James M. Cain novel comes this tragic tale of the fateful love affair between a drifter and a passionate young woman both trapped in a world too small for them.Rafelson carefully directs David Mamet's screenplay which unearths two mismatched characters whose destiny, like star-crossed lovers, lies cruelly juxtaposed.Bringing these two wonderfully to life are Jack Nicholson, mastering yet another role as the physical, unattached Frank Chambers who has finally found something to care for in the world. Lange is even better as the high -strung Cora, whose insatiable love for Frank drives her to mad deeds.Michael Small's dramatic score and production design from George Jenkins compliment this strong film.Wednesday, December 29, 1999 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw and aggressive romantic drama that's carried by it's erotic scenes and passionate script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again Nicholson teams up with director Bob Rafelson and while this isn't a classic like Five Easy Pieces or it doesn't even compare to other works of Jack, yet still this film has enough suspense and drama that's built up by passionate love and the erotic love scenes make the film one to see. As expected Jack Nicholson once again delivered a super and top notch performance as his role of drifter Frank Chambers would fit perfect for him as by 1981 when this film was released Jack was so used to playing the type of loners, rebels, and anti-establishment types that go against the grain(Examples: "Five Easy Pieces," and "Easy Rider", and "The Last Detail"). Nicholson too seems to enjoy his turn of womanizing and love making in this film also.Nicholson is drifter and loner Frank Chambers who's headed nowhere yet he drifts into a job at a roadside diner, a job that's giving to him by owner Nick(John Colicos). His only way to a new way of life and to see freedom and feel good again is when he spots Nick's wife the blond and attractive Cora(Jessica Lange). And with Frank's shady and suspect past it would prove as evidence he will do anything to get this woman as a lover even if it means killing her husband Nick. Slowly but surely the two embark on a hot and steamy passionate love affair that sizzles up the screen as many of the love scenes are erotic and obsessive. As you the viewer feel the heat these die for lovers are only destined to head for a sad tragedy.Really a pretty good film mostly carried by it's obsession and passionate love scenes that prove to be erotic they were really well done by Nicholson and Lange. Also look for good co staring appearances by Anjelica Huston, and Christopher Lloyd in this raw and hard pressed depression era film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad ending for this remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>************Possible Spoilers Here*********I just finished watching both versions of The Postman Always Rings Twice. My main complaint against the remake is that the ending is not sufficient. In my opinion, if someone did not see the first version of the movie, one might be left with a few questions. First, leading up to the incident in the shower, the dialogue is a little lackluster as to what is going on. Second, there is no mention of the phrase, "The Postman Always Rings Twice." The original version had a much better ending leaving the impression that in crime, you can not have it both ways. The performances in the remake were very good as were the sex scenes. The violence was better shown of course in the 1981 version. It is still worth watching both versions of the movie. See the old version first, then the second one and compare the story lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whereas previous versions of this movie had to follow strict censorship rules, this one didn't have to, so you'd better believe that they went all out. When 1930s drifter Frank Chambers (Jack Nicholson) decides to stay at a hotel, he falls for lusty co-owner Cora Papadakis (Jessica Lange). But since she's married, their relationship can only progress if something "happens" to her husband Nick (John Colicos).Bob Rafelson had previously directed Nicholson in the masterpiece "Five Easy Pieces" and the slightly more subdued "King of Marvin Gardens" (they collaborated on even more movies after this one). But here - like I said - they go all out. We might interpret the movie as looking at the role of women in our society...or maybe it's totally up to interpretation. But let me tell you: you're not likely to come away from "The Postman Always Rings Twice" neutral. Also starring Anjelica Huston, Michael Lerner, and Christopher Lloyd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crazy Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Rafelson's 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' is a crazy classic from the early 80's. A strange film, with lust as it's priority. Honestly, what was this! 'The Postman Always Rings' starts off as a hardcore horny film, then it suddenly turns to a courtroom drama for a while, and a finally a love-story. This is a remake of a film that was made in the 40's, with the same name. Though I haven't seen that yet, I am sure it's better than this! When I say the word classic, I don't really mean it. If there is anything that really works in this film, it's the performances by it's lead cast. Jessica Lange steals the show a sultry performance. An Icredible performer, who's body of work goes down as remarkable efforts in the history of filmdom. Jack Nicholson is, as always, superb. The actor who has excelled in each &amp; every film really needs no mentioning.If you dare to watch this crazy classic, watch it for Lange &amp; Nicholson, who not only deliver killer performances, but also deliver first-rate sex-scenes. That's about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncommon Libidinous Intensity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This neo-noir is a persuasively atmospheric scaffold of a mechanical command of film-making, and we are impressed by the performances, the atmosphere, the air of approaching brutality. But what is this movie saying about its characters? What does it gather and deduce about them? Why was it significant to tell their story? This film belongs to a hard-bitten, time-honored potboiler by James M. Cain, which had even then prompted three prior films, including the classic 1946 Lana Turner-John Garfield adaptation. It isn't hard to fathom why director Bob Rafelson chose to helm his own version. On the premise of his pivotal episodes, he was drawn to the brute savagery in the narrative and he felt that in 1981 he could approach Cain's sexual barbarism with much more frankness.He was right. His film comprises scenes of uncommon corporal intensity, most famously the sex scene on a kitchen table, which was so vigorous and compelling that many believed that the two leads were really having sex on screen. I don't believe it was only the film-making; it was the natural earthbound chemistry between the actors. Jack Nicholson, contemporary cinema's earthy epicurean, radiates a special energy, though here not generally demonstrative. plays a Depression-era rolling stone, a petty scrounger, and a con man. Also radiating a special energy, Jessica Lange, who proves physically very self-aware, is the jaded and voluptuous hash-slinger in a short-order tavern managed by her much older Greek husband, John Colicos. Animal frenzy explodes between Nicholson and Lange virtually the instant they first see each other, and the sex is abrupt, callous, uninhibited, and purely libidinous.The screenplay is the film debut of noteworthy maverick playwright David Mamet, who is known mainly for his shrewd, aphoristic, usually coarse dialogue and evasive, hyperbolic phraseology, as well as for his interpretation of masculinity. But while those elements can be found here in pure form, Mamet is entirely conscious of his change in medium. From scene to scene, the film is more instinctual in building its narrative than driven by dialogue or externalized subconflicts. He submits to pure function in his then new medium and thus this crime drama is much more a clean sweep regarding ambiance. Each and every battered Coke sign, every bygone automobile and old overcoat and old trivial truism have been put in with appreciative forethought.Jessica Lange defers to the touch of a libertine hooligan with a natural rapport. Jack Nicholson has seldom been sleazier, sneakier, less relenting. John Colicos, as the conveniently dense, inebriated, business-minded Greek-American, provides a well-refined performance. And yet, we never know the people in this remake. They are kept immutably unfulfilled within a convention of utter exactitude: They exist, they eat, they sleep, they act. That would be right on if the filmmakers could stand outside their characters and have feelings about them. But I never maintained that was the situation. Nonetheless, Rafelson, master cinematographer Sven Nykvist and other partners have gone to limitless torment to fashion a picture that is admirably attained on the level of production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly cast and dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1920s drifter Frank Chambers (Jack Nicholson) starts doing odd jobs for an alcoholic cafe owner Nick (John Colicos). He then meets Nick's sexy young wife (Jessica Lange). Sex and murder follow.The 1946 version was perfect so, naturally, Hollywood had to redo it. They claimed the original had to be toned down because of the Hays Code (this is true). This version is true to the book--but bad casting and a SLOW pace destroy it. For starters Nicholson is far too old for the role--they needed someone in his 20s or 30s. It seems ridiculous that Lange would fall for someone like him. Also Lange was, at that point, still learning as an actress. She's not terrible but not as good as she usually is either. The sex scenes (which were promoted nonstop during the films production) aren't much. They're more violent than erotic and seriously--do YOU want to see Nicholson nude? Also the story is morbid and slow-moving--I was seriously bored and depressed halfway through. Nicholson manages to throw in one of his worst performances and, as I said before, Lange isn't that good.This was a major bomb (for some reason the studio chose to release this around Christmas!) and has rightfully been forgotten. A 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack's good, Jess... ain't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See, the problem I have with little Jessie Lange is that all her performances are always self-aggrandizing. In every role she undertakes I always get the impression that her performance is there to draw attention to itself rather than to illuminate a given character. She always has a scene where she is smoking. The cigarette becomes a prop which is smoked in such a way as to suggest she is actually having sex with it. Similarly with cups of coffee. All little bits of actorish business which scream out "I'm ACTING, darlings - just LOOK at me!!"Put her up against Jack Nicholson and you can see who is the more convincing of the two. Jack's immersion in his role is effortless and subtle. While we know it's Jack, we willingly believe he is Frank Chambers, drifting ex-con, on the look out for an easy few bucks, in Depression-era America.Frank is virtually down and out and stumbles into the isolated diner of Nick and Cora. He decides to stay at this diner when Nick offers him a job after Frank spots Cora in the kitchen. We first see Cora from Frank's p.o.v. She is seen through a serving hatch and doorway in the kitchen. The shot is set up so that Cora is "boxed into" the frame, a visual metaphor for her life: she is "boxed into" a marriage and lifestyle she is unhappy with, but circumstances force her to stay there. That is, until Frank arrives.Frank's amoral, wild, animalistic character is Cora's way out of her oppressive life. Throughout the film references to animals appear, symbolizing Frank's character. At one point Frank swigs orange juice straight from the bottle and Cora says to him "Will you use a glass? What are you, an animal?" Later a dead cat falls to the ground - between Frank and Cora, the message being obvious.There is much to commend this film. The photography, by Sven Nyqvist, is superb. During an attempted crime, Frank and Cora are stained by a deep red light, given off by a car brake light, which adds to the atmosphere as well as suggests the evil fires of hell are waiting to claim the pair. The acting is credible (even with Little Jess) and the direction is assured.There is one unintentionally hilarious line which had me guffawing out loud. Cora is complaining to Frank about her husband. "He wants to have a baby... How'm I gonna do that, Frank!!?" I was waiting for Jack's trademark drawl, "Well, darlin', let me tell ya aaaaall about the birds and the bees..."The film is worth watching for Jack alone and to all you budding murderers out there, let the ending be a lesson to you! Crime does not pay!! God pays debts without money!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a remake... it has its' moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This notorious adaptation of James M. Cain isn't as bad as some make it out to be. This film has a good blend of thriller, drama, romantic and crime.Frank Chambers (Jack Nicholson) is a drifter working at a restaurant owned by Nick Paradacos and his young, sultry, beautiful wife Cora (Jessica Lange). Frank soon finds out that not all is well for the married couple; Nick is a self-indulged, drinking husband who looks at his wife as no more than a prize won, and Cora is a (too) hard-working woman who seeks for liberation outside her gloomy life. Fixtated on the sexy Cora, Frank gets the husband out of the house for a while so he can have his way with the wife. Cora succumbs to this passion and the two become lovers and plot a scheme to murder her husband.Being made in the 1980s gave director Bob Rafelson the opportunity to capture the raw sexuality and violence that made the novel so shocking and appealing to a Depression-era audience. Nicholson's and Lange's sex scenes are raw, explicit and violent to say the least. While posing as a romantic-drama, it does have its thrilling action sequences, as in the scene of Frank, Cora and her husband driving around one late night...Nicholson appears to be miscast as a romantic lead as I don't think he was meant for 'weak, sappy' roles but rather villanious roles. Still, he gives it his best shot, and makes a somewhat convincing performance as the streetwise, ever horny drifter. The one major complaint is Jessica Lange. While her good looks will understandably bring any man down to his knees, her ability to play a neglected, preyed housewife is lacking. Apparantely this film gives her a chance to yell and shout like a hyena on fire. Jessica Lange should have stuck to her first profession, modeling, and leave the acting opportunites for more talented ladies.Overall, a fairly ordinary film with its' share of gratuitous sex scenes will get one through the weekend. Perfect to watch on a Sunday evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a waste of time. See the original with Garfield and Turner. There was heat and intensity between them. All we have in this tired, overlong remake is the two lead actors going through the motions. You don't care at all about these characters because they behave so unrealistically they may as well be rag dolls on a stick. Colicos gives a fine but wasted performance as Nick. The seemingly tacked on legal wranglings in the fourth act are confusing even to audience members who are familiar with the story. How's that for a murky and pointless attempt at screenwriting? The ending has none of the drama and impact of the original movie either. Neither does it stand well on its own merit. It is just, to put it in convenient modern vernacular, lame. A disappointing and pointless remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many problems with this dull, listless filmization of the James M. Cain classic, where does one begin? Well, let's start from the beginning. It tries to compete with the great 1946 version. How do you top a film as brilliant as that? The answer is, you don't! Even if this new version does follow the original novel more closely, who cares? As the tragic, plotting lovers, Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever, so they generate very little heat in their allegedly steamy sex scenes. It's as if the filmmakers were so aware of the miscasting that they tried to disguise this by making the sex scenes between the duo more erotic, meaning more explicit. BIG MISTAKE! This just makes the lack of chemistry even more painfully obvious, and the sex scenes rather silly. Despite having virtually nothing in common, Nicholson and Lange can't keep their hands off of each other and do a lot of huffing and puffing. They go at it like two wild animals in heat, but this does little to make the film any more watchable or entertaining. Yes, Lange is even more breathtakingly beautiful than usual, and she brings more intensity and depth to the role than the script really required. But, whether she knows it or not, Nicholson is a constant thorn in her side. Sure, Jack is a great actor too, but, even though his character is a plotting murderer, there was a romantic edge to the role when John Garfield played it in 1946, and Nicholson does not have one bit of that romanticism. I still kringe when I think of him as the love interest in TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. How did he ever get to be cast in parts like that? Stay as clear from this as possible and settle only for the untoppable original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson under scrutiny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the space of a few days I had the luck (I did not say `good luck') to see `The Postman Always Rings Twice' (1981), `Blood and Wine' (1997) and `A Few Good Men' (1992) in that order. The common thread here, evidently, is Jack Nicholson. This actor has become rather stereotyped for me ? though not necessarily for other people ? inasmuch that I sometimes feel that he does not need to act or anything, but just plays himself: but how well he plays himself! He has that ability usually, and in these three films specifically, to play the mean b*****d, or the loose-liver, or the shady double-dealer or in all cases, a hard type, and quite often the camera captures that glint in his eyes that makes you feel that he has gone crazy. I can first remember seeing him in Rafelson's `The Postman Always Rings Twice' with Jessica Lange, the type of film based on a book which, the same as Truman Capote's `In True Blood', has become a classic in the North American genre. The story is powerful, and Nicholson, more than Lange, is up to the mark. However this film has always ? about three times, now ? left me asking myself what went wrong: there is something more convincing lacking. A wonderful job with preparing the 30s scenario and all those old trucks and buses. Almost reminded me of an early rendering in black and white of John Steinbeck's `The Grapes of Wrath' ? possibly still one of the greatest US novels of all times. It's worth mentioning John Colicos as the Greek petrol-station owner, whose apportation is pretty decent.If in 1981 Nicholson held his own very well with the other principal actors, he had a more difficult job with Jennifer López (who only has to appear on the screen to beat allcomers) and Michael Caine, who in `Blood and Wine' just was not up to his level in `The Cyder House Rules' (1999), also seen again very recently. A much more complex story here as everyone tries to hang on to a near-priceless necklace, though in the end Stephen Dorff does the only honest thing open to any of them. An interesting story: but too stereotyped to Rafelsonian formulas, and with a bit more violence thrown in than really necessary for my liking. The story ? and the acting ? was not bad; it was even very nice to see that Miss López is even able to give a rather good performance and is not there just for her pretty face and lovely hair and beautiful eyes and fantastic ???.. Whoa! I'll try to keep to the film??.. However the film left me unamused as Rafelson's directing has lost the (little) charm it had in 1981. And it is pretty obvious that he is not up to Rob Reiner when it comes to getting absolutely the maximum of possibilities out of the Actors.Reiner's `A Few Good Men' is one of the few court-house dramas to keep me interested to the very end. Arthur Miller's `Twelve Just Men' is the only other film of this type which comes to my mind at this moment. Under Reiner's directing Nicholson probably plays one of his best rôles, certainly the most convincing one I can remember seeing him in. His playing of a Colonel in the Marines is spot on; you feel you identify with that kind of upper-crust navy man. But opposite him he has Tom Cruise excelling himself as a young military lawyer partnered by a magnificent Demi Moore in perhaps the best part I have seen her in. Really good stuff here: gripping story with superb directing.I have seen each of these films at least twice, and with confidence feel I can say that `A Few Good Men' is not only the better film, but also it is where Jack Nicholson redeems himself and comes up trumps ? amen better directing and excellent camera-work; the ending scenes are highly memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soft-core pornography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure what to make of the title, so I'll assume that it had more to do with the book. Nicholson does a fairly good job of acting, but it is clear that this character doesn't belong in his class of eleven Oscar nominations.Lange is stunningly beautiful in this movie, and she isn't afraid to flaunt it in "The Postman Always Rings Twice." Some of the sex scenes are reminiscent of Basic Instinct--which is to say that Nicholson and Lange actually did participate in sexual acts during the filming (it's all on the tape!).I fear, however, that some of their scenes give the wrong image of the average woman. If a woman begins to fight off a sexual attack, one would assume that it isn't welcome. This isn't the case with Cora, though, and the scenes tend to be shot like the rape scene in "Straw Dogs" with a little bit of "Body of Evidence" thrown in to keep it legal.As for the plot, I would have to look to Tarantino to draw a comparison. There are several twists and turns, as well as many little strange things thrown in here or there to keep it mildly entertaining. I will, however, refrain from drawing a parallel between this director (Rafelson) and Tarantino; primarily because a Tarantino film is captivating as a result of action and suspense, whereas this movie was simply soft-core pornography with a strange title.</fullReview>
