		<fullReview>This movie changed my life. It changed it in the sense that after seeing it I developed a life-long passion for Italian films after first seeing it in 1955 when it appeared at a local movie theatre in a revival five years or so after its original appearance. I was only 13 at the time and somewhat of a precocious chooser of what films to go see. I have seen THE BICYCLE THIEF ("Bicycle Thieves" in England and plural as well in its original Italian title) hundreds of times since and never tire of it. The fact that the film has almost never been out of circulation since its making and is constantly shown in revivals, festivals and film classes attests to its endurance. Martin Scorsese does a glorious appreciation of it in his documentary on the Italian cinema, IL MIO VIAGGIO IN ITALIA. What makes it so enduring? What is so damn great about the movie? It is not its trenchant portrayal of post-war Italian poverty and misery. Lots of films did that even better. It is not in any sense of real drama, which is very schematic. Nor even the unforgettably truthful acting, that iconic face of pint-sized Enzo Staiola. We get truthful acting and iconic faces all over the place. It is, I believe, its sense of compassion, its sense of poetry. Those are rarer qualities. The movie is compassionate poetry. I don't know if writer Cesare Zavattini or director Vittorio De Sica would have appreciated that phrase. I feel they might have. I feel it is exactly the truth they were after. To be sure, the film is a story of father and little-boy in search of what is lost, a necessity yes, but also a lost dream. The endangered hope for a better life to come challenges this paternal/filial relationship. In that sense, this is a film-poem, God help me, about Everyfather and Everylittleboy. The most chilling moment in the poem occurs when little Bruno sees his father steal, and a tearful horror glazes his face as a god seems to collapse. The most redemptive moment comes shortly thereafter when the boy slips his hand into his father's. That forgiveness is not cheap or facile. It is unassailable and all-comforting. It is a forgiving embrace of Virgilian dignity. For a magnificent instant the father, Antonio, has become the son; Bruno, the son, has become the father. At the end, when they walk off into the Roman crowd, they are as one. I have written many thoughts about this film over the years, including an extended exegesis for a local newspaper. I have programmed it in film series, shown it to film classes, Italian classes. I know the movie. Friends, the movie is not about stolen bicycles, indifferent police, bicycle chop-shop gargoyles, mouth-foaming lowlife, desperate actions by the desperate, or mere journalistic human interest that is gone with tomorrow's edition. Its worth resides in its lyric portrayal of the eternal curative power of love. No small thing.Two addenda: the song being rehearsed at the workers' club Antonio visits to see his friend is called "Ciccio Formaggio." The song being sung and played by the restaurant musicians when Antonio and his son eat together is "Tummuriata nera," about the mulatto offspring of an Italian woman and a black soldier. The lyrics for both songs, in Neapolitan dialect, can be found by Googling the titles. Recordings by Roberto Murolo of both songs are available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet Desperation---Italian Style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In post-World War II Italy poverty is a dire reality for a large portion of the population. Work is scarce and the opportunities for employment are few and far between. "Ladri Di Biciclette" (translated "The Bicycle Thief") is quietly one of the finest films ever produced. It follows one economically distraught man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who is heading down a desperate path fast. Things look up when he gets a job putting posters on walls in town, but he must sell what few meager possessions he and his family have to buy a bicycle to uphold his end of the business bargain. Naturally tragedy strikes immediately as the title character shows up the very first day Maggiorani is on the job. The police are little help, believing the bicycle is not as important as it really is. Thus Maggiorani and young son Enzo Staiola take it upon themselves to look all over town to try and find the bicycle and bring the thief to justice. "The Bicycle Thief" was originally released in 1948 and won an Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film the following year (the movie was not released in the U.S. until 1949). It is still a production that strikes deep even today. The lengths and desperate measures that some go through is very evident here. Director Vittorio De Sica crafts a film that is much deeper than it appears on the surface. It examines the human condition and questions society, family, law enforcement, alliances and mental anguish perfectly. "The Bicycle Thief" is an excellent production that has aged well and allows the viewer to think about many subjects that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt Drama of Post WWII Poverty a Must-See...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian neo-realist film movement began around the end of WWII with Roberto Rossellini's OPEN CITY in 1946. It is defined and encapsulated by this striking film directed by Vittorio De Sica. THE BICYCLE THIEF is the best of a group of films that depicted the hardship and despair that Europeans, specifically Italians, went through after the death and destruction of the war. The economy was horrible, and the towns and cities were half-destroyed and decaying. Rome is the location for THE BICYCLE THIEF and De Sica shoots the city in grainy black and white with non-professional actors to get a simple, yet unbearingly emotional point across. A simple thing such as a bike can be someone's entire world at that time and losing it means doing something irrational or perhaps necessary.The lead in the film is played by Lamberto Maggiorani who seems to be a very good actor. He is not an actor, however, and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically. Maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. His job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over Rome. He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him. Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city, a sign of joy to some, a representation of their own lowly status to others.When the bicycle is actually stolen, the "title" character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son (Enzo Staiola), a little kid with so much acting ability, you swear this must be a documentary. A grueling search throughout Rome has the essential parts of the movie, because we see up close the actual people and places the neo-realist film movement came to represent. It is a small, sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live. The father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son. Will he do the honorable thing or will he do what his mind and heart know is only possible? These are the tense moments of the film's climax.There is a lot of THE BICYCLE THIEF in Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and some obvious comparisons have been drawn because of the father-son relationship. They are worthy of comparison and have equal artistic prowess. What is different about THIEF is the level of intensity maintained throughout. I felt the key element was the music by Alessandro Cicognini, a simple horn that plays so tragically that it is a main character in the picture. What De Sica does here, as well as other neo-realist directors (Rossellini, Fellini), is create for American audiences a powerful counterpoint to what we are used to. An honest, non-corporate portrait of the struggle for life and self-respect. THE BICYCLE THIEF is one of the finest films ever made.RATING: 10 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one to add to my top 50- a delicate study of desperation in post war Italy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vittorio De Sica's ground/heartbreaking motion picture, The Bicycle Thief, is based on a very simple ideal for a story- man against the elements. In this case the elements are of a society that is often cruel and unforgiving, and that a job in post-war Rome is looked on as the luckiest of good luck charms.Such a man as presented by De Sica is Maggiorani (an actor who really is the type of actor right off the street), a father of a little boy who gets a job putting up movie posters along some walls in Rome. To do this he needs a bicycle, or the job will be lost, and he gets one following a pawning of linen sheets. Very soon though, the bicycle is stolen, and from there a sad downward spiral unravels for the man and his son as they scour the streets for the bicycle. While the score adds basic dramatic tension, everything else on the screen is done to such a pitch of neo-realism it's at times shattering, joyful (scene in the pizzeria the most note-worthy), and with a feeling of day-to-day resonance to those who may have not even felt at or below the poverty level in their lives. Credit due to all parties involved, though I don't think the boy Bruno, played by Staiola, gets nearly enough considering his role as a minor coming of age (that moment after the father and son leave the church nearly brought tears to my eyes).

		<fullReview>It is post-war Rome and much of the city's residents are impoverished and desperate for work. One man named Ricci who haunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, when suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job. The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle in order to feed his family. Thus begins `The Bicycle Thief', Vittorio de Sica's gritty study in realism. Ricci and his wife sell the sheets off of their beds to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day on the job. In order to keep the job, he and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work. de Sica chose non-actors to portray the characters in the film, favoring a further realistic vision by casting amateurs. The result is remarkable, because the pain and emotions conveyed are so true. The relationship between father and son is also compelling and endearing, in that for the most part, Ricci treats his son as an equal, letting him in on his innermost thoughts and fears, until the end, when a particular event causes him to be ashamed, and the roles become defined once again. `The Bicycle Thief' personifies the refreshing fact that European cinema was more daring and also true in their reaction to post-war life. While America was trying to paint a heavy coat of rosy paint on the times by churning out the saccharine MGM musicals by the dozen, Europe was showing that the effects of a war fought on their home turf did not inspire moments of spontaneously breaking into song, or a choreographed dance number, rather life pretty much sucked, but survival, as difficult and ugly as it can be, is most important. `The Bicycle Thief' has been a critical favorite for decades, and for good reason. It is a must-see film for any cinephile.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....is the relationship of the father and son. Watch the film with your focus on the son, not the father. Watch what happens to the boy, what he sees, how he is influenced, his point of view. The father is so preoccupied with the bicycle he fails to see what is happening to his son. This is the strength of the film. Watch the boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord of the Rings fanatics should all watch this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Lord of the Rings and I respect people's right to obsess over whatever they wish. Nonetheless, it does often irritate the cynic in me that we're teaching a generation of kids that there is a distinct borderline between 'good' and 'evil', between 'justice' and 'injustice', that there exists such a thing as a 'hero', when in reality there is actually nothing of the sort.Ladri di Biciclette is a shining example of a film that demonstrates this fact. There is no distinction between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys'. At times we support one character, or the others. But there is never a line drawn between one side or the other because in reality, the only people we see here are simply human - flawed, corruptible and in this case, all suffering the same tragic fate. Our central character Antonio is obviously the protagonist, and he is obviously portrayed in such a way that our sympathies lie with him, but he is far from being a hero. He is simply used as the representation of the tragic misfortune that can befall mankind. This misfortune, also, is not depicted in any black-and-white sense. Antonio and his family's plight is not the only, or even necessarily the most desperate, in this film. In fact, with the exception of the family in the restaurant scene, practically every single character, major or minor, is portrayed as suffering in some way at the hands of capitalism.Therefore, as obviously tragic as Antonio's story is, the only real reason we side with him is because his particular tragedy is centrally focused. But, as has been discussed so often previously, he is an Everyman character. The bicycle in the film is simply used as an analogy for the loss, or lack of any essential element of life that leads to poverty and suffering. In very simple terms, the film's message is essentially that at some stage in life, we are all shouting "Give me back my bicycle!" But I digress. This simplistic and amateurish film is far more real and far more true-to-life than practically anything that Hollywood has churned out in the past fifty years. For that reason, the realist in me believes that all those dreamers, people who believe in a happy ending or ideal status quo, could do with the sort of down-to-earth lesson that this film represents.Yes, it's a distressing and bleak vision. But nevertheless, an utterly profound one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest neorealism film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bicycle Thief is without a doubt De Sica's masterpiece of Italian neorealism filmmaking. It is a true landmark in cinema history.A man who has been unemployed for months is finally given a chance at a job putting up posters. He and his family have been living in poverty for months, and are very exited to hear the news. The only requirement for the job is a bicycle. His wife pawns the sheets off of their own bed in order to buy the bicycle. And, as you can tell from the title, it is stolen on his first day of work. Now, without it, he and his son search the crowded streets of Rome for the only thing that can give him back his dignity as a man.This is a simple, but very powerful film and I found the relationship between Bruno and his father especially touching. The final scene is a true captivating moment as Bruno witnesses the true nature of man and the world we have created for ourselves.Don't miss this film, to call it a classic would be an understatement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film of real life, real emotions, real people. Bicycle Thieves was a film like no other because it was made like no other. With non actors, natural light, filmed on locations, the film captured the truth of Neorealism. The film is made up of a series of "small moments." The fact is, the entire movie is made up of pureness. It tackles issues of class, politics, and post war activities. Overall, the film is about life and hope. The unhappy ending only makes the film more real. If you are a son who loved his father and understood who he was and why he was the way he was........watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The path to eternal salvation becomes obvious only through true understanding of human emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Semantically speaking, self-realization is a probable prelude to catharsis, but at a much higher echelon of cognition the two become virtually inseparable as attaining the former would automatically yield the latter. At this threshold of enlightenment, human spirit attains a sense of ephemeral divinity that would either drive the human crazy or would lead him to salvation. This enlightenment can seldom be attained through vicarious means. Even cinema, with its unparalleled potential to stimulate and satiate, mostly falls short of being cathartic, and only in the rarest of the rare cases does it manage to accomplish the incredible and the extraordinary. Undoubtedly, Bicycle Thieves is one such rare moment of triumph, wherein cinema becomes not only the tool but also the medium for the viewer to attain eternal salvation. Bicycle Thieves is an Italian neo-realist film by Vittorio De Sica. Neo- realism, a naturalistic movement in Italian cinema of the 1940s, aimed at giving cinema a new degree of realism, which promoted the use of an amateur cast vis-?-vis a professionally trained one and advocated shooting at real locations instead of the custom-built sets &amp; studios. Keeping up with the spirit of the movement, Vittorio De Sica chose a factory fitter who had brought his son along for an audition as his male lead. His lead actress was a journalist who had approached him for an interview, while the young boy was filled by a child spotted in the crowd watching the filming. Bicycle Thieves tells the story of a poor worker searching the streets of Rome for his stolen bicycle, which he needs to keep his job intact. The movie is an amalgam of contrasting human feelings of hope &amp; despair, sacrifice &amp; gratification, euphoria &amp; melancholy, love &amp; detestation, and malice &amp; benevolence. Bicycle Thieves performs the central function of art, which is to discover the meaning of life. The movie brilliantly handles with utmost care and precision the tender and often painful relationship that universally exists between a father and a son. The later half of the movie presents cinema at its most vivid, vituperative and volatile culminating in one of the most impactful, melancholic and brutally humanistic finales ever filmed in cinematic history, the agony of which would keep the viewer contemplating for weeks, months, or even years. The screenplay is simplistic, thought-provoking and at times nakedly brutal, while the cinematography is so effortless and magnificently beautiful that it appears as though a soul of a man has been filmed, and its true essence has been captured and preserved. The poignancy of the background score casts such a sustained spell that the movie experience is enhanced beyond imagination. American playwright Arthur Miller called it a lyrical masterpiece as it examines openly the destructive and draconian world man has made for himself. Marlon Brando once said, "Bicycle Thieves is the perfect example of what can be done in front of the motion picture camera and is so rarely done". Academy winner, Henry Fonda was so moved by the movie that he was tempted to write Vittorio De Sica a fan letter. The film is frequently on critics' and directors' lists of the best films ever made. It has captured every honor that the world of film can bestow including an Academy Honorary Award in 1950.All these accolades and the ubiquitous acclaim cannot describe the actual experience of seeing this film and becoming a part of its emotional impact. It makes the viewer laugh, cry and experience a rainbow of emotions. Bicycle Thieves has withstood the test of time for over six decades, and is a film for anyone and everyone.PS. It is a cinematic magnum opus, which accentuates the true might of cinema, and is a must for everyone, irrespective of cast, color, creed or gender. It's an ageless cinema for people of all age groups. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you are merely a moderate fan of cinema you will have at least heard of this film. It has been hailed as a masterpiece for just short of sixty years and has been routinely studied in film classes everywhere. In a sense, it is one of the recognized masterpieces of cinema. And yet, this is not a film in which to pick up obviously great shots like the 360 degree shot in the hotel room in "Vertigo" or cuts as good as the jump cut in "2001: A Space Odyssey" with which Kubrick transports you from prehistoric ages to an age in which space travel is common in barely a second. This is a subtle, realistic film, and though it looks terrific, it is not flashy. It exists not to excel technically or tell the story of humanity, but simply to tell a story. A simple story which may say more about human nature than any other film in existence."Bicycle Thieves" is about a man in economically depressed post-World War II Italy who is lucky enough to find a job which requires him to use a bicycle as transportation while putting up posters around the city. It's relatively well-paying and almost too good to believe for his family. While on the job his bicycle is stolen, and the rest of the movie tells the story of him and his son attempting to recover the bicycle. In the magnificent final scene Antonio Ricci (the lead character) finds himself tempted to steal a bicycle in order to be able to perform his job. Here we have our 'hero' thinking about doing to someone else what was done to him. There is no black and white in the world, no good and evil. This film does a great job of stating that fact without moralizing and preaching like so many modern films do. This film does not insult your intelligence and I pity those who wanted a third act, or those who wanted more explanation. This film is beautiful and brilliant because it is completely understated. It's realistic. We feel Ricci's desperation and are transported into 1940's Rome as he makes his way through the city's crowded streets, alleyways, churches and brothels.I have no idea how much this film cost to make, but I would be surprised if it was made on a low budget. The location shooting throughout the city is impressive, as is the (again) understated cinematography. De Sica cast non-actors in the lead roles, and I find their performances to be among the most realistic and effective I've ever seen. Alessandro Cigognini's score is a highlight of the film, and I consider the melancholy main theme one of the greatest musical cues I've heard in any film.I enjoy theatricality as much as anyone and I certainly don't dislike Hollywood gloss, but "Bicycle Thieves" serves as a jarring reminder of how great a medium film can be. The jarring effect the film had on audiences upon its release (in particular American audiences) is easy to understand viewing the film in 2007 and it escapes my comprehension how anyone can't be completely captivated and enthralled by this masterwork.****/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films try to explain multiple aspects of a story or a character by showing several episodes from the character's life. Vittorio De Sica's masterful The Bicycle Thief relies on the power of simplicity to drive home its point. It is a very simple film, relying on film making at its basics. There are no professional actors for us to identify with, but there are plot lines, emotions, and thoughts that no one can help but relate to. Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) has been waiting for a job, but when one finally arrives, he must obtain a bicycle in order to be able to accept the position. His loving and caring wife, Maria (Lianella Carell), hocks the bed sheets in order to be able to afford a bicycle for Antonio. He reports to work as a poster hanger, but while on the job for only a short time, the bike is stolen by a young thief (Vittorio Antonucci). Desperate to get the vehicle back, Antonio seeks the aid of his friend, Baiocco (Gino Saltamerenda), and also receives the help of his devoted son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola). Bruno stays by Antonio's side, no matter what, determined to help his father get back the stolen property. It is a frustrating journey for the father and son, as they receive no help, except that of Baiocco. It seems that no matter what they do, Antonio is left with a fateful decision (shown in one of the most brutally honest scenes in any movie I've ever seen). He must ask himself just how far would he go to put food on the table for his family that he loves so much? There has been controversy over the ending of the film, which I am not going to go into, because it would be cheating you out of a brilliant ending to an extraordinary picture. However, I will say this much - When viewing The Bicycle Thief, ask yourself what you would do in Antonio's situation. What choices would you make? Some of the questions that rise from this film are some of the questions that help us to define ourselves as people, and the fact that this film provides such a clear and honest representation of so many facts of life is what makes it an undeniable masterpiece! This is a film to be cherished!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much that can be said about "The Bicycle Thief" that hasn't already been expressed. It is considered a great work of the Italian cinema, and looking at it in its 1999 release version, one can see why.Structurally, it's a theme and variations, with such a simple, clearly stated main motif that one can identify and follow its mutations with no effort. DeSica is clearly the fine craftsman here, directing every scene with a beautiful sense of control and balance. His work with young Enzo Staiola (as Bruno) is especially commendable, and he allows then nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani (as Antonio) and Lianella Carell (as Marie) to act in a model of naturalism. Carlo Montuori's photography is brilliant, and Antonio Traverso's production design is pungent and atmospheric. Like most "masterpieces," a film-classic score provides emotional depth in a subliminal way: here it's a romantic, Italianesque original composition by Aessandro Cicognini wraps up the entire production.DeSica's career is most impressive, being involved in nealy 200 films, 165 of them as an actor. This film remains one of his greatest achievements. It seems to be standing the test of time very nicely, too. It's been criticized, sometimes quite severely, and just continues to bounce back, winning new admirers with each reissue. The public just won't let "The Bicycle Thief" fade away. That alone tends to override any negative factors. It looks like this film is going to be around for quite a while. ###</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw "Ladri di Biciclette" I was still infatuated with the idea that all the known movie masterpieces must be regarded as untouchable ideals, that the film is definitely "good" -&gt;end of story! But while I was watching the movie("Ladri di Biciclette") the true sensibility of the characters and of the shooting technique astonished me! The plot is simple but touching, the actors react naturally. Although the times they are living are awful, Antonio and Bruno lift themselves over the daily cares (they do have strong characters) and the father and son relationship is more than believable!!! I've never seen actors understanding each other better, and I don't mean it on a stage level! The looks on their faces when they should cry, but they don't, the famous take when father and son are standing on the sidewalk one thinking about the other, and what is left to be done! But what is most touching is the scene from the end, when Bruno's look actually saves his father from prison. The man who's bike was stolen shows that some people are human even in the darkest of times.This is movie to be seen, a movie that will make you wonder about the boundaries of humanity, the power of a character and even dare you to think of the mistakes that society makes you commit in order to survive!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Italian Neorealism has always been one of my favorite film movements, and The Bicycle Thief appears to be one the finest examples of this medium. While people today might not understand the power in the story, one has to understand the nature state of Italy after World War II. The country was in ruins, and finding a good job was difficult. Desperation took over more often than reason, and this leads to the eventual climax of self pity and remorse. Quite a powerful film, for it is the only foreign film I have on my personal Top 25 list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartbreaking Masterpiece of the Italian Neo-Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the post-war Rome, after more than two-year unemployment, the family man Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) finally finds a disputed job position putting up posters that requires having a bicycle. However, he needs to retrieve his bicycle in the pawn shop but he does not have money. His wife Maria (Lianella Carell) pawns their bed sheets and uses the money to recover the precious bicycle. Antonio envisions a better life for his family with his salary, overtime and benefits. Unfortunately, his bicycle is stolen on the first working day. Antonio and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) spend the Sunday chasing the bicycle and the thief on the streets of Rome."Ladri di Biciclette" is a heartbreaking masterpiece of the Italian Neo- Realism and one of the best movies of cinema history ever. This is the third time that I watch this unforgettable film that makes me sad with the desperation of Antonio and his lack of perspective in the end. There are memorable touching scenes, like Bruno eating pizza in the restaurant wearing a torn coat and contrasting with the wealthy family; or the happiness of the clumsy Antonio putting up the poster of Rita Hayworth in "Gilda"; or the indecision of Bruno between a dish of soup in the church or chasing the old man with his father; or the shame of Antonio in the end. The DVD released in Brazil by Spectra Nova has good quality of image, subtitles in yellow but no Extras. The DVD released by Versátil uses the same matrix of Spectra Nova but with subtitles in white, and it is difficult the reading by the viewer. However, there are many Extras. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Ladr?es de Bicicleta" ("Thieves of Bicycle")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers One of the simplest movies ever made, yet one of the most poignant. Of particular note is the title of the film, which serves, in retrospect, to illustrate deSicca's main point. In English, the singular title "The Bicylce Thief" causes the viewer to question who really is the bicycle thief in the movie? It is logical to conclude that the title refers to the main character, whom the film closely chronicles. But to call the hopeless, dejected character, with whom the viewer has empathized for the entire movie, a thief would be ludicrous, unless- by calling such a man a "thief"- deSicca is making a more powerful commentary on an inability to define a person or his actions as absolutely good or absolutely evil- the two terms are not mutually exclusive, as there is a blurring between the two that occurs when other factors are considered. The title serves as a reminder that not all criminals are evil- some have been motivated out of good intentions and desperation. In the end, the viewer is forced to make a jarring comparison between the "thief" who stole the main char's bicycle and the main char, himself. The irony of the situation causes the viewer to realize his own hypocrisy. Though we formerly considered the first thief to be petty and evil for ruining the main char's life, we can no longer hold such a judgment of him after witnessing the main char do the same- an act which the viewer considers sympathetically. The change in judgment toward the first "thief" which the viewer is forced to make at the film's conclusion is a reminder to the viewer that one's awareness of the circumstances governing a situation can dramatically change one's assessment of the situation. The Italian, plural title "Ladri di Biciclette" serves to generalize the crime, desperation, degradation, to everyman in post-war Italy. I also loved this movie for the portrayed father-son relationship. The little boy did an excellent job in portraying a boy who attempts to act like a grown up in order to help, and therefore gain the approval of, his father.However, by the end of the movie we are reminded that the boy is just a boy (which the father seems to forget at intervals, but realizes when he offers to take him for pizza, etc.). The father also has a dilemma- and not just that he bears the burden of providing for his family monetarily, but that he must provide moral teaching and an example as well. Moreover, the filial relationship serves to better illustrate the theme of blurred definitions of good and evil. The boy's black-and-white ideas on good and evil is juxtaposed with the reality of post-war Italy, in which there can not be such a clear distinction between the two terms-"good" people are forced to do "bad" acts in order to survive. The two different moral characterizations are forced to converge in the young boy, himself, when he witnesses his own father commit a crime. The boy is forced to grow up too soon- i.e., to abandon his absolute views on good and evil in favor of the grey reality in order to grant his father forgiveness. The ending of the film illustrates that though a child may constantly seek approval and confirmation from his father, the approval which a father must seek from his son, though far more subtle and less obvious, plays an equally important and intrinsic role in filial relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Is Not Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Life was Beautiful, life was bleak and depressing, as depicted in de Sica's classic example of Italian Neorealism. Ricci finally finds a job after the war that requires a bicycle, but when his is stolen, he searches Rome for the one thing that he thinks can give his family happiness. Stark and gritty, the film comes off almost as a documentary, with unprofessional actors showing true skill as you come to really feel and hope for the characters. de Sica's does a fantastic job in both depicting the visual beauty of Italy, as well as establishing anticipation and excitement through quick cuts, especially in the climax. Although mostly unscripted, the film's story makes this a must see as a father and a son bond while searching for hope. Punctuated by the Hollywood taboo of an unhappy ending, Ricci must become the thing that he hates most in order to help his family, and show what kind of an example he is for his son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good man who has been failed by everything around him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I was a brilliant film critic so that I could write something monumental to this monumental film. It is absolutely one of the best films ever made. Perhaps the best film ever made. Thank God for TCM and Robert Osbourn. Together they have brought obscure masterpieces right into our living rooms so that we can discover the global genius that is film making around the world. The Bicycle Thief is about desperation in post WWII Italy. After a man wins the job lottery putting up posters of Rita Hayworth around Rome, on his first day at work his only essential tool of trade, his bicycle, is stolen. What ensues to the end of the movie is a desperate, tension filled, search for the thief who stole it, and ultimately the recovery of his bicycle. He is accompanied on his search by his 7 year old son. The two actors who play these roles are not professional actors and yet they turn in performances of the century. The plot points, direction, writing, and cinematography, of this masterpiece are without equal. The portrayal of the misery and desperation of those who survived WWII leaves a pit in your stomach. Most profound is the relationship between the father and son and their journey together to find his stolen bicycle so that he can make money and feed his family again. This is a movie without a climax. And that's a big part of what makes it great. The ending is something you could never imagine, and will never forget once you've experienced it. I will only say one more thing about it's conclusion. There are some things more heartbreaking than the tragic loss of life. In this movie, that "something more heartbreaking than the tragic loss of life", is the tragedy of continuing to live after you've lost everything. This is the saddest film I have ever seen and that includes Old Yeller and Where the Red Fern Grows. But it is a magnificent film and should be seen by everyone. It has left a mark on me that will never go away. And in every respect, it very well could be one of the greatest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that won't be easily forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films made in Italy. While not "the best movie ever", it is one of the all-time greats.'Ladri di biciclette' is more than just a movie, it's a way of life and what it contains is forever significant. I'm taking about its solid, tragic and realistic story. Yes, it's a fairly basic plot which could never be described as "exciting" or "feel-good" but that isn't (and it never was) a priority. No, its priority is the heart and soul that was put into it.What we got here is a strongly sentimental movie and one that is very pessimistic and brings back the intense feeling of bad luck and failure.Cinematography is generally pleasant, capturing a decent amount of Rome's streets and areas. To me, the scenario is one of the most important things in a movie.Amazingly, the cast consists in unprofessional actors but you can never tell that in the movie. If I didn't know, I could easily think they were real actors. They are so authentic and dedicated that it's fairly natural to see them as normal/professional artists.Lamberto Maggiorani's performance as Antonio Ricci is superb, a prodigy non-professional actor.Enzo Staiola is just as splendid as Ricci's cute son Bruno. He is so expressive and genuine. The character Bruno is a loving kid who follows his "daddy" wherever he goes and does whatever "daddy" says without saying a word but that doesn't prevent him from looking tenderly at his father.The guy in the film is literally out of luck. After having been (predictably) unemployed for a long time, he finally gets himself a job only to have his bicycle robbed in his new job's 1st day. When his bike is robbed, nobody helps him or gives a damn about him aside a friend of his and Bruno. But when he is the one robbing a bike, he is not only chased but caught, slapped, threatened and humiliated in public by an angry crowd. His one and only saving-grace in this situation is the fact that the bike's owner feels compassion on poor Bruno when he sobs.That ending is easily one of the most memorable in a film ever, it's just so heartwrenching and profound.Title in Portugal: 'Ladr?es de Bicicletas'.</fullReview>

I'm waiting for the day when someone will overstep the limit this film has signed, but I don't think that day will come, because you can't surpass perfection.

		<shortDescription>Marxism Or Nihilism?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Rome, Italy in 1948, the economy is depressed and jobs are very few. A former bricklayer manages to get a job putting up posters, but he needs his bicycle back from a pawn shop, and trades in his bedding for it. On the first day of his job, a young man finds his bicycle and steals it. The man, who has a wife, son, and baby, desperately searches for it.The man goes to the police, but can do no more than file a complaint, and they won't waste valuable time looking for a stolen bicycle. His young son helps him, along with some dopey friends of his, but no luck. They go to a church, to a clairvoyant, and get no results. Even finding the thief fails-they cannot prove he did it. The movie ends with the man broken by his sufferings.The movie is said to be Marxist, but it is difficult to understand why. The implied message is that the law, elected politicians, the church, even a group of political agitators, give this poor man no relief. The movie tells what doesn't help the protagonist, but does not say what would. The movie may attack religion, democracy, and capitalism, but that is all it does. A relic rather than a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Universal Masterpiece ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lamartine, a French writer and poet said once : "Sometimes, when one person is missing, the whole world seems depopulated", I guess in the case of "Bicycle Thieves", Vittorio De Sica's gripping masterpiece of neo-realism, one can say that sometimes, when one object is missing, the whole world seems totally unlivable.The story is simple, as it often is for the greatest films. It's about a man named Ricci, who just got a job in a post-War unemployment-stricken Roma. The community's hopelessness weakened its fraternal spirit as illustrated by these human queues protesting when only one's got a job. And that day seems to be Ricci's day : he will start working as a hanger-poster, all he needs is a bicycle. Having just pawned his, Ricci's reaction quickly betrays him, but from the crowd's opportunistic cries, he realizes he'd better shut his mouth and do the best to get his bicycle back.The film relevantly alternates between social commentary and family drama, through a powerful depiction of the solidarity that could only prevail within the family in these times. The wife, Maria, without hesitation strips the sheets from the marital bed : they would replace the bicycle in the pawn shop. The never ending shot of the man climbing the ladder full of other used sheets, is a strong reminder of the hardship endured in these days where even sheets were secondary.In another interesting scene, Ricci waits for Maria who visits a Wise Woman. Impatiently enthusiastic, he joins her upstairs while asking two kids to watch the bicycle. Maria came to pay for the prediction that Ricci would get a job, but he prevents her from 'wasting her money', as a practical man. However, when you measure the length of the human queue that visits the Wise woman, you understand how far from practicality people could be pushed by despair, while superstition was the only guidance one could seek. Ricci didn't need that, he had a job. On many levels, the scene is interesting, as we wonder if Ricci's intervention could have foreshadowed the theft, expecting from the title and the misleading cheerful mood, that the bicycle would be stolen when he'll come downstairs. But this would have been too predictable.The following day, Ricci rides his bicycle, carrying a ladder. Every time we get to see him on a bicycle, there's a sensation of freedom, driven by an exhilarating fast motion. But fate chose Ricci as the unfortunate victim of a meticulously set-up stealing. We only have a quick glance on the thief, but Ricci's reaction sweeps it off, and sets up the dramatic element that will never desert the film. Ricci knows what this terrible loss means. He comes back by bus, ignoring the queue, and peoples' protests. The next day, starts a long quest for the stolen bicycle with Ricci and his son, Bruno, a plucky funny-looking little boy, who makes the duo look like a dramatic reminiscence of Chaplin and his Kid, with a new father-and-son dimension that will be the heart of the film.And in this journey that immortalized the Roma that was just healing its War hounds, queues take a particular significance as an allegory of Ricci's condition: a man isolated in his own despair struggling against a system that makes an outcast of him, or worse, an agitator. In a church, Ricci 'harasses' the only man he previously flashed with the stealer, unluckily frail and old. After a long unsuccessful search, Ricci almost wisely resigns and takes Bruno to the restaurant. For a brief moment, Ricci smiles again and lets Bruno drink a few wine. The restaurant scene represents a pivotal moment when Bruno realizes his personal contrast with the richer kid who can eat spaghetti, and Ricci reconsiders with a mathematical precision how providential and indispensable were the job and the bicycle.Ricci's only chance is superstition, an euphemism for luck. "Find it now, or it'll be lost forever" the Wise Woman implacably says. And in an unpredictable twist, Ricci meets the thief, right after the visit and he's the one, as his defensive reaction shows. Ricci violently gets him off a brothel, with the fierceness of a man who won't let his prey escape. De Sica's direction is masterful as it makes Ricci, following the tragic irony that governed his journey, look like a bully to the people of the neighborhood and the epileptic stroke of the suspected kid made Ricci even more detestable.Ricci endured hostility, he lost his bicycle and his pride, he faces a situation where his heart is full of hatred and where he has nothing to lose. If a thief can get through this, so be it. Tortured by his conscience, he finally asks Bruno to take the tram and steals a bicycle parked in a cleared place. But this is not Ricci's day at all, and the climactic sequence after making my heart pound, literally melted it when the by-standers stopped Ricci and started treating him like a bug, with the sad and tear-jerking cries of poor Bruno that saved him from jail, but not from the insults.De Sica deliberately hired non-professionals as to amplify the film's neo-realistic aspect. I couldn't believe it as Lamberto Maggiorani's face embodies to perfection the raw and brutal condition of an average man facing an unfair hostility. And as he walked hand in hand with poor Bruno into the sunset, with Alessandro Cicognini's penetrating score, two things cuts straight into my heart : first, I had just watched one of the saddest but greatest dramas ever. Secondly, considering the father-and-son relationship, Bruno learned in one day what it took to be a man with responsibilities, and how cruel the world could be, so maybe the only light of hope is that despite everything, Bruno still loved and respected his father ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In both the arts and reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vittorio De Sica's Ladri di Biciclette (1948) touches us deeply in the spirit as if its moving images on the screen were made of the same material of our soul. We connect and relate; this movie tells us what we are and what we truly care among human things. The loss of the bicycle is for Antonio and his family an immense tragedy, their dreams of a better life are stolen; like every time we lose something or is taken away which could prevent from poverty and sufferance. It is in these magnificent films that we best see and know ourselves and feel relate to other people beyond the simple psychology of social provenience ? it's just a film, but by watching it we look up on the most beautiful reflector of excellence and come close a little more to the understanding on how to become better persons; in both the arts and reality, it is an act of love. The musical score by Alessandro Cicognini is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sad Slice of LIfe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a masterwork. After years I can still see the images. Once I had children, it became even more to me. This is a microcosm of what it must have been like in postwar Axis countries. There is widespread unemployment, everyone trying to scrape a living. This man and his wife try to find a way to keep going; they have so little. Even though things are hard, the little boy, Bruno, idolizes his father. The final scene is about as gut wrenching as anything ever put on film. It is not sentimental as some say; it is painful. We have a man of great morals driven by forces over which he has no control, but that isn't going to matter. The options are starvation and abandonment. It's interesting how the crowds that judge this man counter the efforts he has made. The film is grueling and despairing. The thing is that it is so human. The bad guys seem to be winning all the time. The universe is indifferent and harsh. This movie is extremely well acted and there are great scenes that can be analyzed over and over. It is visually striking with great symbolic references. Ultimately it is just so human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Praise for the masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead..There are many different aspects portrayed in the movie. Most of these can be personally related to by a person who has lived a low/middle class life. The first aspect is the frustration arising from loss of something petty in the view of the world, but essential for one's life. The father and son seem to be alone in the world looking for their bicycle. Initially, they did have friends, but gradually as this movie beautifully shows, they are all alone. The whole world is indifferent to them or against them in their search for the bicycle. The movie is successful in developing pity and sympathy for the protagonist in the minds of all that watch the movie.The second aspect of the movie, which made me judge the movie as a masterpiece, is the father-son relationship. This relation has been picturized in a natural manner, but it magnificently captures many subtle emotions in the fathers-son relation. In an attempt to be explicit, I have listed these various emotions below:Son to father::1) How well the son understands his father's troubles and silently faces his problems (not complaining when he falls, resting himself without any complaints when tired)2) How the son tries to keep up with the expectations of his father (Trying to run as fast as he can, crossing streets hurriedly)3) How the son observes his father's problems and frustration (when he cleans himself after he falls with his father's handkerchief, and then the father uses it to wipe his face).4) How the son breaks when things seem completely out of control (Slap, Public beating of his father)Father to son::1) How father wishes to see a manly companion in his son (In all his search for bicycle, he assumes his son will follow him and help him. He takes his son for wine)2) How he is sandwiched between his long term problems (job etc) and his son's immediate problems of tiredness (he notices his son's tiredness time to time, but can't do anything abt it)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen and studied this particular film as a milestone in film history and a good example of Italian Neoclassical film, and as I can see it was a remarkable film for it's time, it still doesn't really last the test of time. The story is simple and universal, a man against society, pursuing justice and driven to defy his fate. At the time this was an unusual view of humanity. Now it surprises and reaches only those inexperienced in film. It's certainly a good example of it's genre, but it's no longer unique. Also,many may find the ending unsatisfying (as it may have been intended to be.) The film offers only a problem and no solution. However, it's characters are noteworthy. The main character, the father, is a struggling, moral every-day joe, and his son is an impressionable boy who at times seems more adult than his parent. In fact, if their personalities were swapped the outcome of the story may have been very different. It's a film I will not soon forget, but the only impression it makes is just another reminder of how horrible the world can really be.</fullReview>

It deserves to be a classic. And I also like to see Italian culture , people in that time. It does show how Italians act in a way.

		<shortDescription>Supremely downbeat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are other (Italian) movies that make me bawl more while watching them, but Vittorio De Sica's supremely downbeat Bicycle Thieves can hold its own in a "I'll never laugh again" kind of way. Telling the simple story of a man losing his bike and subsequently trying to find it, and sort of extrapolating it into society at large, De Sica provides a social commentary of a country either not working or working against you. I'm not going to pretend that I'm an Italian expert after three months here but I do think it captures the feel of Italy pretty well, and sadly, given the current state of affairs here the commentary still rings quite true on both a micro and macro level; comments about "nothing has changed" abounded in my company, like everyone I watched it with had had their bikes stolen or bought a stolen bike, and the unemployment is through the roof.Either way you don't really have to read too much into it, it's first and foremost a solid (melo)drama, and as such, De Sica does lay it on pretty thick, but it feels like such a humane work that I'm willing to let most of the overwroughtness slide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad movie about the harshness of post-war Italy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is considered to be a classic of Italian cinema. So far my look into Italian cinema has been awful to say the least (The Titanic Animated movies and Troll 2 were the only Italian films I have seen before this) I wanted to know what the best of their cinema is like because I have clearly seen the worst.The plot is that a man named Antonio Ricci found a job that was very difficult to get in those times. The job seems to get him a decent pay and might probably change his financial situation. The one condition of the job is that he must get a bike. They pawn their bedsheets to get the bike and on the first day of work, it is stolen. He can't do the job without it and the police can't help him find it. Antonio starts looking for it with his son, Bruno. He slowly starts to become more and more desperate to find the bike and it becomes more and more hopeless.I can see the emotional impact this may have had on some people. The movie is a very sad movie to try and slowly create and build on a feeling of hopelessness. This movie does do that very well and if you are looking at movies for escapism, then don't watch this movie. If however what you are looking for is a look into what life was like after WWII for Italians then this is definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father and son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reputation of this celebrated Italian neo-realism film preceded itself a little with me but on reflection I think I can understand why it is such a highly regarded movie. A comi- tragedy as opposed to a tragi-comedy, it has a very simple but well delineated narrative, with an ending of rare pathos and sadness.To watch this honest, hard-working and well-meaning family man brought down by wretched luck to the extent where in an act of desperation he debases himself in front of his adoring son, is almost like intruding on private grief. Earlier on in the film, before the father loses all hope in changing his fortunes, there are some nice comedic touches, with the young son "caught short" at one point and later when the father blunders into a brothel in pursuit of the bicycle thief, with his infant son in tow.This was my first experience of Italian neo-realism and while I more usually prefer some escapism with my movies, I was quite absorbed in the story here as it unravelled with an inevitable certainty which could never end up well, indeed I guessed that the father was going to lower his scruples by stealing a bike himself, long before he actually did.Yes, it does have some longueurs and the landscape of post-war Italy as well as a full understanding of the Italian psyche was difficult for me to naturally relate to, but the universal themes of honesty, self-respect, human dignity and of course father-son relationships shone through.The open-air cinematography was excellent, the background music was sympathetic to the action and the acting unsurprisingly wholly natural, engaging and involving, given that most of the participants were amateurs. The young lad playing the son, in particular gives the best performance by a child actor I think I've ever seen.For my tastes, I wouldn't include it in my list of favourite films, but can certainly appreciate its qualities and why it's so beloved of critics and cinema-lovers alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's interesting to see the street scenes, the apartments, the roadways and the buses in postwar Rome. Those scenes alone make the movie worth watching.But that's about it. The plot is minimalistic, the acting is passable, the pace is very slow, and the soundtrack is poor. There is some suspense initially in the movie, but when you realize that nothing really happens, the suspense rapidly falls away, while the drudgery continues. I have certainly seen worse movies than this over the years- it's not bad, just boring, very slow moving and somewhat pointless- but seeing reviewers claim it's one of the best of all time is beyond bizarre. I'm beginning to conclude that if a movie is dark, depressing, and soulless, it will resonate well with the so called "learned reviewers". Personally, I'd prefer some content.</fullReview>

It's a film of denunciation of a society where what for some is a trifle, for many others, as the protagonist of the story, is your tool to get the basics, food."Ladri Di Biciclette" is a film where hope and love triumph over evil and unfair everything end up being erased by magic with the words "Fine" On the contrary, the harsh reality of this wonderful work carries a taste bitter end to raise awareness certainly many viewers, and understand that life is but a contradictory game where victory is only a mere appearance.The film looks splendid black and white photography by Carlo Montuori and memorable soundtrack by Alessandro Cicognini ... and anecdotally assumed also the first film appearance of the great Sergio Leone making a brief appearance as chaplain sheltering from the sudden rain in the black market of Porta Portese, in the middle of the dramatic search.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable, grim depiction of the unfairness of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a precocious boy with a dullard of a father who has more than a touch of Attention Deficit Disorder.Ricci doesn't know how to prepare for contingencies and his family must suffer as he blunders along. Their livelihood depends on his retaining his bike -- and yet he leaves it too far away to seize back from a thief. (Was I alone in wondering whether he'd lose his son as well, as he bumbled around Rome on his search?) The pathos piles up in this film. You have the viciousness of people who won't lift a finger to help, though it's no skin off their back. The world is peopled with those who don't give a damn whether you live or starve. And there's brutal fate, which lets a punk get away with a crime and a family man get caught and humiliated.In many ways this film, which stunningly employs non-actors in the main roles, succeeds brilliantly. One of the few false notes is Ricci's seeking help from a sophisticate in the theater world. What did these two have in common that had made them friends? And it never was clear why the thief paid the old man. I also found the movie's ending to be shockingly abrupt.However, despite such quibbles, this is one indelible work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Italian masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only that, but a masterpiece of cinema. I do like foreign language movies, and for me Bicycle Thieves is one of those quintessential jewels of foreign language cinema. What makes me love Bicycle Thieves so much is the emotional impact. It is an incredibly touching movie, especially at the end which is so harsh and pessimistic yet very real that I can't help getting choked. It is not just the ending that is so achingly poignant, it is also the ironic humanism Bicycle Thieves has, and the film is also chilling in the scene when Bruno sees his father steal and redemptive in when Bruno slips his hand into his father's. Aside from the poignancy, the film is incredibly well made, with stunning photography, wondrous scenery and poetic symbolism. Alessandro Cicognini's score brings a dramatic intensity to the proceedings as well, and the Italian songs are wonderful. The script is both thought-provoking and philosophical(you live and you suffer), and the story follows or adopts a flow-of-life structure. The pace I have no problem with either, it is drawn-out but it is so deliberately to add to the neo-realism. Vittorio Di Sica directs impeccably and the acting is pretty much outstanding with Enzo Staiola delivering one of the most heart-breakingly believable child performances I have seen especially. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest motion pictures ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In defining the Italian neorealist era, Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (also known as The Bicycle Thief) is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. It stands as a work of profound emotion, highlighting human frailty, the importance of objects and the circle of morality by telling a beautifully simple and elegant story set in the bustling streets of Rome.This movie is truly a work of art, a real and concise piece of passionate filmmaking by De Sica. In a time where most motion pictures functioned as paths to escapism, especially in Hollywood, De Sica's realistic look at the Italian streets and at the poor stood in stark contrast to the glitz and glamour produced in major studios. His Bicycle Thieves is a lean film, utilizing the suffocating poverty of Italy in its post-war era as a defining factor.Lamberto Maggiorani stars as Antonio Ricci, a poor father and husband looking for work. He is given a job, but the conditions require that he has a bicycle. Together with his wife (Lianella Carell), Antonio sells some bedsheets and procures a bicycle to do the job. He is elated, as you might imagine, and becomes overjoyed at the prospects of earning money to help lift his family out of abject poverty.One day, while working at his job of posting Rita Hayworth posters in Rome, Ricci has his bicycle stolen. He becomes frantic in the search, going to the police and using the help of friends to find the stolen property. With his son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), he traipses through Rome in all conditions to track and hopefully recover his bicycle.Watching Maggiorani, who was a factory worker and not a trained actor of any kind, put life into Ricci is an astounding experience. The way he struggles, with himself and with the situation, to come up with a way to understand what has happened to him and to come up with a way to go on with his life is simply amazing. The bicycle is no mere object to Ricci. It represents his livelihood, his pride and his ability to pull his life out of the gutter to offer hope for his family.With this in mind, watching Ricci's desperate search through Rome takes on weight and urgency. As he pushes people aside to gather possible clues or to find people who may know where the thief is, we're with him every hurried step of the way. We're with him when he considers theft himself, too, and we see the distance growing between Ricci and Bruno as the man becomes more desperate and more upset.Bicycle Thieves is a wonderful motion picture in that it taps the realism of the streets and of human despair in ways that few other pictures ever have. Placing this film in the context of post-war Italy, a country burning with poverty and anguish, creates a deafening sense of trouble and sorrow for its characters. The raw emotion is inborn for this picture, as though the massive importance of the bicycle and what it means to Ricci simply never needs to be explained.From the relationship between Ricci and Bruno to the way Ricci elects to solve his problem, Bicycle Thieves is a movie filled with human frailty. It offers us a profound understanding of that frailty, treating it with respect and honour and dignity. The poor are not mere objects to shuffle aside, the thief is not a villain anymore when the story comes full circle and the lengths to which despair can take us are realistically and intensely explored on multiple levels. Indeed, Ricci's search through Rome mirrors our lives and our searches for individuality, meaning and respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an unassuming masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(note: this was written after being introduced to the film on VHS tape in the mid-1980s...obviously it's time for another viewing)Even after a half century of neglect, in faded prints with almost illegible subtitles, Vittorio De Sica's post-war classic still survives as one of the shining achievements of cinematic expression; certainly it marks a pinnacle of Italian neo-realist filmmaking. Employing (out of fiscal necessity, no doubt) then fresh techniques of outdoor location photography with non-professional actors, De Sica relates the simple but powerful story of a poor worker in the economic shambles of post WWII Rome and what happens when his bicycle, his only source of employment, is stolen. With his young son he then embarks on an increasingly desperate search for the culprit, which in the end becomes a painful but not unrewarding odyssey of discovery for both father and son. The result is a spare, beautifully realized film, rich in character and detail, and graced by a haunting, uncertain conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The drama Bicycle Thieves is directed by Vittorio De Sica and stars Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola. The film takes place in modern day Rome , and modern day is in the 40s because that was when the film was made.The film starts off with a man yelling the name Ricci (Maggiorani) who is a person that gives out jobs. Ricci goes to the man and finds out that he is getting a job that pays very well but he needs a bicycle. His bicycle is getting repaired and it is not supposed to be done for a week and he needs it for the next morning. Ricci goes to the repair shot and pays extra to get his bicycle. His wife and son are very happy for him and he is extremely excited to go to his first day of work because he was so unlucky in the past. Unfortunately at his first day of work while gluing posters to the wall someone steals his bicycle. And that is when the chase to get his bicycle back begins...The screenplay for this film received an Oscar nomination which it well deserved, and it probably deserved to win as well even though I have not yet seen the film that did win. The writing was so simple, so pure and that is what I loved about it. It was easy to watch yet extremely thought provoking. The film is truly amazing because the plot is so basic but it is just so powerful. I don't wish to spoil anything but the ending is absolutely brilliant as well. The screenplay for this film is a masterpiece and I wish more of them today were like this.The direction for this film also was quite simple, which made it quite brilliant. There are only few films that get me so emotionally attached to their main characters. De Sica does not use complex shots really at all in this film yet I still think it is one of the best directed films ever made. It is hard to describe, the only word I can really think of is pure. De Sica did not direct this film to make money or to win awards, he just directed it because it was what he was born to do.The acting for this film was as well superb. Maggiorani plays Ricci and he is fantastic. He is just a simple man who wants his bicycle back so he can get money to support his family. He is the everyman and Maggiorani played the role perfectly. Enzo Staiola was Ricci's son and he was just the normal kid and he also did his role perfectly. It was like the two of them weren't acting at all they were just that real father and son. The supporting cast as well did a spectacular job.Overall I give this film a 10/10 and I'm proud to call it my new second favorite film. It is perfect in every way and I recommend this film to absolutely everyone. If you don't enjoy then I must say that you don't see the beauty in simplicity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching but Overpraised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poor man relies on his bicycle to do his job, but it is stolen, leading to much angst. This landmark film of the Italian neo-realism movement has some fine moments and is ultimately touching. However, its historical significance should not be confused with its artistic merit. The simple plot is drawn out too much, and for a film made in 1948, it looks rather primitive, as if it were made two decades earlier. The acting by a cast of first-time actors is nothing more than average, although the little boy is adorable. Maggiorani looks like a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Clint Eastwood! It's a decent film, but falls far short of its reputation as one of the all-time greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bicycle Thieves is a memorable work of art with the true flavour of reality. To see it is an experience worth having. An Italian workman (Lamberto Maggiorani), long unemployed, is robbed of the bicycle he needs for his new job, and he and his small son (Enzo Staiola) search Rome for it.To the rest of the world, this beloved film became the jewel in the crown of the post-war Italian neo-realist movement: a film shot with urgency and immediacy that did not shirk harsh economic realities, yet also emphasized the touching relationship between father and son, and the shame and guilt that easily creep into desperate lives. That the two lead actors were non-professionals only makes the film seem more believable and authentic. Bicycle Thieves is unquestionably a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neorealism at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian masters working in the cinema of those years that followed WWII changed the way movies were done in their country. After the defeat, years of hardship and penury befell their land. Despair was everywhere because much was in ruin, or there didn't seem to be an end in sight. Thus, the work of the directors of the stature of Roberto Rosellini, Vittorio DeSica, and Luchino Visconti, and the early works of Federico Fellini, went to create the movement we know today as the neorealism. "Ladri di biciclette" was perhaps the best exponent of the trend started by these men. The action in the streets of Italy's major cities, mainly Rome, became the natural backdrop for the stories they wanted to narrate. Little was done in studios. Unlike Hollywood, the Italians had one advantage in that recent history could be brought to the screen right from the original locations.The story of Antonio Ricci, a poor unemployed worker, in the days following the end of the conflict, is a gripping tale in which the agony of every day life conspired against him and his family. When his name comes up for a job pasting posters all over Rome, he encounters a big problem. The basis of his employment requires him to have a bicycle in order to move around the city. Alas, Antonio and Maria have pawned it in order to satisfy more pressing needs. Maria has a solution, she will sell her dowry's linen. In exchange, they receive money which will be used to reclaim the precious bicycle.Before going home, Maria decides to go see La Santona, a sort of female seer, that predicted Antonio would get a job. She feels she has to give this woman something as a token of her gratitude. Little is left over for them to live on, but with Antonio's new job, things look better for them. Antonio and Maria have two other sons, Bruno and a newly born baby. Even Bruno has a job, to help ends meet.As Antonio begins to work pasting posters advertising "Gilda" all over the city, his precious bicycle is stolen. Antonio must act quickly if he wants to keep working. He goes to find a friend, the head of a cleaning crew. The next day they meet in a square where all kinds of stolen property end up to be sold. Nothing is found, adding to the foul mood Antonio is feeling.Next day is Sunday. Antonio takes Bruno to help him in his search. When they see an old man speaking to the man who stole Antonio's bicycle, they follow him. This old man refuses to tell them anything. Being hungry, he takes Bruno to a trattoria where they can only order the cheapest items on the menu. There is a family sitting nearby with a son about Bruno's age who is enjoying dishes that Bruno cannot have.When they meet by chance the man who took the bicycle, Antonio and Bruno find themselves surrounded by a neighborhood crowd that will not help them at all. The house is searched, but nothing is found. Even the policeman that have tried to help abandons them because of lack of evidence. The solution for Antonio is to try to steal a bicycle because it is the only way for him to keep on working, or so it seems. Unfortunately, when he does get the lonely bike, he is not prepared for the mob that assaults him, leaving him beaten and helpless.This work is one of Vittorio DeSica's masterpieces. The other ones were "Umberto D", "L'oro di Napoli", and "La Ciociara". This film was also written by DeSica and his usual collaborators, among them Cesare Savattini, a genius himself. In Lamberto Maggioriani, the director found the perfect actor to portray Antonio Ricci. Bruno was played by Enzo Staiola, a natural boy actor who had only about eight years at the time. Lianella Carell appears as Maria, although the film belong to Mr. Maggioriani and Mr. Staiola and the great direction by DeSica.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Desperation of Post-WWII Rome Painted in Intensely Heartfelt Detail by a Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I thought the plurality in the title of the two-disc 2007 Criterion Collection DVD set was an error in translation, but now I realize it is an accurate description of the moralistic symmetry presented in this classic 1948 film, the pinnacle of the post-WWII Italian neo-realism movement. It's the type of art-house film of which everybody has heard, but relatively few have actually seen. That's why for me, seeing it for the first time in the clean print transfer offered by Criterion becomes a transcendent experience not only for the heartbreaking story of one man's dire situation but for the rueful way it depicts the way of life among Rome's poverty-stricken inhabitants after the devastation of war. While much of the credit belongs to renowned director Vittorio De Sica ("Two Women", "The Garden of Finzi-Continis") and his frequent writing partner, Cesare Zavattini, Carlo Montuori's beautifully composed cinematography and Alessandro Cicognini's melancholy music score contribute immeasurably to the vivid portrayal of the city's unforgiving nature.Against such a teeming backdrop, the basic story at its heart comes across as almost a parable. With the scarcity of jobs after the war, men desperately wait for a chance at any menial job. Antonio Ricci gets his opportunity when he is hired to glue movie posters around the city. The one condition to his hiring is that he must have a bicycle, an ironic point since he just sold his previous one to feed his family. When his wife sells their bed sheets for cash, Antonio can afford one, and he beams with pride over his new job. So does his son Bruno who quickly learns every nook and cranny of the bicycle. On the very first day of his new job, however, his bicycle is stolen. Antonio has a Sunday to find it before reporting back to work the next day, and the rest of the movie follows father and son on a palpably desperate search. One frustrating event follows another as Antonio grows increasingly angry, weary and desperate with his hopes fading precipitously. These episodes allow De Sica to spotlight postwar Rome in highly charged personal detail - Antonio pursuing an old man to a church mass, confronting a suspect in a hostile neighborhood, treating his son to a restaurant meal, visiting a fortune teller whose prediction is frustratingly curt. Meanwhile, the bond between father and son evolves in mercurial fashion throughout the day.De Sica hired amateurs off the street to play the roles, which likely explains why the naturalistic performances resonate so much. With his worn fedora and a constant look of intensely felt desperation, Lamberto Maggiorani fully inhabits the role of Antonio. As the cherubic Bruno devoted to his father no matter the depth of despair, Enzo Staiola really carries the moral conscience of the story in an intensely watchful manner. During their momentary respite in the restaurant, he produces a memorable look of forlorn acceptance when Antonio says they cannot afford to eat like the family at the next table. The ending is heartbreaking without relying on cheap sentiment. The first disc contains the movie with surprisingly no film scholar commentary (Criterion's usual practice with such a renowned classic). The second disc includes interviews conducted in 2005 about working with De Sica (Staiola, close to seventy now, is among the subjects), an hour-long Italian TV documentary about Zavattini, and a forty-minute history of Italian neo-realism. The accompanying 75-page booklet is an exceptional extra containing a multitude of scholarly essays and remembrances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man has his bicycle stolen away from him and spends the next day with his son trying desperately to find it.A simple story in a sobering look at depression era/post war Italy. So powerful in it's simplicity, The Bicycle Thief is not only a standout human drama but also the best possible look at life in post war Rome and the human misery among it's lower classes.Director Vittorio De Sica chose to film in the crowded streets of Rome and use non professional actors to capture the mood appropriately. This neo-realist approach works almost as a filmed documentary of Italy and the existence forced upon it's citizens. When Antonio loses his bicycle he loses so much more and his desperate search in the overcrowded streets is one of cinema's most emotional exploration of a man trying to capture his dignity that was taken from him. The bicycle was his job, his sense of purpose and it ensured a good livelihood for his family.The non-actors give forceful performances, especially the little boy. The scene in the end where the father has given up hope and resorts to desperate measures is not easily forgotten and the simple look the boy gives him is the most pure moment I've ever seen.I doubt The Bicycle Thief will leave many viewers untouched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing gets better than this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has no loopholes and is the father of neorealist cinema. The story is simple and an honest depiction of the helplessness of a poor family. A jobless man (Antonio Ricci) finds a job of sticking posters in the post second world war Italy. With great difficulty he arranges for a bicycle which gets stolen on the very first day at work. Antonio knows he can't find it but still he has no choice so he sets out with his son to look for his bicycle. Audiences along with father and son contemplate every aspect of bicycle i.e. number plates, careers, pedals etc while searching for it. The desperation of the protagonist is heart-breaking.I was avoiding this flick because a friend of mine told me an Indian classic called 'Do Beega Zameen' is loosely based on 'Bicycle thief'. I love this Indian flick but I didn't want to see any thing in the same line. After a long time I happened to see 'Bicycle thief' and realized that this movie is just incomparable. All the main characters in the film are non actors. Enzo Staiola who played Bruno (son) was literally picked from the street. He has done a fantastic job. Lamberto Maggiorani as 'Ricci' was also employed in a similar way. It seems they were picked up because of the way they walked. 'Sica' must be a great man. Lamberto Maggiorani is just too real. I don't know if it's his non-actor background or something 'Sica' did. It looks as if he is really looking for a bicycle. One scene after other is like a collage of postwar Italy told through two characters. The whole church sequence is a satire on the double standards of the roman society. In one of the scenes, Ricci decides to eat in a restaurant on the grounds that if we have to die of hungers why not eat good food before that; Bruno is ogling at people who are eating expensive food and Ricci in the middle of the food starts calculating what he could have earned if his cycle was not stolen. It's a very powerful scene if you have equated hunger, food and money ever in your life. The film is so real that you forget that its film. The last few scenes gets you totally. 'Sica' has used a cycle to expose poor post war Italy how cool is that? If cinema is not doomed and survives in the next century it's because of films like these.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's extremely difficult to write a review of Bicycle Thieves without mentioning the influence it had on world cinema, but had it not been for Bicycle Thieves directors like Kurosawa, Ozu, or Satyajit Ray (who in turn went on to inspire the vast bulk of the Hollywood renaissance, ie. Coppola, Lucas, Scorcese, etc) would have been deprived of one of their biggest influences. In other words, no Bicycle Thieves means no Pather Panchali, no Ikiru, no Tokyo Story, and therefore no Godfather, Taxi Driver or The Conversation. It might sound like an exaggeration, but without Bicycle Thieves, at least one quarter of the last half-century's greatest movies might have never been made.Many reviews here have already commented on the superb level of acting (which is remarkable given that virtually everyone is a non-professional) and the moving storyline, so it's difficult to add anything of substance. That said, I still can't decide whether the outlook of Bicycle Thieves is pessimistic, subversive, or neither. Andre Bazin famously called Bicycle Thieves the only true communist film of the 1940s, but I'm not entirely sure if that applies. There are allusions to the class struggle (particularly during the scene in the restaurant), but the film falls short of directly calling for a radical social change, instead portraying the working class of Italy as hopelessly divided by its own poverty, unemployment and greed. While that in itself may suggest De Sica's desire for a proletariat united against injustices posed by the system (an old Marxist chestnut), it's still a comment the film never makes in a literal form - if it's there, it's hidden away somewhere in the narrative for the audience to decipher themselves. In that respect Bicycle Thieves quite clearly differs from many other Italian neo-realist movies like Ossessione, because it does not directly criticise the capitalist system, instead preferring to remain ambiguous and leaving the audience to arrive at their own conclusions about the fate of Antonio and Bruno (the most lovable and sympathetic father-and-son pairing I've ever seen on film, I hasten to add) and of Italian society in general. In a way it's probably for the best that De Sica has chosen to portray the message of the film in an ambiguous light instead of patronising his audience with lectures and slogans (a la Ken Loach), since it enables him to portray social injustice without running the risk of alienating his audience, something which many politically motivated film makers inadvertently tend to do.Its ideological implications aside, Bicycle Thieves is a cinematic milestone as well as one of the most emotionally moving films you'll ever see. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

After having watched it for the second time in a week, it is my opinion that this is the greatest film ever made. The style and acting are so real that I am still emotionally coping with their struggle. This is due to so many things that the director does in the neo-realism style, but also a credit to the incredible acting, which is incidentally performed by non-actors. This really makes you wonder if acting "talent" is a facade created by Hollywood in their quest to produce money not art.

		<fullReview>Among the handful of perfect, ultimate film experiences, Bicycle Thief still has the power to amaze. Try to take your eyes off Ricci and his son, Bruno, as scene after scene turns hopefulness into despair then abject humiliation. Yes, Bicycle Thief is a political film, and its characters do represent a war-torn Italy deciding its fate(metaphorically, Ricci without his Bicycle; and literally, the Socialist agitators meeting in the basement along side community entertainers). But should we care about that now? Politics and emerging regimes in Bicycle Thief wisely take a backseat to the urgent problems of joblessness and "feeding the kid". In that respect, the only comparable US film is Ford's "Grapes of Wrath". Tom Joad and Antonio Ricci may be caught in different stories, but they have a lot in common. Politics aside, Bicycle Thief's script is concise, unsentimental and its power still resonates. The black and white photography, capturing Rome in its ancient and more recent state of post-WWII decay, is often breathtaking. Editing and directing are flawless -- Bicycle Thief flows like a scary, poverty-stricken nightmare, and then delivers one of world-cinema's greatest closing images. Do not miss this perfect film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Family Film Which is Not for the Whole Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bicycle Thief is classic piece of mid-20th century Italian film-making by veteran workhorse director Vittorio De Sica. Using his experience to good advantage, De Sica cast a mix of fellow veteran performers and unknowns - with no stars - to give the film a feeling of universality which would have been missing had well-known actors been cast.The story is simple. It is post-war Italy and the bread lines are long. People are desperate for work and money and many are close to starvation. Antonio, Maria and their son Bruno see a glimpse of hope when Antonio gets a job hanging posters. The job is dependent on his bicycle, however, which is almost immediately stolen after he gets the job. Antonio and Bruno take to the streets to find the bicycle thief.Ostensibly. the film is about poverty, desperation, and the extremes these conditions push people into. And the film is certainly stark, open, and economical in both story-telling and pacing. However, there are also some moral points which are not to be overlooked. The bond between Antonio, Bruno and Maria is certainly touching and all three of the central characters are very believable, very well acted, and very sympathetic. The Bicycle Thief was a first film for all three principal cast members, and all three went on to achieve modest success in European film. Enzo Staiola, who later became a teacher, was particularly impressive in the role of Bruno at the age of 7.As I mentioned above, the film is economically directed. The cinematography is excellent, and it is clear that the director was intimately familiar with his sets - using locations perfectly. The script is also lean and believable, giving the film a realism rarely found in modern cinema, but not uncommon in mid-20th century European cinema. And some of the scenes are so memorable that it is possible to pick out homages paid to the film in major films made a good 50 years later.To discuss the thematic content of this film, and the reasons I can't recommend it for family viewing, any further would require a spoiler, so I will leave off here. My highest recommendation goes to The Bicycle Thief - a well deserved classic which can be enjoyed by most audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One family's struggle with poverty in Post-WWII Italy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This powerful film must be viewed in the original version (with subtitles) to capture the essence of the feeling. Post WWII Italy, seen from the view of the "have nots", where everyone struggles and there are few laughs. A family man at last is offered a job, but to keep it, he must show up for work with a bicycle. He had pawned his bicycle, but by giving up the family linens, he gets it back, only to have it stolen on the first day at work. He, his son, and several friends go to great lengths to help the man find his stolen bicycle, without results. Eventually the man resorts to becoming a bicycle thief himself.I have never seen anyone so ashamed, as this man was, when his son witnesses the humiliation of seeing his father caught stealing and mobbed for his offense. I was also stunned by seeing the size of the pawnshop (it looked like an Amazon warehouse!), as well as a "bicycle fence yard" that was enormous. During poor economic times pawnshops and "fences" seem to be the only ones flourishing.This is a stunning motion picture achievement. The poor film quality (suffering considerably after some 50 years) only adds to the authenticity. "The Bicycle Thief" is one of the finest films I have viewed. It rivals "La Strada" for my favorite foreign film. This film receives my highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most stunningly beautiful movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bicycle thief is the story of a poor Italian who can't get a job. Finally he stumbles upon one that he can have if he had a bicycle. So his wife sells their bed sheets for this bike so he can work. His first day on the job the bike gets stolen and this could mean devastation for his families economy. Not wanting this to happen he sets out with his son Bruno as they search Rome looking for the bike.This amazing film is masterly directed and is one of the greatest foreign films in history. De Sica directs this film to incredible levels of creativity and intrigue. The thing that really ties this film together is an incredible story and screenplay. Also a remarkably great performance by Lamberto Maggiorani even pushed this film father along the way to greatness. Along with him the greatest child performance in movies was done by Enzo Staiola playing Bruno.There is nothing I can say that can lower this films phenomenal standings. The film is almost like a lovely painting, and finishes with a shot that sends chills up your spine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is a film about child, one who is both IN the film and watches it.Hard as it is to imagine today, the world of film once had ideas on the surface, and lively controversies. Men took risks and sometimes survived to be celebrated.Here is a case: an experiment in urban photography, naturalistic acting (rather, naturalism) and investment in a narrative based on unromantic caprice. It is on many `best of' lists. But as with many projects (`On Golden Pond' comes to mind) the IDEA of the film is far superior to the film itself. This film is mawkishly sentimental while advertising that it isn't. It is crisply crafted while claiming otherwise. It is highly stylized - especially the confrontations - where it claims verity.The ideas explored have long ago been replaced by others more vital. As a result, the more you see this the more tired it seems. Except. Except for a couple shots of the kid, like when he is interrupted when peeing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must Watch Neorealism Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Satyajit Ray said that he decided to be a filmmaker after watching "Bicycle Thieves". Words like this from an inspirational person like him, was the main reason behind my interest to watch this film.Vittorio De Sica 's 1948 neorealism 'Bicycle Thieves' has a great impact on me. One of the best creative works in cinema. This film portrays post world war II Rome.Now coming to the story. Antonio Ricci, the protagonist has offered a job of advertising for what he need to have a bicycle. That's the only condition. He tells his wife, Maria, who manages the money for buying the bicycle by selling her wedding gifts. But, on the first day of work, a man snatches the bicycle when Antonio was on a ladder. He chased the thief but failed to catch. He reported this fact to the police station and back to home with no hope. On the next day, Antonio and his son Bruno went to a market with some friends to find the bicycle. They spotted the thief talking with an old man there in the market. Antonio failed to catch the thief so he decided to catch the old man. That old man ignored them and ran away from them. But after so many turmoils, he didn't lose hope. He finally caught the thief in a brothel and started fighting and continue accusing him. But when the thief had fallen on the ground, neighbors started blaming Antonio for accusing him without any proof. A policeman came and searched the thief's house, but they found no any bicycle. Then they walked off from there. Antonio then found a bike beside a doorway and thought of stealing it. As soon as he jumps on the bike, the cycle owner found him and started shouting. Crowd on the roads caught him and decided to hand him over to the police. But the cycle owner noticed Bruno and forgave Antonio.Work of screenwriter is fascinating and I also like the soundtrack. I found that Ray's works had some similarities with it. Like this movie, Ray also took some unprofessional actors for his first film 'Pather Panchali'. Among all the casts, Enzo Staiola who played the boy's role is incredibly awesome. It's a must watch film for every film-lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the system takes time to break a man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BICYCLE THIEVES is a brilliant and sad drama, through which permeate social themes and human frustration. The main protagonist is no way out and no choice. Left to the social norms that run over the last shred of human dignity. It's sad and heartbreaking.The director brings a realistic and tragic story of loneliness and isolation of the common man in a complex social system. Ironic but true. The system destructible man. The streets of Rome are full of life. The disorder in the form of poverty and misery is a real inner picture. Paradoxically or not, this is the story of a healthy man and his struggle for survival through limited possibilities of civilization.In life, the most important are the little things. In this film, it is a tool for work. The loss of this funding brings the main protagonist to despair. The film is the second part turns into aimless running around Rome in search of "the means of life". In some moments of hope appears as an antidote to despair. However aimless wandering will drive away all hope. It's amazing sounds, but each person in the film and the occurrence of certain protagonists directly affects the atmosphere. Ironically the man violates social norms in pursuit of a stolen bicycle. Despair does not choose neither the time nor the place.This film can be viewed as a collection of experiences through human anxiety. Tragicomic everyday. How the system takes time to break a man, kills the human spirit in him, and gave it to fate. Non-professional actors express subtlety, strength and sensitivity of the common man or only child.The film, which is artfully "packed" should at all fill the heart with warmth and compassion. In some tears. Nice is that wage. Some nodes in his denouement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking Drama That Retains its Emotional Punch even after Seventy Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best-known of all the Italian neo-realist thrillers emerging out of the Second World War and beyond, LADRI DI BICICLETTE has a straightforward plot of Ricci, a working-class man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who finds a job as a bill-poster, buys a bicycle and embarks on his task. On his first day the bicycle is stolen, and together with son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), he spends the rest of the film unsuccessfully trying to find it.The simple plot cannot describe the experience of watching Vittorio de Sica's film, whose unforgettable black-and-white photography (by Carlo Montuori) captures a postwar Italy trying to re-establish itself in the wake of a catastrophic war (as signaled by the tower- blocks dotted across the landscape), yet simultaneously experiencing chronic problems of poverty and unemployment. Ricci has to join the daily queue of men hoping for a job from an unscrupulous clerk (Gino Saltamerenda), with no real prospect of permanent positions. As he visits the bill- posting office to receive the posters, the camera focuses on the clerks, who seem to be dealing with piles of paperwork to little or no effect. They are not actually producing anything, but simply working for the sake of working, to avoid Ricci's fate. The same also applies to the officers in the police station, who choose to spend time on clerical duties rather than actively trying to catch criminals.Ricci lives in a cramped couple of rooms with his wife (Lianella Carell) and their young baby. Once again de Sica captures the almost daily sufferings they experience: Maria has to put meals on the table on very little money, while having to cope with the chores of washing, ironing and child-rearing in one room, relying totally on any income Ricci can bring in.This explains Ricci's mental sufferings, once his bicycle has been stolen by a petty thief (Vittorio Antonucci). The film is full of tracking sequences as he walks along peopled streets, devoid of cars, his face framed in close-up as he makes his futile attempts to find it. Bruno tags along behind him, experiencing equal sufferings, especially in a high-class pizza restaurant where his raggedy clothes are contrasted with those of a high-class child sitting behind him, savoring the delights of a calzone and staring loftily at Bruno.Eventually matters come to a heartbreaking climax where the hitherto morally impeccable Ricci is forced into a criminal act. The resultant shame, as he is surrounded by a crowd of indignant bystanders, proves too much for Bruno, as he walks away, his face filled with tears, with his father desperately trying and failing to console him. Once Ricci had been a person to look up to; for Bruno his father is now nothing more than a common felon. Yet we realize that this is not Ricci's fault; it is something that he was forced into by adverse circumstances.Only eighty minutes in length - on the DVD release - LADRI DI BICILIETTE is so powerful in terms of visual impact that it demands the viewer's attention. It is quite deservedly one of the established classics of world cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic classic rich in human insight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me that even after nearly 70 years, there remain movies you can come across that become truly seasoned with the passage of time. That perceived immortality may lie in the continued relevance in subject matter, it's true to life story telling or its compelling characters. Many of these older films capture the smaller joys or moments with its subtle yet beautiful cinematography. They elicit an acute nostalgia that stays with you long after the credits have rolled. Bicycle Thieves (Ladri di biciclette) gives us a seemingly straightforward plot. A poor father struggles to get a job post-WWII Italy. He is given a great job opportunity, one that is contingent on having a bike. He buys one and, well, you could put the rest together based on the title. One thing I love about Bicycle Thieves is that, from beginning to end, it steers away (no pun intended) from the conventional storytelling and plot development we've come to expect from movies nowadays. In doing so, it is also a perceptive exploration of how times have changed.A film ostensibly about a bike hunt delves much deeper into universal themes, at its core, that many can relate to. The story focuses on Antonio Ricci, the story's protagonist who begins as a kind-hearted soul, and chronicles his gradual devolution. It would appear that losing the bike is emblematic of his dwindling dignity; as the idea of re-entering poverty becomes more of a reality, Antonio's goodwill gradually begins to crumble. The film is, above all else, evocative of a simpler time where things like bikes were considered this prized commodity. As I experienced their journey running around Rome, I couldn't help but smile witnessing the functioning of a technology-less society. In the version I streamed it with online, there were several editing errors, presumably from the film being the victim of a re-uploaded version. This is likely unintentional. The grey shades from the palette of black and white colors appear to change and become darker as the film progresses, accompanying the shift in mood of the film. This is likely intentional. The film's long shots give us beautiful snippets into Rome and immerse us right in the middle of the landscape. The black and white is particularly useful here lending a historical feel to the film and a stark realism I'm certain director Vittorio De Sica was going for. Overall, it is an indisputable classic and an unmissable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie but not the Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very bored with Hollywood and have been trying to check out more art films, classics, foreign films etc. I saw this is sometimes touted as the greatest film ever made. I thought it was good but the greatest? Not too sure about that. This review is going to ramble.In post WWII Italy, poverty abounds. I really think this movie was made to speak to the common man and inspire sympathy in those of a wealthier class. Our protagonist, Antonio, is out of work when he gets a job posting from the unemployment office. The job requires a bicycle which Antonio has to retrieve from the pawn store. His first day on the job, the bike is stolen. He then goes on a quest to find this bicycle with his son Bruno.As for how the movie aged, I think it's done just OK. The very poor quality looks like it was made in the 1920's and not the '40's - Gone With the Wind is 9 years older. Also, some of the son's expressions were slapsticky which I hate slapstick humor but OK, it was a common form of comic relief at the time. The constant background chatter was annoying.As for my impressions, you can certainly draw lot of meaning from the movie. Some, I'm not sure if it was intended to be there. (My point is I learned in 3 different classes (2 in college) that Miller used the name Loman (low man) in Death of a Salesman to describe his character. Miller, himself, said it wasn't intentional.) Yes, you can see that the government, the police, and the church (who lock in the impoverished so they have to stay for the mass to receive charity) offer little relief. Also, the poor are constantly at odds with each other instead of uniting and challenging the rest of society that blissfully ignores them.This is how I saw the movie and why I think it was to inspire sympathy in the lesser fortuned. Antonio is a good man, his circumstances lead him to do something you thought he would never do, steal. I love when movies create a moral gray area. As much as I didn't want him to steal the bike, I also wanted him to get away with it. Don't judge so harshly, who knows what one will do when they are completely desperate.The other main meaning I took from the movie is what the soothsayer said. She tells the "ugly" boy don't continue to sow a field you can't harvest. Then she tells Antonio that he will find the bicycle immediately or not all and to open his eyes. The open your eyes line leads Antonio to confront the boy on the street, though, I'm not sure if that boy is supposed to actually be the thief (I hope he isn't). You assume that the open your eyes line was saying that the bike is under his nose, if he would just look harder, he'd find it. What she really means is to see the truth, the bicycle is gone. Don't keep sowing a field that won't harvest, let go. Granted, there are few other fields out there for him to harvest... but maybe there are, maybe he can rent a bike? Unfortunately, Antonio doesn't let go and this is what leads him to steal.This is me "Loman-ing" this movie (putting my own meaning into it). I see the bicycle as representing Antonio (or any man's) dignity which is tied to being able to support his family (less so now but it's 1948). Society has taken his dignity from him but it is returned when he gets a job. However, it is again stolen from him. This is why he goes on a relentless pursuit. In the end, you can't steal dignity and this leaves him even lower than before.The relationship with the son is also a nice element in the movie. I thought the smacking scene was great, you felt the sting Antonio felt (remember, dignity stolen) when the son mentioned the soup (though he shouldn't have hit him). Also, Bruno's reaction was fantastic, you really felt how wrong the slap was. The son seeing the father steal was also heartbreaking. There is probably more that can be drawn from here but it's not what I focused on.Lastly, I thought the movie was good but not quite great. It's more of a quiet and simple film, though, it does punch you in the gut in the end. You feel sadness and kudos to any movie that can make you care about the characters and evoke that strong of an emotion.</fullReview>

The central theme is great, and posed an excellent moral conundrum. However, the sub-plots and middle section of the story are quite unfocused and the story drifts.It also hasn't aged well - the cinematography is quite basic, even by 1948 standards.This is all said, this is a classic, and a must-see for historic reasons.

		<shortDescription>There's a cure for everything except death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a powerful cornerstone of Italian neo-realism. World War 2 had left the country ravaged and in political strife and this movement took advantage. De Sica's choices are evident: the two leads are well known to be non- professionals (and neither exactly hit stardom afterwards), meaning every authentic tic is magnified. The camera seldom moves save for a few pans and slow zoom ins; De Sica's preference is objectiveness and displaying the story as it is. The editing is un-obtrusive. Deep focus is applied to every shot so that the hordes of extras mingle around in post-war Rome, each with their own individual tale. He shoots on location, and for some of the figures in the background this is a day-to-day affair, perhaps with a little treat now and again, maybe a football game on the weekend, or lunch at the pizzeria. At times De Sica even captures the mundane; boys playing in the streets, actors rehearsing on stage, church-goers reading hymns, an ugly man seeking romantic blessings. There is focus on one man, Antonio Ricci and his poverty stricken family. He has waited two long years for this job, and is not about to lose it now. Maggiorani displays every inch of despair at losing his bicycle. See how his face falls upon seeing a family feasting on a great meal. See how hesitant and ashamed he is, not willing to divulge the news to his son nor his wife. At the start of the day, he drops off Bruno, not to school, but to a little gas station where he labours all day as a pump assistant. Even his little boy has employment! How shattered his dignity is, and therefore how imperative it is that the bicycle is recovered. His wife Maria tries her own methods; she has been visiting the local seer who has prophesied many things. It is easy to sit within wealth and laugh at the foolishness and naivety of her predictions and those who believe them. Here, it is not foolishness, but desperation. What is often not mentioned is that Antonio himself is not the most sympathetic of characters. Oh, it's a heartbreaking predicament that he is in, there is no doubt about that, and that drives his desperate quest. But where are we introduced to him? There is an eager crowd waiting for a job, and the camera tracks his friend as he runs and runs and runs to tell him the great news, where he is sitting absent-mindedly as though he has not a care in the world. It is Maria who makes the sacrifice of her wedding linens, and of course that eventuates in that iconic shot of piles and piles of similarly pawned stacks of cloth. Antonio becomes so focused on catching the thief that he begins to be careless, and in a fit of guilt, he nearly convinces himself that he has let his son drown. He invades people's homes without thought. And then there is that red herring initially, where he leaves his bike unattended and we sit watching, biting our fingernails and hands gripped together as he exits, and there it is. It is De Sica's triumph that these faults exist, and in spite of them we despair for Antonio. The English translation has the title of The Bicycle Thief, becomes of course it is a story of how a thief commits a small act of wrong and how impossibly large and devastating the consequences are. The original Italian title however is much more appropriate: this is not a film about a singular thief, but about a man who becomes one in his own right. It remains impossible to judge Antonio's decision if we have not been through the same situation he has. And in the same vein, perhaps the original thief was similarly in strife. The last scene is haunting, as the pair of father and son grasps hands lightly, a bond of respect and care severed, and are swallowed by the crowd. How many other bicycle thieves are in that shot?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real play on emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story picks up very meagerly but is based n a very interesting time frame. In post World War II Italy, where the nation was one of the war's loser, economy goes hard and unemployment goes rampant, so keeping a job is crucial for any man, especially every head of the household. This notion gains importance slowly but surely as the movie depicts Antonio trying his hardest to locate his stolen bicycle. The movie brings the audience into some sense of hope by following Antonio's journey with Bruno through all the bitterness of search. Yet I feel that the movie gives a very good slap to the audience with it's complete sad ending. It's like the movie's saying harshly that we don't always get what we want, even if we're down on the ground. The acting overall is not good, even though I'd say that Lamberto Maggiorani's acting adequately brought Antonio's emotions to life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic example of neorealism and that's a scary idea because many "classics" are so dull. God save me from having to sit through "Ivan the Terrible, Part II" again. And "Pickpocket!" This one was shot on the cheap by Vittorio De Sica -- no professional actors, no fancy gimmicks, no back projection, no money, no nothing. Sid Caesar did a parody on his TV show. Yet De Sica's pulled it off. An unpromising story about a poor man and his little son searching all of Rome for their stolen bicycle on which their livelihood depends is truly engaging.It's post-war Italy and almost everyone is broke. People pawn their used linens to add a little to their pitiful government allowance. Nobody drives a car. There are a few crowded old buses and trolleys but the streets are full of bicycles. Antonio Ricci is lucky to have a bicycle. He's just found a job putting up posters and he's proud of it. His wife has sewn a military cap for him as part of a shabby jump-suit uniform. He needs the bicycle to get back and forth to work.But while he's slapping up a poster advertising a Rita Hayworth movie on the wall of the Hotel Florida, a young thief jumps on the bicycle and pedals quickly away.The rest of the movie follows Ricci and his son as they roam the city looking for the bicycle and the thief. They don't find it, not even with the help of sympathetic friends and the police. Finally, out of desperation, Ricci spots another bicycle leaning lazily against a wall, cases the situation, and takes off on the bike. He's caught by a crowd of pedestrians and released -- defeated, filled with remorse and shame.Two things leave an indelible impression on the viewer. One is the faces. Where did De Sica find these features? All of them are distinctive in one way or another. One, a musician, has a head like a chubby balloon and eyes that extrude from their sockets, as in a cartoon.The second thing is the tour of the seedier parts of Rome that we're subjected to while Ricci searches the streets. There's a tiny, shabby theater in which a handful of untalented performers are doing a clumsy song and dance number. There is a soup kitchen preceded by a prayer, and one of the bums complains, "I sat through the service; I'm entitled to the soup." A Thieve's Market, a neighborhood full of toughs, a decrepit police station out of Kafka, overflowing with piles of paper.In the context of all this local color, the plight of Ricci and his young son sometimes recedes into the background although it's never forgotten. By the end, you ache for Ricci to find that damned bicycle but, as with so many other of our visions, his wish is never realized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Bicycle Thief" is a movie which represents the old times in Italy where the bicycle thieves ruled the place and the corruption and the crime rate was high. In this movie we have a man with his little son who is trying really hard to get his bicycle back from the thief that he stole it but in his path he finds many difficulties.I really liked this movie because of the emotions that it gave and because I believe it represents something that is true. I also liked it because of the plot which shows us a man who fights against all in order to get back what he lost. The success in this I believe that it came from the direction of Vittorio De Sica who did a really good job. About the interpretations I have to say that I was amazed from the interpretation of Lamberto Maggiorani who was played as Antonio Ricci and he was simply outstanding and I also liked the interpretation of the little one Enzo Staiola who played as Bruno Ricci his son.Finally I have to say that "The Bicycle Thief" is a great movie and is a must see movie because it shows us and give us to understand that we have to fight for a better life. It shows us also that when we lose something that is "vital" for us then we have to fight even harder for this and never stop until we succeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great buildup to the moral question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gives us a perfect example of which problems Rome had in the 40's. In the start of the movie, Antonio's bike gets stolen. During the research to get back the bike, Antonio and his son Enzo feel alone in the world, with no one to help them complete their mission. Suddenly, Antonio sees his chance to steal another guys bike, but as soon as Antonio tries to steal a bike, everyone are looking, and ready to catch him, even if they don't know the bike's owner.In the moment when Antonio steals the bike, or actually already when he thinks of the possibility of stealing the bike, the breaks the moral value of his own thoughts, and becomes his own very worst enemy. Fantastic!Even though the moral consideration is very interesting, the movie's buildup is very long, with a lot unimportant, very boring scenes. And the moral issue about break one's own moral ideals is seen many times in better stories (Of course this movie is from 1948, and one of the first to manifest the moralistic issues on the screen). I'll end up with giving this movie 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>even before consuming that sweet caraffe of vino, this inspiring powerful quip prepares the young son for what lies ahead despite the all encompassing grimy, dog-eat-dog world and this is ROME! was so shocked to see the depths of poverty, destitution, filth and overall desperation of a nation... despite all the rave reviews prior to viewing I still expected a fellini-esque circus display, however, I was overwhelmed with how easily I became engaged and totally immersed in each scene... so many deep emotions were explored with limited dialog and one would think the constant movement would become annoying but never felt like giving up on the evermost important search for freedom, vindication, and glory... was surprised to see the mass in Italian in 1948, Latin only in the USA??? the gentle slip of a childs hand into his fathers overcame the agony of defeat in such a superb manner I was taken aback and admired the director's ability to portray a significant life event almost as important as the child's birth... that love just never ends and how it gives you life, high recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: In the times of great depression--post WWII--a poor man searches for his stolen bicycle without which he won't be able to retain his new job.It is an economically unstable time and an average family is barely scraping a living. The movie focuses on one such family ? Husband, wife, their son and infant daughter.The father-son duo takes the movie forward. Their interactions and simple day-to-day things have been presented artistically. There are obviously no wide-angle or high-flying shots, or anything grand in terms of camera work. The strong point of this classic is showing life on screen as it in reality is. Everyone is aware of their hardships and has accepted poverty as being a way of life. Even in want there is hope, there is love, and family bonding strong as ever. No scenes have been pictured with "glumness" as such, but watching these scenes; the melancholy that surrounds you is a testimony to director class.It is not a movie with fairy tale ending rather a perfect ending. In the end the protagonist resorts to desperate measures and repents, leaving us all with a sad thought, a bit of pondering and harsh realities.8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bicycle Thieves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Italian film I was determined to watch because I had heard the title somewhere before, not just being listed in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically, set after the end of World War II in Rome, Italy, unemployed and poor father Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) has finally found a job, sticking up posters of Rita Hayworth around town. Part of the job is that he must have a bicycle, but on the first day of working he is devastated to have it stolen, and there is little the police can do about it. The only way he can see finding his transport is for him and his young son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) to walk the streets of the city in hope of finding either The Thief (Vittorio Antonucci) or of course the bicycle. After so many useful and not so useful sources for finding the man responsible for the theft or the location of the bicycle, Ricci does finally catch The Thief, but with no evidence of his crime. In the end Ricci was not able to get his own bicycle back, and there was a point when he tried to steal one himself, but the man who it belongs to sees Bruno and does not press charges, all they can do is walk home in despair. Also starring Lianella Carell as Maria Ricci, Elena Altieri as The Charitable Lady, Gino Saltamerenda as Baiocco and Fausto Guerzoni as Amateur Actor. Maggiorani is not a professional leading actor, but he makes a nice and sympathetic character, and Staiola is cute as his son, it is a near enough simple story mixing the urban environment and humanism, and there are some good moments of camera-work, it is a most watchable social drama. It won the Oscar Honorary Award, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay, and it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A man who's robbed has a right to look".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every foray of mine into a different realm of cinema brings an education and an experience. "Bicycle Thieves" is considered a neo-realist film, made with 'real' people (not actors) in ordinary situations and filmed on 'real' locations and not on movie sets. This story takes us to the ravaged city of Rome following World War II, with impoverished citizens desperately seeking work to provide for their families. The casual viewer will not be prepared for the desperation Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) will eventually face in attempting to recover the bicycle he needs to perform the job he has just been hired for, that of putting up posters throughout the city. Ricci is accompanied by his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), hopeful and naive enough to believe that the family's fortunes are about to improve.Complaints that the film is slow in getting started and depressing as it relates to the search for the stolen bike probably misses the point. This is a story of the human condition, certainly rooted in circumstance of time and place, yet capturing the essence of what a person must do to forge ahead to be a productive person, at least for himself if not for the greater society. Antonio's prospects are tempered by the grim scale of his mission, the search for a single bike in a massive city, almost on the scale of looking for a needle in a haystack. The son appears to symbolize the hope and trust he places in a father to do right by his family, who will be rewarded with a successful outcome.I was intrigued by director De Sica's infrequent use of humorous moments to lighten the film's burden - Bruno's interrupted attempt to relieve himself, his disturbance of the priest in the confessional, eating the mozzarella sandwich. These small moments temporarily distract us from the father's daunting task.It will eventually become clear to the perceptive viewer that because the title is plural, there will eventually be more than one perpetrator. One senses the father's shame and humiliation when he resorts to the same tactic that caused his desperation in the first place. The film's redemptive moment occurs when the son takes the father by the hand with love and understanding, a moment of compassion and forgiveness that closes out the film on a more hopeful note than a depressing one.</fullReview>

It is also worth pointing out that if you notice there are many references on the set of the AMERICAN DREAM. ...The chemistry between the father and son is brilliant, and that ending you want the father to get away with it!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bicycle Thieves captures, in elemental strokes, the crushing of the human spirit at the hands of poverty, indifference and despair. Yes, it's a titan in the chronicles of cinematic history, but more importantly this is an overwhelmingly moving parable that balances the grimness of its characters' plight against some of the period's most elegant visual poetry.Armed with a story (from a novel by Luigi Bartolini) incredible in its simplicity, it tells the tale of an unemployed worker in postwar Rome who finds a job putting up movie posters after his wife pawns the family sheets to get his bicycle out of hock. But right after he starts work, the bike is stolen. This feels like an apocalyptic turn of events, thanks to the way director Vittorio De Sica and screenwriter Cesare Zavattini have crucially conveyed all that this one bicycle means; the one thing keeping this family from falling into an impoverished abyss. And so the rest of the film, during which the father races all over Rome in search of the bike with his son tagging along, has a riveting intensity. You completely identify with Antonio's desperation, even managing to understand why this proud, dignified man makes an uncharacteristic climactic decision.The picture is a pure exercise in directorial virtuosity. As our man searches for the stolen bicycle, De Sica explores the terrible dehumanization of postwar life and finds that loneliness is its unifying theme. He carefully balances a generally tragic sensibility with a quiet undercurrent of hope, all the while sucking us into the story with the sheer urgency of the search for a stolen bicycle. Bicycle Thieves has a certain simplicity, quietness, and even naiveté that are more than welcome as a change from the deafening noise, ingenuity, and hollow sophistication of Hollywood. As the son Bruno, Enzo Staiola is a revelation. His funny face and urchin-like mannerisms make him the star of the film as he plays witness to the joyous and heartbreaking events ? the film's silent narrator. Likewise a greenhorn who turns in a touching performance is Lamberto Maggiorani as Antonio.Playwright Arthur Miller once described this masterpiece as "It is as though the soul of man had been filmed." He couldn't have put it in better words! Bicycle Thieves is a brilliant, tactlessly heartfelt work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Simple Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On first viewing I was a little disappointed with the ending because I asked myself "that's it?" On second viewing I was astounded by the power the ending showed that I was unable to experience on my first viewing - this makes sense, I think I was 16 when I saw this film for the first time.What's great about this movie is even aspects I wouldn't normally find to be good were done very well. Apparently the voice you hear of the leading man, the "man without a label" as the screenwriter calls him, is actually dubbed by a different actor. I could not distinguish this idea at all during my viewing, so it didn't break the illusion of the movie.The movie may only capture the events a tight time-span (two days or less), but it does it marvelously. I'll admit there is not too much going on after the man's bike is stolen and he and his son walk around Rome trying to find it, but there is a wonderful scene that depicts the class struggle where the man and his son eat at a restaurant and the man explains the importance of the bike. The boy sees a wealthier kid enjoying the luxury of melted cheese on his sandwich whereas the two characters at the center of the story have to have basic sandwiches due to their shortcomings. It is a simple, yet powerful scene.This film deals with harsh realities as the dad is unable to ever retrieve his bike - the boy who stole it probably having sold the parts before he could get to it. It is also such a powerful and shocking ending with what the protagonist decides to do, and with the kid holding his father's hand at the conclusion of the film, it is an action that shows they are now equals. They seem to be doomed to live in poverty, and the man has shown what it truly takes to survive in this dog eat dog world.</fullReview>

His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets to get back their bicycle. On his first day at work, his bicycle is stolen and the police can do little about it. He and his small son Bruno go on a journey in search for his stolen bike.The realism and the desperation is all there on the screen. One can truly sense a poor working class family. Sometimes a movie can show what poverty feels like. This is that movie. There is an ordinary feel to these characters probably due to the non-actors.

I re-watched it four times the following week, because never before had a movie touched me so deeply and profoundly ? and I must admit that I wept tears of grief and admiration. To me everything in this film is perfect ? the performances are splendid and very true to life and the story is simple but wonderful.In the center of the movie is a story about Antonio Ricci ? a men living in poor Rome neighborhood, who acquires a bicycle to get a job posting film posters in the city, to support his family. The bike gets stolen soon afterwards, so he goes looking for it across Rome with the help of his son and friends.Ricci's character is greatly portrayed by an unprofessional actor Lamberto Maggiorani, who portrays the character with admirable emotion and sincerity. The performances and also the way the movie is shot, make it stand above other films of the period.I would recommend this movie to anyone, seeing it is an unforgettable experience and possibly even a life changing one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real World Problems Subjected to Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This neo-surrealist Italian masterpiece from filmmaker Vittorio de Sica is a classic by many standards and remains one of the top films of the century. The flawless link between the socio-economic problems of a post-World War II Italy and the criminal leanings of the disenfranchised peoples of that country are melded seamlessly. Looking at just one family during this period, the film follows the breadwinner Antonio Ricci (Maggiorani) around town as he tries to find his stolen bicycle. He has his young son (Staiola) in tow which makes it that much more humiliating when it becomes almost impossible for him to find it anywhere, whether he's perusing the marketplace or hunting down the thief himself. He becomes more unsettled as the day wears on, because he needs the transportation in order to keep a job, and the world around him seems to be more concerned with revolt and propaganda than real world solutions. The film speaks volumes about how crime is elicited by people based on their neediness and the fact that most crime stems from the government's inattention to societal problems. Italy was in a shambles after the deconstruction of Mussolini's government, and at this time there was a large gap between the rich and poor. Besides speaking about Italy's problems in particular, this film also speaks about the origins of crime itself. There is no villain to the story about the stolen bicycle, only a narrative about the state of life for the people who steal and are stolen from. Both sides are getting screwed overall, but one decides to take a different path to gain agency. Having his son with him seriously makes this a tearjerker on top of everything, because he has been thieved from, and left to take care of his family with absolutely nothing. It really makes you think about the complexities of the human condition and how people truly see welfare. It tells a universal and yet very sad story and it does so in a heart wrenching and poignant way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The quest is for identity, a job, a better life and that's all in a bicycle.One of the most realistic films made in times just after world war where everyone in Italy was after a job and beg borrow or steal get a job coz that's the way for better living. Our hero is Antonio Ricci, married has a wife and a kid and gets a job that needs a bicycle. He affords a bicycle and it's stolen now his run to get it back makes the whole movie. He devises ways, catches in fact the thief too, but did he succeed? See it to know it. We all know, that a heart once lost cannot be found again and a life once lost can never be gained again. But if we lose a bicycle, there is a hope of getting it again and it's proved here that hope drives a human being more than anything else.The movie camera moves to and fro into the frames to bring in emotions out of the extremely heart broken but still hopeful Ricci and camera itself acts as a character by bringing out the milieu of the times and the locales. What beautiful thing to know that times then were so very hopeless and still hope is what drove everything in each one.It's easily one of best directed and acted films that has no histrionics but simple plain real life portrayals. The music is simple and there is not much to edit in the movie which means it's perfect as it is. Loved, the way it was made, it was then un compromisingly made and hats off to that.Easily one of the best movies ever. It's 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The drama and miracle of everyday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this story so great? The answer is not that simple. Take the social level of the story. You'd say it is no more relevant. You'd say a bike (the crux of the story in this movie) is nowadays just a bike, nothing else. Actually the social level of the story goes beyond the relevance of the bike. Let's translate it in nowadays language: it's about our ambition to be middle class, the craziness of our ambition to be middle class, our impossibility to be middle class. "Once a picaro, always a picaro" (would say Alarcón). Once a no-have, always a no-have. The bike is but a myth, says the movie: the middle class is but a myth.And the story goes beyond its social level: it's the personal drama of a no-have guy against a universe of no-haves (like him) completely indifferent to his drama. Nobody's innocent in this story, while nobody's guilty: everyone fights to make ends meet, everyone is indifferent to the large picture.And above all these, it is the eye of Vittorio de Sica, his extraordinary empathy for this universe of no-haves (a lesson learned from the movies of Chaplin). A universe of a superb picaresque quality: so real, so everyday, while every now and then exploding in surreal!And Enzo Staiola, the kid always standing by his father, against all odds. And the lesson the kid gets in the end: your father is not a hero, rather somewhere between hero and jerk like everyone else, nevertheless he is your father. Great lesson!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theft and Poverty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie, "The Bicycle Thieves" we are able to see the meaning of Ne-realism at it's best. Neorealism defined as a style of filming prominent in Italy after World War II, characterized by a concern for social issues and often shot on location with untrained actors. This film seems really "real" to the viewers and we are able to connect with Antonio. This film was filmed in the streets because after World War II, studios had been destroyed. In the film we are able to see Antonio's struggle to better himself to help support his family. It is social issue we can all relate to. It's a story of an illusion that was shattered when his bike was stolen from him. A major emphasis put on the bike throughout the film as the search to locate the stolen bike in the streets of Rome begins. Not an easy task but to Antonio this bike is so important; it represents a job, a home, food, and family. It's an illusion that Antonio has that he's tempted to steal a bicycle himself due to his loss of hope. Getting the bike back is all that is Antonio's mind. In the film, "Bicycle Thieves", we are able to see the cycle of theft and poverty as Antonio makes the ultimate decision to gain his stolen bicycle by doing the same and stealing another man's bicycle in his desire to reach this illusion that represents a better life for him and his family.The bicycle in this film is of high importance; it symbolizes the working class status as the important motive, presenting a Ne-realistic Italian society after World War II. The film also contains a logic that shows how contradictory and disappointing life can be. Antonio is offered a job requiring a bicycle. Not having one, his wife Maria pawns some household items in order to acquire the needed transportation. Then on his first day of work, the bike is devastatingly stolen. He needs a job because he has no money, but to get a job he needs a bicycle, a bicycle costs money, which he surely can't afford. This goes to show part of the cycle of theft and poverty with the last scene of the film to completely demonstrate the cycle. In the opening scene we are able to sense the pain of neglect as we see a crowd of unemployed men rush forward as the officer is announcing the name of the lucky man. After two years of being unemployed, Ricci is finally offered a job as poster hanger and we're able to see the happiness it's brought him. As Ricci stands out, the camera allows us to have a view of the crowd. Instead of directly shooting at people's faces, the camera portrays the back of their heads. Then as the camera turning around, we finally see a group of young men waiting for the moment when the officer calls their names. De Sica uses the dehumanized images to allude and to show what the government sees these people (Doubon.com). As the viewers, we see them as young muscular Italians; however, for the government, they are just a group of livestock waiting for the meaningless jobs.The scene I have chosen to analyze is the scene where the father steals a bike from a side street and gets chased by a crowd of people. We are able to see the humiliation this creates for both his son and him. Antonio does not carry those characteristic traits to go out and steal from people. The situation he was in is what led him to the decision to steal the bike of another person. It might not have been the right thing to do but he had lost all hope. Getting another person back seemed to be he's only chance he had of getting back to his job after he tried everything. He tried to do everything he could in order to get it back, searched everywhere and even when he had the robber in front of him the police couldn't do anything. To me the above scene is the most dramatic and intense part of the film. We are able to see an emotionally erratic son chase after his father because he sees people grabbing him and shouting at him. Even though, these are untrained actors, it is incredible to see how well they display emotions. We feel a connection with the little boy when see the worried expression painted across his face and the tears of sadness. We can't help to feel sorry for both of them because we know the circumstances he made that action to steal a bike. Poverty was a key driver to the actions of Antonio and we are able to see it in the film and how it plays an important role in it. We are able to see a city in ruins with people in ripped and dirty clothes which helps reinforce the idea of poverty in Italy at the time. This explains the reason behind Antonio's desperation to get his job back by locating his stolen bike. Even though, the bicycle is the main focus throughout the film, poverty is what lies behind it. If he was not poor, the bike would mean nothing to him. But this bike symbolizes a job that he desperately needs during this hard times. We are able to see poverty when his wife goes and sells their bed sheets to obtain the bicycle in order to attend his first day of work The film succeeds in creating empathy for Antonio's dejected state so that his ultimate act becomes an understandable and painful reaction. It supplies one possible answer to the question: What makes a thief?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tukta Phetasa March 24, 2014 Art 102: Ávalos Bicycle ThievesA roller-coaster ride of emotion Bicycle Thieves captures your undivided attention with its brutally honest take on Post War Italy. The Italian Neorealism was a movement in the film industry that generally characterized the daily lives of the lower class. This included showing the whole truth of living in poverty, oppression, injustice, and desperation in that time. Bicycle Thieves highlights the desperation in the Italian neorealist movement by showcasing the desperation a man faces trying to support his family. This story surrounds an inanimate object to draw forth your emotions. Not because of what the object is physically, but what it symbolizes as whole. The bicycle itself symbolizes salvation for a family in need because without this bike he cannot do his job and without his job he cannot provide for his family. This movie features Lamberto Maggiorani, who is not a professional actor he plays Ricci a man that lands a job hanging movie posters. This job requires that he must have a bicycle but Ricci has pawned it off to get money to pay for food. He knows that everyone around him is desperate to find a job so he lies and says he will have the bicycle by the start of work. He tells his wife that he finally finds a job but he unfortunately can't accept it. He is sad because he feels as if he cannot catch a break because every opportunity is ridden with false hope. His wife gives him the sheets to pawn off and trade it in for the bicycle.There was a scene where we were falsely misled into thinking the bike was going to be stolen when he takes his wife to a psychics' house so she could pay her for her husbands good fortune. Ricci doesn't know what she is going to do so he gets curious and follows her up even though she tells him to stay put. He tells someone to watch his bike as he goes to see what his wife is up to. Everyone thinks that this would be the moment that his bike would be stolen so you watch with a bad feeling in your gut. He then stops his wife from wasting money on the psychic by saying that he didn't get the job because she came to see him. He reports for work and someone teaches him how to paste the posters and as he is going on his own and is posting his first poster someone takes off with his bike. This seemed to be a group effort as someone rides off with his bike and someone else steers him into the wrong direction. There aren't as many people who were willing to help him capture the thief. The police weren't much help either after he goes to report the stolen bike. He then goes to his friends and they and his son Bruno go searching all over Rome trying to find his bike. Eventually his friends give up hope leaving him and his son to continue the search. Ricci gets desperate as he goes on a manhunt with his son. He starts accusing everyone and reveals that everyone is in the same boat as him. They are all dealing with poverty and despair as everywhere shares the same everyday struggles to find a job and support their family.Speaking of family, his son Bruno steals the show because he pulls emotions from you that you wouldn't otherwise get from just watching the father desperately search for a bike. Bruno showcases his fathers' insufficiency to provide for his family as he ignores his son. One scene he gets so frustrated and fed up that he slaps Bruno, as horror rushes through Bruno's face he walks way from his father. Then a huge crowd gathers as someone is yelling about a boy drowning in the water. Ricci rushes to the water petrified and filled with regret as he discovers that the boy was not Bruno. After this sigh of relief he still doesn't apologize or rejoice that his son is alive. In another scene we see that he is almost hit by a car but his father doesn't seem to care as he has an expressionless walk contemplating revenge. The cycle is about to repeat itself as Ricci tries to steal another mans bicycle but in his desperation and unsuccessful attempt at trying to even the odds. He gets caught and this time there are tons of people who try to stop him, as his boy Bruno watches in shock of what his father had just done. In the final scene the man reluctantly lets him go instead of putting him in jail as he sees Bruno's frightened and sadden look. In the end he doesn't get resolution but instead he gets humiliation, his son was his savior and Ricci loses all his self-respect. De Sica truly captures real emotions by captivating the audience with real settings and a nonprofessional cast. He makes it pretty predictable by making it extremely believable and not too far-fetched to understand. Ricci's dry emotions really capture his distress and humiliation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where we see just why there are still so many bicycle thieves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking through his career, I note I've seen about ten of De Sica's directorial efforts, mostly Italian. Surprisingly also, I found he was directing movies even during World War 2, all through the Fascist period in Italy. At the end of the war, of course, the world had been changed ? and unhappily for many, they were left destitute, poverty-stricken and with little hope for a better life.And that's the thematic core of this movie: a man's desperate search for the means to escape from the enervating poverty which pervades Italian society soon after the guns become silent. Most viewers would sympathize with any person on such a quest. De Sica, however, subverts viewers expectations with a fundamentally flawed character, Antonio (played by Lamberto Maggiorani) ? Mr Everyday Ordinary Italian Citizen ? who, after having his bike stolen, desperately searches his neighborhood over a weekend to find it ? and dragging his young son Bruno (Enzi Staiola) along with him as helper... but also as an emotional crutch for himself. Did I say flawed? Antonio is so inept, so much a klutz, he can't wake up to find a job; he can't even perform a simple task; and he can't even keep his eye on his highly prized and expensive bike to prevent it being stolen.Some would regard such a story as bland; and it is when regarded as just one man's inability to succeed against the odds. However, Antonio's quest could be viewed through another lens: as a symbol for a whole country struggling to regain its wealth after twenty long years of Fascism and war. Sure, it's a story about two bicycle thieves and what happens to them. Clearly, however, as the plot proceeds, De Sica shows there could be and probably are a great many bicycle thieves throughout the society ? but all posing as upright, honest citizens. Why else would De Sica make such a movie, bring such an apparently ordinary story to a full-length, feature film?In doing so, though, the story crystallizes and reinforces the bullying, strong-arm tactics of the Fascists with scenes of mobs; of caricatured actors practicing a musical score amidst grinding poverty; of a compliant church and priests wringing their hands (one being a young Sergio Leone); of police fatalism about crime; and of a victim ? Antonio ? squeezed into an invisible, intolerable vice. To that extent, this movie is an implicit attack on the whole Fascist era and the destruction it wrought upon the entire country. Fortunately, it was Pier Paulo Pasolini who finally executed the polemical, cinematic coup-de-grace to Fascism with his release of Salo (1975) ? an horrific satire that is definitely NOT for the easily-offended or the faint-hearted.Do see Bicycle Thieves, however. It's a flawless production and made better with the use of real places in Rome, using real, inexperienced people as actors. It's also still the stuff of real life for hundreds of millions, even today, in many parts of the world.Give this nine out of ten. Highly recommended.February 4, 2014</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. To understand why this is considered a masterpiece of cinema and one of the best films ever made, one must put the era of its release into perspective. It's 1948 - post war Italy and poverty is everywhere. Humanity is difficult to come by. Hollywood is in a glitz and glamor mode, while Italian cinema has been dominated with light-hearted and simple films. Vittorio De Sica is a matinée idol as an actor and also, as a director, one of the driving forces of Neo-realism ... a genre that focused on the struggles of real people.There is nothing fancy or complicated about this story. Ricci is one of the masses looking for work at a time when jobs are beyond scarce. One day he is extremely fortunate to be offered a job posting signs around town. He is elated at the opportunity to again provide for his wife and young son. The only catch ... he must have a bicycle for the job. His wife pawns their bedsheets to retrieve the bicycle and we join in with their pride and happiness brought on by this job.We see Ricci on a ladder posting a Rita Hayworth movie advertisement ... an example of Hollywood's polar opposite approach to movies as compared to the Italian neo-realism. While on the ladder, Ricci witnesses the theft of his precious bicycle. His frantic reaction demonstrates the loss means so much more than the loss of two-wheeled transportation. It's actually the loss of hope.Soon enough Ricci and his young son Bruno are searching the streets of Rome trying to find the bicycle. It plays like a road trip movie as they experience many interactions on the streets and back alleys. Their search is painful to watch and father and son endure many emotions, none more powerful than the last few minutes and a touching final shot that is a tribute to the great Charlie Chaplin.All three lead actors are first timers which adds to the realistic look and feel of the characters and stories. Lamberto Maggiorani (Ricci) was a factory worker who showed up for auditions. He is a very striking man with a Daniel Day-Lewis appearance. Enzo Staiola (Bruno) was a 7 year old boy just watching the whole movie process when he was picked out of the crowd and cast. Lianella Carell (Maria) was a journalist on set to interview De Sica when he cast her as the wife/mother. Additionally, most of this was filmed on the streets and on location in Rome (very few sets).The actual Italian title is "Ladri di biciclette" which translates into Bicycle Thieves, but it has been best known in the U.S. as The Bicycle Thief. It's based on a novel by Luigi Bartolini and the screenplay comes from the incredibly prolific screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, who worked with most of the great filmmakers from the 1940's through the 1970's. Also of note, Sergio Leone was an assistant to director Vittorio De Sica during production. De Sica directed many wonderful films including Sunshine (1947), which looked at juvenile corruption, and Umberto D. (1952) which examined old age.Many question the status of this film as a masterpiece all these years later, but I certainly still experience it's powerful and sensitive message, and would recommend to anyone who admires world cinema and the classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True classic cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1948 film Ladri di Biciclette (The Bicycle Thieves) has generated enough acclaim in its life so there is hardly a necessity for another review, but as an aspiring screenwriter, after I came across a 1950 NY Times article by Arthur Miller that praised the film for its simplicity, I though I'd be worth examining for the purposes of learning about simple filmmaking. How to make a great film based on a simple story with very few characters. Arthur Miller calls this one-track conflict of a film "to be very close to a lyrical masterpiece."The plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one. This job requires a bicycle which the Man also fortuitously procures. During the the Man's first day on the job his bicycle is stolen. The rest of the film focuses on his crusade to find the stolen bicycle and thereby remain employed.There is a real aesthetic beauty as the Man and his Son tramp the streets, the camera follows, and the city dominates. Rome is so influential that characters lives, their interactions, and their relationships are molded and shaped by her. As the man follows clues to track down his bicycle he transverses what seems like the whole city. Moving from one Roman neighborhood to another, new scenes mean new characters, and new characters mean new conflicts.There are many touching scenes between Man and his Son, but one especially where we think the Son has hurt. This scene reaffirms that the Man's true priorities are first and foremost with his family, but within seconds the Man is pulled right back into the chaos of the hunt for the bicycle. Throughout the entire film injustice reigns, paired with the utter simplicity of the film's production, Ladri di Biciclette is a truly remarkable achievement. An example of unadorned, simple cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragedy of everyday life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bicycle Thieves" is a tragedy of everyday life. The storyline has no secret or mystery to reveal. It is just a man in a desperate struggle for the right to have a better life. And it is a note about the crushing helplessness and anonymity with which the poorer classes struggle in modern society. This is exactly what excites me most in the movie: disoriented and wandering aimlessly through the streets of Rome, the man intersects with crowds of other men like him, each trapped in its day-to-day, ignorant and uninterested in the problems other. Interaction with others is invariably characterized by conflict - there is no time or resources to listen to matters that are not ours. And, in the face of the man, there is constantly drawing the dread of disaster "God, what do I do now? how can I support my family?".</fullReview>

Our invisible spectator-spirit floats through space following Ricci through his day of success and failure. We can see all and can change nothing. The outcome is the same for all men; a trial that must be endured each time it occurs. A trial that has no blame or fault, just the same trial that every man withstands in his life. No film conveys this struggle better than Bicycle Thieves. A purely masculine film is Bicycle Thieves. The feminine exists only to comfort and support. Please watch this film with a quiet understanding that life is inexplicable and inescapable.</fullReview>

But, boy, this is a very, very inspiring movie that delivers a message so powerfully, you gotta think about at least one of its factors before you complete listing your top 50!A man desperate to get back his stolen bike, this talks about the poverty, emotions, post-WW II empathy, reality &amp; the plight of the people stricken with the war.

Music is great, but editing is average going by the year it was released.

		<shortDescription>Bicycle Thieves - Steals the Show, Immortally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an immortal classic and now I know why. What a brilliant piece of film making at display! It is close to impossible to better this piece of work for many reasons, most importantly because it would take an event of the order of WW II to be able to do that. Of course, one can recreate it through a period drama but you can not recreate what isn't real(or neoreal) anymore with the same effect. The movie depicts the social,economical and cultural panorama of Italy(focus on the lower/middle class) which is still suffering from the after effects of the war and is trying hard to limp its way out of it. Vittorio De Sica shows it all without ever focusing on it but through a very simple story in the forefront. There is no fuss around the story, there are no sub plots, there aren't any superfluous scenes either. The plot is as simple as it gets. It's the reality of characters and the treatment given to the film that creates a winning combination. The skill of director is such that withing ten minutes into the movie, one starts to relate with the protagonist and empathise with his situation. This certainly doesn't happen because of the problems and challenges the protagonist faces. Its the liveliness and realism that each frame of the movie possesses that completely absorbs the viewer into it.The impact of the movie is accentuated because at the center of the plot lies a father-son duo. Its a relationship which is mostly understated be it the reel life or the real, which of course opens up the possibility of multiple layers. Once there is so much screen time available for this relationship to be portrayed, magic is always on cards, all it takes is a magician who can play the tricks right from his heart and for once not keep anything away from his audiences. This is exactly what Vittorio has been able to do here. If, like me you have also seen Life is Beautiful(1997) before Bicycle Thieves ,you will constantly be reminded of Bengini's masterpiece and which will in a way amplify the goodness of the experience. The fact that the kid here was also (Just like Lamberto was not a pro prior to this role of his) directly picked from the streets gives an immensely raw and mature feel to the kid's character and that reflects directly in the quality of each scene.His expressions, mannerisms,and specially the reflexes are too real to have been directed by anyone.The brilliance of the movie also lies in the fact that it is being filmed in the same city of Rome which has those typically beautiful Europeon streets, lanes, walls, bridges and markets. These characteristics would have otherwise perfectly catered and serviced to the tastes of people who have special liking for these but yet the plot and its presentation is so strong and gripping that one hardly gets a chance to wander away from the core of it.Bicycle Thieves, which is nothing less than splendid till its final chapter begins to unfold, transcends into the realm of immortality within a matter of minutes with what transpires. In those few minutes, you would look at yourself inside out (there are chances you might end up feeling naked), you would see those 'moments of truth' from your past flashing past your eyes at frantic pace and you are bound to experience a range of emotions at once. This was one of the very few occasions in my film watching career where I have found myself inside the frame as the movie begins to throw the end credits</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neorealist, Timeless, Humane Masterpiece from BICYCLE THIEF to BICYCLE THIEVES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You live and you suffer" (Antonio Ricci) Life is an altogether weird phenomenon: it makes us experience a cycle of joys and sorrows, losses and achievements that appear within and around ourselves. If you have ever found yourself within a labyrinth of 'civilized cages' created by social and emotional life, BICYCLE THIEVES is a film that will touch you tremendously. As the purest representative of the Neorealist movement begun by Roberto Rossellini in 1945, the movie, directed by great Vittorio De Sica and written by his collaborator Cesare Zavattini, has been widely acclaimed as a masterpiece. Just to quote some eminent reviewers: "Again the Italians have sent us a brilliant and devastating film;" (Bosley Crowther, New York Times); "Neorealism never got more real...a brilliant, tactlessly real work of art;" (Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian); "Marriage of form and meaning" (Steven D. Greydanus). Its simple, modest communication is clear to vast majority. So to say, both a child and a parent will find something unforgettable here thanks to...direct content.There is, actually, no storyline but a picture of a situation in post-war Rome, a plague of poverty and unemployment that affects the protagonist, Antonio Ricci and his family - wife Maria and two children, little boy Bruno and a newborn baby. In the opening sequence, the camera is in between the situation, which makes the method exceptionally magnetic. Antonio Ricci is given a job at last, but there is one condition ? owning a bicycle. Thanks to a peculiar idea of his wife, he can redeem a bike at a pawn shop and begin his job of delivering and putting up posters. However, as soon as the 'Singular' title BICYCLE THIEF complicates a lot in his/their lives, everything gradually leads towards the 'Plural' BICYCLE THIEVES (consider an interesting analysis of title versions by Bob Graham). That is where the things we observe become the things we empathize with. The core gist of the movie is a human being placed among other human beings. In what ways? FATHER-SON RELATIONS: De Sica with Zavattini beautifully present to us this 'couple' of male characters with the overwhelming screen presence of non professionals: Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staida (in accordance with the purest form of Neorealism). At first, Bruno (Enzo Staida) is very willing to help his dad ? it is a natural driving force in him and yet, when he encounters the growing obsession of his father, the little boy gets confused and totally puzzled. Their relations are based on spontaneous emotions that, on the one hand, uplift them and, on the other hand, depress them. With reference to Crowther's words, this "classic plan" is manifested in them, the "plan in which the comedy and tragedy of daily life are recognized." The inhumane rush that they both experience, the rush towards a dead-end destination poisons their mutual existence. Skills and effectiveness stand in confrontation with motives and will. Is there any redemption from all this psychological state of a materialist slave who creates a mindful uproar? Note the scenes of Bruno falling in the street behind his father who does not even notice it. Moreover, the eye contact that appears to be an attempt of the boy to see his dad's reactions is something that remains from the silent perfection of portraying emotions without words.SOCIAL DEPRAVITY: With reference to Crowther's words, 'he (De Sica) is holding a mirror up to millions of civilized men," the movie addresses "complex social world that is ironically blessed with institutions to comfort and protect mankind." It does it similarly like other great cinematic products of the post war Italy. Ignoring the historical circumstances of BICYCLE THIEVES, its signal is something of a timeless, ever-current warning: Look around because there is someone ? an individual or a family - who may suffer more than you. Let me focus on their mutual 'odyssey' for a while that bears resemblance with Fellini's unforgettable character of Cabiria played by Giulietta Masina in NIGHTS OF CABIRIA. Although there is a huge difference between the protagonists, the movies bear certain resemblance. Who are the people they meet on their way? No matter if a policeman, a bus driver, a marketeer, a seminarian, a beggar, a fraud, a clairvoyant, a mother, Bradshaw refers to them as 'faces.' What do they appear if not either mere shadows that come and go or charlatans keen on sheer profit? Apart from the plot of one Santona, a Wise Woman who owns an alleged power to see into mysteries of past, present and future, there is an additional aspect of startling social discrepancies and celebrity admiration. While Cabiria visits her idol Alberto Lazzari, Antonio focuses his subconscious spellbound on Rita Hayworth's sex appeal in the poster. The sets of Rome, including Porta Portese, Via del Traforo or Lungotevere Ripa and Via Pietro da Cortona with Stadio Flaminio supply us with a more intense combination of spots and people. At the same time, they constitute mindful witnesses of the protagonists' desperate quest. A note should be made of interesting score that evokes moods, sometimes sorrows, sometimes joys. Consider the Trattoria scene when Bruno is granted a little reward, little moment of peace and a human minute within the wretched rush. Yet, even there, 'let's forget all this' occurs to turn into 'put down some numbers.' There is also excellent use of clues, for instance when Antonio leaves his new bike at the gate of Wise Woman, La Santona...we expect that it is going to be stolen there (having suggested that from the title) but...not yet.The film begins and ends with simplicity...a child and his diverse feelings expressed on face. These moments tell him more about his dad than any words could ever do so...Life for him is a constant search for something, perhaps by skipping simple joys of childhood, simple wandering and playing. A great insight into child's authenticity that ignores complications...kids simply want to LIVE...only allow them to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Antonio Ricci is an unemployed man in the depressed post-World War II economy of Italy. With a wife and two children to support, he is desperate for work. He is delighted to at last get a good job pasting up posters, but he has to have a bicycle. He is told unequivocally, "No bicycle, no job." His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets in order to get money to redeem his bicycle from the pawnbroker. On his first day of work, Antonio's bicycle is stolen by a young thief.This film is listed by just about everyone as one of the greatest films of all time. It has influenced everyone, and pushed the "realist" style of film, especially with the use of non-professional actors. It even inspired the film "Pee Wee's Big Adventure".For me, I have an interest in Italian film, but a fairly small knowledge of it beyond the horror realm (Bava, Fulci, Argento, etc.). This film was quite possibly more influential in Italy than America, and it is interesting that Sergio Leone appears in an uncredited role... he could debatably be said to be the most successful Italian director of all time.Does this film deserve all its praises? In short, yes. I am not going to add much here just because you will universally find positive reviews, and I am not going to disagree with those whom I agree with and whom have said their pieces better than I could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A heart-rending, beautiful film. Neil Simon's "Out-Of-Towners" owes something to this movie, particularly that sense of utter helplessness and alienation when luck turns against one. At first I feared it would be too sociological and diagnostic, but it turned out to be a work of art, radiating beauty. Beauty is what distinguishes art from propaganda. The one manipulative aspect in the movie was the little boy joining his father in search of the bicycle. I felt that was too Chaplinesque and melodramatic. I think the movie would have been better without the boy. The man's abysmal solitude would have been highlighted. I get the impression that the movie makers felt that a lone adult would elicit less sympathy than an adult and a kid. What appealed to me most were the elements beyond the plot: the music and the visual effects, the sights and sounds. A good movie is never just "about" something or other. A good movie uses the plot as a mere theme for the creation of beauty. Otherwise we have nothing but dramatized sociology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many films that were made more than 40-50 years ago are difficult to watch at times. Not because they are low-quality, but because the storytelling techniques were different, and in this case, the subject matter was just an overall downer. Now, I have adapted to watching foreign films. There was a time when I didn't like the subtitles side to those films, but I've seen so many now that I don't really even think about it. So my opinions on the film reflect nothing to do with the fact that it's a foreign film, or old for that matter. But I have to say, I didn't really think Bicycle Thieves was as good as the critics have rated it, or good enough to be on one of the all-time greatest films list.There's nothing bad about the film though, it's a unique story about a family in war-time Italy and the struggles that everyone went through in finding a job at that time. These people had no choice but to work, and they had to work jobs that they may not have been pleased with. I liked that part of the movie. They did a great job at making believe that this was a place where a bicycle could get stolen just like that. But to be honest I never found the full story to be all that interesting. The kid tries to throw in some comedic relief and dramatic depth to the role but some of it falls pretty flat. But I did get a little bit of that Life is Beautiful vibe from their relationship at times, that much I liked.The problem with the film is that I didn't care enough about the characters to feel something when the going got rough. For the most part, our lead character is pretty unlikable and doesn't do enough to make himself appealing anyway. The acting is fine, the film looks fine, and the directing is fine, but that's not good enough. I found too many things in the film to just be average.+Set up the world nicely +Acting is fine -Kid's performance is iffy-Didn't feel special 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, touching and powerful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Italian neorealist film is known in 3 titles: the original ('Ladri di biciclette'), the English ('Bicycle Thieves') and the American ('The Bicycle Thief'). The Italian title literally translates into English as 'Bicycle Thieves', because "ladri" is in plural. As such, the English title makes more sense than the American one, because the desperate protagonist becomes a bicycle thief himself.The story is set in Rome and the camera does a good job in showing the streets of that city and capturing the rest. And the fact that it is in black and white makes it deeper and gives it a more nostalgic feeling. Call it good cinematography.Something very curious (which would be impossible today) is that, instead of professional actors, they used people without experience in acting. Yet, they are brilliant in their roles, particularly Lamberto Maggiorani (the leading actor, who portrays Antonio Ricci) and Enzo Staiola (as his cute little son Bruno). They are so convincing and realistic in their performances. It's as if, more than portraying the characters, they BECAME them.It's an extremely simple movie in all ways: cinematography, plot, etc. Not that there is anything wrong or bad about that, quite the contrary! It's a good movie.The film tells the story of Antonio Ricci, a poor man who needs a job urgently and actually finds one (hanging up posters), but with one condition: he's gotta own a bicycle - which is necessary for the work. No bicycle, no job. Get it? So he buys one, but in order to buy it his wife is forced to pawn the sheets of their bed.The good news don't last. Just as he is starting his 1st day in the new job, his bicycle is robbed. He's forced to search for the bicycle with the help of Bruno and other people he knows, as the police doesn't help him at all. Of course that such task will be very difficult and, in fact, they spend hours trying to find it in Rome's streets.During the search, Ricci and Bruno spend time together and they even go to a restaurant where they eat a nice meal: mozzarella bread. During the whole film, the connection between Bruno and his father is notorious, as Bruno often looks at him and helps him in the various circumstances.When Ricci finally encounters the thief and angrily demands him to give back what belongs to him, it's no use. No one but Bruno helps him in this situation. The bike doesn't appear, the thief's neighbors fiercely defend him, there ain't any witnesses and even the policeman isn't much of a help. He loses in the most humiliating and unfair way and the thief simply gets away with it.The climax of the story comes when, in a moment of despair (although not without some hesitation), Antonio steals one bicycle but is seen taking it and caught by angry men who mistreat him. Luckily, he is set free. The movie ends with father and son depressed, holding hands and crying. That is the most emotional part of the film. And that is undeniably one of the most poignant and dramatic endings in film history.The guy was simply out of luck. When his bicycle was taken, nobody saw and nobody even tried to stop the thief. When he was the one stealing one, he was ferociously chased and caught. Life is so ungrateful. Plus, it's not just some bicycle. His life and his family's too depend on that bicycle, as without it he can't have the job.In fact, this movie is a take on the situation of many italians who, after the World War II, were poor, unemployed, going through great difficulties to get a job and without perspectives of future. Just how many of us feel now. Only today the situation seems far more critical and it just keeps getting worse every year.As a movie, it can be somewhat difficult to judge, although it is one of the most regarded Italian films and appears in many lists of the all time's finest films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bicycle Thief (Ladri di Biciclette) (1948)5 word summaryLosing more than a bikeDuring the Postwar depression in Italy unemployment is high. Antonito Ricci and his family are one of the many effected by this. Ricci finally lands a job hanging up posters but the only way he can have the job is if he has a bicycle. No bike no job. His wife sells some bed sheets to get his bicycle out of a pawn shop. Almost right away a man steals his bicycle while he is hanging a poster. Ricci chases after him but the thief is to fast and Ricci loses him. He tries to tell the police, they care but cant waste time on such a small crime, all they can do is get the bike if he finds it in a pawn shop. He begins a desperate search for his bike, and really his whole life. he knows that if he cannot find it he and his family will starve. The Bicycle Thief is beautiful in many ways. Directing, cinematography, acting, writing, everything is almost perfect. Its deep and meaningful and thought provoking. There is so much hope and depression together in one film. The bicycle is more than just a bike to Antonito, its his life. Without the bike he can't work, he can't eat, or provide for his family at all, without it he can't live.****Spoilers****With how depressing the film is you can't help but think it's going to have a happy ending. While it is depressing there's that sense of hope that makes he think he will find the bike at the end. Near the end when you see Antonito on the corner with his son and he's looking at the bikes you slowly see the desperation kicking in deep. In which I think is the best 30 seconds (give or take) in the film. The directing and acting in this scene is amazing. Watching him you can feel his desperation getting deeper and deeper, while he paces and looks back and forth between the single bike and the group of bikes. When he steals the lone bike and makes a run for it everyone chases him down, which unfortunately didn't happen when his bike was stolen. Dozens of men catch him and hold him until the bike owner comes over. Antonito's son runs to him crying, the man sees he's not just some criminal and says to let him go because he has enough problems. All the other men start yelling at Antonito saying he should thank God that he's not going to jail because that's where he belongs, and maybe he would prefer that. As he walks away him and his son are destroyed, crying and holding hands. Antonito grips his sons hand tighter, he knows his life is over? and the film ends.Its possibly one of the most depressing films I've ever seen, up there with Requiem for a Dream.****end spoilers****Its so powerful. Anyone who appreciates good old films shouldn't miss this one. I know many people (especially younger ones) are against watching black and white or even foreign films, and if you skip watching this because of either of these reasons you are a fool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De la Sici landmark film about poverty and unrest Italy Post WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(1948) Ladri di biciclette. Director Antoni de Sica made many very commercial movies in Italy in the 1930s &amp; 40s. The Bicycle Thief is considered a landmark film for its realistic portrayal of hard times in Italy. Now the technique is called Italian Neo-Realism. I made a random movie pick yesterday to watch this director's other famous movie Umberto D. That film impressed me so much I decided to immediately follow it with his earlier work. Antonio Ricci, unemployed for over two years, is overjoyed when he's finally given a job putting up posters. There's a catch, though - he needs a bicycle as a requirement of the job, so he pawns the family linen to get a pawned bicycle back. He goes off to his first day's work, truly happy for the first time in years - &amp; the title of the film gives away what happens next. Even though the film is about the fathers job &amp; stolen bicycle the movie follows the young 5 year old son &amp; the boys reaction to all the things that happen that Sunday afternoon when he &amp; his father go about Rome trying to find the fathers stolen bicycle. Lately there have been some reviews panning this movie calling it emotionally manipulative. That is true &amp; that aspect &amp; the neo realism make this film a particularly interesting one since it was made pre 1950. For me a poignant tearjerker might be a better description. The man with the stolen bike loves his family &amp; wants to protect &amp; support them. Post Wartime in Italian society makes that difficult. Even today 2010 we call can identify economic problems. You can read a lot about de Sici on wikipedia &amp; the start &amp; end of Italian neo-realism. The film won an honorary Oscar in 1949 &amp; has won praise for years &amp; I continue to give it praise?it is a very fine movie. When it was released, it was seen as a Marxist fable (Zavattini the writer) was a member of the Italian communist party). Be sure &amp; view the extras on this DVD they provide more info about the writing &amp; plot process. 5 Stars Great Movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-Interest in The Bicycle Thief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story begs the question: what would you do to support your family? It forces the audience consider poverty and unemployment, issues that we must confront even today. As we sympathize with Antonio, possibly attempting to justify his actions in our mind, we must then analyze the young thief who stole Antonio's bike, the cause of our frustrations from the beginning of the film, and give him the same sympathy. Perhaps he was only trying to feed his family as well. Nevertheless, that didn't give him the right to steal another's livelihood, to put Antonio's family at risk. In the same way, Antonio's desperation doesn't give him the right to potentially put another man's family at risk by stealing his bike. Owning a bike becomes the conduit through which selfish survival instincts allow man to exploit man. It also leads us to ask questions like: Does one society's need justify the misuse of another society? De Sica presents these questions to his audience by creating characters with which one can easily identify, and whose actions can be easily interpreted. It is through our reflections and interpretations that we can then know ourselves.The most respectable aspect of De Sica's film mastery is the way in which he gives the characters of The Bicycle Thief dignity and personal values despite their disadvantaged situation. Antonio's friends who work all night collecting garbage, then help him search for his bike all day are the epitome of compassion and friendship. His wife, as well, in her giving efforts to secure a job for him, exemplifies great consideration. De Sica skillfully pushes the audience to consider the seed of arrogance within Antonio that drives his actions, while maintaining in him a man deserving of our understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Authentic and Timeless Classic Which Captures Neo-Realism In All Its Heartless Glory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the '40s, '50s and early '60s Italian neo-realism was a strongpoint of European cinema. Few films came close to capturing the authenticity and bleak visual delight of which Italian neo-realism offered. The Bicycle Thief is a primary example of Italian neo-realism and defines the genre as a whole.The Bicycle Thief (or to some The Bicycle Thieves) depicts the story of a father and son's fascinating relationship. The story revolves around a poor man named Antonio Ricci who after being unemployed for two years gains a job. Of course he is ecstatic about becoming employed, yet he needs a bike as this is primary for his job of putting up posters. So he pawns some essential possessions in return for the bike, hoping to pay back for them with the job. Alas, on his first day his bike gets stolen; from here on the film follows the Antonio and his son's search for the bike.The Bicycle Thief is certainly not an upbeat film; rather it is a depressing slice of honest realism of how cruel the world really is. The film studies many aspects of human behaviour during desperate situations. On the surface The Bicycle Thief is a simple story, but once you start looking at the film closer you will notice an important social-commentary, a truly absorbing subtext and a sincere study of emotions.It is amazing just how well The Bicycle Thief has developed over time, still remaining poignant, affecting and heart-breaking in its outlook on society and life. The film asks questions of morals, such as "does Antonio care more about his job than his family?" or "does he care about his job for his family?" The film is so enthralling and challenging that it is open to different interpretations from the moralistic point of view. The film's power has not lost its force and ability to bring even the most strong of viewers to let out their pity for the characters we know only too well. It is sad when you realise that there are millions of people today in the same situation, trying so hard to make a decent living yet failing miserably.Another element which makes the film so professional and startlingly realistic is due to how the entire cast is based around almost all unprofessional actors and actresses. The acting is very direct and it is impossible not to pity the characters that you have grown to love throughout the film. The acting from the child is truly magnificent and is without-a-doubt one of the finest child performances of all-time, the child slides himself inside his role capturing the loss of innocence and deprivation he is growing-up around. The film's poetic and angry script echoes the protagonists' emotions and centres itself around them with a blissful ease. Director Vittorio De Sica constantly lays bare the lives of the everyday Italian from the film's period, making it a relatable film for the people the genuine lives that have been filmed. Vittorio De Sica is a master at his art, making films about the people and for the people. His messages on Italian life on politics still echo their force today.The consistent element of class-struggle is endorsed into the film's fluid narrative. The haunting and charming scene in the pizzeria shows the difference in classes and the Antonio's devotion to his son, possibly my favourite scene in the entire film. It is heartbreaking to see how money is always on Antonio's mind. He realises whenever he uses his money he is taking a risk and can barely afford the "luxury" of eating out, yet he wants his son to be happy. There are so many questions the film asks its viewers and so it deserves to be analysed. I can honestly say if you do not feel the slightest impact of The Bicycle Thief then I would question if you are truly human! The film captures the gritty feel of the streets of Rome through a stark and dirty vision. The camera sympathetically and delicately lays bare the lifestyle of the poverty-stricken citizens. It embroils all the elements of life in the city, fluidly capturing the sadness in the lives of people who have very little in life. When looked at today, The Bicycle Thief is a film that makes the viewer realise just how lucky you are and how people take modern lifestyle essentials for granted. The eloquently effective score captures the environment and character tones with an elegant aura, beautifully accompanying the scenes.The Bicycle Thief remains one of the most thoughtfully intelligent social-commentaries of all-time, offering countless revisits. Cinematic perfection, celluloid is rarely as perfect as The Bicycle Thief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best father &amp; son film... ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this third world the majority of us inhabit, we live in a society in which it has become almost normal to be a single mother with the overwhelming responsibility of children. It is a world in which a mother has become associated with the false ideas of having an unsurpassable bond with her child? a bond that is untouched? a bond that is envied. This is a shame, but luckily it is only an idea that has been perpetuated by the media, disillusioned government recognitions and poor cliché ridden films ? often with a strong Class undertone. Ladri Di Biciclette tells of another side of this contemporary notion, it tells of a fathers bond with his child and how this bond is called upon to uphold the family.The film really is beautiful and I would go so far as to call it a true work of art. Ladri Di Biciclette manages to deconstruct what some would see as chauvinist values - and in such a way that we really appreciate the male prerequisite of fatherhood. The plot incorporates the male lead with such precision that we, the audience, feel his every dilemma? his every decision? his every emotion. We also bond with the child to such an extent that we really share his tears. But then anyone really interested in viewing this film will at least be familiar with the pictures of the neo-realist genre and its attributes, so all these experiences are to be expected and this picture does not fail to deliver. I would even be bold enough to say that this film is the best film of the genre (although if interest in neo-realism you should also see Umberto D &amp; Stromboli)? to further that? this is the best film I've ever seen! Ladri Di Biclette touched a cord with me and if it doesn't with you then pay a visit to the circus because you must be made of stone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitter tale &amp; beautiful depiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While infusing a beautiful depiction of post-war Italy with the bitter tale of a man struggling to survive, Ladri Di Biciclette is a perfect example of neo-realist film. This film takes place at numerous locations around Rome, Italy. A church, a restaurant, a busy street, an apartment complex, and a warehouse are all depicted. The picture shows many artistic shots of the landscape such as when all the bicyclists ride through the streets, past parks, and around monuments of Rome as Antonio reports for his first day of work. Shots of glistening bicycle parts on a sales table, or a trolley slowing down on an empty street to drop off passengers have been inserted to artistically enhance the film. This reflection of traditional Italy can be contrasted to the fast paced modern look in French New Wave films such as 'Breathless,' directed by Jean-Luc Goddard, yet both achieve the documentary feel associated with their respective film movements. De Sica's film clearly advocates a realistic depiction of life including its less pleasant aspects. It explores the human condition and questions society, family, law enforcement, alliances, and mental anguish impeccably. The audience experiences the erosion of Antonio's pride. He is exceedingly proud of his new job and his new bike and takes great care to inspect every smooth edge of metal on his bike when he first receives it. This serves as the antithesis to the conclusion of the story, where he is caught trying to steal a bike. Though his intentions are merely to support his family he is ultimately stricken with shame and feels the lowest blow when his son, Bruno becomes aware that his own father has stooped to such a low level. The men who catch Antonio acknowledge that his broken and ashamed state is an even worse punishment than being arrested. The film closes here in true neo-realist style, leaving the hero void of all pride. The film also exemplifies the ineffectiveness of institutions in post-war Italy. "There's just no work for you!" states the man in the opening scene of the movie as a crowd of desperate men stand around in hopes of gaining employment. As the film shows a glimpse into this period of Italy's history, it also explores the uselessness of the police force and the social disarray of the era. Though subjective, told through De Sica's perspective, the police force is treated with derision. The premise of the protagonist's bike being taken is an example of the structural problems facing Italy. At the market it is believed that many of the bike parts are stolen, and it is impossible for Antonio and Bruno to locate parts from Antonio's bicycle. In a scene later on, Antonio confronts the "kid in the German hat" who is believed to have taken the bicycle, but is immediately shut up, verbally and physically, by a mob of neighborhood cronies. In this 'kangaroo court' the mob insists Antonio is crazy for accusing the boy. When the police do arrive to this scene, they are once again ineffective in restoring order as the cronies continue to shove the antagonist. One viciously yells, "Want to lose your wallet too?" This portrayal of the harsh and brutal nature of society is a seemingly accurate depiction of Italian history, and a clear presentation of the social ills. Its pessimistic view of the human condition is effectively disheartening, and at the same time a perfect example of Italian Neo-Realism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I shouldn't listen quite so much to critical opinions. I had heard for years that this was the best film ever made. I heard this mostly from film critics and would-be film critics. When I found that my local arthouse cinema was showing the film on my birthday, I thought it would be a nice present to myself. I wanted desperately to love this film, but all the rabid praise heaped upon it over the years was just too much for this (or any) film to live up to. It wasn't bad at all, but certainly not the greatest film I've ever seen. I found that it dragged on for at least half an hour longer than it should have. I thought De Sica took too long to get around to what I interpreted as his eventual point. A slow pace and a dawdling plot don't usually bother me, as long as the characters themselves are interesting. Unfortunately, I found the father to be thoroughly unlikeable, and I pitied the poor kid (Enzo Staiola, whose performance was perhaps the best thing about the film). I find it hard to believe that this is considered by so many to be the best film ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Revered as one of the foundation stones of Italian neorealism, it is a simple, powerful film about a man who needs a job.This story is so direct it plays more like a parable than a drama.True, Ricci is a character entirely driven by class and economic need. There isn't a lot else to him, although he comes alive in the pizzeria scene. True, the movie doesn't make a point of contrasting his poverty with high-living millionaires (wealth is illustrated as the ability to buy a plate of spaghetti). But if the film is allowed to wait long enough--until the filmmakers are dead, until neorealism is less an inspiration than a memory--"The Bicycle Thief" escapes from its critics and becomes, once again, a story. It is happiest that way.Such films stand outside time. A man loves his family and wants to protect and support them. Society makes it difficult. Who cannot identify with that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I can tick another acknowledged masterpiece off my watch-list, De Sica's timeless Neo- realism opus comprises of a non-professional cast, sternly portrays a grim reality of the post- WWII Italy, sets in a three-days span, Antonio (Maggiorani) is fortuitous enough to procure a job of pasting posters (Rita Hayworth's lionized poster of GILDA 1946) among the massive unemployed, but a bicycle is a prerequisite to secure the job, it is a luxury for his impoverished family, anyhow, they sell the bedsheets and get a bicycle, it seems that everything is going to be on the right track! A brief interlude happens when his wife Maria (Carell) detours to visit a seer to remunerate her prophecy, Antonio leaves his new bicycle downstairs and asks some kids playing around to keep an eye on it, then he goes upstairs to find out who is the mysterious woman Maria is visiting, it is an ingenious ploy to incite curiosities of whether the bicycle will be stolen or not, and forebodes the negligence later in the film, the bicycle is nicked in the first day of his work. Instead of going back home to be enveloped in Maria's whine and fault-finding, Antonio is a man of action, he contacts his friends for help and the next day, with his elder boy Bruno (Staiola), they roam around Rome and try to find the thief, which we all know is a long shot and it dooms to be a long day. From patrolling the recycling market to pursue a beggar who is in contact with the thief in the church, all the effort turns out to be fruitless, during the church scenes, there is trenchant allusion of religion's sanctimoniousness, it is no more than a relief station while justice is never an option for a non-believer. Antonio brings Bruno for a treat despite of all the frustrations, it is also a guilty compensation after his harsh behavior towards the innocent boy, the contrast between Bruno and a rich boy in the restaurant is glaringly affecting, it is when an idea comes to Antonio's mind, out of desperation, he resorts to the seer, to something he gives no credence, and after a bragging twaddle like "you will only find it now or never", ironically, right after he leaves the seer's building, the suspect is precisely walking in front of his eyes. Then things come to a maddening climax, without clear evidence and with the aid of a throng of protective neighbors, the thief amateurishly fakes a seizure to earn onlooker's compassion, even the policeman cannot help Antonio to arrest the miscreant. In the last resort, Antonio commits the theft to a bicycle, but he is outrun by the masses chasing him and to his mortification, Bruno witnesses everything with sobbed eyes, pragmatically, he is let off the hook, at least the world shows some mercy in the end, the ending sees Antonio and Bruno walk along with the stream of people, the future is unbeknown to them. Enzo Staiola is naturally endearing as the precocious son to whom audiences will ceaselessly project their empathy, brilliantly cast, so it Lamberto Maggiorani, adheres to life but seethes with anxiety. Alessandro Cicognini's pensive score is sometimes obtrusive but consistently emotive, and Carlo Montuori's cinematography enriches the misery with visceral intensity by shedding light on the close-ups to indicate characters' inner states. The film is a substantiated indictment for inequity which permeates the society ingrainedly, it doesn't extol the image of Italians after WII, but it never demonize them either, most of the people are from the struggled class, the moral ambiguity is a blockade to condemn them since life is not easy for any of them. First and foremost the film's sociological study on humanism enshrined itself as unsurpassable opus in the entire film history and its appeal is purely timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone raves about how great The Bicycle Thief is. Is it as great as everyone says it is? I cannot say. While I can recognize the power of the film and find the construction and filming to be excellent the movie drove me up the wall.Yes, Ricci is the post war Italian "common man." Yes, Ricci is ground down by the events that occur and he struggles with his relationship with his son...as well as his lower class place in society.Out of all the reviews, though, the thing that gets me is that Ricci is an idiot...and we are championing an idiot. Sure Ricci has his bicycle stolen...right from under his own eyes in a place where thievery is common. He should have been paying attention better. yet no one mentions this aspect in all the reviews.Then, there are bicycles all around Ricci. Ricci has a job if he has a bicycle...yet he has made it this far in life that there is no one Ricci can "cut a deal" with to get a bicycle to use? It seems to me that every step of the way Ricci does something more stupid in life. Ricci is part of the lower caste because he is an idiot who didn't learn.Reviewers seem to be in love with romantic tragic presentation of the poor hard luck people...although some perceptive types do note that the true story is the story of the father\son relationship. But I fail to see anyone noting that Ricci is in his desperate straits because of actions\decisions that he, Ricci, took by himself.For most people in life the dividing line between success and failure are the decisions that we make...and learning from our failures. Ricci never learned. If you love weepy emotional stories of the poor downtrodden then this is one of the paragons of cinema for you. For this reviewer the one time viewing was enough. If I want to see a bicycle stolen I'd rather see Pee Wee's Big Adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladri means plural of thief. Singular is ladro. This is what Antonio calls the person who stole his own bicycle. Thoughts and observations about this movie, which I have just watched for course in cinema at university. Shocking but cool part where thief's mother (??) empties contents of chamber pot onto crowds below. Is her son faking his sort-of-seizure? It's all very convenient. Funniest thing is that he did not appear ill at all, when he sized up Antonio's unsecured bicycle and decided to steal it. The bad part is that Antonio is so honest, but later in the film, of course, he decides to steal a bicycle himself. I feel that he is a very moral man who deserves a break financially. Surely the wealthier family at the table in the restaurant can afford quite a few bicycles, not to mention their ownership of motor vehicles and the requisite chauffeur cordon. What was this ritzy family doing in a restaurant where Antonio and Bruno would eat? (This reminds me of Downton Abbey and all the pretentiousness of the wealthy upperclass snobs, who were post-World War One about to lose their sources of income). The snottiness of the wealthy son toward little Bruno was uncalled for. Perhaps the rich family was getting rich off the misfortunes of the poorer people. Perhaps they owned a string of pawn shops where all the luckless young mothers were forever hocking their dear, precious dowry bedsheets. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Only One Of The Greatest Films Of All Time But Also The Most Essential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Featuring unprofessional actors in starring roles, shot in real locations with no studio sets &amp; using only natural light to capture its drama, Bicycle Thieves (also known as Ladri di Biciclette) is one of the finest &amp; most influential films to come out from Italian Cinema and is amongst the first films that brought neorealism into the world of motion picture filmmaking.Set in poverty-stricken Rome in post-World War II Italy, the story of Bicycle Thieves concerns a poor father who's scavenging for any kind of work to support his family. Having secured a job after selling his precious possessions to buy a bicycle which is required to carry out the work, the future looks promising but his whole world is turned upside down when someone steals his bicycle.Co-written &amp; directed by Vittorio De Sica, Bicycle Thieves provides an unblinking glimpse into the daily life of civilians in post-war Italy but where it makes its strongest impact is in the devastating portrait of human spirit crushed by desperation. The screenplay keep the conversations as natural as possible and shows that when it comes to poverty, everyone is a victim &amp; how desperation has the ability to corrupt even the most ethical minds.Shot in black n white, the camera splendidly captures every moment from start to finish and both the real locations as well as natural lighting only add more realism to the story. Editing also makes sure there are no dull moments once the main plot surfaces &amp; its 93 minutes of runtime is briskly paced. And the untrained actors bring a high-level of authenticity to their given roles plus express their emotions in a very convincing manner.On an overall scale, despite being nearly 70 years old, Bicycle Thieves remains as relevant today as it was back in its time. Even from a visual perspective, this film has only aged like wine plus the themes it deals with and the unforgettable statement it makes during its final moments are only timeless &amp; universal. Absolutely living up to its legacy &amp; unaffected by the test of time, Bicycle Thieves is an essential cinema that deserves every bit of its recognition for it is truly one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking history. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can amateurs, who haven't ever done a movie before, put in such stellar performances?! This was my first reaction on learning that Vittorio De Sica had used first time actors in this brilliant Italian neorealism movie.Bicycle Thieves is set in post war Rome where the protagonist Antonio Ricci is looking for a job in order to earn a living for his family. When he finally bags one, he ends up losing his bicycle which was an essential requirement for that job. As he pursues the bicycle thieves along with his son amid hopelessness, we are made aware of the prominent themes persisting in those times.This movie is one of the pride gems of the Neorealism movement. A story set among the working class, filmed on location and using non professional actors, that deals with the difficult economic and moral conditions of post war Italy, representing changes in the psyche and conditions of everyday life, including poverty, oppression, injustice and desperation. Well put Wikipedia.Lamberto Maggiorani puts in a flawless performance as Antonio Ricci. Enzo Staiola as Bruno Ricci and Lianella Carell as Maria Ricci complement him ever so well. The subtle emotions are the ones best captured in this movie: How Antonio feels disappointed at not living up to Maria's expectation, how young Bruno smiles at the mention of Pizza, Maria's eagerness to know more about the compensation of the job, and there were loads more.Themes of the church, seeking refuge in sages, solace and entertainment in football, syndicates of thieves are prevalent in the movie. Both Antonio and Bruno carry with them the emotions of the viewer as well. One is so engaged in the movie that you feel the pure joy when they're able to purchase the bike, commiserate with them when the bike gets stolen, feel pity for them as they wander around hopefully, feel unjust and hard done by as their pleas are rejected by the police and sheer helplessness and despair at the conclusion of the movie.There are certain scenes that are absolutely exquisite. The scene when Antonio feels that Bruno jumped off the bridge and his subsequent attempts to placate him, ending with him asking Bruno to sum up how much his job would pay just to keep him involved in his pursuit and not feel lonely, is also wonderfully done. How Bruno looks over from time to time at the adjacent table only to be admonished by his father. The sequence in the church when a desperate Antonio couldn't care less for the proceedings and chases the old man all over the church, was great. The moral dilemma that Antonio finds himself in at the end of the movie is one of the best scenes I've seen. Again, the acting in that scene was impeccable."There's a cure for everything except death". What a thing to say to your kid! But then it sums up quite beautifully the bleak optimism of those times. Hats off to this masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bicycle Thieves (AKA , The Bicycle Thief) - Critics got this one right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film with some trepidation. It showed up as an instant play movie on Netflix. I was already very familiar with the movie being on several critics' list for "must see" movies but this part made me even more skeptical. Why? Because many of the reviews focused too much on the wonderful cinematography, how the film represents the Italian neo-realist film movement, the greater social issues of poverty and austerity measures of the time, and the psycho-social father/son dynamic. Well, all that's nice but is the movie good? The answer is a resounding yes! This 1948 film is way before my time but I connected with it as strongly as any film from today.The plot is very simple, a father named Antonio is in desperate need of work during post World War II era in Rome. He finally gets a job opportunity posting advertisements but it requires his bicycle which he has already pawned. His determined and supportive wife gathers all the bed linens to help raise money and retrieve the bicycle from the pawn shop. The father's son, Bruno polishes up the bike, noticing a small dent and admonishing his dad for not pointing this out to the pawn shop manager. The son is instantly adorable! The father is elated with his new job which comes with a regular salary and housing stipend. However, on the very first day of work, the bicycle is stolen. The rest of the movie involves the father's search, accompanied by his son, for the bicycle. This movie is infuriating as you experience the apathy of the police and community to the father's situation. As the day prevails, Antonio becomes more desperate and all that he stands for as a man and father begins to disintegrate. The best movies are the ones that stir intense emotion whether it's joy, sadness, fright, etc. This movie is maddening. You understand the final actions of the father but you also are deeply pained for how it forever changes his son. Thanks to all of you that encouraged us to watch this film. Now, I'm paying it forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene early on in Bicycle Thieves, where Ricci's wife go to see a lady who tells fortunes. When Ricci find's out what his wife is doing he goes up to see her, leaving his bicycle in the doorway and asking a young boy to watch it. My immediate reaction upon seeing this was that the bicycle would be stolen here, I thought to myself, "how predictable". But then, as Ricci and his wife walk back down the stairway and the doorway comes back into the frame, I see that the bicycle is still there. Then it dawned on me: The only reason I thought the bike might get stolen in the first place was because of the film's title, De Sicca had used the title of his film to make the scene suspenseful! It was at that moment that the film had me hooked.The brilliance of Bicycle Thieves lies in its simple yet effective story. Following the precepts of Italian neorealist movement, began by Roberto Rossellini, De Sicca filmed it on location and used only untrained actors. The realistic tone of the film helps to ground it and make it more relatable. This is not a story about superhuman heroics,it doesn't feature any crime lords, fairy tale lands, or over the top violence. It's simply a story about a man who needs a bicycle to support his family and loses it. Yet it's so compelling. That's the power of cinema, and that's why I love Bicycle Thieves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this is the movie for which the word, neo realism, was invented, I'm happy to say it is no more realistic than "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". I don't go to the pictures to see a reflection of all the horrors and blights in the world. I go to the movies to be entertained. Very crass of me, I know. But at least I don't put on an act about it. If you want to see all the people who praise this movie's realism really turn out in force and put their feet where their mouths lie, go to a screening of "On the Bowery" or "Salt of the Earth" or a movie like that and you're sure to find yourself the lone ticket-holder in a sea of empty seats.So don't be put off by all the critical bleating about what a great "slice of life" this picture is. I'm happy to say it's nothing of the sort. In fact, it's one of the most entertaining movies of the 1940s, so superbly photographed, so visually stunning, so melodiously scored, so cleverly and ingeniously scripted, so lavishly produced and brilliantly directed, it's a joy and a pleasure to view again and again.Thank God, the script of "Bicycle Thieves" is so beautifully contrived, bringing in marvelously bizarre vignettes and fascinatingly picaresque cameos. Its many-sided city backgrounds, for all their authenticity and picaresque atmosphere of squalor and oily-rag living, are ? thank heaven! ? heavily romanticized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bicycle Thieves (1948) **** (out of 4)Neo-realist at its very best in DeSica's tale of a father (Lamberto Maggiorani) who finally lands a job in post WWII Italy but quickly this joy turns to horror when his bicycle is stolen. Without the bike there's no job and without the job his future isn't good as his family is out of money so with the help of his son he searches for the stolen item. There's really nothing new that I could say about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said the past six decades but revisiting this film again after many years just made me appreciate this thing a lot more. I think the entire film is pretty much near flawless but I really loved how raw and powerful it is even during the smallest of scenes. One of the greatest things that happens early on is DeSica simply setting up the atmosphere of the situation. Without words we can see that everyone is broke, hungry and just praying for their break, which in their case is a job. The early scenes really sets everything up in how desperate the times are but DeSica then changes gears and shows how hopefully and happy landing a job can be. Of course, this joy doesn't last too long when the bike is stolen and then we're taken on another rather depressing journey as the father just wants to find his item so he can provide for his family. The messages in the film are so loud and clear that the "realism" just jumps right off the screen and you'll be wishing that you could help the man search for his bike. It's rather amazing that this film turned out so well and especially when you consider the budget, the time they had to shoot it and the fact that they used non-professional actors. Maggiorani turns in an incredibly memorable performance, which requires the actor to use just about every emotion possible and you have to say this ranks as one of the strongest performances from a non-actor. Enzo Staiola and Lianella Carell are perfect as well as his son and wife. BICYCLE THIEVES works on a number of levels but without giving anything away, the ending has to be one of the greatest ever done for a film. The movie contains more power and emotion than any of the fake "dramas" that get released each year and it remains one of all-time greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realism at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the time, my favorite type of writing for a movie, TV show, etc. is "poetic realism". There isn't any poetry in the dialogue for this movie, it's just straight "realism". And everything about it is realistic. I dare any one human being who would watch this movie and not think that they would do the exact same thing, or know someone who would. The characters are probably the most human ever devoted to the screen. At times, it almost seems that one can tell what they're thinking, which is incredibly impressive. But how is it done? No flashy dialogue-we'vie already covered that. The camera shows beautiful images, but there are no tricks. The great acting in this movie wasn't achieved by years and years of classical training. One could say that it was through "method acting", but the people in this movie didn't have to make themselves into the character, for they already were. Lamberto Maggiorani was a steel worker, Enzo Staiola was just a boy Vittorio De Sica happened to run into on the street. And yet, the performances that they put through are some of the best I'vie ever seen. It makes me angry when I see someone looking for hidden messages that lie within the movie. There are none. Everything means exactly what you think it means. There's no reason for interpretation, there are no metaphors, it's just a story. A simple story. Bicycle Thieves is my favorite movie of all time. I like it more than "The Rules of the Game", "Lawrence of Arabia", "Chinatown", even "The Godfather" (not that I dislike the movies I'vie just named, in fact I'd probably list all four of them in my top 20). It is, surely, a movie that everyone should see. The next 93 minutes you'vie got, I'd suggest you watch this.</fullReview>

A desperate man looking for his bicycle which means nothing for the world but a lot for this men because it will change his life and he is not able to find it. The movie reflects the world because this is what always happen the people will always support the thief ( you know whom i pointing to) and the catch the one who is innocent. The most painful scene was when the men was getting bit in front of his son. But it has many such scene other then this which will make you think and can also make you cry.

Remarkable film like this do not need anything but the full dedication of the people involved in the production. I had heard a lot about this film and was fearing whether I would like such a famous film. In one word if I would describe the film, I would say ? "Desperation". There is a dialog which has stolen my heart. The characters are so beautifully presented that I cannot escape falling in love with the little boy. Every character seems to be proper and justifying their presence coherently. How decisions of a person changes per minute is very difficult to show but has been presented so nicely that this film has rightfully earned the status of the best film of all times."A must watch for everyone."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main body of this film follows a man, Ricci, as he is searching for his stolen bicycle in the city of Rome. He does not live in the city. He lives outside of the city where he and his family live in poverty. At the beginning of the film, he is offered a job, but the only way for him to do the job. He is able to obtain the bicycle by pawning off some of his families belongings. Ricci starts his work hanging posters around the city the next day. The bicycle is a sign of hope for this family. Ricci and his family have lived in a cycle of poverty their entire lives. Ricci even says early in the film that he has been cursed since the day he was born. The bicycle appears to be a sign that the curse has been lifted. Well, that actually isn't the case because the very first day on the job the bicycle gets stolen. As he is searching for his bike, he turns to the government (the police) to help him, and it does no good. He also turns to religion (a seer) to help him, and that also does no good. Ricci hits rock bottom and think that his only option is to steal someone else's bicycle. He is that desperate. What choice does he have? His only choice is to take matters into his own hands and the only option that seems possible at the time is to steal someone else's bike. Everything in this movie was very well done. The acting was great. I really liked the little boy who played Ricci's son. The music was very subtle but set the tone for the movie and helped the movie to flow very nicely. It seems to me that the theme of this movie was "things are bad, but they could be a whole lot worse". It also was good at expressing the difficulty of living in poverty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there ever was that ONE movie that you had to watch, it undoubtedly has to be this.'Bicycle Thieves' or 'The Bicycle Thief' has a rather simple plot outline, with the protagonist's bicycle stolen on the first day of work. He absolutely needs this bicycle to continue working on his new job, and this leads him to start looking for it all over on the streets of Rome. There is hope all over the film. Hope of finding the bicycle each time he attempts in pursuing one lead or the other.The main essence of this film is relationships. Firstly, it's between the father and mother. The mother is shown to be a delicate young woman, who loves her husband, and is excited when her husband finds a new job. There are scenes in this film which have been shot so well, that you can actually feel this strong bond between the two. Secondly, and shown with more significance, is the relationship between the father and his young 7-8 year old son. There are powerful, heart-wrenching and beautiful scenes all over the movie that are shared by them both. There is not a chance that you would miss them. This film has several themes: Hope, a parent's love and concern, an indifferent world, poverty ...The director, De Sica, was a genius to have hired a totally unprofessional cast to act in this film. The actors played their roles to perfection, even the expressions made by the young son were exactly what was needed to make this film just PERFECT.And which is why I say - Everyone needs to watch this piece of art!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bicycle Thief (how I want to say it) is a pretty great example of neo-realism. The film is engaging throughout, it has two main characters who are with us throughout. Although this is a study of people living in post-war Italy, it's also important to pay attention at he dynamics of the relationship between father and son. One can say the father is taking up the role that was given to him. That ending though is fantastic, and the film does a great job of lingering in shots to show us emotion painted across the characters' faces. This won an honorary award for foreign-language film, even before that Oscar category existed! Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark Italian Neorealist Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bicycle Thieves,known as Ladri di biciclette in Italian,and also known as The Bicycle Thief, is a Italian neorealist film directed by Vittorio De Sica. It tells the story of a poor man searching the streets of Rome for his stolen bicycle, which he needs to be able to work. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Luigi Bartolini and was adapted for the screen by Cesare Zavattini. It stars Lamberto Maggiorani as the poor man searching for his lost bicycle and Enzo Staiola as his son.This landmark Italian neorealist drama became one of the best-known and most widely acclaimed European movies, including a special Academy Award as "most outstanding foreign film" seven years before that Oscar category existed.The movie featured all the hallmarks of the neorealist style: a simple story about the lives of ordinary people, outdoor shooting and lighting, non-actors mixed together with actors, and a focus on social problems in the aftermath of World War II. Lamberto Maggiorani plays Antonio, an unemployed man who finds a coveted job that requires a bicycle. When it is stolen on his first day of work, Antonio and his young son Bruno begin a frantic search, learning valuable lessons along the way. The movie focuses on both the relationship between the father and the son and the larger framework of poverty and unemployment in postwar Italy. The movie works as a sentimental study of a father and son, a historical document, a social statement, and a record of one of the century's most influential film movements.It manages to appeal to the better angels of our nature in a way that only deepens as we grow older along with the film.Again the Italians have sent us a brilliant and devastating film in Vittorio De Sica's rueful drama of modern city life as it is is so well- entrenched as an official masterpiece that it is a little startling to visit it again after many years and realize that it is still alive and has strength and freshness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bicycle Thieves" - the powerful impact of reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the post-war era when neo-realism was en vogue, Vittorio De Sica's "Bicycle Thieves" (1948) was considered by some to be the greatest movie of all time. True, it lost ground in the following years, but only to bounce back recently thanks to film critics who try to unearth the defining moments in 20th century cinema. This undoubtedly is one of them.Together with writer Cesare Zavattini De Sica made many fine movies, among them the no less famous "Umberto D". "Umberto D" is sort of a twin brother to "Bicycles Thieves", as it represents a variation of themes introduced in the earlier film in many aspects, but both of them are social realism at their very best. Low on budget but with a lot to say these pictures simply show realities and omit the overblown pathos film productions tend to often put before the first line of a plot is even written. The impact on viewers interested in seeing reality is thus much stronger. The neo-realistic roots not only show in the way the scenes are filmed or dialog is spoken, also the actors in "Bicycle Thieves" were throughout non-professionals. The main character, Lamberto Maggiorani, a simple workman of Breda, left his own work for two months to be in the film. Enzo Staiola, who plays his son, was a poor child, a son of refugees himself, clearly aware of the suffering lower class people went through after the war. Their performances are magnificent, and De Sica has a simple explanation for that: They are not playing roles, but themselves. Maggiorani tried to stay in the film industry, but would never surpass his portrayal of Antonio and forever remain one of the great faces of neo-realism - the face of a simple worker, be it from Rome or Breda, in life or in fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lead in the film is played by Lamberto Maggiorani who seems to be a very good actor. He is not an actor, however, and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically. Maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. His job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over Rome. He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him. Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city, a sign of joy to some, a representation of their own lowly status to others.When the bicycle is actually stolen, the "title" character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son (Enzo Staiola), a little kid with so much acting ability, you swear this must be a documentary. A grueling search throughout Rome has the essential parts of the movie, because we see up close the actual people and places the neo-realist film movement came to represent. It is a small, sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live. The father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son. Will he do the honorable thing or will he do what his mind and heart know is only possible? These are the tense moments of the film's climax.</fullReview>

I tried to explain to him that thats not always the case in reality, and such a realistic movie would lose credibility if he somehow magically found his bike in the end. But that's near impossible. And he knew it, and he tried to steal a bike and committed the crime that he himself suffered. Sure does say a lot about Humans. The thing is- its so... possible.

		<shortDescription>Quite Simply, a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Sica's Ladri di Biciclette well and truly lives up to its reputation as one of the best films ever made. Its neo-realism comes as a blast of fresh air after the increasingly sentimental films being produced in countries like France in the wake of the Second World War and its simplicity reflects the truth about the world as few pieces of art - in any form - have ever done.The acting is uniformly excellent as is the feeling of despair that hangs over the depressed economy of war-ravaged Italy. The devastation is neatly juxtaposed with the superficial glamour of the American movie stars in the posters the protagonist has to put up as part of his job. This indeed, marks the beginning of US ascendancy and the post-War world, where American culture will come to dominate.The film shows how a simple theft can have a devastating impact on an impoverished man, his career and his family. It also satirises an uncaring society, quick to condemn but slow to help. The police are not interested in the case and turn a blind eye to the black market in stolen goods being blatantly sold in the public square. Likewise, the Roman Church is depicted as being more interested in the solemnity of ritual than in seeing justice done inside its very doors.In his hopeless despair, the man becomes dragged down himself. In desperation, he resorts to seeing the fortune-teller he earlier derided as a charlatan, takes out his anger on his young son, alienating him and, finally, in the film's climax, becomes a thief himself.There are glimmers of hope though - when the body is dragged from the river, he sees that there are more important things than a job, even in this hopeless economic situation.Throughout the film, the cinematography is flawless, often focusing on facial expressions. The despair is not heavy-handed as it would be in an Anglo-Saxon film - there is a lightness of touch and even moments of comic relief in this most serious of films.Bicycles appear from everywhere to haunt the protagonist, but never the stolen one for which he is searching. Ironically, by the 1940s bicycles are, of course, already an outmoded form of transport but due to the collapse of Italian society, they are suddenly an essential machine again and indeed do represent the wheels of progress once more. They act as a class divide and literally distinguish those who will materially advance from those who will not. They are the protagonist's key to entering the workforce and riding forward out of poverty.The realism is reinforced by the fact that the quest fails - he will have to go to work on Monday without his mode of transport and his fate is left uncertain.The film's pace never slackens and the tension builds early. The audience knows from the title that the bicycle will be stolen and quickly sees how important it is to the main character. Hence, every time he leaves the bike alone, anxiety rises until we finally witness the actual robbery and chase, which is almost a moment of relief.Music throughout the film is minimal and is most effectively displayed in the restaurant scene. Like the expensive meal it is a luxury only the rich can afford in this society that has suddenly been stripped of culture and barely knows where to begin to rebuild.Ultimately, this is an essential film that cannot be praised highly enough. De Sica displays an extraordinary mastery and has well and truly found his voice with the neo-realist style, which reflects the harsh reality of life in defeated and depressed Italy.The film's moral lesson of how a simple theft can have a devastating effect on a whole family is timeless and the lack of resolution at the end shows just how the problems will be ongoing for the family in question. The film shows various aspects of post-War society and the lack of cohesion as State and Church both fail to help one in need, leading to desperate measures on his behalf, measures he himself finds degrading and repugnant. His innocent son reflects his conscience in these scenes and stands as a witness to this failed society. To end on the same note as this review began, this film is quite simply a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What really matters in THE BICYCLE THIEF is not so much the simple story of a man losing his means of livelihood in postwar Rome WWII, but the effect it has on the father and his spunky son, so tenderly played by Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola.Since the viewpoint is mostly from the boy's perception of his father's predicament, the impact of the story depends on the casting of the youngster who plays Bruno. Enzio manages to give himself completely to the role despite the fact that neither he nor the man playing his father were professional actors. Director Vittorio DeSica gets masterful performances from both of them, especially in rich moments when the relationship falters and then picks up again as the day goes on and their bond increases.The scenes of crowded streets of Rome and the poverty that existed for so many of its citizens are masterfully depicted by the camera, so much so that the film is almost a documentary of life and a time capsule of the period.Despite the abruptness of the downbeat ending, it's the sort of film that leaves you thinking about the characters long after the film is over. In other words, a true masterpiece of neo-realism...and one of the most natural performances from a child that I've ever seen on the screen.</fullReview>

The film was shot at real locations and the actors are non-professional but all the actors put there souls into the characters which made the film more real,the relationship between the father and the son was superbly compose by the director.In the climax scan there was't much dialog of Antonio(lead character) but his expression says a lot.the director made us aware with the thought of his characters with different camera shots,which was superb,the unfinished ending made the film more influential,it also remember us the most important fact, "A Man Can Do Anything To Survive".Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a Bike is not a Bike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what's so special about Ricci's stolen bike since there appears to be a million more just like it. Well, for one thing, it's his little claim on Italy's shattered post-war economy. Without it, he and his little family don't eat. Besides, with the bike and the poster-hanging job that goes with it, he's got dignity and can brag to his young son Bruno. So, for the next 90 minutes of screen time, he's one determined guy to get it back.It's not like he doesn't have help. His friends fan out, looking here and there, the market- place, the streets. Probably, the bike's in parts now, anyway, like an auto chop-shop. But Ricci doesn't care. By golly, he's going to find whatever is left. After all, the bike is now more than a mere bike. The trouble is there are so darn many of them everywhere you look. It's like trying to find the proverbial drop in the ocean. Worse still are the crowds, everywhere you look, going who knows where. Just as bad, what do they care about his problem since they probably have their own. We know that from the big mob of guys scrambling for work at the beginning. Talk about frustration! All I can say is that President Truman better get the Marshall Plan working or desperate guys like Ricci are going to vote in the Communists, a real possibility in 1948.Now, some folks may find the movie kind of boring since there's no hint of Hollywood glamour or action anywhere, except on a movie poster. Besides, what's all that suspense over something like a cheap bike. But seeing all the real people's faces is unusual and interesting, along with the city streets even though the buildings there are crumbling and ugly. All in all, it looks like this is what you could call a slice-of-life movie, the kind that tells you a lot about other times and places. But more importantly, it says something about things in general?namely, that sometimes a bike is not just a bike, that there's probably a bit of a bicycle thief in all of us, and that sometimes you have to keep pressing ahead even when the world's seemingly against you . Anyway, the movie's something to think about and maybe even enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard weekend in town.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can be interpreted and viewed in many different ways. Most people praise the movie for its father-son relationship in it but to me the movie was an adventure through town, in which the main character encounters the many different social layers of post-war Italy. after his bicycle got stolen and he spends the entire weekend looking back for it, since he needs th bicycle or else he'll loose his new job. It basically is a great and honest portrayal of life in post-war Italy for a common man, who tries hard to find and eventually keep his job, to support himself and his family. It's not a movie that tries to bloom things or follows the usual standard common rules of cinema. It's an early neorealistic movie, in which director Vittorio De Sica used only amateurs to give a realistic and honest portrayal of life.It's a great social and character study. Through his travels through town he visits all kinds of places and meets people from the different society layers. A great study of post-war Italy. The main character himself also isn't without his flaws, which can also be seen back in the father-son relationship within the movie. It's a real honest and straight-forward movie that also shows how far some people are willing to go to get what they want. A great character study.But yes I do agree that the movie is perhaps a tad bit too overrated. Sure it's great and appreciate all the movie tried to achieve but it also isn't an easy movie to watch, due to the low pace and just not being interesting enough at times. It still rate this movie high but I don't think I agree that this movie is deserving his spot in all of the top movie-list and also don't really consider this to be an absolute must-see or classic.Having said that "Ladri di biciclette" is just a great movie. To be honest I was surprised that it got made with amateurs and some sequences were also obviously improvised on the spot. The movie really doesn't look and feel as if it mostly involved amateurs and this also really goes for the acting within the movie.Even though it perhaps is not the must-see, or influential movie, everyone wants to make you believe it is, it still is one great unique movie which most certainly is worth watching.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperate times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a happy film. A post-War film about survival in a country that's been partially turned into rubble by the conflict, the story is about a man whose entire family's living is dependent on his government granted job as a poster placer. For this job, he needs to have possession of a bicycle. Then the titular character comes in and steals the bicycle and the man and his boy go on a desperate hunt through the city to find it.In part, this is a study on the effects of desperation, in desperate times, on a person. We watched as a proud man becomes increasingly desperate to find what is the only salvation for his family in his mind. As a result, we watch him fall from his pride and optimism towards hopelessness, watching as his pride breaks and he becomes increasingly willing to take previously ignored measures to recover his bicycle. During this journey, we watch how this also affects his human relationships with others, as it takes a toll on his relationship with his son, as well as how he interacts with those related to the theft.By the point The Bicycle Thief was released, it had already been a couple years after the War, but it's easy to imagine that the Neo-Realist tradition of Italian film-making was still quite alive and the influence is no doubt seen in The Bicycle Thief. Everything appears to have been shot on location, the camera work is a combination of hand-held and placed shots and the direction is straightforward and observant, not taking fancy liberties. And that's entirely appropriate to such a gritty story.It's not a perfect film; at times it runs close to melodrama and some of the irony is obvious, but the story was still crafted in a way, that I was muttering under my breath to the main character, "don't do it!" and "over there!" For that, the talented cast, and the willingness to grapple the tough moral quandaries of what is and isn't permissible in times of desperation, I imagine that The Bicycle Thief will remain a classic piece of film history. Great work. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler The Bicycle Thief is a classic example of Italian Neorealism. As of many neorealistic films that display some sort of personal struggle, this one displays a powerful message of society and Europe's post-war struggle. The film portrayals a young man, Ricci, and his son, Bruno, as they search for a stolen bicycle during a time of depression in Italy. From the beginning to the end, the film centers on the dreary aspect of a desperate man's struggle to survive. The film displays the message of society's struggles and of Ricci's hard life throughout the entire film. It expresses this by being in black and white. This view gives a distant aspect to every scene and relays the message that what is scene is all there is that there is no deeper meaning to anything, the meaning that all there is this struggle to work. From its scenes of angry workers debating over solutions to the economy to the police and church turning down Ricci's pleads for help displays the neorealistic message of society and its struggle at this time. The mise en scene of the film expresses the message of Europe's post-war struggles as well. From its long shots to its panning of the streets and building to the character's clothing and movements gives one the impression of Italy. Through this mise in scene realistic view, the feeling of Italy as it was at the time, and with that impression the people's struggles are found to be believable.Lastly, the final scene of Ricci becoming so desperate that he decides to steal a bicycle is the best example of the films message of society. Ricci's attempt to steal the bicycle in front of his son Bruno finally displayed the measures that Ricci would take. This is foreseen by his increased desperation throughout the course of the film. In the scene the panning shots of him pacing and close-up shots of his face give away the fact that he is about to steal the bicycle and destroy his son's exaggerated heroic view of his father. This event finally makes Bruno realize the reality of the situation and his father's disposition and struggle in this society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOLIER**********BE WARE SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER******BE AWARE SPOILERLadri di Biciclette is a film that tells people that hope and love can only go so far in the world. In this film the main character gets a job when all other people could not get one, and gives his heart to keep it. However, in the end it does him no good. His family worked so hard to keep themselves living and going in the cruel and poor world of Rome, but a thief had to change all of that. Through the course of the film the man's desperation builds and builds feeling that he is going to lose his new job and his new life all because of a thief. The entire film is meant to make the audience feel remorse for this man and what is happening to him. I felt remorse before he even lost his bike, because I knew it was going to happen. The makers of this film want people to realize that you need to make sure things are going to go well for you, not hope and pray they will. Going to a psychic as in the film did no good for their situation. People rely on hope to much, and those people are the ones that get no where fast. Near the end of the film the man is tired of looking for his bike and wants to get some food for himself and his son. The bond between his son and him is so enormous. At times it seems that the kid is more of an adult then the father. The father always scared, or nervous and the kid always voicing his opinion; the film not just about the bicycle I believe it is also about him and his son. Showing that even in times of desperation your family can try help you out even if that help is hopeless as in this case. A big political issue is that even though he found the person who took his bike, and he knew it was him he could do nothing. Politics today and back then said you need to have proof of the act, and since the man had no proof he could not do anything. If he did, and they found this kid to be innocent of the crime the man could have been the one in jail and not the kid. Politics are a very important part of how this world works; we need them to maintain order. However, in this case it seems that politics and law made more crime and less justice than it is suppose to. Seeing this guy walk away from the group of thugs knowing that there was no more hope at all could have made anyone feel bad. The big social issue is forgiveness. The reason is that the man was so desperate he went to steal a bike himself. However, for him he got caught and was going to be sent to jail, but the man he stole it from let him go because he saw this man's son and felt he had enough problems. Forgiveness is a very important part of everyone's life, because without it you will be a very sad person. This film overall was very depressing, but a good example of how hope can not solve everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Italian Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this remarkable 1947 drama, many aspects and underlining themes become apparent. Taking place during Italy's devastating post World War 2 depression, De Sica uses the real-life environment in the streets of Rome to present his story. The strong connection of the father to son is very apparent and key during the whole presentation. During the voyage together to find the bicycle, the wandering pair walks through everyday crazy life painting a quiet innocent picture of father and son. In another particular movie, we see the connection of father in son in Life Is Beautiful. In the concentration camps, Roberto Benigni makes the horrible experience into a game for his son. The connection between father and son holds true during this experience portraying the innocence like The Bicycle Thief. This landmark film helped identify the Italian neorealist approach showing real life details, detailed imagery, and everyday life. Italian neorealist cinema was a huge movement that grew out of a political movement after World War 2, following fascist rule. Jobs were very hard to come by and the economy was very poor revealed as the film unfolded. Taking place in the heart of this movement gives the audience a great visual to understand and appreciate the tale. The use of a particular object was used very distinctly throughout the course of the film. When the bicycle became apparent on screen, the father's heart was touched shown by his actions and facial expressions. While cleaning the bicycle the morning before work, his son smiles with joy as the sun pours into the room. When walking around, he carries the bicycle like a fragile new born child. After his bicycle was stolen, his heart was broken acting depressed like he lost a dear friend. His sadness and anger took a path which led him to the conclusion of the film. Since these times in Italy were horrendous, the bicycle became a valuable object and friend to the father. Overall, this story is simple, persuasive, and very powerful. The father to son connection painted a true family bond. The use of the bicycle controlled the father's feelings and state of mind. The poetic film style shown through the Italian neorealist movement makes this epic complete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true realist flim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER!! Disappointment, hardship, and in the end desperation are the reoccurring concept in The Bicycle Thief. All of these concepts go right along with the Italian Neorealism movement. The movie starts out with a shot of a crowd of people begging for a job. There are only three jobs given out that day and one goes to the main character. The first problem arises when the job requires you to have a bicycle. The main character almost turns the job down but relies how badly he needs it. The only solution that is reached is by the wife of the main character gathering the sheets off all of the beds to sell for money to get a bicycle. When the Main character goes to sell the sheets you see the extent of the poverty not by just this family, but by all as the camera taking a long shot of the thousands of sheets on the shelfs. This leads the viewer to think other familys must have to do the same thing to get by and it is very depressing. The next day is filled with temporary happiness. The main character goes to work and is excited about the next day. The next day you are reminded of their sad situation when the boy rides on his father's bike to work at a gas station. This would be unheard of to have a boy working when he is so young. The father then starts to put up posters. It is his first day and you see him struggling to get the hang of it. As the main character is working hard his bicycle is stolen. He try's to chase him in the hopes to catch him but loses the thief. The main character then goes home and cannot face is wife to tell her. When she comes and finds him to find out she starts to cry. The next day the main character and the boy leave early to try and find the bicycle before is gets taken apart and sold. While in the bicycle market the main character sees the thief but the thief once again evades capture. The thief was seen talking to an old man luckily they do catch up with. The main character then try's to get the old man to tell where the thief lives. The old man escapes without giving any information up. Then the main character tells his boy to stay on the bridge. There then are screams that a boy is drowning and the main character and viewer thinks it is his boy. Relieved that the boy is not dead they go and eat. As they eat discussing as the main character dose often in the film how great of a job he had and how much money he would have been making. Making the viewer feel worse about the bicycle being stolen. After that they are walking and run in to the thief. The viewer is filled with happiness that the poor man might get his bicycle back and keep his job. The thief denies the charges and because the man can produce no witnesses to the crime the thief is left without charges and the bicycle is not recovered. Not only is the bicycle recovered he is almost beaten up for almost getting the thief in trouble. If it was not for the boy who ran and got a police officer just in time the main character would have been beaten and have his wallet stolen. With almost all hopes lost for the recovery of the bicycle the main character walks aimlessly around in despair. Then the main character comes a cross what he needs a bicycle sitting all alone up next to a wall. The main character is being torn apart in side as the camera gives long shots at the bicycle leaning up by the wall. Finally the main character decides he needs the bicycle to badly and tells the boy to take a cable car to another street and stay there. The boy knowing what his father is going to do dose not get on the cable car. When the main character try's to steal the bicycle he is seen and chased down by a mob of men. They catch him and start looking for a police officer to throw the man in jail. The only thing that saves the main character is once again is his boy coming to the rescue yelling for his father. The man then decides not to press charges because of the boy and lets them go. The movie then ends without you knowing if the man finds his bicycle, loses his job, or the reaction of his wife. All you do see is the son grabbing his father's hand to show his love and forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bicycle Thief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler Vittorio de Sica's `The Bicycle Thief' is an Italian neo-realism film that is about a family during the great depression. Antonio Ricci (the father) finds a chance to work at a good city job pasting up postures around the town. At this time the community would do anything to find employment of this kind. Because they are short on money his wife sells bed sheets to receive money for a bike that he needs in order to keep his new job. On his first day of his job his new bike that he just got gets stolen and he tries to do everything to track down the thief. With a chance to try and get his family out of poverty he takes his son Bruno and some friends and head out into the city to try and keep his family an opportunity to get wealthy. With many frustrating events that occur through out the day Antonio decides to steal a bike himself and later getting himself caught and thrown in jail.One important factor in this movie is how the thoughts in Antonio's mind never get brought out to us throughout the movie but are shown to us through his facial expressions and the way he presents his body and emotions. Another factor that is important in the movie is how there are no staged settings present. This movie uses real life settings and backgrounds that help give a better feeling or realism and makes the situations more effective to the eyes. Finally the ending is also important. After the prison feels sorry for Antonio and decides that he has gone through enough they let him out and the movie just ends abruptly with Antonio and his son Bruno taking a walk back through the town. The movies uses this strategy to once again give a remembrance of the time its set in and also leaves the audience with something to unravel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Luck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film implicates the fact that good luck does not last forever and bad luck is always right around the corner. This film is about a man named Antonio who finally gets a job by hanging posters. In order to do this job, he has to use a bicycle to get around town in which he has one but has to buy it out of storage. On the first day of his job, somebody steals the bicycle and Antonio is unable to catch the thief because no one helps him. The next day Antonio and his son go looking for the bike only to run into many obstacles along the way. The two are able to find the thief of the bicycle, but are unable to do anything about it because there were no witnesses and no proof. Antonio is so depressed that he decides to steal someone's bicycle but gets caught in front of his own son. The narrative techniques are much different then what you would see in many other films. Throughout the film, there are many instances that make the audience believe that Antonio is going to get his bicycle back and the family is going to live happily ever after. This doesn't actually happen though. Antonio gets one chance after another but always falls short and it makes one believe that he has to get the bike back some how. The film shows all these bicycles running around and you just think to yourself that one of them is going to be his. The film kind of keeps you in suspense of how the film is actually going to turn out. One thing that I found interesting about how this film was done was when Antonio's bicycle was stolen and later when he almost caught the thief, no one helped him. When Antonio decided to steal a bicycle though about 10 people tried to stop him and succeeded. The film is telling the audience that just because one person gets away with something, doesn't mean that everybody will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bicycle can mean more than a million bicycles...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the first few years after World War II, Italian film was coined by an almost obsessive focus on working-class life, and all the frustration which these people suffered during this time in many parts of Europe. While Vittorio De Sica's LADRI DI BICICLETTE was not the first film of this category, it has certainly come to more or less define Italian film in the post-war years, and it may in fact be one of the finest films produced in the country, for a number of reasons.The plot is seemingly simple. Even so, the story of a father losing his bicycle during a thoroughly critical point in Italy's economic history is executed with such realism and blunt sincerity, that an uncomplicated surface strenghtens the impact which the frustration of the father and his family leaves upon us. The bicycle is required for in order to keep his job, but another unfortunate seizes the opportunity of stealing it for self-serving needs. Few of the players here are "actors" per definition, and it shows, in the positive sense; the constant use of authentic poverty-struck locations, casting the very people who actually lived there, evokes the realism which De Sica and other Italian directors of his era wanted to achieve. Nothing added, nothing left out. It seems almost ironic that the story takes place in Rome; seldom if ever is any of the glorious architecture, which has come to universally define the place, present.Yet of equal significance in order to make LADRI DI BICICLETTE as mentally gripping as it remains is De Sica's ability to convey this misery through an aesthetic beauty which appears almost bewildering at times. A shot of the father walking absent-mindedly down some stairs in the city, with his hungry son following him, is intense and beautiful however depressing the occurrences in the story may be.LADRI DI BICICLETTE is both very grim and very beautiful. Possibly De Sica's finest achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It&#x2019;s the ending of the movie which really touches your heart, and makes it a masterpiece which it is today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladri di biciclette, also known as Bicycle Thief, is directed by Vittorio De Sica, and produced by Giuseppe Amato. Filmed in 1948 in Italy, Bicycle Thieves is a neo-realistic film which deals with the poor economic conditions of Italy in the Post World War II era. The film stars Lamberto Maggiorani in the lead role of Antonio Ricci, and Enzo Staiola as Bruno Ricci, the son of Antonia Ricci. In the supporting cast, Lianella Carell plays the role Maria Ricci, the wife of Antonio Ricci.Bicycle Thief, very articulately depicts the conditions of the poor people in Italy after the World War II. Poverty, crimes, unemployment, and depression were the main issues during that period. Although, hard to relate for me with it, this cinema somewhat reminds me of the 70&#x2019;s era of Bollywood in which poverty, unemployment, crimes were also the main issues. Also, the frustrations of the protagonist to overcome all these issues, and to break his morals and take the wrong way in order to fight with these issues, are similar between these two cinemas.The most debatable point in the movie is the stealing of bicycle by Antonio. Is it right to commit crime of any level when you are in trouble? Is it ethical to put someone else in trouble in order to get rid of yours? These are some questions which Bicycle Thief raises. In my opinion, it&#x2019;s not right to commit a crime like stealing etc. to get some money. No matter how difficult your conditions are, taking the path of crime is always wrong. I maybe sound philosophical but I believe in &#x201c;What Goes Around Comes Around&#x201d;. If you&#x2019;ve done something wrong today, intentionally, you&#x2019;ve to bear the consequences later or as many people call it, Karma.The ending of the movie supports my point; after stealing the bicycle he&#x2019;s caught by the public and humiliated in front of his own son. I don&#x2019;t think there is any bigger insult than that for a man i.e. getting caught stealing something in front of your son.And he clearly knows it and that&#x2019;s why he asks his son to wait somewhere else before stealing the bike. He didn&#x2019;t want him to about it. He didn&#x2019;t want to lose his respect.&#x201c;Bicycle Thief&#x201d; is a great learning experience, both in terms of film making and how to live life in general. I think the one of the strongest points of this film is its unpredictability. The director creates the situations such that you start to think that he&#x2019;ll get the bicycle back but you are always proved wrong. For example; when Antonio and his friends go to cycle market to find his bicycle, they meet a guy who is painting a bicycle and they think that he is a thief and it is his bicycle. And when that guy refuses to show it to them, they call the police. And just when you think they have found it, it turns out that guy is telling the truth.Also, the situation where Antonio runs after the thief gives you an idea that he&#x2019;ll find the bicycle but you&#x2019;re mistaken again. These small things create the suspense which was required in this cinema. The most surprising element of the movie is the acting and that&#x2019;s because Lamberto Maggiorani was not a trained actor at that time and he used to work in a factory. And, Enzo Staiola was only seven when he was cast for this role. To see such powerful performances from both the leads coming from non-movie backgrounds is mind blowing.On the whole, I absolutely loved this movie. It&#x2019;s a great piece of cinema and I&#x2019;m not surprised that it&#x2019;s being considered as the best neo-realistic film ever.Screen play of the movie is top notch and direction is superb. Despite being a very old film, I enjoyed it a lot. It has the perfect blend of commercial and meaningful cinema. It&#x2019;s the ending of the movie which really touches your heart, and makes it a masterpiece which it is today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all these great review there is little for me to add. I saw this movie in 1988, and it struck me very deeply. To this day, 20 years later, I remember most details vividly. I saw it in some cinema club at my university. Nobody was expecting really much. At the end of the movie, there were the tears and a long standing ovation. It was absolutely incredible. This movie is the best ever I have seen. The acting is unbelievable. Just watch the son's look during the climax of the film (close to the end of the movie). A seasoned actor would not act so superbly. I strongly recommend everybody to see it. It is a timeless classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four currents of thought in The Bicycle Thief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Examining the film through the lens of what was happening socially and politically in Italy during the years of Neo-Realism gives one many insights into what the film was trying to convey to audiences of the time, as well as today. There are many timeless issues and emotions, people being people at all times and places, that occur in this film. Therefor it's important to keep in mind four currents of thought, that have previously been identified, in post-war Italian intellectual life: Marxism, existentialism, sociology and psychoanalysis. The Marxism, as seen as a socialist societal commentary, is evident in the very nature of the story: class differences, poverty and unemployment. Existentialism is seemingly rife in the film, every scene commands the viewer to witness the deep meaning in everything that the characters undergo. Sociologically, this film is an interesting look into the social structures of the times and place in which it was made. Finally, the psychoanalysis rampant throughout. The turmoil, inducing neuroses, almost psychoses, in the lead character as he hunts frantically for the restoration of his dignity, his bicycle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Neo-realistic film is absolutely stunning. A film that demonstrates the hardships of Europeans around the time of WW11. With the story being about a man and son in search of their bike so they can survive one can't helped but get attached. On there journeys they get little help wanting them to be able to work and live a person watching this film could feel like they can't leave the edge of their seat.Not only is the story in this film amazing but the cinematography is as well. The film is visually enticing. the use of shapes and patterns makes each shot look like a painting. One of the scenes that is great to watch is when a bunch of workers on bikes are riding past the boy and his father. Each worker moves by slowly holding a latter, lined up in lines behind each- other equally spaced. As the bikes slowly pass by it creates the illusion that only the two main characters are moving. Each shot in this film looks like it was truly thought about in the making of this film. This film is like living in a painting of a depressing location. While watching the characters living in a Saddened environment with simple things like posters of Rita Hayworth to keep them happy one just wants to watch to see what happens. Without saying much I highly recommend this film to watch.</fullReview>

The excuse of telling the story of a stolen bicycle to discover (and fix) the strange relationship between father and son is portrait in a beautiful way in one of the most exquisite neo-realist films.Great writing, directing and filming, there's not a lot of things I can say, because it's not worth to read about this movie, definitely you have to watch it so you can really understand what means to watch one of the greatest films of all times.This movie is worth for lots of things, even only for watching that kid walking "between" his dad.One of the most heart-touching films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many different theories as to what makes a good film, what makes a film memorable. Every single person will you give you a different set of guidelines as to what separates the masterpieces from your typical, everyday film. In my opinion, one of the strongest necessities towards a really good movie is a fantastic ending. Good, even great movies can be ruined or not as appreciated because of a mediocre or terrible ending. Some of the best films of all-time (in my opinion) finishes on an extremely high note, finishes in a way that allows discussion, allows added praise, builds tears in your eyes, and/or continues providing laughter long after the credits start rolling.Movies like Shawshank Redemption, Finding Nemo, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Princess Bride, Rain Man, Empire Strikes Back, among others, are all movies I deem masterpieces. What separates all these from the typical film is that the movie remains consistently good, and then ends on the top of the quality scale. But, there have been great films with bad endings that reduce it to a lower level; Cast Away, Sideways, and Legend of Drunken Master are examples of good movies that could have been even better if they had figured out a decent way to end the flick. This classic suffers from this fate as well; Bicycle Thief is a grand look at post-World War II Italy that ends very abruptly. While on many people's minds its one of the best films of all-time, in my opinion it's just 10 minutes away from perfection, it was oh so close. However, one really can marvel at the cinematography, the realism, and the impact it's delivered to modern film-making.The Bicycle Thief (a.k.a Ladri di biciclette) follows a down-and-out man by the name of Antonio trying to recover his bike, which was stolen during a day at work. Taking his son Bruno, he goes on a long journey through the highs and lows of Italy as he tries to find his bike and the thief who took it. The movie runs deeper than a simple story of a man searching for a bike, this is also a look into the lives of citizens in a post World War II world, in which poverty is widespread, and times are tough. People aren't very nice towards each other, there is hostility throughout, and nobody is willing to stick out their neck for anybody. There is no hero in this tale, just a string of flawed characters trying to survive. Even when the sympathy is aimed towards the main character, it quickly gets snatched away in certain instances when we see his dark side.The quality of this film can be largely and almost wholly attributed to the director, Vittorio De Sica. Using long shots of the city, long shots of the events occurring, the viewer is thrown into the world of injustice, poverty, and hardship. Sica also uses inexperienced actors that can relate to the situation taking place in the film. This decision not only adds a dosage of realism to the piece, but would also influence the later nitty-gritty street films of later decades like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Do the Right Thing, and City of God. He doesn't toy much with the camera, which makes it less Hollywood and more documentary. The hand-held camera look that the movie delivers turns you not into an observer, but more as a witness. The dialogue is also realistic, as the words used throughout the movie remained short, simple, and sweet.There are two things that prevent this from being a golden masterpiece in my standards. First off, the film is just overly depressing from the beginning to the very end. While yes the subject matter is anything but happy, the movie piles sad moment after sad moment after sad moment at you. Sometimes, the sad moments weren't even necessary and come out of left field. If you are going to make a drama, at least throw in a few moments of temporary nirvana, to allow the viewer time to breathe out the negativity. Plus, there's no need to add more drama and tension coming from other, minor characters that serve little importance into the plot. The second and major drawback is the ending. Few people criticize the ending here, but after following depression and unfortunate incidents for 90 minutes, one would hope for an ending that doesn't come out of nowhere. The ending not only abruptly happens, but also doesn't tie up all loose ends, and just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth. Don't want to dwell into details, but the climax and conclusion is supposed to flow like the end of a hill, not like a straight nosebleed dive, which is what happens in The Bicycle Thief. When spending a whole film looking for light at the end of the dark tunnel, you don't want to end the car ride still stuck in the tunnel. Okay, enough comparisons, allusions, and metaphors.Bottom Line: The Bicycle Thief is yet another "classic" film that's forgiven for its flaws and setbacks and is considered leagues and mountains above the modern-day film. While yes this movie is good, influential, and a good cultural look at a certain time period in Italy, it's nowhere near perfect. Superb acting, directing, cinematography, editing, and dialogue is all slightly (oh so slightly)marred because the director and screenwriters couldn't come up with a better way to finish this motion picture; it felt like they filmed a bit more of this and just sent an ax towards a random scene during the editing process. A good movie needs a strong ending, and this one couldn't finish on a strong note. It is worth a viewing, but it is not one you are going to keep on the shelves for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neorealist cinema at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful neorealist film brilliantly depicting the extremely difficult economical and moral conditions of Italy immediately after WWII using a plot as simple as possible and yet so close to everyday life of a normal poor man. The movies starts with a man getting a job which requires him to have a bicycle (bike) and then shows us how he and his wife get one immediately from the repair shop and then as the title suggest his cycle gets stolen on the very first day of his job. He and his son are then out looking for a thief and bicycle without any luck and then finally we see the efforts in desperation of an unemployed man, father, and a family man trying to survive in the world. The whole time I watched the movie I felt as if I was feeling the pain, anger, desperation of our main actor as my own, the acting, direction and the overall movie was that excellent. The actors playing Antonio and his son are amazing and have excelled in their roles. The father-son combination is really good and their scenes steal the show altogether (be it in their home cleaning the bicycle, going together for work, looking for lost cycle and the final scene is simply moving). Also the photography and direction is top class. It's a wonderful experience going back in time and knowing what countries (especially the ones badly hit by war) was like after WW II and the depression, pain and agony of people living in them and What extreme measures they were forced to take to just survive.Overall I would rate this wonderful Italian movie 9/10.</fullReview>

DeSica did a fine job portraying the misery and poverty of post WWII Italy. One could argue that it is Bruno, the young boy, who is in fact the driving force behind this film. It is his balanced performance, displaying both the youthful innocence of boy and the matureness that can forced upon youth when on faced with the responsibility of taking part in the family's survival, that really make this film special. A classic, definitely worth buying from the Criterion Collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the comments left by other users of this site, and i have something to say to all those who thought this film was "average", or "boring": this is one of the greatest films in history. The reason one might find it boring is because it tells the story of the common man, his struggles and his relationship with his son. During the 1940s, Hollywood made melodramatic films with characters that few could relate to. Also in the 1940s, Italy was still feeling the effects of WWII, were many struggled to make a living. Few films in that time chronicled the lives of the average man. "The Bicycle Thief" is one of the most ground breaking films in history because of this.To all those that found the film boring, please, watch it again. Notice all the bicycles (and bicycle parts) in the film; the protagonist only needs one to keep his life and family together. Notice the touching looks the child gives his father, and how his father hardly notices him. Study the injustice surrounding him, and have empathy for him. Sure, today the film may have lost some of its power because of the countless imitations, but remember this movie was way ahead of its time.I give this movie a "10", and i don't give many of those.</fullReview>

In a plot as relatively simple and uncluttered as exists here, we nevertheless are presented with an epic film, and a masterpiece of neo-realism, continuing an artistic development beginning with OPEN CITY. It is no wonder that a maverick dirctor like Robert Altman would pay homage to this classic work in his marvelous THE PLAYER, and would point out, correctly, how contrastive this artistic masterpiece is to formulaic Hollywood dreck.

After leaving his last belongings(bed sheets!)at the local pawn shop he buys himself a bicycle. Tragedy strikes at the first day of work, when his bicycle gets stolen ! Crestfallen and desperate he looks for the bicycle all over Rome, and even unsuccessfully tries to steal one....because without his bicycle he will lose his job ! Absolutely one of the strengths of the film was Vittorio de Sicas use of non-professional actors which added absolute realism to the film.Professional actors/actresses in Italy tend to "overact"(especially in theater) something which is pointingly avoided during the whole film. Reminds of Orson Welles comment "In Italy everyone is good at acting except for the ones that work in Cinema and Theater !" abit cruel perhaps,but at times true! The expression of hero's sun-burnt face during the film is of dull void like desperation.......the real face of poverty inItaly!Arguably one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.....my vote is absolutely 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie in a class by itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie many years ago and went back to view it again. It touched me in the same way. This movie is a work that speaks to the human condition in a way that Vittorio De Sica's movies often succeed in achieving. In that sense, it is timeless and a great work. The story is about a family man whose bicycle is stolen. This deprives him of a job, something very hard for him to come by in post-war Italy. He is devastated but the man and his young son set out to find it. During the movie, I was struck by the loss of self- respect that comes from grinding poverty, the raising and dashing of hopes, the disappointments seen in the eyes of a spouse, the hurt that is felt in the heart of a child. For me, this movie conveys these emotions.Vittorio De Sica was a master of the neo-realist school of cinema in the 1940's and 50's. He uses on-location shooting and in this movie, amateur actors, to tell his story. Our heart goes out to the father in the movie. We are on his side and yet everywhere he goes, he is rejected. On his first day on a new job, his bicycle, a requirement for the work, is stolen from under his eyes. The father and son search over Rome to find it...an almost hopeless task. We want to hug the child and console the father. This movie takes into a fictional world that is all-too-real for many people. It has great emotional impact as it draws us into the lives of the characters.There are many entertaining movies; there are some that represent technical achievement or great acting; others make us laugh or cry. This movie has something to say. It is wrong to hurt people when they are down and trying to salvage their dignity. In life, it is not us vs. them but all of us together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embodies the difficulty and despair of a generation in post-war Italy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Vittorio De Sica paints a grimly compelling picture in this account of post-war Italy. The difficulties and despair faced by a father and son in searching for a stolen bicycle are a profound embodiment of the challenges faced by so many others in a time of great poverty.An incredibly expressive lead performance by Lamberto Maggiorani, a non-professional actor, lends a voice to the hope and frustration of a generation. His joyous countenance on the morning of his first day at work makes the desperate and disheartening search for the bicycle all the more moving and conveys the tragedy of small hopes being crushed by everyday adversities and misdemeanours.The search through the city of Rome brings the viewer into contact with great crowds of people, from a busy marketplace to a church service and onwards to a football game. As well as portraying masses of people the film shows the sad and often ramshackle streets in great detail; in some scenes the mere panning of the camera through these streets captures the desolation of post-war Italy.The haunting score by composer Alessandro Cicognini lends itself superbly to both the story and the imagery and completes an utterly enthralling film, fully deserving of its status as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Affecting examination of the humiliations of being jobless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a simple story that furthers our understanding of what it was like in Rome in the depression years after WWII. We come to this understanding by considering the life of Antonio Ricci and his wife and young boy. As the film opens Ricci has no job and is among about a hundred men crowding around an official who has a few jobs to assign. Ricci is thrilled to get the job of pasting posters around the city, but the catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job and he has pawned his bike in order to get by. He takes the job anyway and promises to have a bike. He retrieves the bike by pawning all the sheets in the household. Things look good for Ricci at that time until he gets his bicycle stolen the first day on the job. The remainder of the movie has Ricci and his young son trying to find the stolen bike.The power of the movie derives from seeing how Ricci's desperate situation eats at his soul. Consider the arc of his degradation. At first he is happy to have been offered a job and is affectionate with his son. The fist small blow to his self-esteem is to stand by while his wife takes the initiative to pawn the household sheets to retrieve his bike. Once the bike is stolen he and his son attend a bike flea market with the idea that they might recover the stolen bike, but after some pretense he has to admit that it's hopeless. In trying to follow a lead to the thief he disrupts a church service and is escorted out. In pursuit of the thief he rushes into a brothel causing a ruckus. From scorning the prognostications of a psychic he later turns to her for advice. He confronts the thief and, even in the presence of a policeman, he is tossed out of the thieve's neighborhood and is forced to slink away. At one point he hits his son without apologizing and then is irritated with his son's falling and scraping his knees. There is the final humiliation of his thieving a bicycle himself, only to be caught. And all of this is witnessed by his son.The final scene leaves us wondering how many insults a man can take to his pride and still press on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>first example of Pure Cinema: there is no more cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed in retrospect, much of modern cinema can seem to flow from twin fountainheads: Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) and Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Though separated by World War II, the two movies symbolize the cardinal impulses that came to captivate serious audiences, critics, and filmmakers after the war. Where Citizen Kane heralded the age of the auteur and a cinema of passionate individual vision, Bicycle Thieves renounced "egoism" for collective concern, envisioning a cinema of impassioned social conscience. The film exemplifies De Sica's stated desire to "reintroduce the dramatic into quotidian situations, the marvelous in a little news item... considered by most people throwaway material."The quotidian anecdote dramatized here concerns Antonio Ricci, a young husband who has been suffering a prolonged spell of unemployment when he is offered a job as a bill poster. The catch is that he must have a bicycle, and his is in hock. Rescued by his wife's willingness to pawn their bedsheets, Antonio set's out proudly and confidently on his new job, only to have his bicycle stolen on the first day. Desperate to stay employed, he mounts a wide-ranging search across Rome, accompanied most of the way by his young son, Bruno. (Godfrey Cheshire)[...] it is a spectacle, and what a spectacle! Bicycle Thieves, however, does not depend on the mathematical elements of drama; the action does not exist beforehand as it were an "essence". It follows from the preexistence f the narrative, it is the "integral" of reality. De Sica's supreme achievement is to have succeeded in discovering the cinematographic dialectic capable of transcending the contradiction between the action a "spectacle" and of an event. For this reason Bicycle Thieves is one of the first examples of "pure cinema": no more actors, no more story, no more sets, which is to say that in the perfect aesthetic illusion of reality there is no more cinema.

		<fullReview>I've just been reading some of the comments on the Message Board for this movie in particular the frustration of those who love it and castigate those who don't and I relish the irony that there was a healthy audience for John Guillermin's 1960 entry Never Let Go in which a cosmetics salesman (Richard Todd) is fully dependent upon his small family car to visit potential clients and transport his samples; when the car is stolen Todd is distraught; the police offer little help and Todd undertakes a one-man crusade to recover the missing car. Sound familiar? Of course it does because it is Bicycle Thieves with an English accent but Richard Todd was still a major star who had recently portrayed Douglas Bader in The Dambusters, his screen wife, Elizabeth Sellers was also popular on both stage and screen and the 'heavy' used-car dealer Lional Meadows, was played by Peter Sellers who by then was well on the way to superstardom. By contrast Lamberto Maggiorani (Antonio), Enzo Staiola (Bruno) and Lianella Carell (Maria) who comprised the Ricci family were not only complete unknowns but they weren't even actors. On the other hand this was the chief strength of the film which unfolded in a Rome light years away from the one in Three Coins In The Fountain or Roman Holiday, a Rome, in fact, that could just as well have been downtown Tallin or Riga. Keep it simple is a fine philosophy and it would be difficult to keep it simpler than this: Stage One: Despair - no work, no prospects; Stage Two: Hope - a job offer, all it takes is a bike; Stage Three: Determination: Hock the family bedsheets and unhock bike; Stage Four: Elation - new job means new prospects, better life, etc. Stage Five: Despair: - the bike is stolen and we're back to square one.Sometimes simple equals Simply Great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes the most beautiful stories ever told are also the simplest. Unburdened by sudden plot twists or multiple character arcs, these stories are able to take the time to truly focus on their characters, allowing us to absorb every minute detail, each moment presented to us with stark realism. Vittorio De Sica's 'The Bicycle Thief' (or, if you take the literal translation from the Italian title, 'Bicycle Thieves') is such a story. The plot itself is surprisingly simple: a poor family man, Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) manages to acquire a well-paying job, in an era when well-paying jobs are almost impossible to find. To keep the job, however, he needs to have his bicycle, and when it is stolen from him when his back in momentarily turned, Antonio fears that his job ? and his family ? is doomed to suffer. Accompanied by his bright-eyed, intelligent young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), Antonio travels across Rome in search of his bicycle.'The Bicycle Thief' is often cited as one of the most accomplished examples of neorealism, and rightly so. Though I was initially unfamiliar with the term, neorealism is a cultural movement that brings elements of true life in the stories it describes, and the movement was primarily developed in Europe after World War Two. In this film, we are not treated to an happy endings, of always-loving characters with broad smiles departing into the glorious sunset. Antonio and Bruno, having not recovered the bike, disappear soundlessly into a crowd of disheartened poor men, their meagre problems amounting to nothing amidst the widespread poverty in post-war Rome. We may not necessarily enjoy this bleak, somewhat pessimistic conclusion, but the film is all the more poignant and emotionally moving for it.Cary Grant and Henry Fonda were originally considered for the main role in the film, before director Vittorio De Sica opted to use nonprofessional actors. The two main stars, Maggiorani and Staiola, were, in fact, chosen for their respective roles based solely on the styles of their walks. Lamberto Maggiorani does a remarkable job in his film debut as the hopeless and anguished poor man battling to provide for his family, whilst Enzo Staiola's wide-eyed curiosity ? always looking upwards towards his father for guidance ? is perfect for the role of the young son. Together, Antonio and Bruno display a fascinating father-son intimacy. And, even over just a few days, we are able to witness the ever-so-subtle highs and lows of their relationship. Also notable is Lianella Carell, likewise in her film debut, as Antonio's ever-worrying wife, Maria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER: When the father and son disappear into the crowd at the end, sans resolution, I find it hard not to conclude that every single person in that shot - a very crowded sidewalk in Rome - had a serious problem they were also trying to deal with. A depressing thought, but this is post war Italy. What makes it so much better than that is that the father had just been let go by the mob that caught him, which makes the viewer think, wow, isn't he lucky, even though we know he's going to lose his new job because he doesn't have a bike. But he does have a wonderful son who loves him, and a wife at home who loves him, and there's a kind of sense that that makes it OK that he's got to go back to the nothingness he started the movie with. The whole relativeness of the situation is astounding.Perhaps even more fun is comparing the two mobs he deals with in the movie, the one run by a neighborhood mob boss protecting the thief (remember the tires in the apartment, and the mamma's comment "we used to have a car" - yeah, right) that is going to kick his butt for accusing one of their own of thievery, and the other mob, about to kick his butt for being a thief. Great contrast within the father's character, from good guy to bad...Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that shows the post-war life in Italy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 21st century viewer might wonder what Ladri Di Biciclette, a movie made in 1948, might have to offer in the year 2005. The answer is simple: Ladri Di Biciclette is about post-war life in Italy and post-war misery does not change. One who is interested in the cinema and the motion picture as an art will find a lot in this movie; brevity, attention to detail and honest expression. The movie is so brief in story telling that it reminds us of the bitterly strong albeit brief short stories of Anton Chekhov and those of Edgar Allan Poe. This brevity is owed mostly to the attention to detail the production had; every scene's detail is arranged in such a way that the viewer would see what he or she would need to see to understand life there and then. The movie tells us about the misery of life as it was for the people of the post-war Italy in such an honest language that it is hard for the viewer to find a glimpse of exaggeration or overt dramatization. Those features probably will be subject to scholarly work in the movie industry for many years to come; however, and more importantly, the movie's study of post-war misery remains noteworthy after more than half a century. We are witnessing many wars in our times, and this movie allows us to close our eyes and imagine what might happen in those countries affected by wars in the years to come. For those who may be interested in how it would be like after a war, Ladri Di Biciclette is a window to the future. Saeed Payvar.</fullReview>

The story may sound dull when you first hear about it, but the direction and the cast turn it into a good film.

		<fullReview>Ladri di Bicyclette aka. The Bicycle Thief is widely regarded as one of the best movies ever. I dare to say it's the best.Though having a simple score, the movie captures timeless existential problems. And though being played by amateurs, and set in a depressing post-war Italian environment, its fabulous director Vittorio de Sica creates a movie that is the finest piece of art - not only amongst the movies of the italian neo-realism to which it belongs - but amongst all movies ever made on this planet.I have seen this masterpiece at least fifty times, and it has never lost an inch of its initial qualities.If you care about life in general and film in particular, then you simply have to see this movie (along with the other works of Vittorio de Sica).</fullReview>

Why not simply go back to the plaza where he thought he had originally seen the thief?Once it became clear that he would not be able to recover his bicycle, he should have moved on. According to his own calculations, having the delivery job should have given him sufficient funds to "rent" another bicycle until he could buy another one.

		<shortDescription>Much better than I ever imagined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have never imagined that I would end up writing a review for Ladri di biciclette. I was born in 1960, and considering the year this film was made, I must tell you that the only reason I took the time to watch it was because I was trying to shorten a list of movies I'm just curious about and that made it to the top 250. Up to now, I've felt terribly disappointed by the Hollywood crap of the '40s the '50s and part of the '60s and the '70s, and I mean how unrealistic films were. For example "Gone with the wind" is nothing but UNREAL CRAP, and the same can be said about the "Bridge under the river Kwai" (and even a sort of recent remake called "To end all wars" is also quite unreal, though in a way I shall not discuss here), and the same goes for most of the movies at that time. Unreal, unreal, unreal. Still they won Oscars! Jee! There are a few exceptions which are Stanley Kubric's work and some mild exceptions as Doctor Shivago, but again... they couldn't be more unreal. So... back to "Ladri di biciclette" I was nicely surprised to find out how REAL and POSSIBLE its script was. De Sica was undoubtedly with his feet on the ground when he did this. Besides, Lamberto Maggiorani's performance is simply ASTOUNDING. The film, of course, can't be compared to anything of the recent best, however, it comes quite close, and the second half of the film catches your attention quite well. The flick is decently short; it does not include any unnecessary material to make it unnecessary longer... What else can I say? I must recommend this film. It's not the best I've seen, but all in all it undoubled deserves a watch, if only for the sake of knowledge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about humanity in an inhuman world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the recent Life is Beautiful as the only popular example of recent Italian cinema, De Sica's The Bicycle Thief is a startling surprise, with its brutal realism and strong undertones of desperation. While Roberto Benigni's masterwork is a family-friendly celebration of life, The Bicycle Thief is a striking departure, even from other movies that depict the life of the lower class. Shot in the Italian neorealism style, the film plays almost like a gritty documentary, with a cast of unknown actors and a minimal script. The simple story is as sincere and humble as the characters themselves, without complex plot twists or numerous characters. De Sica is also a master of cinematography and editing, as seen in his stunning shots of the Italy, and his quick editing cuts near the climax of the film, which establish anticipation on part of the spectator. But the most powerful facet of The Bicycle Thief is the plight of Ricci, who cannot work without his missing bicycle. The audience is shown a world where a man's honor and his family's wellbeing is dependent on a bicycle, yet despite the desperation and poverty, hope is established with the bond the man and his son form while searching for the bicycle. In The Bicycle Thief, where people are so destitute that they would pawn off their bed sheets in hopes of employment, the most poignant aspect of the film, as seen in the final harrowing scene, shows how humanity triumphs over any material shortcomings.</fullReview>

Through this, the audience sees the despair that has taken over.Aside from being probably Italy's first great masterpiece after WWII, "The Bicycle Thief" is a veritable experiment in neorealism; you get the sense of how Europe was feeling in the postwar era.

		<shortDescription>Marxist Symbolism Overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other commentators say that the protagonist, Antonio Ricci, is a poor man for whom we feel sympathy. This is not what the movie-makers had in mind. This is a Marxist allegory and Antonio is as much the bad guy of the movie as the hero.When the movie opens, Antonio sits apart from the other unemployed workers because he thinks of himself as in a class better than the others. (He is the only worker in the movie who wears a fedora rather than some kind of worker's cap.) He will pay for this arrogance later. Antonio was a member of the petty bourgeoisie, with sheets on his bed and a bicycle. A financial crisis forced him to pawn one of them, so he pawned the bicycle.The government employment agent gives him a job that requires a bicycle, even though Antonio admits he no longer has a working bicycle and there are other workers in the crowd who do. This symbolizes the government's favoritism of the bourgeoisie over the working poor. Antonio and his wife sell the sheets to redeem the bicycle, so he can take the job. The bicycle represents the means of production. A thief, wearing an old German hat, steals the bicycle. He represents the international proletariat. In stealing the means of production he is carrying out a miniature Marxist revolution.Throughout the film we meet people who show solidarity with the working class and proper Marxist conciousness. E.g., the old man who won't "rat" on the thief and who attends a church service only so he can get a free meal. The neighbors of the thief who are prepared to perjure themselves in his defense. The crowd that gathers in sympathy when a boy falls into a river. By contrast, Antonio is concerned only when he thinks the boy might be his son. When he discovers that it is not his son, he forgets the real endangered boy and takes his son off looking for a pizza parlor.Marx thought that the proletariat would inevitably triumph. In the context of this movie, that would mean that Antonio doesn't get the bicycle back in the end. You'll have to see the movie to find out if the movie-makers agreed with Marx about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An infantile movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, a word of warning: Once again, as it's obviously what I do best, I will play the devil's advocate and lambast another great movie. The reason I feel I can do this is that it's already praised so highly by just about everyone else one this site and elsewhere, so that more positive reviews would be pretty much redundant. Yes, I know I'll probably burn in the pits of cinema's hell for this, if there is one. Or, I'll be sentenced to spend eternity watching endless reruns of Mel Gibson movies. When it's all said and done, though, I'll try to make some amends by rating it... well, maybe not a 10 this time, but at least an 8. So please, try to forgive me.Well, to the point, and it's actually a brief one. There will be no attempts of armchair philosophy this time. The reason why I could not stomach this movie is a simple one: it's a movie for kids. Make sure you take your children along to see it, or if you don't have any, bring along some of the juvenile punks in your neighborhood. They will probably enjoy it more than you, even if it's for all the wrong reasons. By this I mean something more than the obvious fact the the plot and the ideas of the movie are simple and dumbed down enough for a four-year old to understand. From beginning to end, "Ladri di biciclette" is marked by a profound infantilism, and a bad sort. It's not the wonderful and honest infantilism of, say, Fellini, where you'll find a real and often very painful account of the reality of being a child, as well as showing the child that still is inside us when we're long since grown up (especially the experience of being an Italian male child with all the traumas of dealing with authority, with the church, with the mothers and fathers of that place and time). That kind of child is shown as a true human being, not least (and we can of course thank psychoanalysis for this, in Fellinis case mostly the theories of Carl Jung) with a true will to power and an extremely powerful sexuality. It's a childhood that is no longer innocent.The childhood of "Ladri de biciclette" is more of the Disney variety. For all its highly praised "social realism", the movie doesn't have much psychological realism, and the social critique actually suffers profoundly as a result. This is because its social "theories", if that's not too strong a word, are based on an idea of "a fall from paradise", the paradise of childhood or childishness. As I said, Fellini's children, like the children of Freud or Jung, are no longer thought of as innocent. The very notion of innocence itself is revealed as a myth. De Sica, however, seems to think of childhood as something profoundly innocent and pure, "uncontaminated" by those "evil" social forces that corrupt people and turn them into egoists, make them violent - and make them bicycle thieves. This state of childhood extends into adulthood as well, until it's "ruined" by society. When I say it's a movie for kids, I should add that it's mostly a movie for little boys - "good" little boys. The protagonist Antonio is nothing more than a big kid, just as childlike as his son Bruno. The other male "good guys" are either kind and friendly uncles, or also, again, children themselves. The one, at least partly, adult character in the movie is, of course, the mother, Maria. Good grief, of course she could not have been known by any other name. She is a virgin mother if ever there was one, asexual or perhaps pre-sexual, profoundly kind and caring, the kind of mother any good little boy could want - or the kind of mother-substitute any good infantile Italian husband could want for a wife. Even so, even she does not escape being treated as a little girl for a good part of the story.Sexuality is more or less completely censored from the film. Even in the scene in the bordello, where the focalization changes to the kid Bruno - and he can, of course, not come in. The camera, and we along with it, is left waiting on the outside.I had not seen much, if any, mention of this profoundly infantile stance in articles and reviews of the movie, and it honestly caught me by surprise. Still, it's the impression that stays with me. This is a tale of the corrupting forces of society, that ruins our original purity, and if not for those forces, we would still all be little boys and girls, playing our games, lacking nothing and never having to grow up. Well... it simple beyond belief, and just doesn't ring all that realistic to me.The fact that the whole thing was rehashed in the dreadful "La Vita ? bella" by Benigni (bicycle and all), is another sad chapter, but I won't get into that, as that, at least, it's obviously not De Sica's fault directly.</fullReview>

I do understand the historical context of the film but where is the depth of character? What do we finally understand about ourselves and the world? Is the message of the film that men will sacrifice their values for survival? Not such a deep revelation in my eyes. Are we to understand that love continues despite the weakness of character? Again, no great shakes there! Yes, life is tough and in the real world things do not turn out OK and people get screwed with no recourse especially in the aftermath of war. Anyone surprised?I left this film saddened by the plight of the man and his son, but I didn't feel that this was enough to justify all of the accolades that this film has received.

		<fullReview>'The Bicycle Thief' is up there with 'Citizen Kane' as an unquestionable cinema classic. Perhaps it's the formidable reputation that led to my being so unsatisfied. While I can appreciate its importance in the history of cinema - its revolutionary use of the free roaming camera, the naturalistic performances and cinematography, the simple storyline - the whole thing left me feeling rather cold. For a movie that can only work on an emotional, interior level, the performances were superficial and lacked the required depth. The refreshingly simple storyline, when left to function without the support of strong performances, fizzled out early, and quickly became repetitive and inconsequential. Staiola's brilliant performance as the young Bruno was at times required to carry the whole movie. De Sici is clearly a talented Director, and is able to compose some genuinely striking images. Montuori's photography is brilliant, bringing a remarkable freshness and vitality to the streets of Rome. But on the whole, the movie suffers from poor characterization and the limited abilities of its amateur cast. A definite disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie I wanted to see since I was studying in Architecture in 1980s. I remember that there were 2-3 occasions when I knew that the movie was going to be screened but not a single time could make to go and see the movie. I had read about this movie in various magazines, books and film review. The most I remember it about was while reading the autobiography of Satyajit Ray. He mentioned the movie and how it inspired him to plunge into making movies. The more I read about Bicycle thieves the more I was eager to see it.I got the occasion during our first Development Team meeting. Our team's boss ? Mr.Bernhard Drumel ? who is a German ? I understood has keen interests in movies. He had organized the first development team meeting in a small restaurant ? called Vertigo ? below a theatre "Film Museum". The theatre was in a wonderful location, in the midst of the biggest park of Amsterdam ? Vondelpark. One has to walk from a tram stop and walk all through the way inside the park, the wooden bridge, small water pond and lovely line of trees. During this first official meeting Bernhard and my official Guru ? Mr.Andreas Hensel showed interest in seeing this movie after the meeting at 5:30 pm. I immediately jumped to opportunity. Even if they (or anyone else) had not seen the movie, I would had gone for the same.Bicycle Thieves is an Italian movie, made in 1945. It is called Neo-realism movie. The movie is about an unemployed man who gets a job ? but for that he has to have a bicycle. He requests his wife to sell some of the linens and buy an old bicycle. But during his work the bicycle gets stolen. The whole movie is about how his son and he are trying to search the bicycle. There are moments of happiness, joy and sadness ? very poignant! The father traces the thieve, but seeing his poverty and not finding the bike ? comes back and thinks of stealing a bicycle themselves; and while doing so ? he gets caught. Seeing his poor state ? people do not take him into prison ? but leave him on the roads again. The last scene was the expression of humiliation of father seen caught in front of his son ? the movie ends there ? sadly.The best portion that I liked of the movie was that ? the story line was very simple. But the direction was fantastic. Throughout the movie, on the backdrop, there are things happening ? that showcase the Italian economy, society and culture. As a director ? it takes lots of efforts to manage and the huge movie canvas ? through these minute details of back-drop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of us like movies with fantastic plots. Some of us like movies with slam-packed action, riotous humour, the perfect romance, or aliens from Galaxy Q-257. In other words, some of us like movies that are far away from everyday life. If you're one of those people, leave now.OK, you're still here, so I can assume that you can take down-to-earth realism. Well, you'll get it. This is an extremely realistic movie, in the *true* sense of the word 'realism' (not like the Hollywood definition where realism = tons of blood, swearing and explicit sex. What the hell reality are they in? ...and how do I get there?!). This is a movie which depicts a day in the life of an ordinary person in postwar Italy who is subjected to an ordinary misfortune. He reacts in an ordinary way. People, in turn, react to him in ordinary ways. This movie is so real, it might come across as boring to most people. But I assure you, it's packed with substance.It's truly one of the most affecting cinema experiences, because it shows you the poetry we all experience in every single moment of our mundane, day-to-day, unsung lives. A similar story happens to each of the 6 billion humans on this planet every day. And each story is absolutely monumental in its simplicity.I can't think of too many other films that are so effective without resorting to gimmicks, histrionics or melodrama. Maybe the fact that De Sica chose an unknown cast is the reason why it was so successful in its excellent presentation. This is a great human story. I give it an 8 out of 10. I had to take away 2 points only because the kid is so damn ugly. Bless his heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neorealist film about a desperate man in a desperate society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vittorio De Sica's "The Bicycle Thief" uses Neorealist techniques to portray a man and a society. The man is Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani), who goes on a quest to find his bicycle after it gets stolen on his first day at work. The society is post-WWII Rome, where jobs are scarce, money is tight, and nearly everyone is so desperate that they could be driven to thievery."The Bicycle Thief" claims to be a slice of life, but it actually has been carefully scripted to ensure sufficient variety and drama. It utilizes as many different locations as possible: Antonio's search takes him to a busy pawn shop, a police station, an open-air market, a church mission, a restaurant, a fortune-teller's, and a brothel. All these different locations present a vivid portrait of post-war, lower-class Rome, contextualizing Antonio's story and defining Neorealism in the process. However, at times there is a little too much of this emphasis on location and atmosphere. The most compelling part of the film is the relationship between Antonio and his young son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), but it sometimes gets lost amid all the vignettes.After watching the movie, I was amazed to discover that the actors were amateurs--their performances are so good! Maggiorani is subtle, never hammy; child actor Staiola is endearing without seeming fake; and together they work up a very convincing father-son dynamic. If the movie sometimes loses its course when trying to address the issue of society at large, it never once falters in the realistic, moving scenes between Antonio and Bruno.For some reason, I like and admire, rather than adore, "The Bicycle Thief." However, it's definitely a well-made, oftentimes compelling film about poverty and its effects on families. And, more importantly, it proved that "well-made" movies don't have to have glossy production values and famous stars, and that stories like Antonio's are worthy of being told on screen.</fullReview>

I also felt bad for his little son, Bruno and the rest of his family. However, this guy manages to dart from place to place in Rome searching for his lost bike makes me wonder....does he need a bike in the first place?

		<fullReview>Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is about to embark on a new life. His wife sells some of their sheets, and with that money they are able to buy his bike back so he can start a new job. His first day on the job, however, someone steals his bike while his back is turned. He runs all over that area of town, but the case seems helpless. Instead of giving up his friend Baiocco (Gino Saltamerenda), and his little buy Bruno (Enzo Staiola) join Antonio in a search all over the city. Some of said this film is a microcosm for socialism, perhaps just about one man's search for faith (fides in latin, which is the type of bike he had), the epitome of Italian neo-realism, or perhaps just about poverty stricken Italy and the lengths one man would go to ensure some comfort for his family. Personally, I'm not sure which is the most important aspect of the film, but even if it's about none of these, De Sica has definitely created a masterpiece on human emotion and captured the essence of Italy during that time (post WWII). If you're debating whether or not to watch this, I would say believe the hype and ignore any negative reviews you hear, this film is one that needs to be seen. Rating: 32/40</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mis En Scen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: Vittorio de Sica's The Bicycle Thief uses several formal film elements to illustrate the depressed economy of the post-war Italy in which the film takes place. One element that really struck me was the mis-en-scéne in the film. The most striking of which, was the pile of bags of linens. When Antonio and his wife, Maria, were forced to pawn their linens to afford the bicycle, the man in the back that had to put away the linens had to climb, what seemed to be stories of bundles of linens. Seeing how many people had to pawn their bed sheets really affected me and proved to what an impoverished state this family/town was in. Another aspect of the mis-en-scéne that was effective were the costumes, especially Antonio's frayed and worn jacket. This was really apparent in the restaurant scene when Antonio took his son Bruno out to eat. They were the only ones in the restaurant in such disheveled clothing. Bruno kept catching dirty looks from a well dressed little boy sitting at another table because Bruno was wearing his torn up jacket and shorts. In the beginning of the film a large group of men stood outside waiting to hear news of jobs that were available to them. All the men looked poverty-stricken and some were hostile. All of those unemployed men had to stand outside waiting to hear about `good government jobs', and for many, only to be denied. The Bicycle Thief makes for a great example of neo-realism in Italy in part because of all these great examples of mis-en-scene depicting the depressed economy of Italy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ricci!... Antonio!! ...Bruno!!! De Sica made a movie in which you could identify yourself with Antonio, with Bruno. It got to the point that you just wished he was successful at the moment he tried to steal the bicycle. Everything happened in two days and contradicts all the movies I have seen before of that time. De Sica makes and excellent job choosing the role of Bruno and the kid makes an excellent job performing. Another outstanding point in the movie is how not only Antonio but the whole family are full of happiness with Antonios' job.Is this movie one of the best ever? probably I heared a lot about it before seeing it so I had very high expectations. Thinking about it in a more objective way, it was an excellent movie that made you part of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film that symbolizes the rebirth of Italian cinema that would last well into the mid 1980s. Made authetic by use of non professional actors who make film feel emotionally powerful. One of many masterpiece films by an great in Italian cinema, Vittorio De Sica. He directs with a quiet sense of professionalism. A touching performance is done by lead actor, Lamberto Maggiorani. The Bicycle Thief(1948) reaches at the heart and tugs at the brain with emotion and pathos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't come much better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the masterpieces of the neo-realism and a milestone in the post-war Italian cinema: "Ladri di Biciclette" is simply perfect in every way.The storyline is quite thin, but very touching because it is so realistic. It's about a man who finally finds a job after a very long search. He and his wife (and two children) live in poor conditions. Because a bicycle is essential in order to do the job (he doesn't want to wait another two years), and because they don't have that kind of money: his wife decides to sell the sheets. NOW they can afford themselves a bicycle and he has a job. And when he has a job, the family will have some money again! But the worst comes to the worst when his bicycle is stolen right under his nose. He cannot catch the thief no matter how hard he tries and from that moment on he starts an almost impossible hunt for his stolen bicycle. With a little help from his friends and his youthful son they start to track down the vehicle. His son is willing to stay with his father for as long as it takes to find it, because no bike ? no job ? no money! Mainly this film is about the search for that one particular bike. But it never gets boring or predictable, not even for a second! Director Vittorio De Sica succeeds in making SOMETHING out of NOTHING. I mean, how can you possibly entertain your audience for 90 minutes with a thin story such as this one? Simple: make sure that the whole thing is so realistic that everyone who watches this picture is emotionally involved. Because that is exactly what this classic intends to do. As said before: the story might be thin but it is so believable and moving that (if you wouldn't know any better) you would want to stand up and help this man find his bicycle. Little by little, he and his son become really fed up with the whole situation as well as disappointed because they couldn't find the bike. What is most unpleasant for the little kid is that his father at times seems to have more interest in the bike than his own son. Thereby the little kid is almost killed by a car. But they still love each other and this you can see in the scene where the father gets into a real panic when he thinks he's lost his son. After that, he takes him to a pizza restaurant. To see how they get so much pleasure from just one pizza is only one of the many emotional scenes that became part of this great film; which is both very lifelike and heart breaking. The acting performances are not the greatest you've ever seen, but they're very good; that's for sure. What is most important in a film like this is that the acts are very believable. The expressions on the father's face when he's looking for his bicycle were very real to me. The camerawork of this film is nothing special. There aren't any original camera shots involved (? la Hitchcock) or nice-looking camera effects (? la Scorsese), but anything of this kind would have only made the film less good. The shooting is so simple that you sometimes forget you're watching a film and that is what De Sica wanted to achieve.* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * Crime leads to crime. That is what this fantastic and most unexpected plot of the film is trying to tell you. Who would have thought that this honest, hard-working father of two children would lower himself to steal someone else's bicycle? You might have guessed that he would try and take another bike, but no one really expected this to happen. But things become even more unpleasant when his son witnesses the awful crime his daddy commits. There's a very simple message to this scene: 'this is the world mankind created for themselves'. It's a good thing that the film doesn't have a happy ending. That way you're left with a bad feeling of pity that stays with you for some time.In short: 90 minutes of rare excellence!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Current filmakers should watch this film over and over again just to learn how to make a half-decent film. If certain directors would realize that small films like this one are the best kind, then the films out there would be much better.What's so great about "The Bicycle Thief", you ask. Well, it's not one particular one thing. It's so quiet and so sad that's it's unforgettable.Did you know that this film does not have any actors?Yeah. It's true. All the players were picked off the street. The shooting period was very minimal and...and...it's magnificent. The actors exude so much pain and sadness that you can't look away. You want them to succeed, more than anything.This film is not to be missed4/4 </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bicycle Thief has long been considered one of the greatest Italian neo-realist films, if not one of the greatest films ever. There is little that is visually stimulating; it is mostly shot with natural light and long sequences take place in the empty streets of Rome. Yet, it is a completely engrossing picture if only because it sets up the story so well. A man struggles to provide for his wife and young son and gets an opportunity but needs a bicycle. He gets one by hocking his bedsheets. Now, he feels life will be better, until on a busy side street it is stolen and lost in a crowd.Vittorio De Sica was originally an actor, and he obviously had a good eye for casting, deciding to go with all amateur actors, which brought a whole other dimension to the world of post-World War II Italy. These actors portraying the father and son are so real, so effective in close-ups and action sequences that it is almost like a documentary following them around the city. It is quite riveting to see a man fight the elements, which is something all can relate to; we feel for this man and understand why he would do the things he does.Desperation becomes part of him as time goes on, and the ending is surprising as it is understandable. This film speaks to all of us; it tells the story of people trying to survive and overcome the most precarious of situations: in this case, people. Life was tough then and it still is. Although this may seem as a depressing film, it actually has a message of hope. This film passes on the message that humans are incredible individuals; pressing on to overcome obstacles at any cost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many years have gone by since this picture was released. Modern filmgoers either don't know or don't have much interest in quality or content in movies, and even less in foreign films. Those of us who know movies, however, can recognize a great picture when we see it. And this is one of the all-timers."The Bicycle Thief" is a celebration of humanity - there is more heart in this picture than can be found in a carload of recent films. All the aspects and emotions of human feeling are shoe-horned into 90 minutes and the picture gets better with each viewing.The actors are amateurs but you can't tell - and the boy, Bruno, is extraordinary. Having seen the film several times, it is he who puts this movie 'over the top'. And it gets better each time - I am not ashamed to say that the ending always moves me to tears.This is an exceptional motion picture achievement. That is why I have given it a 9 vote. It is on my all-time top 10 list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vittorio De Sica's The Bicycle Thief (Ladri Di Biciclette), made in 1948, in black and white, is one of the all time great films, and, in its Neo-realistic cinema verité simplicity, it shows how utterly creatively bankrupt most film-making these days is. And by that I mean worldwide, not just the obvious flaws of the Hollywood crap factory. Lean, spare, poetic- it tells one story, but tells it very well, and that story becomes universal, and is applicable to all people who have ever suffered, or been driven to do desperate things. Its screenplay is deceptively slight, but that does not mean it is not great. Oftentimes, it is assumed that a great screenplay must be witty like Woody Allen films, deep like Ingmar Bergman films, or characteristically complex like Robert Altman films, but great screenplays can also be the antithesis of those things. A great screenplay may be like that in Stanley Kubrick's for 2001: A Space Odyssey, full of symbolism writ large, and on the other hand, it can be like The Bicycle Thief, which is symbolic precisely because it is so intensely personal.The film is almost pitch perfect from beginning to end, yet, as often happens, something is lost in the translation of its title, Ladri Di Biciclette, which literally means Bicycle Thieves, but in America is known as The Bicycle Thief. The original title is more literally true, as both the 'real' thief and Antonio, steal bikes, and it also allows for a deeper look at their differing motivations. When we see the original thief's one room apartment- with mother and two other siblings- we see that he, too, is poor, and we have to wonder if he is Antonio on the future, with just a bit more desperation. Yes, he's obviously a skilled con man, but he may have started out pure, as well. This deeper look is lost in the Americanized title, for while technically Antonio is a thief, he is truly forced into it, lest his family will be even more degraded, while the young thief is likely merely using external circumstances to justify his black soul. De Sica wisely does not opt out for that simplistic end, though, for we still have the contrast between the professional thief, and the rank amateur, Antonio.Many critics have reduced this film to De Sica's supposed refutation of a simple false dualism- that De Sica is merely trying to show good and evil are relative, but the film clearly is NOT doing that, for we know, all along, that the young professional thief would likely be a con man regardless. All of his neighbors are cheats and liars, as he has likely been accused many times before, and even his mother lies for her manifestly guilty son. De Sica recognizes that there IS good and evil, but that sometimes an act that appears evil- such as thievery, can be born of different circumstances; pure evil and greed, as in the case of the young thief, and mere desperation, as with Antonio. Ironically, many of the critics who chide viewers for their supposed biases against the young thief, show their own biases in wholly missing De Sica's actual point- which is not to show that there are differing reasons for similar acts, but that the reasons CAN be night and day, yet still be confused, and that usually, and regardless, it is the honest who are screwed either way.Even worse, are those stolid critics with a political ax to grind. Marxists somehow got it into their heads that Antonio, who is clearly shown as living in squalor, is a member of the bourgeoisie, simply because he wears a fedora, not a cap, or because his wife has clean bedsheets, thus when he gets a job, it is symbolic of governmental favoritism for an elite class, and the young bike thief, who wears a German hat, is a member of the international proletariat, although he clearly is a member of the criminal class, and in that conflation much of Marxist theology bogs down. The theft of Antonio's bike is therefore claimed as a revolutionary act, and his lying neighbors are just good workers defending a comrade. That Antonio is left bereft, at film's end, to Marxists, symbolizes a perverse justice. To point out all the ridiculous flaws in such super-simplistic ideas would waste time, but, clearly, the only reason such absurd claims were made were because the screenwriter, Cesare Zavattini, who adapted the film from a novel by Luigi Bartolini, was a member of the Italian Communist Party, at the time. Interestingly, the film has also been seen as a very Conservative film, praised by Christian groups and even William F. Buckley's The National Review, not because it delineates good and evil, as described above, but because they see it as a refutation of Marxist ideals, in that Antonio and the other laborers do not find work degrading, but a fundament of their self worth; so much so that when the young thief kyboshes Antonio's ability to gain that self respect, he loses all hope, and is reduced to dishonesty himself.Neither reductivist outlook adequately deals with the many subtleties and nuances this great film portrays, and the fact that The Bicycle Thief is shorn of Freudian psychobabble and preaching is one of its strengths. Yet, it is not pure cinema, either, as many European critics have labeled it. Although the visuals convey the milieu well, they do not get inside the characters. This is where the writing and acting ability of Maggiorani and Staiola works magic. Great art is simply not so easily reducible as political panderers want it to be, and one can be thankful for that, lest The Bicycle Thief would not be what it is, nor would we still be watching it with such easy appreciation for its simple virtues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Looking for Neo-Realism, Look No Further</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone looking for a crash course in Italian Neo-Realism need look no further than Vittorio De Sica's landmark 1948 film.To summarize the story of "The Bicycle Thief" is easy. A man desperate for work has his bicycle stolen on the first day of his new job. Since he needs the bicycle to keep the job, he spends the rest of the movie roaming the streets of Rome with his young son looking for it. But of course the PLOT of "The Bicycle Thief" goes far beyond this. It's about a man who is struggling to hold on to his faith in humanity when everything else in his life is telling him not to.The film looks like a documentary, thanks to De Sica's use of on-location shooting and non-actors, hallmarks of Italian Neo-Realist cinema. It also eschews the emotional bombast of your classic narrative Hollywood storytelling from the same time period -- only occasionally does our protagonist display an emotion beyond that of weary resignation that remains on his face for most of the movie, and even then these other emotions appear for a moment or two. It's a quiet, thoughtful and poetic movie, and it rewards patience.I admire "The Bicycle Thief" but I can't bring myself to say that I actually enjoyed watching it. It's certainly effective and it belongs to that class of films that needed to be made in order for cinema as an art form to evolve. But it's not exactly entertaining, and it's capped by a quietly devastating and very bleak ending.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why kill myself worrying when I'll end up just as dead anyway?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bicycle Thieves initially struck me as being much more famous than it deserves. I will admit that for a good portion of the film I found myself wondering why it is such a well known classic. Then again, I'm not exactly an expert on Italian Neorealism so that may have something to do with it. One thing that really caught my attention right away was how well the film captured the desperation of the out of work masses. I live in central eastern China at the moment, in a relatively small city of a mere 6.5 million people, and everywhere I look I see similar circumstances. Especially in the countryside, it's frightening to see how poor these people are.The film tells an incredibly moving story about the life of a poor family using an extremely effective but amazingly simple plot device, a stolen bicycle. In my life I have probably had half a dozen or so bicycles stolen from me, and it's such a sinking and sickening feeling, that for a while I wondered if maybe a stolen bicycle was the original inspiration for the story.Indeed, the after effects are captured flawlessly. The instant desperation, the frantic searching, the fleeting certainty that you'll be able to recover the lost bike, and the gradual and crushing realization that that is never going to happen. Even after filing a police report and doing everything possible to find it, the world is filled with millions of bicycles. As "the one who sees" explains, "Find it right away or you never will."The story boils a man down to the singular need of that bicycle in order to provide with his family, and when it is taken from him we witness all of the above changes in him, along with the gradual increasing of his desperation until he ultimately reaches the conclusion that many of us were waiting for all along, and yet dread to see when it actually happens. All along he only wants to provide for his family, and yet ultimately he is forced to do something that he despises, and clearly isn't very good at. The helplessness and uselessness of the police is surely a statement that Hitchcock would have loved, and also says something about the plight of people in his situation. Even in a situation when he was sure he knew who had stolen his bicycle, and who had even run away from him minutes before, he was told by a police officer that he had no proof and was then ridiculed by an entire neighborhood in front of his son. Sadly, there is no real conclusion to the man's story, because there is no easy ending in his life either. It is interesting to consider the meaning behind the lack of closure. Obviously, it is a closer representation of real life this way, but there is also a point when Antonio, the main character, muses briefly but powerfully on his situation, giving the film a whole new depth - "There's a cure for everything - except death."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie some days ago, I expected it to be sad; and it definitely lived up to my expectations. I am no movie expert but I saw it because I have read it's one of the greatest films ever. I really don't get the feeling of what it is that makes it great, but I'd like to say that say that despite being sad it's not bitter, and that what impressed me most about it was the boy's performance. These two points remain in me, and maybe that is where the power and magic of this movie resides: what could be deemed by an ordinary mind like mine an ordinary film, turns out to leave an profound mark in your mind. It surprised me too to see that the film was made just three years after WW II was over and how a now rich country could once be so poor and needy and today be at the same level countries that were in better shape then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the film's strongest themes is how desperation places people in situations to make sacrifices. This theme is demonstrated on multiple levels throughout the element of production design. From the very beginning of the film, the viewer is introduced to a very destitute environment involving distressed citizens arguing for job offers, tattered clothing of Antonio and his family, the barren house in which they live, and the meager circumstances they succumb to in pawning their bed sheets to buy a bicycle.Further proof of this desperation is illustrated at the pawn shop. Crowds of poverty-stricken people align themselves to pawn/sacrifice whatever material possessions they have in hopes to receive enough money to get them through the day. All sorts of items (props) are sold here including: binoculars, bed sheets, shoes, hats as well as bicycles. One of the structures built on set that capitalizes on this theme is inside the pawn shop. There is a towering shelf about 100ft in the air that holds thousands of bed sheets. The implication here indicates that the entire city suffers from a desperate need to survive and make sacrifices.The bicycle itself is a symbol of sustained living that counters the desperation Antonio and his family is under. Without the bicycle, Antonio does not have a job, and if he has no job, he makes no money, which in turn means his family does not eat. When his bicycle is stolen, the feeling of desperation heightens as he searches the streets of Rome to find it. When his hopes begin to diminish after searching all day in vain, it begins to heavily rain outside. This aspect of production design reinforces the weight Antonio is feeling?thus fulfilling the platitude, "When it rains, it pours." There is a special moment captured in the film that places this awful desperation on hold. Feeling like all is lost, Antonio and his son, Bruno, go to a restaurant to escape from their dilemma. The atmosphere there is very joyous including a live band, people smiling, and good tasting foods. There is a wardrobe contrast shown between the rich and the poor: Antonio in rags and the rich in fashionable attire. All these aspects ironically support the main theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Bicycle Thief" is a very touching movie about a man's loss ofand search for, faith (Fides, the make of the bike, means faith inLatin). For all of us who associate Italy with glamour and glory, avery different view is depicted here. This is post-war Rome whereeveryone is struggling to make ends meet, where anarchy rulesthe streets, where a married couple sells their bedsheets andsend their 10-year old to work 12 hours a day to help feed hisfamily. Antonio and his son desperately go around looking for thebike, and each time they think they find it, something happens. The link between the bike and faith is at its highest when Antonioand Bruno go to church, only to cause a scene and get kicked out. There is also quite a bit of suspense throughout the movie, butmost of all it is a very human, natural, and realistic depiction of thelower working classes, regardless of time and place. It's a greatmovie, and the score is equally touching and great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its reputation, it's still not DeSica's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BICYCLE THIEVES is an Italian "Neo-realist" film--so called because it used real people in rather ordinary situations. Some see these as anti-Hollywood but the actual reason for them was that after the war, the Italian film industry was in ruin and they were practically broke, so making these simple films about simple people was a natural outgrowth, though some of the groundwork for this style began during the war.The story itself is about a poor man who is out of work but is finally able to secure a job using his bicycle. The problem is that soon after starting back to work, the bike is stolen so he spends the rest of the film searching for the bike (sort of like PEEWEE'S GREAT ADVENTURE, but not a comedy). Later in the film, the focus is not just on the bike but on the relationship between the man and his young son. There really is nothing more to this very simple plot, but it is a fascinating time capsule into the desperate state of Italy until its rebirth in the mid-1950s.The fact that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is so well known and respected is a testament to the fact that many "in the know" aren't really that smart after all. What they actually didn't realize is that the director (DeSica) did several other films that were at least as good, if not better. I have heard and read much fawning praise for this film while at the same time wondering how these critics can discuss THE BICYCLE THIEVES without mentioning his other great works. It wasn't like THE BICYCLE THIEVES was his one crowning achievement as director--it's just that this one was discovered abroad and by the Oscar people (AMPAS). I challenge you to watch MIRACLE IN MILAN, UMBERTO D or especially THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US and then tell me that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is THE great masterpiece. These films (particularly THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US) have a great depth of emotion that THE BICYCLE THIEVES lacks and the connection to the audience is greater (provided you ever see these other films).I am not cursing THE BICYCLE THIEVES--it is a very good and simple film. But as far as its being a "masterpiece", I just think it's a bit overrated. Before marking this review "not helpful", please first have integrity and see these other films to see what I mean--they are indeed great films and DeSica was an amazing director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story displays as no other cinema's power to reveal with sheer simplicity some great truth about the human condition. For some it is a bleak movie, others say it is for euro- intellectuals, and there's even those who say it is an overrated classic for film snobs and elitists. However, this movie is so apparently simple, so deprived of tricks, artificialities, cryptic references and special effects, that it I can't understand why anyone would think this is a difficult movie to watch. All I want to say, cuz all has been said about it, is that this movie isn't bleak or disheartening. I mean, it is, but not to the point where you want to say man is a disgusting creature, society is putrid and ?as Peggy Lee would say? "let's pour out the booze and have a ball". Bicycle Thief also shows a great dose of hope in the end. When the protagonist fails to find any help in all the institutions (police, church, psychic) that are supposed to aid him, he finally turns himself into a thief. However, when he is caught stealing a bike, the bike's owner forgives him in a very humiliating scene. After the protagonist has lost faith in all the institutions, when he depends on the generosity of an individual, he finds an act of grace and humanity: he is forgiven, and for the first time in the film, after being betrayed by everything, he is the recipient of a generous act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always liked movies that make us so angry, so vindictive in the name of our protagonists, yet the plot involves things so minuscule and mundane. This film is about something in society that we all, no matter what country you live in, take for granted. We never question the routine stability of conveniences and services in life provided by the lower class jobs. When we hear of thefts in certain parts of town, we're never as careful as we should be, and we, especially those of us who are younger, don't tend to think about the true effects the crime of stealing can cause. To us, crime can even sound like fun, and so can criminals. This film is about a poor man who sells his bedsheets as a last resort to afford the bicycle he needs as a requirement for his new job. On his first day, a thief steals his bicycle, and if he doesn't get it back, he will be fired. He has an innocent, sensitive young son to take care of. He has a wife who worries constantly.The movie is not just realistic, and made to show us reality. It's about a certain part of reality that society disguises in gloss. We never think about the posters we see or the food that is served or the garbage taken out. Thieves are glamorized, and surely even after experiencing this story we'll go right back to secretly enjoying hearing it when a brilliant bank heist is in the news and the crooks got away clean and other equivalents. But the important thing that I feel I got out of this movie is that no matter where society runs to remain blissfully forgetful of the horror of reality---and for the characters here, it truly is horror, and director Vittorio De Sica is sure to make us feel it with them---it will always be there, and it will always happen to somebody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely deserving of it's "classic" label</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite this movie's strong placement in the annals of those deemed "classics", I was a bit hesitant to check it out because I'm not the biggest fan of neorealism, and, strangely enough, a lot of my friends with opinions I respect really didn't like it. I've got to say that I'm going to have to side with those who call it a classic this time around. More specifically, I've never before seen a neorealist film I would ever have called "gripping" and I've not seen any neorealist film as good since "Roma, citta apperta".Let me quickly go through some of the myths and the more popular interpretations: it is true that the movie completely revolves around a man and his son searching for the man's stolen bicycle, but it is not true at all that there's nothing else to it. More specifically, it's about the man's relationship with his son as a main theme and an exploration of post-war Rome as subtext. It is true that it has quite a lot of communist themes placed through-out, but honestly those themes are entirely engulfed in the much more personal, tragic aspects of the movie. The more poignant political commentary is in the way the plot works, where people are forced to own property--a certain type of property--in order to get a job and thus get more property. Truly you can't blame the movie for that, because it has a point.What this movie is really good at is shifting the emotions of the viewers to match those felt by the protagonist Antonio Vicci. The movie quickly establishes the importance of the bicycle and its emotional value to Vicci. The search itself is desperate, but it is given depth by the relationship of Antonio to Bruno, his son. As the two of them share a love for the bike and a need to retrieve it, they also share a shifting and dynamic relationship to each other that runs from full support to quiet alienation and everything in between. The strongest moments in the film are the ones in which their relationship seem the most damaged. The father eventually must depend on the son to share his pain.In terms of the concept of neorealism itself, it's debatable where this movie fits. The most clear features of it are its focus on class struggle, a taste of the melodrama, and a plot lead on by a simple, singular desire. However, the production values are much higher than the famed "Roma, citta apperta", and at this point de Sica is well established as an auteur working under the awareness of a more popular and mainstream international audience. Genre debates aside, it's a strong film that well deserves its lasting appreciation, no matter how many people find it boring or disagree with its politics.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Curiously Memorable Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This interesting and rather unusual classic succeeds in being memorable and sometimes affecting, despite the rather plain characters, the inexperienced cast, and the relatively simple story. The careful technique certainly has a lot to do with that, and in addition the simple sincerity of the characters and situations generally works better than you might have expected.Following the basic daily concerns of a working man and his family makes for a sharp contrast with the material in most well-known movies, and that kind of story in itself is enough to make the "neo-realism" genre worth exploring. It's not easy to hold an audience's attention with such material, and the unadorned appearance of the movie conceals a fair amount of skill, planning, and even a little artifice.The story-telling technique itself is polished, proceeding at a pace that draws the viewer into Antonio's world through the kind of understandable problems and worries that he has. It takes a while before you realize that you don't really know much about him except for his concerns of the present.Only in a couple of later scenes, such as the sequence with him eating in a restaurant with his son, is the character developed a little more fully.It all has a curious feel, as if the specific characters and events were not as important as the experience of being in their world for a little while. In a number of scenes, the situation readily suggests many other circumstances with different details that would produce the same kinds of feelings. Even Antonio's frustrating dealings with the police are not focused on taking cheap shots at the authorities, as would likely be the case in a Hollywood film, but on the way that the reality of things affects Antonio.It's probably a film to be respected rather than enjoyed, because of the often downbeat subject matter and the lack of strong characters. It's a little hard to call it a truly great film, yet it's well worth seeing, and it leaves an impression afterwards that may be somewhat stronger than any feeling it arouses while you're actually watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Ebert says, `The Bicycle Thief is so well-entrenched as an official masterpiece that it is a little startling to visit it again'. The label classic is often prejudicing to the first time viewer, I know it used to be for me, but as I've seen more and more films the label loses some of its appeal. If I had first seen The Bicycle Thief a few years ago, I bet I would have loved it. But this Tuesday it didn't hold much appeal to me. The story is good, a man and his son hopelessly looking for a stolen bicycle in Rome. The bike is an icon of money and food and the good life, but this was made in the post war depression and is fittingly depressing. There is never really a chance to find the bike; it is all a false hope. I'm sure this is how many Italian's felt who spent their days like our protagonist Antonio does at the beginning of the film, loitering around in an unemployment line hoping for the remote possibility of work. I can see beauty in the work. Some of the photography is very beautiful, especially the landscapes of Rome during the thefts and by the bridge, but still it does nothing for me. The little boy who plays Bruno does a excellent job acting and is the cutest child actor I've ever seen, but still it does nothing for me. I think my biggest problem with the film is with the story. The basic concept appeals to me. A man hopelessly lost in a city of despair. But the execution is a little off. I don't care about the characters. I don't care if Antonio starves or eats, lives or dies, works or commits crime. I don't care if Maria has sheets. I don't care if Bruno wants spaghetti but only gets mozzarella bread. Maybe there is nothing wrong with the movie and I'm just callous, but for arguments sake I'm going to blame the movie for not getting me involved. It seems like there is no tension. We know the bicycle is going to be stolen because of the title, the whole film is mired in depression so we just naturally assume things aren't going to work out, and at the first glance of the bicycle in the alley, we know that Antonio is going to steal it. It just seems predictable. Maybe that is a fault of its age and its conventions being used once too often, but I just couldn't get myself to care about the characters or even the film. I'm guessing it was a lot easier at the time to get people to understand the characters because they were living it and it was every day to them, but for me as a college student in Iowa it has nothing. It doesn't engage me, it doesn't entertain me, it doesn't make me care, it doesn't do anything but bore me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this movie is reasonably good but greatly overrated by critics and those who reflect their opinion and each others'. The action of the movie is slow, sparse and predictable, and the characters have little depth; they are mostly automata enacting conventionally established roles. The film stays rigidly within the framework and conventions set for it by the genre, or perhaps imposed on it _ad_hoc_ by the director. It is pictorially pleasurable, but as it is "neorealism" perhaps we are not supposed to enjoy the view but suffer from it. (Actually, from the point of view of Americans of 2005, there is nothing realistic whatever about it; we could be looking at people living on the moon.) Its closest relatives would be from the genre of Socialist Realism, but in the USSR the protagonist, instead of suffering a moral catastrophe at the end, would probably have to get religion with the Party. Of course such conventions are fundamentally no more "real" than the weirdnesses of Antonioni or Fellini -- who also knew how to make the sufferings of the poor entertaining, although they didn't focus on them with such rapt attention.Many people say this film had great influence on those which came after it, which may explain why I feel that it is not tremendously interesting and certainly not up to the adulation which has been heaped on it. The reasons for _that_ might be an interesting question, but this little message is a review of the movie, not its audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film, when one appreciates when it was first made. this film has to be appreciated within the social contents of the times we are dealing with here, but not only. i must say the ending is heart breaking. i had a few comments to make regarding the main actor's pace, there was a moment when, come , on he could have caught the guy had he not started screaming "Thief!". I'm not on about when the bike was first stolen but when by pure chance after the rain he sees the culprit not too far off, he could have bee a bit more subtle and wiser in his approach. But apart from that brilliant, I am very sure things turned out for the best since he did not lose the most important thing that is his family, his son who remained ever loving by his side. One notes that he was a bit careless in keeping an eye on his bike, we could see early opportunities for the thieves to snatch it before it was actually stolen and same could have happened to his son all throughout but thank god that never did. I am very glad I finally got to watch this all time classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a classic movie... and I hate it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, I was the stereotypical "ugly American" who was too bored by foreign films to give them a fair chance. But that's changed lately. These days, I like nothing better than popping a Bergman or Kurosawa or Ozu movie into my DVD player, and I'm becoming more and more intolerant of crass Hollywood fare.Bear with me, because my tedious introductory comments are leading up to a point. And that point is - "Bicycle Thieves" is perhaps THE essential movie that turned me off foreign films for so many years. "Bicycle Thieves" is, in sad fact, the movie that chased me away from subtitles, away from the arty-farty world of elite cinema. It took a long time for me to work up the courage to watch another foreign film after I saw this little gem, I can tell you.But why, you might reasonably ask, did "Bicycle Thieves" have such a profoundly negative effect on me? Because I found it simply too depressing for words. Depressing...to an almost absurd degree.The movie, I'm sure you know, is about a dude who needs a bicycle to get a decent job and support his family. He pawns some of his last worldly possessions in order to obtain said bicycle. And the bicycle is *immediately* stolen. Our protagonist spends the whole movie trying to get the bicycle back, and even succeeds in tracking down the thief, but he is obstructed at every turn by jerks and ultimately frustrated in his quest.So, in the end, our hero tries to steal a bicycle himself during a moment of despair. Unfortunately for him, about 10,000 people witness the attempted theft and perform a group tackle on him to stop it. He is publicly shamed in front of his son, and then slinks away. End of depressing movie.What exactly is the message here? Society sucks? Poverty is inescapable? Don't respond to stealing with more stealing? Or, at least, never try to lift someone else's bike when 10,000 people are ready to spring upon you from every doorway and stop you? The truth is, I can't figure out the movie's message. Nor can I relate much to the depths of poverty shown here - can the guy really not afford to buy another bicycle, or borrow one, or *something*? Or must his whole life be an endless tale of frustration and woe? Call me superficial...call me bourgeois...call me uninformed...but I think this movie is just a drag, a slog, a pain in my posterior. It's the kind of foreign movie that turns Americans off better foreign movies, and that's a shame. I wish I could see something sophisticated about it, but I don't - what's so sophisticated about being relentlessly dark, to the point of stretching credibility? In short, I'll gladly take the bitter-sweetness of a foreign art film like "Tokyo Story" over the bitter-bitterness of this one. Real life is usually better than what you see in this movie, folks. And when life does get this bad...I'm not sure I wanna look at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's be objective here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I imagine most of the comments that praise this film endlessly are film buffs and film students. The Bicycle Thief is seen as the flagship representative of Italian neo-realism, and it is more "important" than it is entertaining. This film drags and drags and drags, but that's the point. This is "realism." You are taken on the man's quest to find his stolen bicycle. The scenes are long, mostly dead-ends, and many times you are unsure of where he is going or what he is doing (as he is). The Bicycle Thief and Italian Neo-Realism is an interesting experiment in film, but nothing more than that.My critique of neo-realism is that we already have something like it, and they're called documentaries. What this genre does is it essentially takes the worst of doc and non-doc films. In a documentary, when something gets long you can look past it because IT IS REAL... and the very nature of it being real makes it engaging (if done well). In a non-documentary, the director can do whatever he pleases to add exciting elements and twists to a story (which neo-realism does not take advantage of). This movement had to happen sooner or later, but it is no surprise to me that it didn't last. This film is a must see for any student or buff, but if you wanna be entertained there are hundreds upon hundreds of better films out there. Nevertheless, The Bicycle Thief had a great "feel" to it that cannot be described, likely attributable to its realism. Quite frankly though, The Bicycle Thief got very slow. If I wanted realism, I'd rent a doc or look out the window. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hate its point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie I run into sometimes where I didn't discover I hated it until I got to the ending. But hate it I do, hate, hate, hate, and I sincerely look forward to never seeing it again. When I find myself so hating a movie that the rest of the world adores, my standard procedure is to give it one star, just to balance things. But in truth, this movie was so well made that I couldn't in good conscience give it only one star. So I gave it two."What's he talking about? How can he admit it's a terrifically made movie and yet hate it so much?" I hate it for it's message. I hate it for its point of view. I hate it for what it has to say, no matter how skillfully and artfully it says it. And it's not until we get to the ending that this message really becomes clear.The message is one of hopelessness. Grim, grinding, depressing hopelessness. This movie is absolutely steeped in a malevolent universe premise. Everything sucks and there's nothing you can do about it.The protagonist is a very likable guy. He clearly loves his wife and children and is trying his very best to somehow provide for them. When he manages to get his bicycle out of hock so that he can get the super-rare job, you exult with him that he's finally going to be able to make some money and feed his family. Of course, the unfortunate title of the film already leads you into instant stress over his situation, because you already *know* the bicycle, essential for his success, is going to be stolen (and you don't have to get very far into the film to realize that the title is probably going to end up applying just as much to himself, that he too is going to end up stealing a bicycle). And sure enough, on his very first day on the job, the bicycle is stolen. Now his only option is to try to find and retrieve the bicycle, a practically hopeless, impossible task. But one that could certainly be the core of an interesting, engrossing film story.And it *is* an interesting and engrossing film story. I was totally caught up in it. I really felt for the guy, and wanted him to succeed. I felt for him, I felt for his kid, I felt for his brave, steadfast wife. Like I said, the hero is likable. He doesn't give up, he doesn't despair, he keeps plugging away, and, against all odds, he *does* manage to find the thief! And yet... it's all for nothing. Because this isn't a movie about triumph, about success, it's a movie about failure. Because finding the thief doesn't help, he proves to be untouchable, the police can do nothing. With every other avenue exhausted, at the end of his rope, he does indeed try to steal a bicycle himself, but he can't even succeed at that. The movie ends with him walking away, a completely shattered, broken man.Well what kind of an ending is that?!? I watched the whole movie pulling for the guy, waiting for him to succeed *somehow*, and in the end, the message is, "Sorry, success is impossible, life is a stacked deck, there's no reason to even try." What kind of message is that?!? First off, it's depressing as hell, and I don't watch movies to be depressed. Second, it's a premise I strenuously reject. Life is NOT hopeless, the universe is NOT malevolent, happiness and success ARE possible.One of the most useful things I've ever read on this site is a thread in the discussion section about whether the message of the film is intended to be Marxist. I confess that one of my reactions was that it did seem vaguely Marxist, or at least anti-capitalist. But the thread makes a good case that it really wasn't Marxist at all; indeed the communist guys in the film are no help at all. Nothing is any help. This movie is Anti-. Anti-everything. Capitalism clearly doesn't work, communism doesn't, religion doesn't help, government (in the form of the police) doesn't help. A loving wife, a dedicated friend, nothing helps. This is a horribly nihilistic, depressing philosophy. Apparently the only thing that the movie makers believe in is making artistic movies.I suspect that the movie makers thought it was chic, or sophisticated, or artistic to be anti-everything. Well, not in my book. You have to be *for* *something*. But in one limited respect, I'll buy into their anti-everything philosophy: I'm anti-this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand all the praise that this movie gets. It does not make sense to me. I'll have to watch it again.The part of the movie that works for me is the reaction of the son, Bruno, to problems his father is having. He wants to be proud of his father, but things only go from bad to worse.A guy with no bicycle gets a job that requires a bicycle. He relies on his wife to solve the problem by pawning their new and used sheets to get their old bicycle out of hock. Why would a pawn shop value a bicycle the same as used bedding especially when they already have a warehouse full of pawned bedding?The job entails carrying a big ladder, a bucket of paste, a big paste brush, and movie posters on a bicycle and putting up posters. That would seem to be a dangerous and stupid balancing act. Why aren't the people and supplies delivered by truck?The bicycle gets stolen from under his nose at the first job and he is unable to catch the thief even when he is "aided" by someone in a truck. Why didn't he put some kind of restraint on the bike? Why didn't the thief choose an unattended bike? It is hard to believe he could not catch the bike thief.He tries to find the stolen bike and then gives up. Why couldn't he borrow someone's bike or even promise to pay someone part of his new big salary to use their bike?Spoilers: As a last resort, he grabs an unattended bike, but as soon as he touches it, ten people appear out of every door and window and chase him down and catch him. It is incredible that out of all the bicycles in Italy this guy chooses the one that is guarded by ten athletes that are able to outrun a bicycle that has a big head start. You have to wonder if this guy is too dumb to function in that society. He takes a ridiculous job, depends on his wife to get a bike, is unable to hold on to the bike, unable to catch the thief, unable to find his stolen bike, unable to come up with a plan to get a new bike except for theft which he bungles. When you see him putting up a poster, he seems very sloppy and the results do not look good. So even if he had a bike, he would probably be fired for sloppy work.If you a looking for a real masterpiece of Italian cinema, look at Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a movie that is much better. </fullReview>

Plainly it was once impactful. The best it can do is the attempt to develop the storytelling through the kid's perspective in the second half. But it falls short, failing to break the bonds of basic moralizing.So we're left with the 'bicycle's components' - note especially that the soothsayer was stolen directly from this to be used in "The Matrix" series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to a mindless display of special effects and violence, any serious film about the human condition is welcome. "The Bicycle Thief" is most certainly a serious film about poverty and desperation, and perhaps it was strikingly dramatic at the time it was made - but I do not regard it as a truly great film because the characters do not come alive for me at all. I feel sorry for the main character in a generic kind of way, but that is all. The few details we have about him and his family are kind of arbitrary and vague, so I never felt as if I had gotten to know him as a person. In short, this is a serious film about a difficult time and the desperation of the people who lived through it, but it was neither as informative about that time as a documentary would have been nor as engaging as a dramatic vehicle should have been.</fullReview>

Some of them HAVE been great but others like "Wild Strawberries" and this are just meandering, depressing and ultimately pointless. Seriously--what's so great about this? We see a man becoming completely destroyed and humiliated in front of his son. And the point is...? It was just depressing and also boring. The acting was nothing special (it's obvious they used amateurs) and the story is just so frustrating. What happened to the bicycle? Who has it? Why are we not told? Yes, I know life is like that but I don't need a movie to tell me that! Sometimes you want a movie to forgot about your troubles and worries. This one makes things worse. The ultimate message here seems to be that life is terrible and you can't do a thing about it. Does THAT make it a classic? I don't think so.It's another one of those films that was wildly overpraised and, I suppose, at the time of its release it was revolutionary. However not all movies become classics forever and ever. Time has not been kind to this one. I think critics and people keep praising it for one of two reasons: they don't understand it and think they're missing something (but don't want to admit it) OR don't want to rock the boat of critical opinions from the 1940s.

		<fullReview>This is another one of those "Top 100 Films" (or top 250, whatever) that is very overrated and will always be overrated because critics don't have the guts to ever change their lifelong opinions of anything, or go against their peers. In other words, it's the "thing to do," meaning rate some films higher than they deserve. It's almost an elitist-type of attitude among critics. Maybe it makes them feel smart. It's always been "in," too, among North American critics to overrate these European films. That, too, somehow makes this Liberal morons feel intelligent. They do this with Kurosawa, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Truffaut and others. In this case, it's director Vittorio De Sica.The fact is this is a grimy, unappealing, boring movie. The story is a simple one (not that there's anything wrong with that!): a man needs a bicycle to get a job. His wife pawns some things to help him buy a bike. After he gets it, it's stolen and the rest of the film is the man trying to find it. It was NOT fascinating; it was boring.Sometimes great camera-work elevates a film way above the story, or great acting will do that, but there is nothing extraordinary about anything in this movie. The actors are literally amateurs and look and sound the part.Yes, this movie can bring emotion and frustration as the feeble man and his son search desperately for the bike. Yes, I can see where this would be a "touching" film for some. Some parts are nicely filmed, too, It isn't all bad, but it's nowhere near its reputation as one of the top classic movies of all time. Come on! Get real!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those overrated movies in top 250 which take a rank in top 250 but which were not voted by enough people actually!It did not take even a ten thousand votes! Just because it is old and it seems like a powerful drama it is not supposed to be a great unforgettable movie!Antonio (played by Lamberto Maggiorani) is an unemployed guy during the depression in Italy following World War II. He finally pawns the family linen for a bicycle and gets a job hanging posters around the city. Until the day his bicycle is stolen everything seems back on track in his life but this unfortunate event thwarts his plans.The thing is that it has not even a great plot .I don't live in an environment where cinema is taken for granted as action,dumb martial arts or some stupid technology effect.I know what real drama is supposed to mean!and this one may look like a powerful drama at first look but the actor's performances are really bad.Lamberto Maggiorani cannot reflect the helplessness of a man whose only bicycle(his treasure) is stolen.The kid who plays the role of the son of this poor man is not good either. I just don't understand why it is even a classic neo-realist movie. It has nothing extraordinary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film just dragged on and on interminably. Even the simplest scenes, for example, when the father and son get caught in the rain while looking for the bicycle, are dragged out to longer than could be believed. What is the point, anyway? That bicycles get stolen and can't be found, sometimes? I could have told you that. Well, this is my first review, and apparently I have to write at least ten lines. That's a shame, actually -- I think that's probably why there aren't very many negative reviews here. Who wants to write a long review of a movie they hated? A lot of the reviews I've glanced at here, for "The Bicycle Thief", make a big deal about the amateur actors. Who cares if the actors are amateurs or not? As long as the acting is good, I think, I don't care if they are big names or not. BTW, the acting in this movie isn't one of my complaints.</fullReview>
