		<shortDescription>I had a very good time watching this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I had a very good time watching this movie, but it seems like I'm one of the few. I don't know why, but the voters on this website always seem to hate comedies if they aren't from the hand of some cult-director. Does a movie always have to be a great drama or an exciting thriller? Not if you ask me, but I'm only one of many over here of course.It's true, the movie is a little chaotic from time to time. It isn't an overproduced Hollywood movie that takes itself too serious and that's exactly where its charm is in it for me. I loved to see Brad Pitt as the clumsy criminal who always is able to do something wrong. The same for Julia Roberts as his hysterical girlfriend and James Gandolfini as the gay hit man who has kidnapped her. I know, it's not done to say that you liked to see Julia Roberts play a certain role and Brad Pitt can never be good as a comical actor... Well, perhaps it is time for some people to broaden their minds. Don't believe what everybody says, watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. I liked it and I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chaotic, messy but brilliant commentary on relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm genuinely surprised at the number of people who disliked this movie. Perhaps because it was a bit disjointed, chaotic, uneven, unpredictable and even incoherent at times. And that's just why I loved it. It's life. Yes, it's the crazy, seedy, shady lives of these people (the main characters being Pitt's and Roberts' characters), but at least it's honest... and darned funny. I thought the self-deprecating jabs at how most Gringos view Mexico/Mexicans were priceless. Raul!! The grainy flashbacks had my sides splitting.People, this is a classic melodrama told in today's yucky, dirty, gritty, ugly times. A beautiful (if you look closely) story that doesn't take it self seriously at all. This is anything but formula Hollywood hype. It is a genius inside-joke that sandbagged most of the people hoping to come out and see a Pitt/Roberts version of Sleeping in Seattle or some similar chick-flick dreck.When is enough enough? Never.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Comedy From Gore Verbinski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple working on the give-and-take aspects of their relationship, an exquisitely crafted antique pistol with something of a diverse history and some questions concerning who is working for whom, all figure prominently in `The Mexican,' a black comedy directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. Jerry Welbach (Pitt), a somewhat less than astute young fellow in thrall to a criminal currently incarcerated, is given a seemingly simply assignment: He is to go to Mexico, where he will rendezvous at a bar in a small town, at which time he will take possession of an invaluable hand-made pistol; he will then transport the item to the States and deliver it to his boss. But there's a problem; his girlfriend, Samantha (Roberts) expects to go to Las Vegas at the same time, and their plans were already made and set in stone. So what is a guy to do? After Sam throws him out of their apartment and Jerry tries to explain-- in a memorable scene with her on the second story balcony, he on the ground looking up-- that if he doesn't do this job they will, well, KILL him, it doesn't make any difference. After all, their trip to Vegas had already been planned, and he promised it would happen. Talk about a guy between a rock and a hard place. And it's only the beginning of a dark comedy of errors and circumstances that ultimately involves them with some double dealings and brings them into contact with a psychotic killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini). Director Verbinski lends a nice touch to the movie, eliciting noteworthy performances from his actors and establishing early on his method of using specific landmarks-- a traffic signal and a cross-roads in the middle of nowhere, for example-- that give context and definition to what is happening, sometimes off-screen (as in the opening scene, when you only `hear' a traffic accident that becomes a pivotal part of the story). He avoids slapstick and plays up the natural, subtle humor that drives the film. The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is clever and witty (`You ?Forrest Gumped' your way through this...') and often very droll. And he maintains a pace and develops an atmosphere in which the unexpected can be expected that keeps it all moving along nicely and right on track. And there's a politically incorrect sensibility to the movie that is refreshing to see; in real life certain situations and cultures that are foreign to us are often viewed in stereotypical terms, so there is no reason to portray it otherwise in a film, especially when care has been taken to present it in an inoffensive manner, as it is here. Taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, Roberts nevertheless creates a lively character with Sam, imbuing her with plenty of spunk and, of course, that trademark smile. It's not a part that calls for a lot of depth, but she makes Sam likable and fun to watch, and she makes her banter with Jerry and Leroy credible and engaging. Credit goes to Pitt, as well, for making the most of what is actually a leading man/character role; Jerry isn't the sharpest tool in the shed and he may be easily distracted, but-- like Sam-- he's not without some natural charm that makes him quite personable and interesting. And there is a chemistry between the two that makes their relationship believable, especially when the sparks are flying. Gandolfini, meanwhile, not to be outdone by his charismatic co-stars, makes an indelible mark as the sensitive, psychotic killer who turns out to be something of an enigma. The supporting cast includes Bob Balaban (Nalin), David Krumholtz (Beck), Luis Felipe Tovar (Luis) and Gene Hackman (Margolis). A lively romp that takes some unexpected turns, `The Mexican' has a dark side, but manages to remain uplifting and thoroughly entertaining. There's a natural flow to the film and the laughs, generated by both the situations and the characters, are never forced but prompted, rather, by the spontaneity of it all. It's a movie that never pretends to be anything other than what it is, which is pure entertainment. It'll leave you with a smile on your face, some chuckles and some great lines to quote. And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprising delight; good comic performances, romantic nuggets, good sense of adventure. *** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MEXICAN / (2001) *** (out of fourThe title of Gore Verbinski's new romantic comedy adventure refers to the name of an extraordinarily valuable but cursed pistol possessed by a young man living in urban Mexico. Brad Pitt stars as Jerry Welbach, an errand boy forced to work for a local mob boss (Bob Balanban) after accidentally causing a powerful kingpin named Margolis (Gene Hackman) to be sent to jail. His "last" job is to go to Mexico and retrieve "The Mexican" and its beholder. Jerry's spiteful girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), wants Jerry to keep his promise about traveling to Las Vegas with her, but she does not realize that he can either accomplish this task or be killed. Since Samantha is such an understanding lover, she packs her bags and heads to Vegas alone, dumping her "selfish" long time boyfriend. Unfortunately for her, she is in the middle of a complicated situation whether she likes it or not. While traveling to her destination, Samantha is almost killed by a hitman (Sherman Augustus), but saved by another cold-blooded killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who has been assigned to kidnap her just in case Jerry gets any deceptive ideas while on his journey.Once in Mexico, Jerry locates the person and the pistol, but things go terribly wrong when the man is accidentally killed and several locals steal his transportation. Becoming suspicious, Jerry's accomplice, Ted (J.K. Simmons), is sent to find Jerry and declare the rising stakes at hand. Meanwhile, Samantha and Leroy become emotionally candid and share useful information of their past experiences involving love. While Leroy is a homosexual, he still lusts for romantic fulfillment, as the sentimental killer gives Samantha some advice of her own."The Mexican" is not really a romantic comedy like many audiences will expect; it is a somewhat coarse, violent adventure with undertones dealing with forgiveness and the strength of love. Actually, the relationship between the characters of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts is quite trite. Except for the third act, whenever on screen together, the two characters do nothing but bitterly argue and fight. The performances keep the romance alive; clearly Pitt and Roberts are the right choices for the parts. Brad Pitt progresses into a somewhat comedic role, and he often struggles with it. But I certainly thought his performance was funny. He gives his character the perfect amount of charm and sweetness. Julia Roberts is a little annoying but puts an effective edge in her character. We actually end up caring about both of their fates.There are a lot of little things to like in "The Mexican" like the scenes in a Mexican bar, shuttered with a dark atmosphere and authentic cinematography by Dariusz Wolski; dim lights give the rooms a greenish tint, creating a realistic and believable mood for the scenes. The soundtrack furnishes the movie with a genuine zest. A lot of the dialogue is witty and smart, with scenes that are well-written, often funny, and keep our attention. The comedic elements keep the movie interesting and fresh. The film does an excellent job with informing us about the history of the pistol and the plot's complications are curiously intriguing. Leroy's homosexuality introduces relationship issues that give his character depth. Although often bloody and shockingly profane, "The Mexican" is not mean-spirited or nasty-but enlightening and whimsical.The film is directed by Gore Verbinski, who also provided us with fast-paced entertainment in the 1997 family comedy "MouseHunt." "The Mexican" is much different from that film, but still has the energy and stride to keep us engrossed. Although not what many people will expect, I found "The Mexican" to be a surprising delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why am I the only one who liked it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I admit it. I'm a Julia fan. But before I saw this movie I'd heard so much about it being terrible that I had incredibly low expectations - so I guess I was going in to see it from a different angle to most people.I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I actually saw 'Mouse Hunt' or whatever it's called once on TV, didn't think too much of it, and I was hoping that 'The Mexican' would be different. Luckily, it was.Brad Pitt gives a sweet performance as Jerry, the accident prone hero, but the best part of the movie is the chemistry between Julia Roberts as Sam and James Gandolfini as Leroy - an unlikely relationship between a kidnapper and a kidnappee (is that a word?). I'd advise people to see this movie with an open mind. If you expect miracles you'll probably be disappointed. But I actually did really like it.Oh, and it made me cry. Four times. How embarrassing is that? Maybe I'm getting my period or something.</fullReview>

A young man (Pitt) has to go to Mexico and retrieve an antique pistol for a mobster, much to the chagrin of his girlfriend (Roberts). Pitt encounters a lot of snags and hang ups trying to complete the task, and unknowingly, his girlfriend is being held as insurance until he finishes the job. Worth seeing! B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere between cute romcom, gritty crime drama, road movie &amp; dark comedy is "The Mexican"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take "All About Steve" (cute dysfunctional romcom), toss in "3 Days in the Valley" (gritty crime drama), a little bit of "Silver Streak" (roadcom) and a hint of "Deathtrap" or possibly "Fargo" (dark comedy), then whip them all mercilessly with an eggbeater until it's unrecognizable, bake at 425 degrees for 2 hrs 3 mins, and there you have "The Mexican".If you enjoyed all the films I mentioned above, you'll like this. It's polished, as any Hollywood flick with Brad Pitt &amp; Julia Roberts would be, but it's quirky and odd enough to set itself apart from the others. The story is about a lovable loser (Brad Pitt) and his crazy therapy-inducing girlfriend (Julia Roberts) who end up trapped in a bloody battle to get a cursed gun known as "The Mexican". The plot has plenty of twists &amp; turns to keep you entertained on the surface. But the real story is about unlikely relationships: not just Brad &amp; Julia's bipolar romance but also unlikely friendships &amp; loyalties that spring up between kidnappers &amp; kidnappees, assassins &amp; victims, American profiteers &amp; Mexican defenders... like a good Clint Eastwood movie ("The Unforgiven", "Gran Turino"), the point is that it's easy to apply labels, but how often do you get a good look at what's underneath?I mentioned that this is a dark comedy, and indeed there are about half a dozen killings. What makes it different from, say Pulp Fiction or Heathers, is that the film doesn't gloss over the deaths with comedic gags. That's where this film is unusual... It has a place for comedy, and it has a place for tragedy. It doesn't really mix the two. Thus you may find your emotions wrenched around a bit, and that may be disorienting to some viewers. But if you're ready for a wild ride (exactly what this movie claims to be), you'll love it. And it has a cool dog in it too.Other good movies in the same genre include "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith" (Brad Pitt &amp; Angelina Jolie), the hilarious "My Cousin Vinny" (Joe Pesci, Marisa Tomei) and the classic "Foul Play" (Chevy Chase &amp; Goldie Hawn).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see how some people wouldn't like the movie. It didn't have alot to say about the world. It didn't inspire you to go out and do great things. It wasn't even extremely funny. but I still liked it. I have become accustomed to Hollywood, and their mindless stupid little movies. At least this one had better cinematography. Perhaps it was a bit overcast, and although it might seem like the typical teenager flick actor would fit the part better, that would have turned the movie into just another money making teeny bopper disaster. But as it is the two biggest stars in HOllywood made this movie, and that alone made it a pretty interesting movie. I'm one of those people who like Julia Roberts. I have heard many complaints about her as an actress, but she still tops my list of favorites. SO maybe I'm a bit biased towards the film, but i still thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being quite a harsh critic myself, I was surprised to see how badly recieved this film was. Admittably the film tended to drag a little length and was missing something to make it a little more entertaining.But the film has some interesting characters, situations, and scenery to make this film highly watchable. Pitt and Roberts are good, but have put in much better performances elsewhere. And spend the majority of the film apart. I suspect the main criticisms of this film are mainly to do with high expectations: in having Pitt, Roberts and the Sopranos guy in. But in summary, an alright film - but nothing special.</fullReview>

She was either yelling at Pitt all the time or gushing over a hit-man who admitted he was gay, and both routines wore thin. She thought (being gay) that was just the greatest thing and really overdid it. Overall, if you modified Roberts' character into someone less abrasive this might have been a "keeper."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stereotypes Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have liked to have seen the Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts characters arrive to cosmopolitan, beautiful Mexico City with its tree lined avenues that resemble Paris, and to have seen them expelled from one of its exclusive restaurants or hotels for being so vulgar and lower class. I would have liked to see them blunder at a party in the upper class Chapultepec Heights or Polanco neighborhoods among blond Mexican socialites and to have gone stark, staring mad when seeing the luxury and refinement said Mexicans live in.The same applies for other movies such as Fools Rush In and My Family which have such a myopic, erroneous vision of Mexico. American audiences, how would you feel if all movies made about the United States dealt with trailer parks, Appalachian coves and ghettos? Ponder that there are many Mexicans who feel the same. If the prosperous Mexico is a hidden Mexico, please Hollywood producers, discover it. It is infinitely interesting as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deus ex machina saves the day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a bit too self-consciously comic for its own good. Perhaps it can be chalked up to magical realism? There are more than a few loose ends by the end of the film and one never really knows where the story is going. Brad Pitt plays a character who is a kind of walking illustration of Murphy's law. The two hit men Leroy and the one played by Gandolfini were confusing enough. We are made to care about the Gandolfini character and then then he turns back into a villain long enough to be killed. Deus ex machina was was working overtime with this one. In reality both Julia and Brad would have been dead meat long before and no crime boss is going to forgive you for having been in the presence of his "son" when he somehow dies from a stray bullet, even if it wasn't strictly your fault.In short, this is an ideal date flick with enough violence to satisfy the guys and enough sweetness to satisfy most chicks, and insubstantial enough to be forgotten 5 minutes after it ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More money than sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how with some movies, you wonder why and how they ever got made? This little stinker epitomises that question.What a formula. Take two of the hottest (and most expensive) stars of the era and immerse them in a thin plot. Write a screenplay that beats the wispy plot into something that no one could believe in, least of all the actors (and it shows), while ensuring that there are no opportunities for them to use their skills. Dare to portray Mexicans as a bunch of bumbling hicks, and add some commonly used south-of-the border spices - superstition and miracle. Throw in three small chuckles and call it a comedy (King Lear has more). Make sure there is none of the romance that fans of your big stars crave, and would be happy to pay to watch time and time again. Oh, and make it unnecessarily long - if you're boring your audience you might as well bore them rigid.For this film to be made at all, someone had to be returning a serious favour or sleeping with someone. If they'd filmed that, it would possibly have made better entertainment. The sleeping, that is.</fullReview>

The writers should be ashamed. Someone decided to insert a sub-plot about a gay hit-man (Gandolfini) which not only doesn't work, but ruins the rest of the movie. Stupid.

		<fullReview>The Mexican had potential, i've have no doubt about that; Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and James Gandolfini are all more than capable performers, and have proved it over time. The script is really clever and slick, as are the fundamental elements of the story, but in trying to summarise this film; the word dull just kept springing to mind. I can't blame the performances of any of the cast, in fact some of the acing was excellent; and the dialogue is both witty and strong. The problem here is the work of Gore Verbinski, he simply failed to capture the necessary imagery to carry the story or its characters and he failed to create the right moods or feelings in the critical scenes. It's like he didn't read the script or something, i'm glad his work improved though.5/10 This one just didn't seem to work for me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luckless Brad Pitt can't seem to work off a debt that he owes crime boss Gene Hackman in an unbilled role. Four years earlier he got into a fender bender with Hackman right at the moment that Hackman was carrying someone in the trunk of his car. Only because it was a live someone, Hackman got off with a few years in the joint, but he makes sure Pitt pays and pays for that fender bender.His last assignment seems simple enough go to Mexico and find a bring back an antique pistol, a real piece of craftsmanship that several legends have been told about. But even that last assignment is the last straw for his girlfriend Julia Roberts. She gives him the old heave ho as he leaves for Mexico.But just to make sure Pitt follows through, Roberts is kidnapped and held hostage by James Gandolfini, a gay hit man with whom she bonds rather strangely with. Of course you don't expect things to go smoothly for Pitt. The Mexican is one of those murphy's law films, if anything can go wrong it does go wrong. The Mexican is a film that was made more than likely for no other reason than let's team Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and get some real box office out of it. They seem to work well together, but this very quirky film just doesn't quite jell. Possibly it should have been played more as an out and out comedy than it was. James Gandolfini comes out best in this film.Still fans of Pitt, Roberts, and the Sopranos might like it. Although if you go in expecting to see Tony Sooprano, fuggedaboutit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit too random for my liking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSFor once let's cut straight into this. I'm not an enourmous fan of this film. I'd always avoided it expecting some random romantic comedy staring Pitt &amp; Roberts. It wasn't what I expected, but that still doesn't make it particularly good.In "The Mexican", Brad Pitt plays Jerry Welbach, a man who made one dodgy driving error and ended up paying for it for years after. In effect sentenced to work for the man who he accidently got arrested, Jerry starts this film being sent on his final case to go to Mexico and retrieve an ancient beautiful gun called "The Mexican". Jerry experiences countless screw ups in what sounds like it should be an easy job, and this isn't helped by the fact that his beloved girlfriend Sam Barzel (Roberts) is angry with him and driving around with her kidnapper, a homosexual hitman, played by James Gandolfini.Ok, sounds like a simple enough plot, some have described it as too thin, but personally I don't always have a problem with thin plots. I do have a problem however when the plot is at times confusing and irritating though. Pitt is good as Jerry, although I admit to prefering him in countless other films, Gandolfini is the star of the show, and Roberts is just plain infuriating. Actors aside though, the background of the Gun is random and a bit too obscure for my liking, the portrayal of Mexicans seems slightly stereotypical, the humour is limited and ultimately something just doesn't feel right about this film.It's hard to know what to say about "The Mexican". To create a film and feature two of Hollywood's biggest stars was a good idea. Ultimately though, for all it's few good points, this film contains one too many flaws. I won't say to avoid it, as it's probably more suited to other people's pallets. I would suggest however that you do like I did and only watch it on television rather than pay money for it. They could have done so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you combine two of Hollywood's most famous sex symbols, the director of "Pirates of the Caribbean" and Mexico? Apparently, an overlong, boring mix of comedy, romance and violence -- which, in this case, is a rather lackluster result considering the potential.Jerry (Brad Pitt) is one of the most inept criminals in history. Five years ago he crashed into the back of a crime lord's car and, as a result, found himself working off the accident by running errands. Jerry's last retrieval before retirement involves skipping the border into Mexico, finding a rare and beautifully crafted pistol (The Mexican), returning it to Margolese (Gene Hackman) and walking away from everything happily. But Jerry's girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), is tired of Jerry's continual lying and criminal feats, so she dumps him and heads for Las Vegas.After arriving in Mexico unscathed, Jerry soon finds himself at the wrath of thugs, murderers and hit men intent on stealing The Mexican from him. Meanwhile, Samantha finds herself taken hostage by a gay hit man with a heart named Leroy (James Gandolfini of "Get Shorty" and TV's "The Sopranos"), who -- by following all of the Hollywood cliches -- is an amiable, likable guy who wouldn't harm a fly.The advertising for "The Mexican" had it all wrong. The studios advertised it as a sweet, funny comedy starring two of Hollywood's biggest stars. The major cop-out is that Pitt and Roberts share most of the film far apart from each other -- which isn't a huge problem anyway, as it provides a pleasant twist on the repetitive buddy formula. But the movie's twisting, turning, violent, harsh style soon grows weary -- especially as the second hour draws nearer. The end almost redeems the rest of the film, but not quite."The Mexican" is primarily interested in doing things that have already been done before, such as culture clashing. Take, for instance, the scene where Jerry spends a good minute or so trying to tell a band of traveling hombres that he needs a ride to the nearest town. Somehow, Jerry confuses "carro" for "deniro" and the driver's eyes suddenly light up. "Robert De Niro?" he asks with a big gap-toothed grin. Another joke that indicates foreign countries know more about Hollywood than actual language. Har-har. It'd be funny if it hadn't been done before.If you're looking for something harsh, "The Mexican" may very well be too sweet. And vice versa. The movie is too wish-washy -- sometimes it wants to be the next gritty comedy ("Trainspotting") and sometimes it's aiming for cute gimmicks and completely silly characters.And then, even worse than trying jokes and failing, "The Mexican" never even strives to give us funny moments. In that scene where Jerry tries to hail a ride to the next town, the punchline is never delivered. All road travel movies are about confusion, usually resulting in two people misunderstanding each other. What should have happened is this: Jerry has a hard time explaining to the Mexican driver that he wants a ride. Finally, they both understand each other, and Jerry thinks everything is OK, but soon finds himself being left in the dust by the car, which continues driving on. Because confusion is funny, and "The Mexican" never understands this. That is one of its most fundamental flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is a mess. After several years of independent films with bite, and some that actually made tons of money, the Hollywood machine finally gets in gear. Following their version of a formula, they pack it with box office draws. Try to cover all bases so that the largest possible audience will open it. So we have here `Pulp Fiction' meets `Way of the Gun' meets `Pretty Woman' meets `Romancing the Stone.' It is supposed to be a sweet romantic, character-driven, fate-driven, edgy, funny situation/chase movie, It skittles about, doing well with none of these.I think the script had possibilities. Pitt and Gandolfini have the stuff. Roberts is wallpaper, but could have held up the role of shrewish neurotic. The problem is with the vision of the director. There is none. And thence to the editing, which lacks snap.The director uses excessive closeups without understanding closein acting. This is just mere exploitation of famous smiles.The only interesting element is an episode where Gandolfini discusses his new relationship. This is fine stuff, but is quickly thrown away as other elements of the story intrude. Pitt as always gets my appreciation for the sheer danger of the risks he takes. This time, the film is worthless, but one can really relate to how much he exposes. He is the Janis Joplin of acting today, and I hope he doesn't end up as a fat Brando.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply, the worst movie I've seen all year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies, I guess that some people love and most people hate. I am the latter of the two people. The trailers do this film no justice at all since they imply that it will be another 'Pulp Fiction' type movie with stylish characters, witty dialogue, dark humor and over the top violence played for sinful pleasures and shock value. This film contains the last of these promises, and that's about it.My roommate and his girlfriend, who love this movie made me watch it one night. Being a huge movie buff, and a fan of Brad Pitt, I had incredible expectations for this flick, but they were all shot down, beginning with Julia Roberts' annoying scene where she tosses all of Brad Pitt's stuff out a window in a fit of rage. As I sat there watching this film, the other couple in the room kept laughing hysterically at the jokes and slapstick in this film. Needless to say, I sat bewildered as to how anyone can think this movie is funny, let alone enjoyable. Now, I am one of those people who enjoy most movies with over the top silly humor like Monty Python, Road Trip or Deuce Bigalow, and I love to laugh for the simple point of laughing, even if the material isn't exactly up to Python brilliance, but how can someone think that "I need a ride-o in your truck-o to the el town-o" is the least bit funny? There's a fine line between juvenile humor (which even the most serious of us enjoy, even though they don't admit it) and a pathetic attempt at juvenile humor (Enter "The Mexican"). Trust me, this is coming from a guy who finds humor in almost anything. This movie had me sitting there, hoping that something entertaining would happen. No such luck here.With a film with Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini (and though I don't like her, Julia Roberts) one would think that the movie would be good, if not great. But once again, Hollywood proves that even big budget stars 'owe favors' to producers from time to time (In other words, if the script is bad, the 'bigger' the movie, the harder it will fall). Pitt is an incredibly annoying and incompetent wannabee gangster who tries to provide humor for the film, but fails miserably in perhaps his most embarrassing performance to date. James Gandolfini was probably the best part of this film, though not saying much as the hitman with hidden secrets. Julia Roberts made me want to take the television and throw it out the window, she played the most annoying character I have seen in quite some time. The acting and the script are so awful, it will bother you for a while afterwards and leave a bad taste in your mouth. It's one of those films that tries too hard to be good, and wants you to want it to be good or hopes that the viewer will be incompetent enough to think it's good as well thinking that big budget stars and a misleading trailer will make up for a cheesy plot, bad acting, a horrible script and bad direction. Come on guys, believe it or not people are not stupid. All in all, this is a flick that is a total waste of time. This movie sucks so bad, it draws all the air out of the room and then closes all of the walls around you until you suffocate from the suckage, as well as the large quantity of cr@p that is hurled at you from your television set. I have said this for maybe three or four movies in my life, but this film is pure torture to watch, it provides no entertainment, and leaves you upset afterwards, after you were looking forward to a nice evening at home with a fun movie. I rarely say this on IMDB, but AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!! 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three words for you on this movie: Save Your Money. That is, unless you consider nine bucks for a ticket to be money well-spent for the privilege of taking a nap on those oh-so-comfy theatre seats. Cause you're sure not paying for much else.After seeing The Mexican, I'm at a loss to explain why this movie needed to be over two and a quarter hours long. Nothing ever happens! I kept waiting for some humour, or exciting action, or romance, or, well . . . basically anything. Hell, I woulda taken a UFO hitting Julia Roberts on the head and knocking her out. At least that might have woken me up.The elements were in place. Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and the supremely talented and wasted James Gandolfini anchor the cast. There's a storyline involving some neurotic characters, the mob, guns, Mexico, and a kidnapping-hostage situation. There's material, here, people. Why they couldn't make it go anywhere is beyond me.Julia Roberts' character becomes friends with her kidnapper. Uh, yeah, that's original. Brad Pitt's character has trouble speaking Spanish in Mexico. So what? And would someone care to explain to me the purpose of putting in those reel-style clips about the legend of the pistol? Were they supposed to be funny? Scary? Sad? Either this movie was so brilliant that it went way above my head, or it was just plain dumb. I'm gonna bet on option number two.There was one good line in the movie: "Guns don't kill people, postal workers kill people". There, now that you've read it, I just did you a gigantic favour, cause there's no other reason to go see this disaster they call a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long, too boring and only Gandolfini is actually acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I like Gore Verbinski, I cannot say that this is a good movie. It's way too long and it never offers us some breathtaking story that would keep me on the edge of seat. Actually I think this is the weakest movie Verbinski has done. Not that his direction is bad, it's mainly because of poor script that fails to provide really good black comedy and it's because, I must say, bad casting. Why? Well I really respect Brad Pitt's work. He's not some handsome guy who is here only because of his looks. He knows how to act and he proved that many times ("Kalifornia", "Se7en", "Twelve Monkeys", "Fight Club", "Snatch") but this is movie where he just couldn't fit in. His colleague Julia Roberts is also working this movie off, so the only person who's actually acting is James Gandolfini. Gandolfini is very good in his role; emotional, vulnerable but still strong and convincing. I forgot one thing about Pitt &amp; Roberts: I just cannot put two of them together as a pair. Although we have here some universal messages about love, hit-man who's very emotional (strange for hit-man even though he's gay) and cameo role from great Gene Hackman; this is really movie that you can easily skip unless you're in love with Brad Pitt or you just want to watch a movie without innovative story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Names Aren't Always Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface this might appear to be a relatively entertaining film since it stars two big names , but stop to consider the careers of both Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt . Roberts was unbelievably lucky to have won the Oscar for ERIN BROCKOVICH while Pitt is obviously a film star due to his sexy boy looks . You're right i'm slightly jealous of Pitt's physique and his face and even more jealous still that he's made a massively successful career out of it and like everything else he's appeared in THE Mexican shows Pitt is not much of an actor The plot revolves around gangster Jerry Walbach being sent down to Mexico by the mob to collect an antique firearm called " The Mexican " and while he's away his girlfriend Samantha is kidnapped by a hit-man called Winston Baldry who also wants to get his hands on The Mexican . I'm not sure if the premise would have allowed for many laughs but what's obvious on screen is that Roberts and Pitt try and milk the humour for all it's worth . This is a mistake because the comedy should come out of the situations the characters find themselves in not by Roberts and Pitt mugging for the camera , shouting or waving their arms about trying to convince the audience that this is a funny film . Even worse is the casting of James Gandolfini as Winston since he's written as a gay version of Tony Soprano , effectively we've got Gandolfini playing a distractingly similar role that he's best known for . Thankfully we don't see JK Simmons playing the head of The Ayran Brotherhood but his character is such a wimp I found myself wishing he'd say something like " From now on Jerry your ass belongs to me " while craving a swastika onto his victim's flesh . It's probably also a mistake to have Gene Hackman in here since his scene seems to have been written just so we'd get a cameo from a living legend . Anything that prolongs the running time of this movie receives harsh judgement from me THE Mexican is a comedy that I found to be far from entertaining . The casting of such big names must have cost a lot of money and more time and attention should have been taken with the script and you do get the irritating feeling that the producers thought having a couple of big names in the movie everything would have taken care of itself . Obviously it didn't . Some people on the message boards have complained that this is the worst movie ever when in fact it's not even the worst movie Brad Pitt has appeared in , but unless you're a die hard fan of either Roberts or Pitt there's not much point in seeing this amigo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard a lot of criticism (sp?) on this movie for various reasons. I have to say that I agree to pretty much every one. The plot is sketchy and incoherent at times, it crosses too many genres, etc. etc. The characters don't fit together right, but that's alright. For me all the flaws are what makes me want to watch The Mexican. For some reason I love this flick, even though I don't really know anyone else who cares for it! Why do I like this movie? I haven't figured that out yet, but I believe it's because I never tried to read that much into it, just sat back and took the trip. It will never make my top 10, but that doesn't mean its not worth repeated viewings. If you haven't seen it, give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What on earth is this dreck?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lovable" loser Brad Pitt is forced by gangsters to head south of the border to retrieve a cursed antique gun known as "The Mexican," while hit-man James Gandolfini kidnaps Pitt's girlfriend Julia Roberts for insurance.The Mexican, some unholy combination of romantic comedy, edgy violence, and Quentin Tarantino-esque tomfoolery succeeds at none of these things, despite featuring Pitt and Roberts at the height of their popularity. In fact, the film is so tonally uneven, muddled and unpleasant to watch that it is impossible to ascertain what attracted these performers to it.Director Gore Verbinski has neither the light touch or off-beat flare to make anything we see take flight...unless it is the viewer from the theater. Full disclosure, I nearly made it to the end of this turkey before my party finally threw in the towel and left.Much of the problem with the film is that it seems to believe that we have some sympathy for the Pitt and Roberts characters and are rooting for them to safely be reunited. Alas, we don't. When we first meet them, Pitt is a pathetic pantywaist being bullied by his mob acquaintances and Roberts, and Roberts is light years beyond shrill in an atypically charmless performance. Their opening scenes are basically Roberts shrieking at Pitt like a nagging fishwife and Pitt stomping around in a petulant put-upon snit. We are glad when they separate (although even singularly they are unpleasant company) and actually do NOT wish for them to reunite safely. Your film has a major problem when the central couple is so off-putting that you hope they never reunite.Worse, the film's badly directed incidences of pseudo-slapstick give way to very brutal (and very real) passages of unwelcome violence that seem to come from another film entirely.The passages with Roberts and Gandolfini are near excruciating because she simply won't shut up and keeps yammering. Gandolfini, The Sopranos over-feted one-trick-pony, pretty much plays Tony Soprano for the umpteenth time...only this time, he is gay. Isn't that hilarious? A gay hit-man with all the mannerisms of Tony Soprano. That is about as far as the ingenuity in this mess goes. And truthfully, once you see what the film has in store for Gandolfini and the hapless romantic foil that Roberts hooks him up with, it especially feels like a waste of time.Truthfully, this is one of the most aggravating, unpleasant and appalling films to come down the pike in decades. It succeeds at nothing it attempts and manages to tarnish the careers of its stars in the process. I hope that both Pitt and Roberts have paid back on whatever bet they lost because I cannot imagine any other reason for their inclusion in this debacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been an adult Bob Hope and Lucille Ball movie. It was as fractured as Pulp Fiction but without any of the reality. If it was intended to be a tongue in cheek spoof, that much was accomplished. I don't remember if the actual age of the pistol was mentioned but it was obviously a cap and ball pistol. No explanation as to why a pistol that old and treasured as an heirloom, was loaded. Julia Roberts pulled the trigger and "bang", the bad guy is hit in the thorax at point blank but, in typical Hollywood fashion, stands around just looking shocked. In real life he would have dropped 1/10th of a second after being shot. That is just childish.James Gandolfini's talent was not just wasted, it was thrown away. He played a great part for nothing. Hackman's character could have been cut out of cardboard. He looked like he was thinking, "Why the hell did I agree to do this?" Might be easier to endure with an occasional shot of tequila and a Dos Equis chaser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome little crime dramedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore Verninski's The Mexican is somewhat of an oddity. Verbinski is known for massive scale Hollywood epics, and this one has trappings of such a film, but instead takes an off kilter, unpredictably strange approach, through committed, idiosyncratic writing, and a dense, comic narrative that unfolds in such an odd manner you can't help but get invested in. Brad Pitt is a sheepish screw up as Jerry, a hapless low level gangster underling who is tasked with returning a priceless Mexican antique pistol to his bosses. The pistol, embedded in a tragic legend and believed to hold a curse, certainly seems to be troublesome McGuffin for our hero. Between his hapless ineptitude and the curse, he's led on madcap chase through the southern states and across the border to find the relic, transport it, and do right by his shady employers, who may just have it out to end him if he messes up one more time. Pitt, often the assured, confident leading man, has a Scrappy Doo esque, dishevelled side to his talents, which he uses to great effect here, laying a guy just this side of dumb, who is adorably trying to extricate himself from his situation. Julia Roberts plays his neurotic girlfriend Samantha, who doesn't approve of his line of work, and follows him on his looney odyssey, always one step behind. She crosses paths with a no nonsense hit-man played by James Gandolfini, giving the best performance of the film. His character, Winston Baldry, initially kidnaps Samantha, and gradually befriends her, the two of them forming a touching bond that provides the poignant moments of the film, rays of grounded seriousness in an otherwise glib enterprise. J.K. Simmons is priceless as an aloof, eccentric member of Pitt's organization, Bob Balaban is the unassuming yet scary ringleader, and there's a wonderful surprise cameo from an A lister near the end that I won't spoil. This is the type of film where the old adage "don't judge a book by its cover" comes into play. The cover suggests a light bit of romantic intrigue that focuses on the chemistry of its two star leads. Instead, they are separated for a majority of the film, and we are treated to a tongue in cheek, oddball romp with moments of surreal levity, real emotional beats that feel earned, and a slick, almost Elmore Leonard style story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mexican (2001): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Cast: Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, James Gandolfini, Bob Balaban, Gene Hackman: The running joke is the constant misinterpretation of a story of a gun called the Mexican and those who fired it. Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts have broken up after she learns that his life of crime isn't over. He is assigned to travel to Mexico to obtain the legendary gun but everything goes wrong. Interesting setup becomes uneven and pointlessly violent. Director Gore Verbinski handles the humour and action well but the screenplay is a mess. This is a set up from his previous junk Mouse Hunt. Pitt never seems to be in the same movie as he is constantly messing up and proving to be the screw up Roberts claimed that he was when she tossed his clothes out the window in the opening. Roberts is in better form due to her kidnap and amusing dealings with her captor. Why we are suppose to care if she and Pitt get back together is beyond me. James Gandolfini delivers the best performance as a gay hit-man sent to kidnap Roberts and then learning a bit about himself and forced to soul search. Bob Balaban also makes an appearance in cardboard fashion. Gene Hackman is a great actor and he appears briefly in a key scene and steals the moment. Well crafted film about misinterpreted information as stories become warped through each passing voice that delivers it. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's now 2015 and I just watched this for the first time. I was dubious because of the rating. But, wow, this is a great movie! I watched it again a week later with my wife, and it got even better.I like an intellectual film. One that resonates with modern angst and twists around the classic tropes. I also like unexpected love stories. This film has both.This is two hours long with lots of characters and fairly complex plot. If you think it makes no sense (like some reviewers here), try a little harder. It all ties together, but it doesn't condescend to make it bleeding obvious.By far, Gandofini is my favorite. His character is so passionate and conflicted. So human. So tragic. I really enjoyed his conversations with Sam. They are so honest. Made me cry.My only complaint is casting Julia Roberts as Sam. Good actress, bad casting. Sam is a 19 year old, silly whimsical romantic girl. But Julia is a 30+ mature woman. Such as when she says "Are you going to rape me?" if she were 19 it would be funny, but from Julia it sounds insane. A 30 year old woman doesn't think like that. Also when she answers the "when is it enough?" question on the curb. It seems weird coming from a 30 year old woman.Likewise Brad is a bit too old for his part, but it is less distracting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am split about how to review this movie, The Mexican. On one hand, the movie has a very cheesy plot and the script is one of the most clumsily- written scripts in recent memory. On the other hand, I thoroughly had a good time watching this film as I laughed quite often and found the banter between Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt to be amusing. I also liked the the use of the dog in the film and found him quite endearing. That being said, there is no way to get over the fact about how bad this film is script-wise. Gore Verbinksi's film is about a man named Jerry who is ordered by the mob to travel to Mexico and bring across the border an ancient gun. If he does not comply, he will suffer the consequences. However, Jerry has a girlfriend who wants him to cut ties with the mafia and lead a normal life. There is no denying that the film has a talented cast. There is also no denying that the actors were not on their A-game. That being said, they seemed to be having fun as they were chewing the scenery. They were not awful by any means, buy simply not their best. As said before, Pitt and Roberts does plenty of bickering and it's rather amusing. James Gandolfini has a solid role as one of the mafia's hit men and Gene Hackman does feature an awesome cameo. Overall, The Mexican is a hit-or-miss sort of movie. There are some things that are unforgivable cinema sins and there are other things that are mildly enjoyable. The script is awful, but the actors do all they can to make the film bearable. It's funny at times and there is more action than I expected. A rather forgettable, but entertaining diversion. My Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mexican</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember the hoopla surrounding the "great pairing of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts" at the time of 2001 and the backlash when it was realized they shared such little screen time together. What I found (and many others) interesting was how James Gandolfini (RIP) takes the film right from them as a gay hit-man needing his boss (supposedly Gene Hackman's Margolese) to get a historical artifact found in a mine not long ago?a gun made by a poor gunsmith with a heart-shaped bullet chamber, called The Mexican. Sent to retrieve the gun is Pitt by the dour, double-crossing Bob Balaban for Hackman unaware (for a bit until he is privy to a conversation) that he is to be off'd by "always just trying to do his part and nothing more", JK Simmons (another extraordinary scene-stealing supporting character actor) once in Mexico after the mission is successful. What happens to Pitt along the way is one of those "you gotta be kidding me" journeys full of hard luck and difficulty. Roberts is kidnapped by Gandolfini as "leverage" so that Pitt will do as he is supposed to without any attempt to achieve financial gain for himself. What happens between Gandolfini and Roberts is actually the true heart and soul of the film because they learn a lot about themselves through the constant appraisal of her relationship with Pitt. In a second viewing of the film (the first was so agonizing I hadn't watched this in thirteen years), I realized that if Pitt and Roberts, considering the characters they are trapped in, had been on screen any longer than necessary, the experience would have been even more abrasive than it already turned out to be. Roberts can be so likable when sharing time with Gandolfini and an absolute pariah when with Pitt, I thought I was watching two different characters on screen. Pitt works the "aw shucks, I'm just trying to keep from being killed and get the gun to where it needs to go" part throughout, taking a lot of frustrating developments (that Balaban wanted him dead, that his car is stolen, that a cop takes the gun, that he must tolerate locals and their firecrackers, guns going off in the air, the unfortunate accidental death of Margolese' grandson thanks to the celebration that Pitt is annoyed by, a passport swap accident, interference in the mission of the gun) and holding onto his wits, even after Roberts seems to be okay and back with him. The constant bickering between Roberts and Pitt, seemingly presented as a charming humorous state of affairs in how they spend most of their time together, really gets old fast. Gandolfini's talk with Roberts before meeting Pitt about never giving up on love even when it appears enough is enough is probably one of the best (if it wasn't for Hackman's lone scene about the Mexican's importance) scenes in the film. The violence that does happen in the film is primarily just an example of the nature of Pitt's obligation to gangsters (he is a lousy driver and hit Margolese' car which was carrying a live body in the trunk, leading to Margolese' arrest!), and how it is bound to happen as the Mexican is a desirable artifact perhaps worth quite a pretty penny. Balaban deadpans in the same league as Bill Murray so his stone cold face doling out orders and insults gives him a great villain for the film here. A mixed bag, in my opinion, that could have been better if Pitt and Roberts been more compatible and less combative as a couple in the film. The gun's back story is amusingly presented in differing ways by each person who tells it to Pitt, not particularly knowledgeable in the gun's history but just wanting his situation to be over. Gandolfini and Roberts in the diner discussing his sexual orientation is sweet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tries too hard to be cool. Instead it mostly just seems silly, and dull.Initial plot set-up was fairly interesting and had potential. However, it quickly degenerated into inane farce and/or pointless sub-plots.Director Gore Verbinski (director of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, so you already know the movie is going to be more style than substance) seems intent on channeling Quentin Tarantino: cool quips and nonchalance while in the middle of incredible danger and violence. Instead, he misses the mark and the movie just feels lame. Leave the cool stuff to Tarantino, Mr Verbinski.Star-studded cast: Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, James Gandolfini, JK Simmons, Bob Balaban, Gene Hackman. They do their best but are hamstrung by the script and direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated film that turns fairly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10The Mexican is a film that although is never rated that highly, I felt it was kind of good and was enjoyable even with it's flaws that cropped up a lot. With an average acting performance and a basic script you'd be right if you didn't have much expectation going into this, but just give it a chance and it can fully enjoyed by all film fans. I personally felt it was Pretty Good and here below is why I, but many other didn't, felt that way.The story is slow and then kind of fast and fluxuate's between both varied pacing, the plot isn't all that exciting either but it makes for very watchable film and just give it a chance and you may be entertained by this. The film has about 50 scenes where you think it will end but it never does, frustrating yes but I did feel the film was worth watching, even after going through so many end parts to the movie.Brad Pitt is average in this and although he does nothing to harm the film necessarily he doesn't really ever take a firm hold on the piece. Julia Roberts and James Gandolfini work together well and although Roberts as with Pitt isn't at her best, Gandolfini show's off his talents with beautiful ease and although this film is unknown these days, Gandolfini was just brilliant. I didn't care much for support though which did harm the film with stale performances, luckily they aren't seen as much as the main cast at all.Gore Verbinski in the directing role does a job that is fairly good, but is not his best and knowing what he can sometimes do, he fails with this and the positives of the film are not down to him. I felt one part of the film that I personally loved was the setting with some camera shots being doubly beautiful due to location, one great example is where Pitt is crossing a crossroads and looking each way, great camera work with a great locality to match.The film is too long and stretches too much to be considered a straight good film, although it does a good job with the majority of the story, it just falters towards the end and as I said with the multiple possible endings it just can annoy you. The acting also as previously mentioned is poor all round and sometimes it feels like a slight comedy but just manages to avoid being funny as well. Not much more to say negativity way but if you see for yourself, I am sure you may find more bad things than I did.It is hard to say who will like this, people who enjoy fun adventures may enjoy this because it is quite fun, not a stable film by any stretch of the imagination but excitable all the same. Pitt fans won't like this too much as he doesn't get to well, act, and Roberts is the same and seems they were put together as the stars but never see each other in the story. Don't watch it if you don't want to watch a long film with little new to offer, but watch it in a good mood and it is enjoyable.Overall a 7/10, many many people give it lower but I really did feel it was Firmly Kind of Good and as I have said all the way through this review, the film is genuinely a fun one, with lots to offer too. Watch it as I say in a good mood because once you overlook the more serious parts of the film, the more light hearted parts become fun and can be enjoyed, given you open your mind a bit and stop thinking about this critically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes on a bit...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must have looked like a sure-fire winner on paper: two Hollywood A-listers and a TV star hot off the back of a hit TV series in a quirky comedy-thriller, but add into the mix a still-to-be proved director (who has admittedly gone on to better things) and a writer with a (short) history of lacklustre vehicles behind them and suddenly things don't look so rosy.Things start off well enough. When called upon, Brad Pitt can be an engaging comedy lead, and he fits the role of Jerry Welbach, a hapless gopher for the mob for whom even the simplest task snowballs into a convoluted task of epic proportions. Julia Roberts as his long-suffering girlfriend is less sympathetic, simply because most of her scenes with Jerry involve shouting very loudly at him. Gandolfini is a gay hit man who kidnaps Roberts as insurance to ensure Jerry brings back a special gun he has been sent to Mexico to collect. He and Roberts connect with a predictability that could probably be construed as an insult to straight hit men everywhere.So far so good. Things tick along quite nicely for a while, bu the problem is they keep on ticking and, like an unwound clock, things slowly start running down. Gandolfini's character is despatched too early in the film and leaves an indefinable gap in the narrative that is impossible to fill. It's OK to have a character serve as the emotional and moral sounding board of the principle characters, but when that is so obviously their sole purpose they stand out like a sore thumb.The film needs a good twenty minutes shaved from its running time and, paradoxically, sub-plots that could easily be excised without disrupting the narrative flow (such as it is) are easily identifiable. Maybe one day they'll make a director's cut that is shorter than the original...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mexican Is A Gun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julia Roberts typical face on the movie poster activates the prejudice, that this movie is just able to be a anti-art entertaining pink story for girls and girls, and it turns into a money machine with the cooperation of Brad 'The cinematic poker face' Pitt. But every scene in this movie has the taste of famous directors. It's something like the first monkey of Darwins evolution theory. The first monkey which follows Robert Rodriguez,Emir Kusturica and GORE VERBINSKI. Gore obviously directed this project with love and tequila. Another drunkard actor around the table is James Gandolfini. I guess that the Postsoprano Gandolfini will never act as a homosexual again because of Phil Leotardo. Applause for Gore,for the master of 'cliche' emotions J Roberts,for Pitt 'The Factotum',for Gandolfini 'The Breath' and especially for the cast in Mexico. The Mexican is not a cult,the Mexican is a gun. PS: Everything I write about James Gandolfini is dedicated to Tony Soprano.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heavily flawed, but nonetheless fun and enjoyable journey to nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie, flaws and all. It's a fun, albeit pointless story with some good funny dialogue, enough violence and gun play for the guys, romance for the girls, and entertaining, if not Oscar-worthy, performances from an excellent cast. I'll be honest, in spite of the pacing flaws and overall pointlessness, I really can't say I didn't enjoy the hell out of this movie because it delivers a little bit of everything.The story follows Jerry (Brad Pitt), a mob errand boy who has a knack for screwing things up, resulting in him always being in the mob's debt. He is ordered to fly to Mexico to pick up a priceless, legendary pistol known as "The Mexican," and bring it back to the states. Not quite comprehending the fact that his life depends on the assignment, Jerry's overly emotional girlfriend Samantha (Julia Roberts) isn't happy that he's blowing off their romantic trip to Vegas for it, and breaks up with him. Shortly after retrieving the pistol, Jerry manages to royally screw up everything, and as a result, the mob sends a hit man, Leroy (James Gandolfini) to take Samantha hostage until Jerry gets the gun back. Samantha and Leroy soon become good friends, and over the course of their separate adventures, Jerry and Samantha realize they still love each other.The first thing anybody should know about this before they watch it is that it isn't really a romantic comedy. The majority of the comedy is in the first thirty minutes, and Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts don't spend nearly as much time on screen together as the misleading ads suggested. The film is not as much of a romantic comedy as it is a messy mixture of comedy, crime/gangster thriller, romance, action, adventure, and drama, never content to settle on a single tone. One minute you're chuckling heartily at some goofy, innocent dialogue about love and romance, and the next minute, someone's being shot to death in a very bloody fashion. It isn't necessarily a dark movie, but it's by no means a lighthearted one either. The constant shifts in tone will put many people off.The dialogue between Julia Roberts and James Gandolfini is a lot of fun to hear, and it's quite insightful on the subject of relationships. Their scenes are the heart of the movie, and provide the emotional core. The performances here are excellent. Julia Roberts is excellent and really brings her over-dramatic loudmouth character fully to life. James Gandolfini is perfect as the gay hit man with a heart of gold. He is believable as a soft-hearted gay man as well as a cold-blooded killer. Brad Pitt's journey in Mexico is the more slapstick of the two, and also the more mean-spirited and violent. Brad Pitt is very funny when he needs to be, but his performance feels rather awkward at times, and in many scenes, he talks with his hands as if he has no idea how to deliver his lines. He's still a fairly likable character.Although they would be just fine as their own movies, these two stories manage to give the movie a little something for everyone. It would be a great date movie for patient couples. I use the word patient, because the movie is needlessly slow at times, and would have greatly benefited from an editor. This is the biggest flaw in the film. Many shots of nothing happening in certain scenes, as well as various pointless moments in general could have been easily cut. The film's 130 minutes could have become 110 or even 100 without in any way diminishing the entertainment value or effecting the story for the worst. This is some of the most lazy editing in any movie I've seen. Another problem is that the stories really don't go anywhere. Although you'll come away most likely having been entertained, you won't be able to help but wonder what the point to everything you just saw was.The Mexican was originally intended to be an independent movie, and perhaps it would have been better-received if it had stayed independent. When a story this quirky and different attracts the two biggest stars in Hollywood, it only sets itself up for disappointment. That and the slow editing. But flaws and all, The Mexican is a fun and enjoyable journey to nowhere. It's funny, it's violent, and it's got entertaining characters, and in spite of these flaws, I really love this movie, and recommend it to anyone willing to endure a few slow stretches of an otherwise fun time. 8/10.The Mexican is rated R for Violence and Language. Sex - 3/10 Violence - 8/10 Swearing - 10/10 Drugs - 2/10.</fullReview>

Mob errand runner Pitt heads to Mexico to retrieve a rare pistol for a crime lord on his supposedly last job, or so he tells displeased girlfriend Roberts who breaks up with him and goes to Las Vegas. While things go wrong in Mexico for him, his girlfriend is kidnapped in Vegas by a compassionate hit-man (Gandolfini) to insure the pistol is delivered as planned. Quirky screwball romantic-comedy caper throws two of America's biggest superstars (who share few scenes together) into an overlong script that doesn't really go anywhere. Although, a few amusing moments with Pitt in Mexico make it enjoyable and Gandolfini's surprising character is the most interesting part of the film. 123 min., rated R. ** ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Helen of Troy was said to have 'the face that launched a thousand ships', causing the ancient Trojan War. Well, shove-off, Helen, we've got Julia Roberts, who launches a thousand heart throbs every time she grins, sobs, laughs or whatever she does on screen. Julia Roberts (Samantha Barzel) plays the 'I-want-my-relationship-to-work', desperately seeking solace girlfriend, with her can't-live-with-can't-live-without half-witted hard-luck can't-do-anything-right-boyfriend Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt), and finds comfort and understanding with the help of a relation-trouble-gay-hit-man, Winston Baldry (James Gandolfini), who is, in fact, supposed to kill her.Sounds confusing?Well then sit down and enjoy the 'ride', brilliantly directed by Gore Verbinski, with this sometimes clumsy, yet intricate romance-comedy. It has several 'intersecting' subplots, including a wonderfully comic-tragic legend of a cursed antique pistol, a really mean dog, vicious gangsters and of course Mexico.You won't get lost, though. The hilarious slapstick situations and unexpected twists and turns flipping back and forth between Mexico and Las Vegas, are all well sewn together by the much sought after relic, and an icing on the cake cameo plus performance by Gene Hackman , keeps your attention, almost waiting, for the next shoe to drop.Although somewhat long, no time is wasted, and in spite of the seemingly hopeless situations, you'll 'never' find yourself saying, enough is enough! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that, while enjoyable enough, you walk away from knowing that it should have been better. Fantastic cast (Pitt, Roberts, Gandolfini, Hackman, Balaban, Simmons), yet there is no character development outside of Gandolfini's character, and as a result, the scenes he is not in are flat. Also, the actors are not particularly believable in their roles (Gandolfini, need I say more?). But the most problematic thing about the film is that it goes back and forth with no cohesion at times, leaving the viewer wondering what the heck is going on. Eventually, it just leaves the realm of sensibility and becomes silly, mindless drivel and you are just waiting for it to end. You would expect more than mindless drivel from this good a cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, inventive, odd little movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some possible spoilers)I'm aware that The Mexican inspired some pretty strong negative reactions and didn't fare terribly well on its release. Part of the problem, I'm sure, is the supposed 'dream-pairing' of Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt and an expectation of a standard-issue romantic comedy. People who come to this movie expecting that are sorely and understandably disappointed when they discover an entirely different kind of movie.Brad Pitt plays Jerry Welbach, a schlemiel who winds up working for a gangster that he inadvertently put in prison. Being a screw-up, he's sent to Mexico after failing to perform on his last job in order to get a pistol. But this is no ordinary pistol -- it's a hand-made piece of art with an oral history that keeps subtly changing during the movie. Its curse follows Jerry around Mexico but somehow never quite stops him, perhaps because in his weird way, he's one of the good guys. At the same time, the curse manages to trip him up enough to make his bosses nervous, who decide to hold his girlfriend hostage until he comes up with the pistol. James Gandolfini plays a hitman who rescues Julia Roberts from another hitman, and this is where the best chemistry of the movie arises. Gandolfini's hitman is gay, and Roberts' Sam instantly connect on a personal level. They hit Las Vegas with a postman that Gandolfini attracts, until tragedy strikes and Gandolfini goes back to business.Without revealing too much more of the plot, I can tell you that the stellar cast delivers, especially in smaller roles, such as JK Simmons as Ted, Jerry's partner of sorts, Bob Balaban (always liked him), and Gene Hackman in a small but important role. There are many funny moments, such as Carlos Lacamara as the car rental rep insulting a clueless Jerry en Espanol while smiling the entire time. Most original of all is the movie-within-the-movie that flickers to life any time the story of the pistol is told, changing and advancing each time, and sounding like an old 8mm projector is playing it.At the end, this is a film about redemption and faith, but it's a long, strange trip to get there. And at the very end, you wonder if Gandolfini's exhortations about fate and love will really work. But if you go in with an open mind and a willingness to try something new, you will be entertained by The Mexican. And watch the dog -- the dog will let you know when Jerry gets off track. No, seriously.</fullReview>

Julia Roberts, and Brad Pit, can't be bad, the picture on the cover also looked promising, both clutching each others hands, like they had just been through hell together, both of them relying on each other to survive, racing against time, (you know the kind movie). Well if you have ever been told to never judge a book, by its cover, well that goes for movie covers aswel. what a bore, they never spent 1 minute with each other, well maby 1 minute at the end, but there was absolute no chemistry between them at all, it was like 2 separate storys going on in 1 film, it was just so boring, and the sound track just made me laugh.</fullReview>

The movie is about a man who is told by the Mafia to retrieve a legendary pistol called "The Mexican". Against his girlfriend's wishes, he does it. But the gun is to bring a curse, and the man believes it when his girlfriend is kidnapped by a gay (you heard me) hitman named Leroy. Now, Jerry must save his girlfriend, along with bringing back the gun.NOTE: I have nothing against homosexuals, I just find it funny that Tony Soprano is gay in a movie.The movie offers hardly any good laughs, but the fun attitude of Pitt and Roberts saves the movie.</fullReview>

"The Mexican" shows organized crime without the glamour and the glitz, choosing instead to focus on the interactions of the characters and the personal relationships that are developed throughout the film. This is not a warm and fuzzy film, the characters are all flawed and dangerous. The storyline leads us all to a very dark place promising finality and redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not Pitt and Roberts, is *about* Pitt and Roberts. It's not a romantic comedy, it's a story about people. Don't walk in expecting a formula film. Life isn't a formula, life is a stream of events that happen to you and you try to make it work out anyway. The Mexican celebrates this idea by joining the characters in the middle of their life's adventures, Pitt trying hard to unwind the crazy coil that events that life has wrapped him and Roberts in against their will, and Roberts wriggling with learning this life lesson. Pitt and Roberts DO have chemistry, and it's a real world *reactive* chemistry. What happens when "Pretty Woman" meets "Fight Club"? Boom!! The two stars lead different sides of the plot line through most of the movie showing they are two different people seeing the situation in their own way, and then they come together and tumble into each other as they try to express their love. The movie doesn't try to sugar coat love and life, it celebrates it's excitement! And on the way there are a whole load of twists, some great acting, some surprises, some mystery, and some hilarious ironic and even dark humor. The movie isn't your normal Hollywood formula pap, it's more like a big budget art film. I don't think most people get that. Don't hold on while you watch, let go and enjoy the ride! I've seen it in the theatre, on DVD and on TV, and each time I walk away smiling.</fullReview>

Galdonofo plays an off-kilter character... a sensitive hitman who engages Roberts to talk about her love troubles a la an Oprah interview.... all while holding her hostage. And with the locales, I really dug the little towns in and the seedy atmosphere the movie captured. It gave me that 'hmmmm, I want to travel' vibe.

		<fullReview>I did not see The Mexican in theaters, because I expected it to be another lighthearted Roberts comedy, and because it received little acclaim. When I rented the DVD recently, I was pleasantly surprised with Brad Pitt's latest attempt to break out of his "Typical Hollywood Leading Man" persona. In The Mexican, Brad Pitt plays Jerry, a reluctant hero who is thrust into the world of organized crime through an act of Fate. He is a bumbling mobster, who manages to screw up most of his jobs. His life is complicated by a disfunctional relationship with Samantha, who has put her life on hold for 5 years to cater to Jerry's "career." As his last job, Jerry is sent to Mexico to retrieve an elusive artifact: a revolver called the Mexican (hence the title of the movie...). Because of his personal clumsiness (and perhaps the machinations of Fate), the gun is lost, found, and lost again...and then found.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie on all levels. It is essentially a romance, even though the hero and heroine spend few scenes together. Digging deeper, one discovers that The Mexican is also about the role of Fate in every day life. The superbly cheap lighting and on-location filming further enhances Pitt's raw physical energy, and Jerry's essential helplessness and confusion. Verbinski transforms little things - stoplights, stray dogs - into agents of an unseen hand.Don't let the bad press dissuade you from watching The Mexican. It's well-worth the $5 renting fee.

		<shortDescription>HOW DO YOU SPELL "NAUGEHYDE(?)" ??????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched the film at least 4 or 5 times. It's ok, kind of cute even. Brad Pitt is great as a regular Dumb Joe kind of guy. Julia is lacking a lot, she just doesn't play her part well. I am glad they are not in many scenes together because they have NO chemistry (have u heard that before..LOL). BUT my favorite part is when he tells her that he will WRECK the bleeping car if she says one word, moment of silence, and she says naughehyde. My problem is that I can't figure out how to spell it. I know the way I'm spelling it is wrong because I tried to look it up on the net and it gave me "no such word" so I don't know how to spell it. CAN YOU HELP ME PLEASE!!!?????? Just send me an email if u think u know the correct spelling...THANKS!! Lynda C.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an okay film, but i had a few complaints. The fact that Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt have hardly any screen time together is a good thing as they have no chemistry whatsoever and give better performances when they are seperated. All in all, i would have to say i liked Jerry's storyline better than Sams, it was a lot more fun and served the film a lot better, i felt myself getting bored by sams side of the story which wasn't good because i am a fan of Julia Roberts. Overall, good performances, okay story 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While perusing this site I had the misfortune to flip the channel to the beginning of The Mexican. What a load of crap! I saw this turd in the theaters when it came out- it might have been the worst movie I saw that year. The story is dull and full of plot holes-but if you have half of a brain by the time this movie is over with you probably won't care anyway. The acting is lame, the writing even worse. There is no consistency to the direction-pointless violence one minute, idiotic sight gags the next. The film is sadly stereotypical and condescending to homosexuals, Mexicans and pretty much anyone with an I.Q. over 65. Julia Roberts could not be less believable or interesting. And anyway, she is way too old for this type of role and was obviously just going through the motions. Brad Pitt was nothing to write home about either. If Pitt has no edge to his character ala Fight Club, he just looks bored. Bored, boring just about sums up the whole (LONG) experience with The Mexican. I wonder just how a movie with such star power could be made so dull and listless? Did someone lose a bet? Is this really the best vehicle they could come up with for Pitt, Roberts, Gandolfini et al.? Anyway I have wasted enough time deriding The Mexican. If you rent this joyless mess you will be sorely disappointed. If for some reason you did like this, WHY? Seriously, WHY? Just how low are your standards?</fullReview>

Twenty minutes in, I thought, there is absolutely nothing thatn can possible develop in a film as bad as this that could possibly redeem it. I was wrong. Gandolfini is very, very good. It brought to mind the Sci-Fi flick "Q", in which Michael Moriarty refused to be anything but spectacular, despite the cardboard story and wooden cast of characters that he had to work with. Gandolfini's is a great, great performance. It's a shame one has to sit through such horrible, silly, inane, pointless, dumb, stupid, idiotic...words fail me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In what could have been an overly quirky and silly tale for two megastars, The Mexican turns out to be a surprisingly dark and fun little fable that kept my interest through the entire two hour running time. Many complain that Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt share little screen time together, but this is a plus. Julia Roberts has much more chemistry with James Gandolfini then she does with Brad Pitt. In fact, lets talk about Gandolfini, because he is the main reason The Mexican works. James plays the role of a gay hit-man, who is not a very nice person, but has important things to say on life and love. I found his interactions with Julia to be highly satisfying. On the other hand, Brad Pitt works quite well playing the stranded American in Mexico. Pitt has much better chemistry with the wild dog he adopts then he does with Julia; so the film works out well. The story behind the gun is an interesting one, which gives the ending a pleasing legend like tone. The Mexican isn't what audiences were expecting, but as far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One schizophrenic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mexican is a movie with terrific ideas and a topnotch cast that is sabotaged by poor decisions. The end result is watchable and fun, but you'll find yourself wondering, "why the heck did that get by the editor?"The Mexican tries to sustain two emotional tones that are diametrically opposed to one another. The result is a film that continuously undermines itself. The light romance story structure cannot support the graphic gangster movie violence. One gives a lie to the other. For example when an inevitable tragedy occurs, Julia Roberts reacts to it in an amazingly offhand manner. She has to. If she reacted in a realistic way we'd have a hard time accepting the happy ending. Had the movie been more light romance or more film noir there wouldn't have been this problem.The actors truly save this film. They rise to the occasion and make the movie into appealing entertainment. Julia Roberts' acting, charm and comic instincts make us like a character that spends much of her time complaining about all and sundry. Roberts talent is such that she can pull off being both strident and charming. James Gandolfini plays a character that is too "high concept" for its own good. He is supposed to be a psychotic hit man with a heart of gold, but Gandolfini pulls it off. You really like the character, but he is undeniably scary.Brad Pitt can be genuinely funny in the proper role, the incomprehensible gypsy fighter in Snatch for example. He is most effective, however, in movies where a lack of acting ability does not detract from the proceedings. There is no denying he has an affable screen presence but here, sharing screen time with Roberts and Gandolfini, he's out of his league.The Mexican is definitely worth renting. Just be warned it has a severe personality disorder, too graphic to be cute and too cute to be a decent crime movie. If you can find tolerance for its flaws you will see a lot to like here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must strongly disagree with "The Unemployed Critic". The promotion of the movie was indeed quite misleading, but I thought the movie was much BETTER than its trailers. The trailers made it seem like just another stupid romantic comedy. In fact I thought it was a much darker comedy with a somewhat surreal texture that reminded me of such great movies as "Raising Arizona" and "The Big Lebowski". There was quite a bit of violence in the movie, but this was counterbalanced with some truly funny scenes. The musical score was perfect, and I thought that the crew actually made excellent use of the settings. The lighting was just plain cool.I do think that the movie would be better without the "f" word and with slightly less graphic violence. Personally, I don't mind that so much, but this is a movie that I can't share with a lot of family and friends because of these elements. That's a shame because I think overall it's a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

Much to the behest of his girlfriend (Roberts), he finds himself newly single and embarking on a series of mishaps ranging from a stolen car to a fierce dog. His girlfriend, meanwhile finds herself kidnapped by a sensitive hitman (James Gandolfini) trying to obtain the gun for the idiot's boss.The Review: Those expecting a lighthearted, quirky romantic comedy about two mismatched lovers, are going to get a crime film with a reasonable share of blood that neglects romantic comedy in favor of bloodshed. It goes without saying that this film would never have been made unless it's heavyweight stars were attached. Lacking substance, "The Mexican" is really nothing more than just a perpetrated bunch of hype meant to collect a whole bunch of money.</fullReview>

I mean, there arguments were believable. But it wasn't JUST a "cute" movie... it actually had a plot. That sounds like a dumb comment I'm sure- every movie HAS a plot... but others had informed me differently. The plot was quite obvious- Brad Pitts quest for a gun that is legendary in Mexico and America. And it was an ACTION movie... there were actually parts that had you covering up your ears waiting for a gun shot to ring out. It was a good movie... there was nothing wrong with it. I recommend that people go see it... despite what some of your friends have been saying about it. If I had listened to my friends, I might not have gotten the chance to see this great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mexican is unquestionably eye candy for the masses not that doesn't make the movie decent. Hey it works; you should never change things if they are right. The plot of this film is not really great and you probably won't like it if you don't care for either of the main stars that act in it ? Brad &amp; Julia. But it is extremely easy on the eyes. It's a movie that you can watch any time, not to violent for younger audiences and a bit of love and romance thrown it too. This is where the faults lye sadly. Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt are alot more believable as brother and sister than lovers. They lack any real sexual chemistry, which lets this film down a great deal unfortunately. They also don't show that much emotion also. However still there's no doubt that Brad Pitt shines once again in this movie and it sure isn't Miss Roberts' worse work. Definitely watchable although not this years outstanding picture of course.</fullReview>

I truly believe that the only reason they made this movie is one big excuse to have two big Hollywood players: Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt star in a movie where the success of that movie was based on their names alone. The problem is that that they ignored the primary rule of film making: don't make a movie around actors. The result is a film in which the characters do not even remotely act naturally. The plot is horrible and the stars cannot even work with the plot themselves. They do not have on screen charisma and it proves that if you want believable characters, the actors have to fit them, not the other way around. The result is a movie that makes no sense, is not realistic, and is based purely on the actor's names alone. Perhaps the worst thing is that the movie makers had to have known this.

Not that I can't sit through 3-hour movies, but looking back at it, The Mexican had so many superfluous plots running through it. For instance, the whole Julia Roberts plotline could have been cut out and had no effect on the goings-on of the rest of the story. I take that to mean that she was added to attract an audience, and not for the benefit of the story. The only time she really played a necessary part was at the end, when... well, I won't spoil it, but, well, it's not like spoiling it would cause so great a damage. Anyway, it was a "enjoyable" and "interesting" movie, but notice how I avoid calling it "great" and a "masterpiece"...

		<fullReview>I just purchased this movie in an effort to stock up on action/adventure. The Mexican definitely fits into that definition! Brad Pitt as Jerry is finally trying to do the right thing here-he meets all the requirements given him. But "Fate" has something else in store for him. His girlfriend dumps him as Jerry is leaving the country for "a job", but is still kidnapped and considered a negotiating piece. The romance is almost nonexistent, but that's okay, because romance and bullets don't mix. I think they could have shaved off most of Julia Roberts' performance and the story would still have been more than taken care of. She was NOT believable nor sympathetic and I felt more for her kidnapper than for her. Brad Pitt, however, was great as the desperate mob peon trying to do his work. You could feel his anxiety and disappointment with each obstacle. You could sympathize with his blunders. So what if he's good looking?! He still can act and he does it well. James Gandolfini also presents a good case and it's too bad he kidnapped Roberts. If he had played opposite Pitt, I think the movie would have moved a lot quicker and less painfully. But overall, the story was surprisingly cute and raw and you can appreciate the cultural confusion between rural Mexicans and Ugly Americans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read several unfavourable reviews of this film and they almost convinced me not to watch it. They were wrong. You might not get this film. Even if you do you might not like it. Watch it anyway.The story centres around a guy who, by misfortune, works for organised crime. His last job for them is to collect an antique gun from a guy in a bar in Mexico. His girlfriend, none too pleased with his trip to Mexico, dumps him before he leaves. What follows is a mixture of comedy, caper movie and a vicious satire on relationship therapy culture.Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts are excellent in their roles, particularly Pitt, who manages to give his character no cool or clue. James Gandolfini steals the show as a sensitive hitman who doesn't want to be "defined" by what he does.While parts of the film are hilarious there are dark moments in there too. While The Mexican isn't quite as good as say "American Beauty", it is pitched at the same level, treading the lines between straight comedy, satire and meaning-of-life navel contemplation.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dish: The Mexican The recipe: Take two Hollywood A-list stars, one female, one male. Make sure they are both beautiful and handsome. Add a hint of desperation to give them a lacklustre appearance and ask them to pretend they have an on screen chemistry, to be acted out and manifested over the backdrop of a minor theft / smuggling operation, which goes wrong. Oh, and by the way, just to make things more interesting, at regular intervals, narrate to the audience an age-old love story which should give the audience a background to the plot. Mix well, ensuring there is not even a hint of consistency, continuity nor resulting sympathy for or empathy with any of the characters.The result: A complete and utter celluloid catastrophe. No, that's overrating this film. In fact, calling it a film is actually overrating it. It's more a collection of scenes from a slapstick Hollywood pilot movie, which should never have seen the light of day.I happen to believe that Mr. Pitt has a remarkable talent for acting, having demonstrated these abilities in such diverse vehicles as `Fight Club', `Seven' and `Twelve Monkeys'. We all make mistakes, and I think it's probably high time he made one. And made one he has. There is NO redeeming feature to this cinematic hotchpotch of crude comedy sketches, and pseudo-psychological relationship-counselling babble. There is even an attempt to introduce a character who displays sexual preferences which apparently are written into the script to contrast completely with his professional nature. Great potential. Bad, bad implementation. It just doesn't work. No amount of close-ups of Julia Roberts' tearful face, or Brad Pitt's blue eyes and blonde hair (ever so carefully rugged-ised at every opportunity) will a complete movie make. Admittedly, Pitt does do the whole `bumbling fool in a dangerous situation' thing quite well, but it's just not enough. I was irritated with Robert's character almost through out the entire experience, with her constant, unbelievable, badgering of Pitt's character to give up his criminal ways. On the few occasions when there was a real opportunity for the film to leap into something resembling drama, it was unable to pull it off. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and had they all perished (which I'm not saying they didn't), I simply would have shifted my weight to the other cheek in order to rest my weary head on the jacket I had rolled up to get some shut-eye. Add to this cacophony of let downs a pitifully predictable ending, and I think, great ingredients or not, what we have is a dog's dinner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry's total criminal incompetence has landed him in an unenviable position with his mob employers. He is given a stark choice: either be rolled up to the neck in a carpet and set alight in the boot of a car or, go to Mexico to retrieve a valuable, but cursed, 19th century pistol - The Mexican of the title - for Margolese, the gangster godfather who is rotting, influentially, somewhere in prison. Jerry (Brad Pitt) is not that stupid, he opts for Mexico, especially as it's advertised sweetly to him as `a bit of travel and a bit of sex.'. But Jerry's problems have a second dimension. His girlfriend Sam (Julia Roberts), whose head is swimming with psychiatric neologisms from joint therapy sessions with Jerry in their troubled relationship, has also given him an ultimatum: either the life of crime goes or she goes. So, when Jerry returns home to tell Sam the good news, that he's off to Mexico, the scene is set. The infuriated Sam goes her way and Jerry goes his for `a bit of travel and a bit of sex' in Mexico.The Mexican has all the ingredients of a farce. The simple task of retrieving the Pistol is, as you might expect, not going to go smoothly. This is down to a combination of Jerry's own casual, boyish incompetence, the serious double-crossing going on among his employers, the distant influence of Sam and, not least, the `cursed' pistol itself, the possession of which seems to result in deserted fortune.Additional complications ensue. Sam is kidnapped by the feared hired hitman Leroy (James Gandolfini) in order to put pressure on Jerry not to be tempted to go his own way. And Mexico is not the holiday brochure that Jerry expects. It's a crumbling hell hole into which every seedy, sweaty, shifty- eyed Mexican stereotype has been deposited. At every turn there is a Mexican on the make, and they all, seemingly, want the pistol as well. There is also a mad Mexican dog thrown in for Jerry to befriend. I'm not interested in political correctness but, if I was a Mexican, I wouldn't be too happy watching this film! This is an attempt at a comedy thriller, an attempt because it is a comedy that is not funny and a thriller that lacks thrills. Compare it to Midnight Run, with a not dissimilar set-up, and its weaknesses become apparent. The script lends itself to overacting, particularly from Pitt and Roberts, actors who are not genuinely good at comedy anyway. And there is insufficient other material to compensate.There are some interesting areas that might have worked in a better general context. The hardened hitman Leroy is revealed as an unlikely gay gangster by the socially observant Sam. Their association blossoms as they travel and talk of failed relationships; Sam, with her psycho babble and Leroy with his more vulgar, frilless observations. But the sense of irritation at the unnecessary confusions of the plot is overwhelming. Particularly annoying are the endless tales of how the pistol was infected with the curse. Just as you thought it was all sorted out and it was time to go home, enter the uncredited Gene Hackman to tell the true story of the pistol with yet another silent sepia flashback. So, it occurred to me somewhere near the end, when it wasn't quite the end, that, given the choice between being rolled up in a carpet to the neck and set alight in the boot of a car or, being offered the chance to watch this film again.I would choose the film. But only just.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant acting blended with a unique and clever story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to the theater not expecting much of "The Mexican." I thought a relationship between Julia Roberts (Samantha) and Brad Pitt (Jerry) would appear awkward and unlikely. However, I was pleasantly surprised when "The Mexican" rarely featured Sam and Jerry in the same scenes together. Instead the movie is a portrayal of Sam and Jerry's separate interpretations of the events that unfold. Jerry and Sam are both involved (directly and indirectly) with the retrieval of a gun named, The Mexican. Each character has their own string of stressful and humorous events in relation to the gun. Towards the end of the movie you are presented with a surprising twist of the plot, which gracefully pulls together the hidden symbolism and metaphors carefully placed throughout the movie. In addition to the clever story, the relationship between Sam and Jerry becomes more believable, due to the fact that they are rarely seen together in the movie. In fact they appear to have a wonderful talent for acting off of one another's emotions during their scenes together. I would highly recommend viewing "The Mexican" if you are fan of mysterious, adventurous, comedic, dramatic, or romantic movies. In other words, I highly recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MEXICAN (2001) Rating: 8/10The Mexican has everything going for it ? a fun, edgy story; cool leads; heaps of funny, impossible situations and groovy tunes. It is everything I wanted out of a day's entertainment, it's exactly what I was in the mood for. Something not too serious, but still contains drama, while also mixing strong elements of comedy in, too. Okay, I'll admit the film is way over-long and not exactly what I expected, but with the two zesty personalities of the lead actors (Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt ? both superb) how can you go wrong? Add to that the movie has a fantastic and original script, a few awesome action scenes and awesome cinematography. I enjoyed this story and its many points-of-view and was never bored. The Mexican has some particularly good scenes, especially the part where Pitt tries to hitch a ride with a Mexican by adding `o' to the end of every word. All in all, The Mexican is an unpredictable, uncontrolled and endlessly entertaining comedy-thriller that you'll just want to rewind and watch all over again after its finished. I'm sure this will be one of the year's best comedies.</fullReview>

I enjoyed the two stories; however, I think the movie would have been better if it had focused more on only one of the plot lines. The cinematography of the scenes in Mexico were very good. Rent the DVD version if you can, the scenes that were cut make the movie flow a little better. I do agree with many on this board that the movie seemed to drag at times. On a whole though I enjoyed it. I gave a 7 out of 10, which was probably a little generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In this mess, Gandolfini shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I checked the end credits to "The Mexican" I noticed that one of the producers was Lawrence Binder, who produced "Pulp Fiction". I wondered if writer J.H. Wyman and director Gore Verbinski was trying to create a variation or a companion piece to "Pulp" because if they were, I thought they didn't do a very good job. I don't think it would've mattered at all if Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt were together in the entire flick. I thought both characters (especially Brad's) were annoying. James Gandolfini just about stole the movie away from Roberts and Pitt as a hitman who kidnaps Roberts. The only screen chemistry that developed was between Roberts and Gandolfini. Just imagine Gandofini as Tony Soprano but playing the Rupert Everett character in "My Best Friend's Wedding". That's essentially what his character is like: a mix of danger and gentleness. His character has depth. Unlike the film which is a mess. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I felt entertained by the movie, though after 90 or 100 minutes I started to feel slightly bored. Thinking a little about it, I must say that it is rather a bad than a good movie.The movie apparantly tries to revive the style of the early Tarantino movies, but it is much weaker.There are simply no intriguing plot twists, Jerry is just running after the gun until at some point you don't care anymore how the movie will end. How hard you try, you won't find out why all these people were after the gun, especially since most of them were working for Margoles. Most of the characters are pale and undistinguished. Only the Leroy-Winston character and his relation with Samantha was sufficiently absurd and of some interest, though also not highly original.Probably the makers ripped off quite a lot of their jokes from other movies. Even the old Warner Looney Tunes were used, namely, Jerry waits at the apparantly empty crossing in the desert and when he finally decides to cross he is almost hit by a (skeleton of a) truck.In the good old times, the truck would have run over him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy?? Drama?? Do you care??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether this one is supposed to be a comedy or a thriller. It seems like the Brad Pitt portions are supposed to be comedy/thriller and the Julia Roberts portions seem more in the vein of romantic comedy (big surprise!!) Yes, it's true, Julia and Brad have only about 15 minutes total screen time together. Kind of disappointing considering that most viewers will go into this expecting a HUGE megastar-power picture. This isn't the huge megastar-pairing vehicle intended, but a regular movie with two main roles that would probably have been served better with less star-wattage: either Brad Pitt and another, lesser known female co-star, or Julia Roberts and another, lesser known male co-star. As it is, James Gandolfini, as the gay (why? does his sexuality actually ADD anything to a fundamentally road-movie-ish, bumbling-fugitive movie?) thug holding Ms. Roberts' Samantha hostage while his bosses try and track down Pitt in Mexico, practically steals the whole picture right out from under the rug of our two stars. Another fault, the movie has about four endings!! I hate when that happens in a movie, especially when the movie isn't that good to begin with! It makes a sluggish movie seem so much longer!! All three leads are OK to watch by themselves, as always, but the movie has more of a "who cares?" aura surrounding it. Ultimately, 'The Mexican' ends up being a big waste of time and money. Hopefully the mechanism of pairing two powerful and talented Hollywood stars will be put to better use in a better project in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitt+Roberts+Mexico=no bueno.Things get going rather well and good for the first act and then come to a screeching halt. The second and third act drag on at an excrutiatingly slow pace. Some may like the Mexico-mojo going on, but when you consider the star pairing of Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt and how uninspiring this movie turns out to be, you realize just how much of a let down it is. Said another way, they could have done a lot more with these two.On the good side, the Soprano dad does a good job considering he is a wistful, gay hitman (silence=death, and so does my glock 9). Brad Pitt is always easy on the eyes, but am I the only one who maintains JR is the acting equivalent of ice skating shows ? I haven't seen that much forced emotion since Nancy Kerrigan triple lutzed in baby-blue chiffon....Need evidence: check out the playful bed scene in Vegas, ugh, that cackle. Movie rule #343: Julia Roberts cackled = box office draw. Just see her last 3 romantic comedy trailers: each one contains a 2 sec. cackle (see Stepmom, Runaway Bride, et. al.)In summary, the Mexican does nothing for me, at times, amusing, but mostly goes in too many different directions. And way too much violence that doesn't help the story whatsoever. Just tell me you didn't groan at least a little bit when Jerry discovers he doesn't have his passport and thus, must catapult this stinker past the two hour mark.Let us all pray that Steve Soderberg can get some genuine quality out of these two later this year in Ocean's Eleven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the fascination with Julie Roberts? Is it because she plays dippy women the audience identifies with or is it her overacting. I do not see the appeal nor do I see the appeal of this movie. The story of the gun called the Mexican had some appeal but the movie's lighthearted love story was nauseatingly juvenile. Also because this was a big budget Hollywood film there had to be lots of guns. People were brutally killed as amusement, hit men are portrayed as sensitive souls whose employment happens to be murder, again both Hollywood cliches. What are the people like who make these movies? What are their lives like? Brad Pitt can act on occasion but he seems to be fascinated by people with poor grooming habits. Don't waste your time on this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not CHOOSE this film. Where I currently live we have a night at the Cinema known as Sneak Preview, where you pay a smaller fee and are then surprised with a not-as-yet released film. The Mexican was my 'surprise'. I had seen the trailers and assumed I would be treated to frolicking hijinks and bad Mexican gags. I was rewarded with at least one! It seems to be the mistake in Hollywood these days that MORE big names make an even bigger, better film. Did they learn nothing from Batman and Robin!? Ok, The Mexican is hardly as bad as B &amp; R, but it DOES disappoint. Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts have about as much chemistry as my fifth grade science project, which I failed. I usually like Julia, and sometimes even enjoy her films. Not this time. In it she is a shrill, shrewish, shallow ballbusting character who made me wish I had earplugs. And Brad Pitt seems to think he is in some alternate Rain Man-Fight Club universe where he plays a less than saavy dimwitted version of Tyler Durdan. He twitches and flips out and kvetches and generally spazzes out for the overly long length of the movie. And when did James Gandolfini as a gay hit man ever strike anyone as believable? The advice and love stories he and Roberts babble on about are boring, and only in a smarter film would the line about 'when is enough enough?' make anyone sit back and really think or say 'awww'. The only thing even moderately interesting were the little clips about the gun, and even they were like a bad homage to the Three Amigos. This movie dragged on way too long, and when Gene Hackman showed up I just wanted to know what happened to his career. Altogether, I would have rather watched Chips dubbed in spanish.</fullReview>

Whilst much of the movie was spent with both characters running around in apparently pointless circles (hence leading to a mind-numbingly dull plot), there were funny parts.

		<fullReview>I didn't think I was going to like The Mexican. Most romantic comedies are unbelievably sappy, and tend to go way overboard in the process of convincing the audience that a Hollywoodesque, balls-to-the-wall, I'd-die -for-you kind of relationship can actually happen in this superficial world of ours. Ridiculously contrived events, totally banal "seductions", and forced chemistry make for a bad movie (Random Hearts? Thomas Crown Affair? Ouch.). The Mexican isn't necessarily a complete departure from this, but since Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts' characters already have an established relationship (and simply spend most of the movie apart contemplating separation), and because a bit of fairy tale magic pervades the movie anyway, it does manage to avoid many of the pitfalls a "typical" romance movie might suffer from.The plot involves the indentured Pitt having to do one last job for his crime boss, a job that Roberts' character won't wait for. He goes off to retrieve a legendary Mexican pistol worth a considerable amount of money (or so we're led to believe), while she heads off to Las Vegas to follow her own dreams. Both of their paths become complicated, and they're forced to re-evaluate the relationship in the process. It's surprisingly effective.Pitt, Roberts, and Gandolfini (the hit-man who tracks Roberts) are all quite good in their respective roles. Roberts is horribly irritating when actually with Pitt, but since these moments are relatively rare, they can be mostly overlooked. Pitt plays a rube pretty well, pulling off the anti-Tyler Durden convincingly. Gandolfini manages to mould a realistic character out of brutally contrived "novelty" role, and his presence steals a few scenes.I found the cinematography pleasantly different, certainly artistic. Weird angles, good close-ups, yum yum. The vignette flashbacks are a nifty addition, and the overall look of the movie is rich, in a barren, Mexican kind of way. (Or at least Mexican as the movie wants us to see it--I imagine there are a few stereotypical and potentially derogatory concepts woven into the movie that I could probably comment on more effectively if I knew anything about Mexican culture. As it is, I can only imagine...)The Mexican is not without its flaws. The Roberts character, as mentioned, is particularly irritating at certain points in the movie. The hyperbole of an irrational woman, to the point of being a parody. The entire Pitt/Roberts relationship is obviously unlikely, going from rock solid (if they can work through the fact that Pitt is enslaved to a gangster, nothing should really be that difficult), to hanging by a thread (only the sage wisdom of Gandolfini can illuminate true love? C'mon.). And ultimately, the movie doesn't have much to say about anything other than some trite love advice, so the philosophical synapses don't get much of a workout.Still, The Mexican ends up a fiesta, in my books. I give it the unexpected rating of 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

This movie has to be one of the most stupidest, dumbest, most retarted movie since Godzilla 2000. Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt are barely together through this hunk of junk. About two minutes in the beginning and about five minutes at the end. Thats about it. On the trailers it looks like it's going to be a pretty funny comedy. It's a fricken boring drama. Then at the end it started to get pretty serious about their relationship. Really there is only one funny part in the whole movie. And it involves Brad Pitt and his driving. Waste of everybody's time. Julia Roberts last two movies have been flops. This one and America's Sweethearts. Her only that is really worth watching that came out last year is Erin Brockivich.

		<fullReview>Where do I begin? The only good thing about this movie was Brad Pitt, he's pretty good as a comedic actor although he's better known for drama. I chuckled throughout most of his scenes.On the other hand, am I the only one who found Julia Roberts character Sam, to be incredibly annoying? Everytime she even spoke of Jerry (Pitt) she would talk about how selfish he was and complain and whine and whine and whine! I mean, if anyone whines as much as this woman did you wonder why Jerry or any other man would put up with it. Maybe because I'm a passive person and try to go with the flow which makes me really irritated with high maintenance women in movies.Above all...I think the casting was a little off. It just doesn't work. I could definitely see Sandra Bullock in this role instead of Julia. I personally think she should stick with drama. Bullock has several enjoyable comedies and I'd take a Sandra movie over Julia any day. Anyways, Brad really saved the movie, he was fun to watch and I was eager to see what would happen next with him.All in all... it wasn't terribly bad. It was interesting, I mean it wasn't cliche. I've never seen a movie quite like this before. If Julia's character weren't so whiney and selfish, the movie would have gotten a higher rating from me. I wanted the movie to go off just so I could stop hearing her moan. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I had no real desire to see The Mexican, but my wife did, which meant so did I.I will admit, however, that I was intrigued with the prospect of seeing a film with two such powerful leads. But it all fell flat, thanks mainly to poor direction and screenplay.More or less all the jokes fell flat, the story had no power, and the stars had zero chemistry. The film is basically two separate stories, with the back story acting as a third story, as well as padding. The stories by themselves are fine, but put together into one film, it's a mess. It would have been a better film if made into seperate features, rather than just one. And one long one at that, being over two hours long. By the 90 minute mark, I was ready to use The Mexican on myself.When a film has such intense star power, there should be chemistry, but this movie has none, basically because whenever Roberts and Pitt happen to share a scene together, they're screaming at one another. Roberts becomes increasingly annoying whenever she meets up with Pitt. James Gandolfini is in typical fine form as a killer for hire, although he should be because it's the same part he's been playing for nearly a decade. Pitt is the only decent aspect of this movie, because he truly is a versatile actor, but he should not have to lower himself to playing a dufus stooge relying on pee-gags when his own jokes fall flat.This movie had a lot of potential, but it was executed in a truly tasteless, immature fashion, resulting in one of the biggest, and most dissapointing, messes of recent memory. I'm not saying I hated it, but pretty close. It's two solid hours that I will never, ever see again, and I feel cheated as a result. A film should leave you feeling good to have seen it, not saddened by the waste of time watching it. Wait for it on Movie Central in a few months. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched it. After seeing a cheap Czech movie, which got me a little bored, therefore I decided to watch some american (almost) block buster movie. A typical hollywood flick, You may expect. And so it was, the choice went on to see 'The Mexican'. What a relief it was. I didn't have to think at all during this movie, I just watched it! And I had a very good laugh at it. The storyline, although a little bit complicated (but not that much), was..., well..., good! The movie altogether has no flaws at all. Except maybe one - it is just too typical and everything in it is just plain simple. But hey, these are the rules of hollywood movies! I accepted them, I watched the movie and I had a great time.By the way, James Gandolfini is just great. I love every piece of his acting. No, I am not gey :)I highly recommend this movie to anyone, who wants to spend 2 hours having a great laugh. It is also good to watch with your girl/boy friend. I gave it a strong 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2/10 = One point for Brad Pitt, he was amazingly funny and another point for Julia, who would normally score much higher (I am one of the few that liked Mary O'Rielly), for her standard, superior performance.The whole plot is contrite and certainly predictable. For the two biggest stars in Hollywood one would think the producers (and their agents) could find something more credible.AND, to keep Brad and Julia apart for at least 75% of the movie leaves little to be desired. Although special kudos to James Gandolfini who is really the co-star to Ms. Roberts. The cinematography was excellent, too. In fact, if the Brad Pitt character was less prevalent and not on screen ? the movie might have made sense. Of course where would that leave Mr. Pitt?Unfortunately, a poor story and the overzealous dialogue burden the overall production. Only Ms. Roberts manages to bring this bomb floating up to sea level and onto the radar screen.Of course, if you are a Julia Roberts fan, then this is a must see, but do not expect any fireworks between Pitt and Roberts - nothing exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting modern take on the western genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by The Mexican. I didn't really have high opinions of Julia Roberts before the movie started, and to be honest I still don't. One of the major flaws with The Mexican was with THAT casting. Sure, she helped the box office figures a lot but she wasn't right for the role. Watching her argue in the film made me cringe; sorry, but to me Julia Roberts has developed an on-screen persona that embraces underdog victories, and the like. She's always innocent and naive in her movies causing us all to pity her, but here she is not. Seeing her in a not-so-perfect relationship which was wrecking her life wasn't....right, and I think the film could have benefited from different casting. Maybe it's good that she's straying from the uber-cutesy romantic-comedy popcorn movies.....but whatever. Still doesn't change my opinion. Also, the direction in this movie was a little hokey; not exactly stellar. Cinematography was decent. Oh, and it's also advertised as romantic comedy. It's not. More like an action/adventure/suspense (read: western) with a romantic subplot. Still, the storyline is pretty interesting and the script is tight. Pitt and Gandolfini had solid performances. All in all, worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film despite reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The Mexican is a film about fate and how it controls our destinies. The meaning of the opening shot is not even revealed until the end, and in between we get two interesting stories and some great humor. The first story is the story within the story about the poor gun maker who is making a gun to give to a wealthy commander as a gift for the commander marrying his daughter. This story is fed in parts pieced together from stories that are right in some ways and wrong in some others. In the end it is a story about true love. The second story is the one the movie is centered around. It involves Jerry (Brad Pitt) who is a reluctant criminal trying to get out of his business so he can be with his girlfriend Samantha (Julia Roberts). However Jerry has messed up his last job and is being forced to do one more thus causing Samantha to break up with him and go to Vegas (where they were planning to go together) with out him. Jerry's job is to go down to Mexico and retrieve the antique gun from the previous related story and bring it back to his boss. The gun is allegedly cursed and almost immediately causes Jerry to have problems as it is stolen from him. His bosses think he is trying to steal the gun and send a hitman to use Samantha as collateral. The hitman (James Gandolfini) and Samantha hit it off and have a little adventure of their own. The stories all come together in the end in a very subtle, cohesive way with the main point again being true love. The director, though not the greatest, does have very subtle techniques that add to the story, and Brad Pitt is very funny as the bumbling crook. An entertaining film if you are looking for something that is more than just a shallow story put on the screen to get two big stars together, but instead makes you think while also making you laugh and entertaining you. In fact Roberts and Pitt share very little screen time, but when they are together they work well together.</fullReview>

Although his character isn't too great, and he can't act like he did in 12 Monkeys, Fight Club or Snatch, he is really good as Jerry, the guy that goes to Mexico to recover the priceless gun.*** Julia Roberts. She is again terrific, managing to give depth and value to her absolutely annoying character.*** Some scenes in the movie - eg: the ones with the dog, especially when Pitt threatens him with the gun.*** Some lines in the movie. I ain't gonna stay here and tell you the lines i liked, you'll find that out by yourselves if you Forrest Gump your way through the movie.*** Gandolfini. Great actor, as he always was.BAD POINTS*** The fact that during the whole movie you have the feeling that you're watching a low class film. I don't know why is that.*** Some parts of the action, totally unappropriate. Eg: the 3 different stories around the gun.*** the ending. Well not all the ending, but the part after Roberts says "Wrong answer" and then... BANG!!!*** Some plot holes - including the fact that american citizens don't need passports to get to Mexico, which is an important part of the film.All in all, an enjoyable watch, but nothing out of the ordinary.

		<shortDescription>Marraige made in heaven????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fate meant that eventually producers would bring Julia and Brad together. After all, it would be bound to be a marriage made in money heaven. Fate says you will most likely go to see The Mexican due to the pulling power of it's two stars. Fate will also have it that you'll walk out, wondering whether you just wasted 2 hours. Not that The Mexican is bad, but it's not really that good either. The worst parts of the movie are when Jerry and Samantha (Brad &amp; Julia) are on screen together. There's no spark whatsoever, and their constant bickering.... well, it just irks. The true magic is between marshmallow hitman (soft on the outside and inside) Leroy (James Gandolfini) and Sam. They spend a lot of the movie together, and help to lift what otherwise would have been a total waste of time. Leroy's job is to `regulate funkiness' and he does it by acting as a listening ear to Sam's romantic problems. It's like an episode of The Soprano's, with our Tony's role reversed to the quack. And while Gandolfini is a fine actor, you can't help but think of Tony Soprano every scene he appears in. Julia Roberts does surprisingly well with the inane dialogue she's given through a lot of the movie. Her character is delivered warts and all, going for the slightly dowdy look rather than the big mouthed beauty we've become accustomed to. But every time she lets go of that wonderful smile, the screen lights up. Brad Pitt on the other hand is a major disappointment. He looks like he doesn't really know what he's doing in this movie. His gestures are over the top, and his comic timing, well, let's just say it needs work. Not that it's all his fault. The Mexican walks an uneasy line between romantic comedy and crime drama. Sadly, it fails to deliver on either account. It seems writer, J.H.Wyman, was trying to capture the heady mix of Lock Stock, and give it a Hollywood twist. But it's been twisted so far that it snapped. Clever writers entwine the threads of a story-line, usually resulting in a strong tale. The threads in The Mexican never quite meet, so that you're left with a handful of string. The Mexican, does however, deliver the odd brilliant line - `Guns don't kill people, postal workers do', `I'm not gonna Kill you, just shoot you. It's the American way' and `You've managed to Forrest Gump your way through this'. But the small handful of witticisms are not enough to rescue the movie. The common link between the characters and story lines is an ancient pistol that carries a curse. We're reminded of the fact ad nauseam. And it doesn't work. By the time you get the final telling of the 'legend', you wish the pistol had never been made. Bottomline, The Mexican has it's moments - most of them between Roberts and Gandolfini. The rest of the movie is a poor excuse to bring two big box office names together. But fate says that when I diss a movie, more of you go to see it. Just don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with my flatmate, and didn't know anything about it except the tagline. So, I was pleasantly surprised by the pace of "The Mexican" - it was fast, funny and engaging - almost. This was a very entertaining movie, but I wasn't convinced by - um - Leroy. At the risk of ruining the story, I'll just say that I don't think that that particular subplot really worked. It seemed like it was just dropped into the story without much justification.Anyway, Julia and Brad were a nice combination. They're both very charming actors, and made us all smile with their troubled relationship. I heard lots of sympathetic giggles from the audience!So, this is a good movie for a laugh, and sometimes that's all you need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recipe For Success?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take two of Hollywood's biggest earning and, arguably, best stars. Add in a sort-of famous and extremely good TV actor. Pump a relatively small budget in, and set the genre to rom/com/thriller. What do you get? A great love story with some quirky acting and edge of your seat moments? Or a mild mannered comedy that would like to be cool, but falls short by only a few metres? Ladies and gentlemen, the decision is yours.While there is nothing essentially wrong with The Mexican, it all plays out like a film never quite sure what it would like to be. There are some extremely humorous moments, there are some extremely touching moments, and yes, there are a few edge of your seat moments. But there are not enough stand out moments like this, and instead the action is replaced by too many conversations which are, quite simply, pretentious, and which sound like they was lifted straight from one of Beverly Hills 91210's slightly better episodes.Brad Pitt has more than proved himself as so much more than a pretty-boy actor. But after films such as Fight Club and Snatch, in which he pushed his acting abilities to the limit, The Mexican is a major step back for him. There's no doubt that he looks gorgeous with his blonde highlights and pseudo skater-wear, but there is simply no room here for him to engage his acting abilities. A sort of good-looking Forrest Gump type character, he stumbles from one incident to the next, looking more than a little bemused by the whole thing.Likewise, Julia Roberts, possibly the best actress in Hollywood at present, is given a character to play that is actually extremely dislikeable. Watching the film, I found myself hoping her and Brad wouldn't get back together in the end purely because I couldn't think of a worse possible punishment for him than having to listen to her moaning for the rest of his life!James Gandolfini, however, is a marvel. Having never seen The Sopranos, but aware of the reputation he has as a brilliant actor, I was blown away by his performance as a gay hitman. It is this performance that carries the whole film, and brings it near to being the quirky classic it would like to be.While The Mexican does have its faults, it's not as bad as some people would like to make out. It's about twenty minutes too long, the ending is slightly confusing (not so much a twist as a new storyline that doesn't really fit in anywhere) and the violence, on a few rare occasions, is unexpected and unwelcome. But if you forget all that and go in expecting nothing, you might have quite a pleasant experience. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were some good ideas in the script - some laughs, some soppy bits, a little bit of action. The real disappointment comes from imagining what the film could have been like if it hadn't been trying (and failing) to make a Deep And Meaningful point about love.Some of the plot twists are just arbitrary. Good plot twists should leave you saying 'Gee, that all makes sense now' rather than 'why on earth did they waste the last 90 minutes building up a character and then do THAT?'.If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, or if the romantic part of the film touches you, then you might be able to enjoy this film. Otherwise, I'd say it's the perfect film to watch on a plane: you don't miss out on much by seeing it on a small screen, and it's good way to waste 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post-modernly messy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some might term this a post-modern movie; the less charitable would think it a mess. It is incoherent and derivative, and lurches from one mood to another. One moment, there are touchy-feely psycho-babble sessions about relationships; the next, people are shooting each other dead - but without the style that enables Tarantino to bring that sort of thing off. There is lots of pseudo-Mexican colour, desert scenery, and background Mariachi and sub-Morricone music, but little of the gritty, sweaty menace of Desperado or a spaghetti Western. The plot is best ignored, and was possibly created by playing that party game where a paper is passed round a group of people, being folded so that no-one can see what the others have written. The pistol which all the fuss is about (the "Mexican" of the title) could at least have looked a bit more impressive and valuable. The flash-backs to the 19th century, showing the legend of the pistol, are embarrassingly wooden and sentimental, and lack the humour and style that might have made them work.(Incidentally, were the makers aiming at a record for the number of shots of characters sitting on the WC?) On a more positive note, fans of Julia Roberts and/or Brad Pitt will probably be able to take away some pleasant memories of their favourites. Both play the hands they've been dealt reasonably well - and both create a few laughs, justifying the use of the word "comedy" in the film's publicity. (On second thoughts, they probably picked their "hands", so they should take some of the blame!) For once, the kind of movie-goer who likes to say that various screen couples have no chemistry between them will be silenced, as this couple are not supposed to get on - except in bed, where we never see them together - and spend little time in the film with each other.The rest of the cast mainly play cardboard cut-outs, including mock Mexicans muttering lines about gringos through broken teeth; but James Gandolfini is a notable exception, with a sympathetic role as a gay heavy. As for uncredited Gene Hackman, whose character only appears in the last reel, one wonders just how he came to be in the movie. I hate to say that any movie isn't worth seeing, so I won't; but don't go with your hopes too high. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it on a plane if you must.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people flocked to theaters to see 'the new movie with Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts' and although their performances are adequate it's James Gandolfini who will raise eyebrows. His role as a cold-blooded hitman with emotional problems will be remembered long after this movie is forgotten. And it will surely be forgotten quickly, as there's just not enough here to keep us entertained for very long. A runtime of a little over two hours might not seem exceptional, but in this case it's about fortyfive minutes too long. The storyline can be summed up in two lines, and it's mind-boggling to see director Gore Verbinski stretch it out like this. Fact is that aside from Gandolfini, every character is wafer-thin and just not very interesting. One wonders why Gene Hackman bothered to show up for the last five minutes, as by that time we've all ceased to care about what happens next. another questionable turn of events is the way the movie seems to shift from a lighthearted comedy to a melodramatic fairytale. All in all I wouldn't exactly recommend this to anyone. See it on a plane if you must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie, despite Julia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that I went to see this film not particularly expecting to enjoy it. But I was proven wrong. Mostly. Brad Pitt has his usual charm, so that you can't help liking him in it, and he does a good job as the 'Anti-Steve McQueen', making fun of himself and his usual coolness. James Gandolfini, as usual, is excellent making what is essentially a cold-blooded killer into a likeable and sympathetic character (inspired casting as he sends up his character in 'The Sopranos')The main reason though that I was reluctant to see this movie was the presence of Julia Roberts. There is this certain something that Miss Roberts has that really annoys me. Maybe it's her particularly wide mouth, or maybe it's the fact that she seems to only do movies where she is portrayed as being this almost godlike beauty (see the first 5 minutes of Notting Hill if you don't believe me.) I really fail to see her appeal and, particularly since her character in this movie is meant to be an annoying woman thus making her almost unbearable, find myself avoiding films with her in them. To be fair to her she didn't annoy me in every scene she was in, but when she was acting with Brad Pitt she turned the annoying, full of herself, unreasonable cow switch up to 11. But forgetting about those parts, it is a fairly funny film and has a surprising cameo role at the end. (Don't look on the cast list on imdb if you wanna keep the surprise.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wannabe-independent but entertaining star vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see The Mexican, you realise just how big an influence the American independent cinema has had, and still has, on mainstream production. The Mexican is certainly not an indie. It is a straightforward studio film, but it adopts the now very profitable aesthetics (or lack of them) that independent productions introduced in the early 1990s, courtesy of Quentin Tarantino &amp; Co. All the trademark stuff is there: oblique camera angles, filtered colours, absurd dialogue and over-the-top ketchup violence etc. But the screenplay itself is hardly revolutionary: a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy/road movie, albeit with more than its fair share of twists and turns.It might sound a little bit hypocritical to fit a mainstream story into a non-Hollywood mould, but that is just where the film hits the right notes (and it's certainly preferable to a Hollywood story in a mainstream mould). The Mexican has an authentically independent feel to it, sufficient even to gloss over most of the script's stereotypes and clichs. One of the most glaring of these stereotypes is Julia Roberts' character, a hysterical woman who, even in her few shared scenes with co-star Brad Pitt, comes across as anything but likeable.Pitt ?n Roberts actually only share the screen for about fifteen minutes of the film's overlong running time, which is probably just as well, as they don't seem to have the right chemistry for a good screen couple. Both, though, give pretty convincing performances, aided and abetted by a hilarious contribution from James Gandolfini, of The Sopranos fame. The best scenes in the film feature him and Roberts in their quest for a long-lost mythical pistol called `The Mexican', which Pitt is also looking for in the parallel plot. Most of the film takes place in Mexico, resulting in the stylish images reminiscent of Traffic: yellow tones, a grainy picture ? but no subtitles in this case.Come to think of it, a comparison with Traffic is a good way of showing what independent cinema is all about. Traffic is a very honest film, in which director Steven Soderbergh had complete artistic control and was not afraid to do a third of the film with Spanish subtitles. Bowing to mainstream convention, on the other hand, a film like The Mexican is forced to depict Mexicans as dirty, hard-drinking layabouts speaking English, badly (American audiences being notoriously allergic to subtitles). This disrespectful depiction of the Mexican might not go down too well with some of the more discerning audiences hereabouts.Ultimately, though, The Mexican is a perfectly decent star vehicle. It offers quite a few laughs and is pleasantly laid-back. With its many twists, the story is always entertaining, and Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, though certainly not on Oscar-winning form, are still worth the price of a ticket. After all, it isn't often that both of Hollywood's biggest stars appear in one and the same film. The fact that they do is a real coup for director Gore Verbinski, who somehow managed to persuade both of them to take hefty pay cuts to grace his movie. The result is good entertainment ? no more, but certainly no less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did she ever win an Oscar ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all an interesting and often amusing tale of a clumsy criminal in search of a valuable pistol. But certainly not a great film.Brad Pitt portrays this criminal and I must say he does a pretty decent job. However, while I consider him to be one of the best actors around, this performance is little more than "slightly above average". In one of the first scenes (Julia Roberts throws luggage at him), his acting is even quite lame. My conclusion is that Brad Pitt should stick to serious acting and not try to be Woody Harrelson or something else he is not.Julia Roberts was excellent at playing the same character she has been playing for the last 20 years now, in every single movie she has been in. I still cannot believe they gave her an Oscar for repeating herself over and over again. I was actually reminded of Kevin Costner, another actor who, in every part, use the same gestures, the same ticks, the same looks, the same everything. It's almost like being in Groundhog Day...Please God, make them stop.James Gandolfini, now there is a performance. Even before the, blessed be thy name, SOPRANOS, this guy played a number of interesting characters, although mostly small parts. Well, this time it's bigger and even more interesting. If you're looking for one good reason to go see this film, well voila !Finally there was Gene Hackman, although one needs to wonder why... A very short, almost marginal appearance with absolutely no charisma. The actor from Unforgiven, French Connection and many other great movies was nowhere in sight. Acting on auto-pilot, no dedication as if he'd rather be out playing golf or something. 6/10 , but no more than that. Vaya con dios.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mexican" (2001). Directed by Gore Verbinski. Written by J. H. Wyman. Starring Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, James Gandolfini and Bob Balaban. Running Time: 123 minutes. Rated R. Overview: Jerry (Pitt) is an affable but inept errand boy for the underworld. His mob boss, Margolese (unseen and unbilled until the end of the film), is spending time in jail thanks to Jerry's bungling. To make up for the mishap, Jerry must run errands for Margolese's sinister lieutenant, Nayman (Balaban). After botching one job after another, he is given one last chance: drive down to Mexico, meet a man in a bar, and bring home a priceless pistol known as "The Mexican." Before he leaves, he quarrels with Samantha (Roberts) to whom he had promised to quit the mob and travel with her to Las Vegas. They split and he leaves for Mexico. While there, he alienates everyone he meets, doesn't get the gun, and arouses the suspicion of his bosses back home. They employ mysterious mob enforcer Leroy (Gandolfini) who kidnaps Samantha and motors to Mexico to find Jerry and secure the sought-after six-gun.Review: 1.5 Stars out of 4 Idea for a Hollywood story pitch: Cast two of today's brightest box office stars, keep them apart for most of the movie, and then let a burly guy with a beard steel the show. That's exactly what happens in The Mexican. Roberts and Pitt have very few scenes together, and when they do, they are less than dazzling. The only chemistry between characters involves Roberts and Gandolfini, whose Leroy has depth, complexity and some sly surprises. His scenes with Roberts actually enhance our interest in her character, too.Early in the film, Roberts and Pitt have a break-up scene where she hurls his belongings off the balcony as they endlessly argue about commitment and "blame-shifting." The camera lingers on this scene as if it were a fresh idea in filmmaking. With two of Hollywood's biggest names shouting at each other, what more can we ask for? Plenty. How about original storytelling and engaging dialogue? From there, the film continues to rely on road movie clichs, such as Roberts' attempt to escape through a bathroom window only to find Gandolfini waiting for her as she climbs down. These well worn set-ups, predictable enough in the script, are also telegraphed by the direction, with camera shots being composed in such a way as to anticipate the action.The film also tries but fails to combine several genres: road movie, romantic comedy and gangster flick. This has rarely been done effectively, with Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction a notable exception. The appearance of the mysterious Margolese at the end of the movie will remind viewers of famous films from the past, unintentionally emphasizing how far this film falls short in any genre.In addition to the Gandolfini character, another plus for the film is the use of sepia-toned flash-backs to present various versions of the pistol's legend. As in Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (or Edward Zwick's Courage Under Fire) none of the stories agree. These segments are creatively shot, intriguingly lit and add a certain fascination to the film. Mexican shooting locations also add visual zest, but the best reason to see this movie is to eavesdrop on Gandolfini and Roberts. ###</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie generally lame and tedious. Julia Roberts overacts and is not funny at all (if it is meant to be funny). Brad Pitt is OK and carries the film along. Photography is very good, but is Mexico and Mexicans supposed to look unflatteringly like this? This is not a comedy (a very mild one), not a human drama (not so intense with relationships) but grinds along with painful slowness around retreiving an ancient gun called the "Mexican" and the mishaps that follow. The movie is vaguely meant to be a comedy, I can see, but the humour is thinly stretched. The end is quite vague and anticlimatic -I couldnt get it about mixing up the assassins- but by then I was hoping this drudgery would end. I would rate it a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mexican gets an "A" for effort in the acting and production values, but an "I" for incomplete in the story area. Brad Pitt &amp; Julia Roberts are fine as the typical (now why are we so crazy about each other again?) love/hate drama couple, and James Gandolfini shines as a typecast (yet with a twist) gangster.I did enjoy the first hour or so of the film, as the twists and turns were keeping me enthralled, as well as the "fish out of water" element with Brad Pitt's character constantly losing the `Mexican' (a gun) in Mexico.But like so many movies that can't think of a good ending, the twists and turns became so plentiful and so implausible, I didn't care how the end turned out. In fact I think that was the point of the filmmakers: for audiences to lose interest in the plot, and as long as Brad &amp; Julia got together at the end, then everything would be A-OK. Well, I was entertained in the beginning and bored by the end. I would only recommend this film as a rental, especially when you have friends over because paying attention to the plot does not matter. (6 out of 10 stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad + Julia = zero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Mexican" is proof positive that just because two actors are huge stars doesn't mean they'll have good chemistry. The collaboration between these two and their $20 million asking prices makes sense: Shot mostly in Mexico, they could afford big stars. The script contains a lot of monologues and opportunities for improvisation. They're the kinds of roles actors can have some fun with. Pitt looks like he's having more fun than anyone. In fact, he out-acts most everyone tenfold, Roberts included. Maybe the film's creators understood from the beginning that Brad plus Julia equals zero steam. How else do you explain keeping them apart for most of the film? Fine by me. I didn't like any of their scenes together anyway. I attribute this to Pitt's dominance as an actor, at least in this particular film. He's in a zone and she didn't come to play. Pitt steals every scene.Gandolfini also gives an effective performance as a sensitive hit-man. This guy really needs to get away from the mafia/hit-man roles, though. Has he ever played anything other than a thug? Sure, his Tony Soprano (on "The Sopranos") is the Boss, but he's still a thug. His character in "Mexican" is supposed to be a break from his own type. I can just hear the phone conversation with his agent: Gandolfini: "I'm looking for something different. I'm tired of playing goons all the time." Agent: "Well, then have I got the role for you! A SENSITIVE hit-man!" Hopefully he'll move into deeper territory soon. If he continues in this path, he's short-changing himself. Right now, he's a draw. He's a star.The film's savior is its director, Gore Verbinski. His performers aside, it's apparent that he looked at J.H. Wyman's great script and knew exactly what to do with it. The film does lose its way toward the end, as it leaves the audience waiting a bit too long for anything consequential to happen. But Verbinski keeps the sharp, funny, unexpected visuals coming. Bringing with him a fresh, eye-grabbing style, he's one of those guys to watch...and he's only going to get better.If you're looking for a good movie to go out and see, you could definitely do worse these days than "The Mexican."Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, and James Galdofini, how could this movie possibly be this bad? It has to be the writers. This was the most uneven, ridiculous, stupid, unfunny, unexciting, uncool movie I have ever seen made by A level movie stars. They must be planning on selling this to the foriegn market or maybe it is just a case of spending all the budget on the stars and none on the rest of the crew.I could write a better screenplay than this B- movie has. Considering the abundance of bad movies that have been released in the last 18 months and even worse made for TV movies, I have come to the conclusion that the writers went on a work slowdown long ago. Why don't they just go on strike. Then they could fire them all and use "Replacements" who could easily write movies of the same name as well as supposed A level movies like the Mexican was touted to be.There is a message when a Chinese movie is rated so high in all categories by voters on this site. Could it be SATAN that is causing the quality of American films to go way downhill. Forget the writer's strike threat - lock them out and hire some fresh talent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really eager to see this picture being that I've been pleased with the roles that Julia Roberts has tackled in recent years (My Best Friend's Wedding, Erin Brockovich, Stepmom). She has grown tremendously in terms of her acting ability, and I was even more excited that Brad Pitt, another fine actor, would also be starring with her. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in the picture. As I sat through the movie I couldn't help but wonder whether or not Roberts and Pitt just wanted to work together badly or whether they just did it for their huge Hollywood salaries. They are both A-list stars, and I'm sure that they both have access to the best of scripts and directors, but this movie was just not one of them.The Mexican seems to be a movie which tries to blend both comedy and action simultaneously, but fails dismally in that attempt. The direction was sub-par and the screenplay just didn't add up. The acting performances of Pitt and Roberts were lackluster, and despite the fact that I do enjoy them as actors, they seem to have no chemistry together whatsoever. Not a highlight of either of their careers.</fullReview>

The theatre where I happened to watch the film was for the most part silent. As I was. Some of the humor is centered around Pitt and Roberts not being able to listen to each other, fighting for no reason at all, but still loving each other too much to leave. Get real, arguing is just not that funny after the first senseless fight.Pitt is sent to Mexico to retrieve a gun, worth..well nobody ever says, with a fabled tale surrounding it. He is so adept at getting himself into trouble and being downright stupid that I wondered what kinda criminal organization would send an idiot to get a valuable gun??Roberts part is weak but she does so much with it. She really goes thru an emotional rollercoaster and she makes you feel what she feels. The key to a good actress. And I'm not a Julia fan either. The director must've watched U-TURN with Sean Penn, cause I kept getting the feeling he was trying to capture the same aura. Difference being, Penn was not stupid, unlucky maybe, but not stupid as Pitt is in this film. All in all, wait til the video comes out and rent two cause this will probably be disappointing to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocrity at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me go ahead and state my unpardonable bias right off the bat: I am a big fan of both Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. I thought Pitt's work in "Fight Club" was genius, and I loved every sappy, cliche-ridden moment of "Notting Hill." There. I feel much better now (and while I'm on a roll -- I think Kevin Costner is criminally underrated). The big question, though, when I sat down to watch "The Mexican" was: What version of a Pitt / Roberts movie would this be? For every challenging, well-written film they've done, there's also a dud lurking in the shadows. So, would this be "Seven" or "Seven Years in Tibet"? "Erin Brockovich" or "Runaway Bride"? The answer, if I can keep a foot in both camps, is a little bit of both. And all that saves it from "I Love Trouble" territory is an actor best known for his work on television.Much has been made of this Pitt-Roberts pairing, the two $20 million-plus superstars joining forces for what would presumably be a megawatt jolt of charismatic nirvana. Well, let's just stop right there. Roberts is no doubt deserving of the superstar billing -- the streak she's on at the moment is, in a word, unprecedented. Pitt, on the other hand, as much as I admire him, should really be glad he's making what he is, and that no studio honchos have caught on to the fact that he's only been responsible for one big runaway hit, and that was "Legends of the Fall," almost seven years ago. "Seven" was such a crafty, gimmicky movie that it would have been a hit without him, and "Interview with the Vampire" starred another little actor named, oh, Tom Cruise. Apart from those two, what do we have? "Meet Joe Black," anyone? How about "The Devil's Own"? "Sleepers"? One of the reasons I like Pitt is that he searches out risky material, but he seems to be more a superstar in theory than in practice. So "The Mexican"'s publicity department handicaps the movie right away by giving it a hype that it couldn't hope to meet.The story itself is Tarantino-lite / pseudo film noir silliness that we've seen a hundred times in the wake of "Pulp Fiction." Jerry (Pitt) is assigned to travel south of the border and retrieve a gun (rumored to be cursed) for his crooked boss, played by Bob Balaban with his usual delectable smarminess. Complicating things is the fact that Samantha (Roberts), Jerry's addicted-to-self-help girlfriend, dumps him and takes off for Vegas. It's on this trip that Samantha is, oops, kidnapped by Leroy (James Gandolfini), a thug ostensibly hired by Jerry's boss to make sure he doesn't make off with the gun once he has it in his hot little hands.For the next hour we cut back and forth between Jerry in Mexico and Samanta and Leroy in Vegas (among other places), and this is my one big criticism of the film. These scenes are cut together so that they stand on their own as little vignettes. That sounds nice, but what happens is that, with each fresh cut, we meet some new characters, get introduced to a subordinate conflict, solve that problem, and then -- screeeeeeeeeeech! -- slam on the brakes and cut back to the other half of the couple, ruining whatever momentum had been accumulated. After eight or ten repetitions, I couldn't help but feel that director Gore Verbinski is only the latest in the attention-deficit-disorder school of directing. There are some nice touches within these scenes (a phone conversation between Jerry and Samantha, an important recurring fascination with traffic lights), but they don't add up to much. Not helping matters were the obnoxious sepia-toned flashbacks wherein we see the variations to the cursed gun myth (complete with the totally inappropriate whiring and clicking of an old-school movie projector), and loads of wild 'n' wacky plot twists that most people will see coming a mile away. Oh, and there's also an unforgivably obtrusive product-placement gaffe involving Balaban and a bag of Doritos.What makes the film worth seeing is James Galdofini as Leroy, the hooligan with a secret. I freely cop to the fact that I've never seen an episode of "The Sopranos," and therefore was largely unprepared for the excellence Galdofini would bring to this role. Leroy could have been just another stereotypical gangster character, but as inhabitated by Galdofini, he comes off as conflicted, tortured, and very, very human. Pitt and Roberts certainly look nice during their brief time together on the screen, but Galdofini is the real deal. In a movie that wants so badly to be postmodern and cool, Leroy is the living, breathing, romantic heart that shows what could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOLIERS***This is a very flat, somewhat predictable, mostly by-the-numbers excuse to put Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt together on screen. Surprisingly, they share very little screen time. The more interesting of the pairings is James Goldofini which the ads and preview fail to mention. Unfortunately, he is the best reason to go see the movie.People have commented that the plot of the movie is Taratino-esque. I think those people are Tarantino fans who want to make sure people don't forget this very talented actor. Otherwise, if I were Tarantino, I would be insulted to be associated with this movie.The movie isn't terrible by any means, just disappointing and not a good buy at $8/$9/ticket. While the movie may have good direction at some points, and also good interesting twists and turns, it is also rather pointless in the grand scheme of things, and not very funny, and somewhat confusing. Part of the problem is that the ads prepare you to see a comedy. It wasn't even a dark comedy -- which would have been greatly interesting given Julia Roberts' track record.The basic plot: Jerry (Pitt) has to retrieve a gun, terribly named "The Mexican," for some LA-esque hoodlums. Unfortunately, this retrival exercise strains Pitt's and Roberts relationship, b/c Jerry is suppose to go at the same time as their plan to go to Las Vegas. Jerry has problems retrieving the gun b/c of its accursed nature, so Jerry's gang hires a thug to kidnap Roberts in an effort to persuade Jerry into retrieving the valuable gun, rather than take it for himself.Major Problems: The kidnapping is nothing more than a futile excuse to add some lines and give some comedy to Julia Roberts' role, and to more humanize the kidnapper/kidnappee relationship. Jerry has always been loyal. In fact, Jerry's best friend in the outfit has been even more loyal. With those two facts, why did the outfit feel fit to kidnap Roberts or even send Jerry in the first place? Sure, Jerry hasn't always been thorough with his work, but if this is so important, why send him at all? It makes more sense to send the kidnapper, who was suppose to be the most loyal of them all.The Script Just Wasn't That Funny: seriously, I only laughed like two times and I like both actors. I was even looking forward to seeing this movie. I was really let down. The problems with its humor are too numerous to and too specific to count here.What's The Point?: A good theme the movie played on was suppose to be a way to discover the meaning behind relationships. "When is enough enough? When do you say that you can't take it anymore?" This is a good theme to explore and will never tire of discussion. Unfortunately, this movie flat out misses this point, at best lightly skirting around the point (Pitt and Roberts' relationship; Winston's sexuality; the stories behind the gun) to try to play to silly visual humor and poorly times one-liners. While missing good points might not be the end-all/be-all of a movie, the lack of anything else interesting, in combination, is -- which results in the movie we have here. Gene Hackman's cameo performance then turns out to be a waste of time.In the end, it doesn't really matter does it? All it shows is that if you put two big stars together, people will go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful entertaining film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what some of the critics were doing while watching this film, but we enjoyed it tremendously. Julia was wonderful and funny and beautiful and just plain fun. Brad Pitt was very funny and I thought he did a good job. James Gandolfini was simply spectacular, he was tough,funny and fantastic. I hope we get to see more of him soon. All I want is a good time when I go to the movies. So to the critics, get another job. It was a completely entertaining film that showed great chemistry between Julia, Brad and Jim Gandolfini. What more do you want?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Gun Pornography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie treats guns like porno films treat naked people. Shooting a gun is something all the main characters do at least once. People dying as a result is treated in a fairly offhand manner. Real guns abound and imaginary ones are fired in the hands of little children. An old pistolero is photographed as beautifully as any old-time Hollywood movie queen...and when it GOES OFF, baby that's the CLIMAX. Rarely has any movie been so determined to romanticize guns, bullets, and gunfire. True, the story is ABOUT a gun, but more than that, it's the LEGEND of a gun that the plot addresses. That's fair enough, and it's a good story. Dumped on top of that like gasoline on a fire however is the weird contemporary MOVIELAND LIE about guns...that everyone has one and shoots it and people get killed but it's NO BIG DEAL and doesn't get in the way of TRUE LOVE and a HAPPY ENDING. This is how MORE and MORE movies are using guns...like they're a cliche that has stopped having any real meaning in life. It's like there's a scriptwriting key command for "insert gunfire here." The Mexican has so much of this that the end result is BORING GUN PORNOGRAPHY. If I had had a gun while watching this, I would have enjoyed FIRING IT AT THE SCREEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>im not a big Brad Pitt fan, or i wasnt before "Meet Joe Black" came out, but now having seen "The Mexican", i can say i admire his acting skills. i was very impressed with the way he and Julia Roberts worked together. i hope to see them as a team again sometime. i hope this is not considered as a spoiler since it was in the trailer, but my favorite humorous parts have to be when Jerry (Pitt) spouts off things like "El -Camino!" and "I need a lift in your El trucko, to the next towno!" it was very comical to watch him struggle to understand spanish. Sams' (Roberts) speech about how Jerry managed to "Forrest Gump" his way through the ordeal was funny as well. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone in need of a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this quirky little thing! I didn't expect much after seeing the rotten commercials, but I found it very well-written and irreverent. The "Tarantino-esque" claims are baffling, because the violence is extremely low key in comparison. The side-stories about the gun are charming--without them, "The Mexican" would be a lot more dull and flat. The heart of this film is very romantic, and that's what caught me. So go! Turn your brain to "low", and try not to pay more than matinee price....you'll be pleasantly surprised!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT Recently, I saw The Mexican starring Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. When I saw the previews for the movie, I couldn't wait to see it because I truly thought it was a romantic comedy. Well, it was funny at parts but the real meaning behind the story is what really kept me glued to the seat. Pitt and Roberts share an unbalanced relationship in the movie. Pitt works for mob and is sent on a mission to mexico to retrieve a legendary gun for his mob-boss who's in jail at the time. At that same time Roberts and Pitt had planned to go to Vegas and they break up because he now has to go on this trip or else "he's dead!" Well I'll skip to the exciting parts. Pitt goes to Mexico, finds the gun, but none the less has problems along the way including losing the gun numerous times. The other plot of the story follows Roberts as she get kidnapped, becomes close to her kidnapper, and they also have problems along the way. The most beautiful part of the story is when we finally find out what is so special about the gun and learn the legend behind that story. It's like a fairy tale! Only then do Roberts and Pitt realize their love for each other. Who knew you could learn so much from a gun? It's a beautifully made gangster/romance/comedy/drama movie. I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who likes that kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was disappointing right from the start. I knew it was a bad sign when I hardly got a chuckle out of the opening balcony scene, and we were only 10 minutes into it. The movie seemed like a bunch of 2 minute skits, all put together as one. Brad and Julia hardly had any scenes together, which is a mistake, and James Gandolfini's appearance in the movie added nothing beyond which everyone already knows of him. Brad Pitt did have a few funny scenes, but not nearly enough to keep this movie afloat. I call this movie a 20 minute checker....I was checking my watch every 20 minutes in the theater....not a good sign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Mexican Don't Need No Steeeenking Badges!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a truism: Romantic comedies are neither romantic nor funny. They are a simple excuse by filmmakers to gather clueless middle and upper-middle class people in a dark setting to sell them popcorn and soda at inflated prices.In this particular bit of piffle, the Mexican, bankable stars Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt are the two pretty faces enlisted- at $20 million a pop each- to sell us this thoroughly awful story. Actor Nick Nolte has said that if performers continue to give the same johnny one note performances in film after film, the public will eventually abandon them like yesterday's newspaper. Apparenty Julia and Brad haven't gotten the news yet. Brad's roles have been going downhill since Thelma &amp; Louise. Julia has not been good since Mystic Pizza.Brad is a semi-criminal, in romantic trouble with girlfriend Julia. He wants to make one last score. Gene Hackman and Bob Balaban want him to recover a mythic hand-crafted firearm called the Mexican. Brad planes to Mexico to get the weapon and hires a fancy ranchero-like truck to get around in.This is a mistake. Romantic comedies feature the two leads first falling in love, then having a minor tiff that makes them fall out of love, and finally- comes the dawn- binding up their wounds and agreeing to love one another forever, or at least until the end of the movie. But this movie decides to separate the two lovers from the get-go.Not to worry. Someone has hired James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano of the HBO Sopranos) as a sympathetic hitman to kidnap Julia in case Brad tries absconding with the Mexican. James and Julia get along famously. She learns that he is gay. He tries to explain the man's point-of-view. She discovers Gandolfini's soft underbelly. The Hitman spots another middle-aged gay in a restaurant and with Julia's approval, hustles him. The Three of them cavort in a hotel room where Julia, unaccountably, wears a green t-shirt with a picture of a young Paul Newman on it. Gandolfini, the lover surrogate planted by the filmmakers to keep Julia occupied while Brad is on the road, is very winning, exchanging sentimental twaddle with her in small beaneries and hotel rooms.But, flash (=spoilers=), the middle-aged gay lover is dead on the sidewalk from a hotel balcony fall. Gandolfini has to kill another hitman, and now the two ramble off to Mexico to join Brad chasing the mcguffin (a Hitchcock term meaning any dumb item the protagonists in a film are pursuing): The Mexican. And almost the first thing Brad does is shoot Tony Soprano. The only love story and personal chemistry we have seen so far is that between Gandolfini and Roberts. But the clueless Brad hasn't been watching any part of the movie but his own. Gandolfini must have had some clout on the film. Before being shot by Pitt during a tire-changing exercise, Gandolfini passes on an opportunity to off Brad first, leaving the audience with the impression that for a gay hitman, he's a pretty nice guy.The killing of Gandolfini is a major mistake in the story. But the filmmakers compound it by having Julia at first be angry with Brad for doing it, but then FORGIVE him for it, presumably because of the invisible panache and loving personality that he presents to her. The audience wants Gandolfini to rise from the dead and put a bullet in both Roberts and Pitt.The film meanders to an end with some half-baked showdown between Brad and Gene Hackman, who deserves a rap for contributing his waning integrity to this terrible film. Brad and Julia are happily reunited, the stupid fable of the gun is told.But I've forgotten to tell you about this ferocious dog the filmmakers tried to use for laughs in this alledged comedy. The mutt comes with a deflated football in its mouth, as a booby prize, when Brad is forced to buy a rambling wreck of a truck to continue his pursuit. The Dog goes with it. The Dog is supposed to be funny. It is even less funny than the other jokes in the film. But if you think the Dog is funny, you will like this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, richer than billed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer leads one to expect a romantic caper movie, but "The Mexican" turns out to be stranger, more quirky, than that. The characters played by Pitt and Roberts spend most of the film separated -- probably a good thing, since they would likely run out of things to do fairly quickly -- and the story has more violence and stunning plot twists than anticipated.Pitt plays a young tough in thrall to a crime boss sent on one last job into Mexico to fetch a beautiful historic pistol with a curse on it. His girlfriend Roberts wants him OUT of the crime business and dumps him at the beginning of the film to seek her fortune in Vegas. (They've been posing as a married couple in group therapy, so they often resort to psycho-speak in their arguments.) Instead, she runs into killers working for various unknown parties who use her as a hostage to make sure Pitt delivers the gun and does not use it for his own ends. Pitt gets stuck in Mexico with big problems trying to find, and then hold onto, the gun.The real center of the movie is the growing relationship between Roberts and her primary captor, "Leroy," played with much depth as well as humor by James Gandolfini.The soundtrack is perky and amusing, and there's a lovely running visual gag with traffic stoplights. At least three soft focus flashbacks recount the highly dubious story of the pistol's romantic and mysterious history -- true or not, it makes little difference. The movie sports a few plot twists that are a bit much, and is a little too exhaustively long for its genre, but in all, a highly entertaining piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could pairing Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in a romantic-action-comedy be a bad thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie. I tried to like this movie. There where a few clever, subtle, jokes that were amusing but as I found myself checking my watch I knew that I was just making the best of a bad movie experience. The first thing that I noticed was that the film was green. I guess that they were trying to create a dingy washed out look, but after the first oppressive, nauseating, half hour I couldn't help thinking that this was one of the ugliest looking films I've ever seen. The plot was thin, hokey, and bordering on completely absurd. The dialogue concerning romantic relationships was forced at best and at worst embarrassingly stupid. Of course the biggest question is why would they make a movie with two of the biggest stars in Hollywood and have them share only about 10 minutes of screen time? Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts are two of my favorite actors. Fight Club, Seven, Notting Hill, My Best Friends Wedding; I loved them. So how could pairing Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in a romantic-action-comedy be a bad thing? If you want to find out go see The Mexican.</fullReview>

Why have big name stars who are supposed to be romantically attached play in roles in a story which essentially keeps them separated during most of the flick. Thus, it was not a romantic flick. And it wasn't a comedy either. In fact it wasn't much of anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a Roberts/Gandolfini buddy picture, than a Roberts/Pitt romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** SPOILER ALERT!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!! *** *** EVERYBODY LOCK YOUR DOORS!!!!! ***When it comes to movies, I seem to be an atypical guy. Most guys I know cringe at the thought of seeing a romantic comedy, "chick flicks" they call them, yet I embrace them.Movies are just stories acted out and put on film. The way I see it, if the plot is solid, and the actors give good performances, I'll get sucked in no matter whether it's a rip roarin' adventure, a political thriller, a slapstick comedy, a scary slasher film, or a "chick flick". So, I went into "The Mexican" looking to be entertained. I wasn't.The plot follows Brad Pitt on a job from the mob to steal a legendary antique gun, known as "The Mexican" from... well... Mexico! This is supposedly Pitt's last job, a fact that Julia Roberts (as Pitt's girlfriend) doesn't care to accept. She drives off in a huff to Las Vegas, where she is kidnapped by James Gandolfini, to be used as "insurance" that Pitt will indeed complete the task at hand.Okay... the good things. The three principle leads... Roberts, Pitt, and Gandolfini, all play their individual roles well. When Roberts and Gandolfini are in the same scenes, they exude a magnetism that is fun to watch. (Especially when it is revealed that James is homosexual!) Pitt plays a likeable, bumbling criminal, and you really do root for him to complete his task.The scenery is wonderful, and offers intriguing locals such as a barely lit tunnel through a hill, and various small Mexican towns with very narrow streets.The little mini-movies that show the legend of the gun are interesting, and are filmed to give them an "artificially aged" looked.The legend itself was nicely wrapped up in the end, and gave a satisfying feeling of closure.Now, the bad things...The movie is marketed as a romantic comedy between Roberts and Pitt. Yet, there are few scenes with both of them together, and when they do play off each other, they bicker and yell and fuss and whine. I don't go to a movie to see that. I've broken up with past girlfriends because we interacted in the same annoying fashion. I sure as hell don't want to spend $8 to see bickering on the big screen!There is excellent chemistry between Roberts and Gandolfini, which is unlikely for one main reason. He was sent to kidnap her and use her as "insurance". He even hints that should Pitt not complete his task, he may be forced to kill her. SO WHY DOES HE BEFRIEND HER SO QUICKLY??? OR AT ALL????? I know nothing about criminals, but it seems to me that if you are sent to kidnap somebody, you should NOT get emotionally involved with them. You should act as imposing and threatening to them as humanly possibly, so they will discover NO weaknesses of yours, lest they try to get the best of you. Yet, Gandolfini not only befriends Roberts, he confesses to her that he is homosexual, and then has a special night with a postal worker he picks up in a diner! HUH???? WHA?!?!?!?Too many peripheral characters (and a few supporting roles as well) seem to switch sides too often. I'm all for a twist or surprise ending, but when characters go from being bad to good, to not who you thought they were, to bad to good again, it'll make your head spin.And one thing that made me want to scream at the screen (except I was in a theater with my wife, and that would've been embarrassing...) was the scene where Roberts is in a Mexican hotel room, and a criminal (or maybe he was a good guy, I don't recall) rushes in, and ransacks the room looking for the gun. He pulls open dresser drawers, flings clothes out of suitcases, overturns trash cans, and then splits. The camera then shows us that Roberts was hiding (with gun strapped to her thigh) IN BETWEEN THE TWO MATTRESSES on the bed!!!!! Okay, I know Julia is slim, but FOR GOD'S SAKE, wouldn't the criminal see that the mattresses weren't laying flat???? Plus, if you are going to ransack a room, and you are looking for something very important, wouldn't you grab the mattresses and toss them to the side???? Under the mattress is one of the most common hiding places in the world! Whether it's extra cash, porno, or your stash, EVERYBODY hides stuff under the mattress. That this criminal was unaware of this, completely frustrated me.So, in closing, I think that Pitt and Roberts would make a good romantic team, if only they'd (a) spend more than 10% of the movie together, (b) they'd respectfully interact with one another... no more whining!!!, and (c) if it didn't have an madcap adventure caper to back it up.Thank you. :^)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****POSSIBLE SPOILERS**** Just saw this yesterday. Julia Roberts turns in a good performance but is a little bit annoying after awhile. I know a lot of people think that Brad Pitt is the greatest looking man in the world and all that but the guy has serious limitations as an actor. James what-his-name as a gay person. Puuuleeeeeezze! It is now very fashionable and hip to have gay characters in TV and movies but this is bit of a stretch. The appearance of Gene Hackman at the end was certainly a welcome surprise. The movie switched so much from violence to comedy that I felt that it trivialized some of the scenes in which certain characters were killed. There were times where I was taking some of the scenes very seriously yet I would hear a fair amount of other people in the theater laughing. Wait until it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The previews and trailers for this film seem to indicate that it is a romantic comedy.It's not. The newspaper ads with critical reviews call it a "roller coaster" action film.It's not. My local paper's expose on the film called it a character study in relationships.It's not. The Mexican is a classic example of doing many things badly, rather than doing one thing very well. The plot line is reminiscent of Tarantino, Rodreguz, or Ritchie. So expect the foolishly foiled caper laced with light comedy. From that point, the script tries to blend in the relationship study, some interesting characters, and a romantic comedy feeling. Unfortunately, there's just too much going on here for any one piece of the puzzle to shine, and the whole movie turn out unfulfilling and short of any marks. So, if you are looking for romantic comedy, this isn't it.If you are looking for a roller coaster action film, this isn't it.If you are looking for a character study in relationships, this isn't it.It's really quite unfortunate for Brad Pitt, who has a very good history of selecting good roles in fine films. Watching this, one can see how the script could be very exciting and enticing. Had this film done all things well, it very well could have been great. Whoops. Better luck next time.</fullReview>

Pitt's character is just plain annoying throughout. I had to laugh how guns are so casually waved around in Mexico, where they are illegal. Want to smuggle a loaded handgun on an international flight? Just wrap it in tin foil and put it in a lunch box or wrap it in a shirt. Yeah. No problem. Just an example of the leaps of faith this movie takes to move its plot along. Anyone ever notice how much Pitt's and Robert's nostrils look alike? I found myself noticing these things at about the 90 minute mark. Not a terrible movie, but it has many problems. Find something else to spend your date money on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a nice mix of the familiar--- late-generation gangster flick, oddly juxtaposed with New Age relationship noise--- with the rare. The "legend" scenes reminded me of the Mexico of "The Wild Bunch". The relationship between Julia and her kidnapper was hilarious. I think lukewarm reviewers expected too much of a Pitt-Roberts pairing. This was a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mexican turns out to be quite boring. The writers forgot to give us any reason to care about any of the characters. There is no real chemistry between Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. I kept looking at my watch and was amazed at how little time had passed. In short, who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does a movie like this get made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would have compelled two of the world's biggest stars toplay a numbskulled gun-for-hire and a numbskulled aspiringwaitress, respectively? How is it that the bright folks atDreamWorks never noticed that...a) it doesn't make sense for the mob to watch lovable lug Brad Pitt screw up every job he's ever done for them...and THEN, asPUNISHMENT, hand him an even bigger job: tracking down anantique gun in Mexico;b) it doesn't really work to have a hit man (James Gandolfini)abduct Pitt's girlfriend (Julia Roberts) to make sure Pitt stayshonest...when the girlfriend and the sensitive hit man spend theentire movie sobbing in diners about their failed relationships. Weknow he won't harm her; shouldn't we think, at least for the first fewminutes they're together, that he might?The movie lurches from tone to tone in a patchwork way that, Iguess, is supposed to be Tarantinoesque, but just seemsincoherent. There are about six scenes that involve peoplesquatting on the pot and/or peeing. (No explanation given for this,except that the screenwriter is either a Peter Greenaway fan or anundinist.) The screwball characters are uncharming and the plothas no engine. The movie drags on and on past Ending #1, #2...what got this movie made? Apparently, at one point, THE MEXICANwas a hot script. (Even David Fincher wanted to do it.) Whoscrewed it up?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care what anyone has to say about this film, I liked it and thought it was great fun. It was great to see two really good actors taking a chance on a small move and making it one of the best films I have seen in a while. I would hope that more actors would do the same and continue to develop their art without pressure to always produce a block-buster. If I have to pay big bucks to see a movie, I would rather see something like this then the mindless crap that is coming out most of the time. I highly recommend this film to anyone who still likes to see actors in a really good performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I the only one who liked this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do believe that every single review I have read of The Mexican has said to stay away from the movie, that The Mexican is awful. I watched this movie the night before it came out with seven other people, and all eight of us thought the movie was absolutely wonderful. True, it was not exactly what I thought it would be judging by the trailer, but I hate trailers that tell you the movie (Autumn in New York).Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts are an unwed couple having problems. Pitt plays Jerry, an idiot who is working as a criminal to pay off a debt. Roberts plays Sam, a high-strung woman angry that Pitt won't get out of his job and go to Vegas with her. So when Pitt goes to Mexico to retrieve a cursed gun called the Mexican, Roberts takes off for Vegas. Things go south, so to speak, and Roberts is kidnapped by James Gandolfini, playing his usual mobster/tough guy role. Pitt runs around Mexico trying to find the gun, Roberts tries to run from Gandolfini, and chaos ensues.Many people complained this movie was terrible, but with no real reasons as to why, so I'll give you my reasons why I liked it. First of all, Brad Pitt plays a role that is a total departure from his normal ones. His last two movies he played a hard hitting fighter (Snatch, Fight Club), and in the past he hasn't done too many comedies that I can remember. However, in The Mexican he shows that he can get laughs, and plays the part of a moron a little to well. Roberts is wonderful, as usual, and that is all there is to that. Gandolfini doesn't do anything different than normal, which isn't bad, but it would be nice to see him try something a little different. That doesn't mean he should be chastised for his role here, because he does a great job in it.The Mexican did run a little long, and there were some parts that dragged by. But I watched this movie running on just a few hours sleep and had no problems at all staying awake. The time Roberts and Pitt spent onscreen together was fantastic, and all those who are complaining they were apart for so long, it is in the script, so you have to have two big names and two good actors to keep the two separate sides of the story going. I suppose maybe my friends and I were the only ones who liked it, but that is probably because when we go to see a movie, we go to enjoy the movie, not pick it apart like a bunch of anal critics. The Mexican is enjoyable, funny, and definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Mismarketed Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing "The Mexican" and all I can say is WOW... I'm a 22 year old college senior. I have not seen a single commerical for 'The Mexican' that was targeted at me. Every clip, poster and spot felt like yet another soft-lensed romantic moment invoking the on-screen charisma deserving of the sensitive stars of 'Legends of the Fall' and 'Pretty Woman'... If you go to this movie, you're not getting the Brad Pitt from 'Snatch' and 'Fight Club', and the Julia Roberts of 'Conspiracy Theory' and 'My Best Friends Wedding'. But don't worry folks, just unclench those buttocks and let yourself be pulled along for the ride, this is a great movie that tells a unique story. The plot defies predictability. It doesn't pull any punches, yet the camera doesn't bathe in the blood as in 'Hannibal'. People were so outraged at 'American Beauty' for its depiction of violence and lust, that they missed the transcendent tale that was occurring. This movie is going to draw some heat from people for being violent. It's going to be wrongly classified as resembling 'From Dusk til Dawn' just because it goes across the Mexican border. These are all misconcepts. If you liked 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Pulp Fiction', you should like this movie. If you tend to avoid Pitt and Roberts for being girlie movie cuddleporn, then have no fears about this. If you're a Soprano's-watching James Gandolfini fan, then you'll get a kick out of seeing him in a new role with differing motivations. If you're looking for something droll and comforting that toes the PC line and targets a middle-aged demographic... well then, you're going to probably be more happy with fare like 'What Women Want'. In short, I really liked this movie. I'm a college senior on a short budget, but I've sworn to get this on DVD as soon as it comes out. Watch it, you should like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual, when a movie that I look forward to seeing comes out, I read the reviews and read comments from other IMDB members. After reading the comments about The Mexican, I actually had second thoughts about seeing the movie, but I'm glad that I listened to my instincts and saw the movie.First of all, there were many flaws and holes in the story overall. It was also too long. But, the movie was entertaining and energetic. Of course with great actors like Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in the same film, you expect a phenomenal outcome. Their performances were great comically, and Roberts once again has put more depth into her character than we have seen before in her more lighthearted films (i.e. My Best Friends Wedding)..This film is definitely not that. I saw a little blend of Pulp Fiction and Traffic in the movie, but also containing many comedic elements. The audience laughed hysterically throughout most of the film, so I could tell that they were enjoying it.So my review would be, that the film was not excellent, or really even close, but definitely worth watching. It was an entertaining and funny film and the acting by the entire cast was great. I happen to be a fan of both of the lead actors though.... I am usually a pretty hard judge of movies and I still managed to enjoy it a great deal, but it could be because my expectations were fairly low!Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir wrapped in a heartwarming package in order to fool the stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I debated whether or not to see The Mexican, because of its ambiguous advertising - was it a shmaltzy, light hearted romantic comedy piece of garbage aimed at the lowest common denominator of moviegoers, the people who want an insipid piece of celluloid to go "awww" over Julia Roberts? Was it a neo noir flick like I was hoping? Or was it something different altogether?I broke down and decided to see it, mostly just to finally find out what kind of movie it was exactly, and I walked away with a weird feeling not unlike the one you'd get after seeing a David Lynch flick. Part of it is because I still don't know what the movie was aiming for. It's a neo noir flick, undoubtedly, but it still has that touch of insipid romantic comedy in it. Add cartoonish yet brutal violence to that, and you get something that leaves me confused. The juxtaposition of it all almost made me want to break down and laugh while watching it, but while it had that quality, it didn't have enough of it to make it an unintentional comedy like your average cult shlock action film.It could have been so much more. We get so few neo noir films today compared to all the other genres they're cranking out by the truckload, and the lack of truth in advertising and lack of focus in the movie itself went a good ways toward ruining this one. Though it's extremely fun to come here and read all these reviews from the plebeians who wanted a "delightful" sugary piece of heart warming Julia Roberts trash. (Ha, go watch Beaches, ya gallery dwellers.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the previews for this movie, I just couldn't believe that Brad Pitt had stooped to the usually-low depths of a Romantic comedy, especially after his AMAZING roles in quirky movies like "Fight Club" and "Snatch." However, "the Mexican" is FAR from any ordinary Romantic comedy...it's Romance meets a bit of black comedy meets Tarantino (with a bit more feeling) meets a great tale. This postmodern adventure is equally hilarious as it is serious. While the comic mishaps of Pitt, Roberts, and Gandolfini (all AMAZING in their respective roles) dominate, nevertheless there are deeper thematic currents about the nature of love, fatalism, etc. that keep the movie balanced. The direction was terrific, the script was fresh and original, but the true highlight of the film had to be the actors themselves. You could tell they were having the time of their lives in their roles...Gandolfini is now a cinematic force to be reckoned with! Don't let the trailer fool you...this is an incredibly witty, vibrant movie that is definitely worth the price of your movie ticket. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprise to everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you heard those wild spun tales about how that old relic that sits in your living room got into your family's hands? Or have you heard the tales of the blessing or curse that lays among it? With THE MEXICAN the old relic is a fancy Mexican pistol that is very valuable for both personal and profitable reasons. And leave it to a unlucky fella who is cursed when he gets hold of the gun. THE MEXICAN starts off with a not seen, but heard car accident on Laurel Canyon Drive in Los Angeles. Then we see a very worried and upset Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt), as he sits on his bed with his eyes wide open. His girlfriend Samantha Barzel (Julia Roberts) isn't aware of Jerry's problems, since she still thinks that the two are still going to Las Vegas to start a new life. But Jerry gets a job from his imprison boss' attorney (Bob Balaban). You see, Jerry has fouled up so many jobs before due to poor judgement, that he is given one last and easy job. The job is to go to Mexico, meet a young man by the name of Beck (David Krumholtz) retrieve a infamous Mexican pistol, and bring both the gun and Beck back to the U.S. Well, Jerry has no choice, his partner/friend (J.K. Simmons) advises him that it would be wise to accept the job, since Jerry has messed up his other "this is my last job" assignments. Jerry goes to Mexico, drives a El Camino (since that is the Mexican style automobile) and finds both the gun and Beck. But when an intoxicated Beck is slowly making his way to Jerry's rental, a bullet from random gun shooting in the air, lands and kills Beck. But to make matters worse, the El Camino where the pistol is put earlier gets stolen. Now Jerry is in very hot water. Flash-forward on Interstate 15 on the way to Las Vegas, Samantha stops at a outlet mall and is almost killed by a hit-man. Instead, another hit-man, Leroy (James Gandolfini) saves her, and then takes her hostage. You see, Leroy works for Jerry's boss' and has the advantage of getting the gun back, just as long as he has Samantha in his custody. But while Jerry is having the worst luck in Mexico including getting arrested by the Mexican police, running into a group of clumsy bandits, and a mean dog that won't leave Jerry; Samantha and Leroy communicate with each other and it turns out that Leroy is actually a very sensitive and "different" kind of hit-man. I was expecting THE MEXICAN to be a MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING like "cutesy" romantic/comedy. But nope, it's more like PULP FICTION believe it or not! It's a film that has various characters who each have their problems and all of these character's connect one way or another. But it's no surprise to see that it's like PULP since it is produced by PULP FICTION co-writer and producer Lawrence Bender. But director Gore Verbinski adds his own flavor to the pulp stories of the 40's and 50's. He makes THE MEXICAN a cross between a Sergio Leone and Steve Soddenberg film and adds Orson Wells' TOUCH OF EVIL into the mix. It does have that spaghetti western feel with Alan Silverstein's score making it more possible. And with the dirty and run down buildings of Mexico, you think that Brad Pitt walked into one of Clint Eastwood's "Dollar Trilogy" films. Then there's Roberts and Ganolfini, they appear to be in a Steve Soddenberg film with the stylish Las Vegas mixed with the coffee shops, and the unusual characters, situations, and violence. I did enjoy THE MEXICAN quite a bit, and not only for it's style and story but also for the acting. Brad Pitt proves once again (after SNATCH, FIGHT CLUB, 12 MONKEYS, etc.) that he is one great actor who is not only handsome but actually reads and picks good scripts. Julia Roberts is sort of different than her usual "chick flick" roles that Oprah fans have known to love. Nope, Roberts is more of the whiney girlfriend than the woman who stand on her own terms. But that is good to see since Roberts is playing a different kind of role again. And Jame Gandolfini hasn't been this good in a movie since his role of Bear in GET SHORTY. He shows humor/terror/sadness/kindness in his character of Leroy, the most unusal hit-man in the history in cinema. For films that are released before the big summer season, THE MEXICAN is a winner! However, the surprise is that women might be surprised and disappointed to see that the film is quite violent and dark. But guys will be surprised to see that it's actually quite a good dark comedy/action film. With a great cast, style, story and until maybe Ted Demme's BLOW, THE MEXICAN is going to be the most acclaimed pre-summer film. Well worth it! ****1/2 (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever had a bad experience with Mexican.....?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Mexican' is the story of a small time hood (Pitt) who is in a troubled relationship with his girlfriend (Roberts). He is ordered to go down to Mexico pick up a mythical antique pistol (with a heart shaped chamber nonetheless) called `The Mexican' and bring it back to the states. Pitt was supposed to take Roberts to Vegas so when he backs out she ends their relationship and heads to Vegas alone. The previews make this look like another delightful Roberts romantic comedy. This is however a rather violent, schizophrenic, film along the lines of `Grosse Point Blank' (the Tarantino effect strikes again). I have trouble laughing and feeling heart warmed when folks are being dispatched and maimed in a graphic way. Roberts and Pitt are both extremely amiable but they have nothing to work with and they are rarely on screen together. Pitt ends up doing Clousea like bits as a bumbling ignoramus who keeps botching simple tasks and then in the movies final half-hour suddenly gets smart. Meanwhile in another movie altogether Roberts gives and receives relationship advice while in the hands of a homosexual hit man and periodically she raises her voice for no reason. James Gandolfini is our hit man and he is an old pro at this part having made a name for himself as the lead on `The Sopranos.' He is a wonderful actor who can change from loveable to horrible with just a slight movement of his eyes. Roberts tries to convince the hit man to pursue love with a gay hitchhiking postman and give up killing. If I haven't already sold you on the film there is also a lot of murky mumbo jumbo thrown in about the pistol's origins and mystical powers, in-fighting in Pitt's mob organization, and the nature of love. There are some funny bits with a mad dog, soupped up Mexican rental cars, a stop light in the middle of no where and a cameo by a major star but it never comes together. We are left with a strange mess that feels like several different films put together. The movie jumps from cartoonish slapstick to grim violence to light hearted romance to fantasy and so on. It also is overly long and the plot twists and turns fall flat. I guess the film has some message about love and the extremes we should go to to keep it alive but for the life of me I couldn't explain it to you. I am also disturbed about the growing number of bovine death scenes in films. Since `Twister' we have seen cows dispatched in `Oh Brother Where Art Thou,' `Me Myself and Irene' and now `The Mexican.' Don't cattle already suffer enough at our hands? Do we really have to abuse them on film as well? My advice is that you `steer' clear of this one altogether.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've all seen romantic comedies where the couple has a big fight that lasts the whole movie and then make up. This movie throws in a subplot about Brad Pitt on a mission to retrieve a gun that is less than entertaining. Julia Roberts is real cute and a good choice for the role, but it's hardly the most intelligent script. The only thing that stands out is James Gandolfini. When movie stars break out, they take roles that they were meant to play. Then they start going for what they consider "creative" moves which are really ridiculous. That's why DeNiro ended up in Rocky and Bullwinkle and Christopher Walken in Blast From The Past. Well, one day Gandolfini will be making those movies and people will say, "Why can't he go back to playing a gangster which he does so well?" Well, this is one of those movies that they will be speaking about. True Romance is another one. Go see this movie not for Pitt or Roberts, but for Gandolfini who is right now at his prime.</fullReview>

With 2001's The Mexican, I see only difficulty. I sat in front of the TV watching this "black comedy," hoping something, anything would happen that would make sense, would make me care about the characters or the story. The Mexican makes so little sense and is so thoroughly tedious that I wasn't even interested, well into the third reel, when Gene Hackman shows up.I have seen a lot of rotten movies in my time, and many of them were watchable despite their awfulness. The Mexican can't even get to that level of incompetence, it's that bad.</fullReview>

Only Samantha gets kidnapped, and Jerry has a lot of difficulties delivering the cursed gun.I think they're suppose to be white trash characters. They're way too pretty. Having these two A-listers may not be the right move. And it doesn't quite work as a comedy. Both Pitt and Roberts try very hard to be wacky. Pitt especially try hard to be stupid. The story is idiosyncratic wallowing in its quirkiness. None of it is particularly funny. However James Gandolfini does take an interesting turn as the kidnapper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The legend of the silver pistol</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never having seen this film when it made its commercial debut, we were able to catch it when it showed recently on a cable channel. "The Mexican" is a film that combines genres. It tries to be a madcap comedy, a road film, and a crime comedy. Gore Verbinsky tries to make sense of the J. H. Wyman's screenplay, without much success.Fans of Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt were probably disappointed with the finished product because they only appear together for a short time. Brad Pitt plays the goofy Jerry, a gofer for a mobster who is sent to Mexico to retrieve the valuable silver pistol. Julia Roberts is Samantha, Jerry's girlfriend, whose main ambition is to relocate to Las Vegas to be a croupier.The viewer is rewarded by the wonderful supporting cast. James Gandolfini plays a bad guy sent to get Jerry in Mexico. His character is the most complex of the film and to boot, he is gay, something that Samantha notices without much trouble. J. K. Simmons, sporting a blond wig, has some good moments as Ted. Bob Balaban is also on hand to play the man who sent Jerry to get the pistol. Gene Hackman shows up toward the end showing why he is one of the best character actor of his generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary and Unfunny Film About Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with the big constellation of stars Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts this movie can't go up. Mediocre at its best (or worst) "The Mexican" is the unfunny story of a loser (played by Pitt) Mob employee that must do one last job for his boss (Bob Balaban): travel to Mexico and track down a old Mexican gun and bring it back to the U.S. Simple if wasn't for the fact that his girlfriend (Julia Roberts) wants more time between the two and she hates the things he do; the fact that this guy is a complete idiot and ends up doing the most terrible and unfunny things after a serious of unfortunate events happen to him; and his girlfriend (again!) is kidnapped by a strange and a gay hit-man (James Gandolfini) that also wants the gun but he's there to protect her from other hit-man and they turn out to be friends sharing relationship stories with the men in their lives (okay this is the only thing that is original and works in the whole picture).Why I am disappointed with this film? When you make this equation "Great Actors + Great Director + Great Story = Excellent Film" you think that this could have all these factors. But the story is unbearable, suffers from good situations and doesn't have a interesting meaning at the end (it wasn't supposed to have one being a poor comedy as it is but nevertheless it didn't appeal to me). James Gandolfini was the best thing here, first you don't develop any kind of sympathy for his character and then he becomes more and more interesting when the film rushes from the middle. You couldn't even think of a tough guy with a frightening appearance like him being a homosexual with not so many luck in finding a partner. His conversations with Julia are very good, sometimes even funny (the one in the restaurant for instance). Gore Verbinski I expected more of you considering your amazing work in "The Weather Man" (one of the most underrated films of all time) and the "Pirates of Caribbean" trilogy. This wasn't a screenplay for you and you could easily pass this one without diminishing your career. Pitt and Roberts are well together but it doesn't add anything good to their film list. And to think that Gene Hackman had a brief moment here (he's not wasted, he's just underused). It's not so bad but it didn't needed to be made. But Gandolfini stole the show and made a almost watchable film. That's it! 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) has just received two ultimatum: the first of its head, a mafia that instructs it to travel to Mexico to restore an old and valuable gun so-called "The Mexican", and the second of his girlfriend, Samantha, (Julia Roberts) requiring him to put an end to its relationship with the mafia. Jerry thinks that the more attractive alternative is to stay alive - even if you have problems with Samantha- and decides directed toward the south. Find the gun is easy, but bring back is a matter more complicated. It is assumed that is a carrier of a curse legendary, since it was commissioned by a rich landlord as a gift of wedding to a daughter who eventually died in tragic circumstances. A curse that Jerry has reason to believe, especially when a killer hostage-taking Samantha to assure the delivery of the pistol to mafia capo. It is a movie that has received poor criticism in general, but I believe that are made from the perspective of expect such large stars a result commensurate with its fame. If not we take into account the latter, the film is simply entertaining, quick, with good blows of humor, good photography and some dialogs interesting. The environments of the scenarios i have liked, but the characters Mexicans have little action . I noticed that only at the end of the film appear a few drawings of the two main actors together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE Mexican will lose a lot of viewers long before its conclusion, simply because it is a black comedy from the talented Gore Verbinski. Bradd Pit plays a low life sent by a very bad man (Bob Balaban!) to Mexico to pick up a priceless pistol. As he crosses the border, a Mexican observes in his passing that Pitt is going to run into a lot of trouble. And he surely does. The guy holding the pistol (David Krumholtz) is Balaban's grandson and is unfortunately dispatched via a stray bullet. Then Pitt's rental car is stolen, along with Krumholtz's corpse and the prized pistol. Meanwhile, Pitt's forlorn girlfriend (Julia Roberts) is grabbed on her way to Vegas by a hit man (James Gandolfini) looking for Pitt and the gun. They embark on the oddest road trip you're ever likely to see. Everything gets more complicated from there. Gandolfini is a standout as a gay killer with feelings, and is too quickly dispatched from the movie. Pitt and Roberts are professional as usual. The ending comes with a bittersweet surprise, if you're still around by then. A little less black comedy and a little more straightforward plotting might have helped. This can be said of the many, many black comedies that involve chance or odd meetings, road trips and guns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Riddle:What's wrong when you have James Gandolfini, Gene Hackman, Brad Pitt, and above all Julia Roberts in the same movie and you still aren't entertained?Most likely it's the screenplay.Gandolfini does an out and out reprise of his character in True Romance with a really dumb twist at the end. One wonders what he thought. 'Oh, OK, this is cool, this might be fun, it might work.' But it doesn't.Pitt's good, and Roberts works very hard at her part, and (extremely) occasionally there are good laughs in this one (that aren't downright cheap and stupid) but those 'laughs' are so unremarkable that the one we had only minutes ago is already lost again - and that's not exactly complimentary of a movie.Oh yeah - Roberts and Pitt fans might have fun. (Hackman fans won't get much for their money.) But this one is just too contrived as too many contrived movies are.In a word it's - 'unremarkable'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mexican is unfortunately missing most of the main things you need to have a good film. It lacks any real plot. Good Dialogue and characters. Good Acting. Good Direction. Good Visual effects. And that you can't guess whats going to happen next. In fact the plot is a mere clich itself. The dialogue and characters are amazingly horrible. The acting is just pathetic, except For James Gandolfini who is actually pretty good. The direction is just as bad as anything seen before. The visual effects are just below fair. And the film is utterly predictable. But the thing that really hurts it is the casting of the two leads who simply seem lost and just completely ruin the film. Julia Roberts needs a great actors director to give a decent performance like with Mike Nichols in Closer, and she lacks one here and is just horrible giving one of the worst performances I have seen in a long time. While Brad Pitt has a lot more talent than her and he just acts goofy in this film, he is also horribly miss cast. Another major problem is that the two leads are way to good looking to play these parts. They should have had someone like Gandolfini in all three lead rolls. Avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated road adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MEXICAN (2001)THE GOOD:--Gore Verbinski seems to have a large knowledge of Mexico and its scenery and certainly uses that to his advantage here. Shot widely on location, "The Mexican" looks truly perfect as a road movie, with eye-candy galore and some wonderfully impressive shots of the lovely locations.--I was massively impressed with what the writer of this film, J.H. Lyman, manages to do with the hitman-hostage story. It is the best element of "The Mexican" by far. Instead of getting the simple shoot-bang-em-up-and-take-a-sexy-hostage-girl, us viewers are left to contemplate one very fascinating character: Leroy. This is a complicated character, who is discovered in-depth by some truly impressive counselling scenes with Sam (Julia Roberts). This is the most developed character in the film, played perfectly by Soprano James Gandolfini, and this film is worth viewing for that performance alone, which far overshadows the (still very good) performances of mega-stars Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts.--Is it just me, or did this movie seriously deserve an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score? The music in this film was just astoundingly good! I loved the driving theme, it was very catchy, and the flashbacks (projector story) had a great score too. The music was all-round inventive and fitting to the film, certainly one of the most memorable aspects.--Another strong point of the film is its great ability to bring together a number of genres and intercut them effectively without anything ever feeling forced or boring. On the outside the film looks like a Pitt/Roberts romantic comedy but it is certainly more than that. The film has strong elements of drama (Gandolfini's character) and lots of road action as well as a historical value as well (loved the projector flashbacks - stylie!). And then of course you have the aforementioned romantic comedy side of things, which is lots more fun than many other typical Roberts vehicles of late. The characters aren't your typical rom-com characters and the two leads play off each other during their on-screen verbal fights so well.THE BAD:--The only really annoying factor of the film which brought down the quality a lot for me was the tedious ending, which dragged on for a very long time and shoved a lot of information in our faces all at once. Without much time for plot qualities to sink in I was left feeling more empty than I was prior to that last 20 minutes or so because all of it had no real effect on me. Furthermore, I think the ending was supposed to really grab the audience by the balls and give them a surprise. It certainly had elements of surprise, but grab me by the balls? Not so much.RATING:8/10 - Perhaps some viewers were let down by the hype of this film, but personally I found it to be a lot of fun and VERY underrated.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Blow (6/10) Fight Club (10/10) The Mask of Zorro (8/10) Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (9/10) Traffic (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Gore Verbinski has a great future like movie director - just see Ring or Pirates, even Mouse - but first he should select better the scripts for his movies. This is the real problem on this one. Anybody who has gone to a screenwriter's school or academy or university knows that one of the first things you should learn to write for movies is that your principal characters must act. They must go to create action. And never expect and react. That's what makes Brad Pitt's character in great part of the movie. Everything happens to him and he never do nothing for the action. He just stays there and things happens round him - can anybody believe that a girl like Julia can be in love with a dork like him? Just cause he is handsome? Oh god! - and that can't work. It's hard to understand how a director like Gore has fallen in this kind of mistake. We'll expect that in the future his movies will be better - like Pirates.My evaluation: 4 over 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really terrible film about a chronic screw-up who is sent south of the border to pick up a valuable hand-made pistol, "The Mexican", for some mob guy he's indebted to. The film isn't very funny and it's boring too.Brad Pitt plays Jerry, the guy on a mission to retrieve a gun. I know he can be funny because Brad Pitt was excellent as the oblivious stoner in "True Romance." He played his part so subtly in that movie, but here he's working non-stop to squeeze a few laughs out of a lame script. It just doesn't work.Julia Roberts plays Samantha, Jerry's ditzy girlfriend, and she's clueless when it comes to being funny. She's supposed to be this walking cliche of modern psychobabble, but her character talks fast and acts dumb, and that's just not the way to approach comedy. You have to lay it on the viewer slowly, not beat him over the head with it. James Gandolfini plays a gay killer who takes Samantha hostage because the boss thinks he might be selling the gun to the highest bidder, and he plays his part very well. He's both menacing and ridiculous listening to Samantha's love advice. Gandolfini is the only character I liked in the film because he was funny in an odd sort of way.The film is much too long due to numerous plot twists and scenes that drag out forever. And considering the expensive talent involved, the whole thing is just a massive waste. Skip this one, you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After he made a very spirited comedy with "Mouse hunt" (1997), you could be more than ready for a new Gore Verbinski's movie. Unfortunately, "the mexican" turns out to be inferior to "Mouse hunt". This movie is a relative but not total disappointment because Verbinski's movie alternates qualities and faults.First, to begin with the qualities, well there are quite numerous. "The mexican" enjoys a good directing, dialogs that sometimes sound incisive and funny ideas in the script like the light in the desert or the dog that keeps on following Brad Pitt wherever he goes. Moreover, the script contains assets, especially the coup de thtre in the desert when Pitt discovers that J.K. Simmons is actually an impostor.But "the mexican" also includes important faults that damages a little the story. It's a shaky movie: Verbinski obviously to balance his movie between the sequences featuring Pitt in the main role and the other ones featuring Julia Roberts, his partner. The sequences with Pitt are always almost delightful. Not only do they make the plot progress but they also testify that he's one of the finest actors of his generation. On the other hand, when Verbinski focuses on Roberts' adventure, the film falls off. Besides, the sequences with Roberts turn out to be absolutely useless as far as I'm concerned. Indeed, Roberts is taken hostage to compel Pitt to do his job but he accepts it without making any fuss. According to me, Verbinski used this device to lighten his film and he also wanted to give to Pitt, the image of a Hollywood hero.Another fault, Pitt is supposed to act the role of a blunderer gangster and however, I think that Verbinski doesn't emphasize enough on his clumsy side.In the end, a good but shaky movie. Fortunately, Gore Verbinski will catch hold with the very acclaimed "Pirates of the Caribbean" (2003).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great if you don't expect a Pitt/Roberts romantic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film which was largely victimized by having Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts cast as leads. This is not saying that their acting was poor -- I believe they were both excellent. The reason why many people who view this film will be disappointed is because: 1) Pitt and Roberts do play a couple, but this is not a Pitt/Roberts romantic movie where they are together throughout the film. 2) Pitt and Roberts are not playing their "typical" roles. Pitt is not the cool, smooth character -- instead he plays a clumsy criminal who's also a pushover. Roberts doesn't play the sweetheart everyone adores -- instead she plays a character who is emotional, irrational, loud and outspoken.This film has two main parts. One part consists of Pitt's character looking for a gun called "The Mexican." This portion contains the majority of the comedic aspects of the film. The second part involves Roberts and James Gandolfini (playing a mob hitman) and their evolving friendship. This portion contains the sensitive aspects of the film where Roberts and Gandolfini struggle to understand love and their own personal relationships.This film is funny and serious at the same time, and the acting is very good. This film, however, can be slightly confusing to watch, because the background information to the story is slowly revealed throughout the film, instead of giving it all in the beginning, so the viewer doesn't completely know what is going on. This was probably intentionally done by the filmmakers, since the characters in the film don't completely know what's going on either.I highly recommend this film. This film is very enjoyable as long as the expectations of this film does not center around a Pitt/Roberts romantic comedy. My rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was certainly an original idea. Someone must've really had time on their hands to think up the plot that creates THE MEXICAN. A film that gives us a really different idea for a story and then uses it against us.Jerry (Brad Pitt) is the errand boy for a mob boss (Bob Balaban). When he is given one last job, to go across the border to Mexico to retrieve a sacred gun, his girlfriend (Julia Roberts) is kidnapped by Leroy (James Gandolfini) for a ransom. Very confusing...J.K. Simmons, Gene Hackman and David Krumholtz co-star in this film that could only be described as a Romantic Action Comedy. A very rare combination, but it does exist. So, on a scale of one to ten, the romance is a 4. The action is a 6. And the comedy is a 4 also. It is not really a romance movie, nor is is laugh-out-loud comedy. It is probably more action than anything else as it is extremely violent. Not a lot can be said about this film. It is a mixed up film that can never seem to decide what it wants to be. It is entertaining, but it is NOT the film the previews led you to believe. The trailer basically gives you the "funniest" parts of the movie. Nothing new here, folks. THE MEXICAN: 3/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like "The Mexican", I really did. It had an A-list cast, and an interesting, dark-comedy story to tell. I so wanted it to be good, and for some extended periods during the first half, it really looked like it might succeed. But I knew something wasn't clicking, the movie was shaking, and rattling. Then in the final half-hour, cracks became fissures, and the "The Mexican" falls completely apart. This is an excellent example of a movie that starts strong (or at least decently), and finishes poorly. I won't go into the story, or the characters portrayed by Pitt, Roberts, and Gandolfini. I'll just outline what went wrong. For starters, the direction stinks. The director seems not to know whether he is making a dark comedy, crime drama, romance, or slapstick. So, he makes all four, jumping from one to the other, from scene to scene. Secondly, Pitt and Roberts are wasted. There is no sexual or romantic chemistry developed between them, and their comedic scenes are poorly structured and unfunny. And finally, Gandolfini is again Tony Soprano, but this time he is a gay, sensitive Tony Soprano. Give this film a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than the sum of the parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is possible that this film was produced just to see if putting Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in the same film would automatically produce a blockbuster no matter how weak the script. Well, now we have our answer. This is a B movie screenplay that grossed close to $70 million, a stunning tribute to star power.The story is a quirky tale about a loser named Jerry (Brad Pitt) and his neurotic girlfriend Samantha (Julia Robert) and his misadventure procuring a legendary Mexican pistol that is believed to be cursed. While he is on this mission from the mob, his girlfriend is taken hostage by Leroy (James Gandolfini), a gay hit man who is holding her to assure that Jerry doesn't run off with the gun and sell it. The characters aren't the only ones that need therapy, since the film has an identity crisis of its own. Is it a light hearted comedy or a blood and guts action flick? The answer is both, but neither is done well.There are a few good skits in the film, mostly between Gandolfini and Roberts. The slapstick is mostly lame due to the fact that Brad Pitt, gorgeous though he might be, is no comedian.This is an opportunity for the three leads to spread their wings a bit, playing characters that take them to unaccustomed territory. Gandolfini gives us his standard mob characterization, but this time with a twist. Beneath that murderous exterior, he is ultra sensitive and gay, and he uses his hostage to vent all his loneliness and frustration. Gandolfini continues to prove that he is one of the best mob toughs ever, gay or straight, with a droll performance that produces some of the best laughs in the film. Yet, of the three, his performance strayed the least from his comfort zone.Julia Roberts gets a chance to extend her already awesome comedic talents with this part. She steals the show with her portrayal of the temperamental girlfriend from Hades, who is constantly spouting west coast psychobabble and blaming everyone else for her problems. Her comedic screen chemistry with Gandolfini is fabulous as the two lob grenades at one another, throwing in subtle physical comedy without missing a beat.Brad Pitt is completely out of his element in this film. I admire his courage in taking a role so far removed from his normal type. Pitt is used to playing the hardened rebel, always smart, resourceful and independent. This role is the antithesis of that. Here he plays a dim-witted, bumbling, henpecked loser and he is all thumbs trying to slip into his character's skin.Overall, the film is far less than the sum of its parts. This is likely to be a big disappointment for Pitt fans, but a pleasant surprise for Roberts and Gandolfini fans. To the non fans out there that are just looking for a good story, this won't provide much satisfaction. I rated it a 6/10 on the strength of the comedy of Gandolfini and Roberts.</fullReview>

Samantha threatens to leave Jerry if he does not immediately abandon his risky job, and she quickly dismisses the death threat as a fabrication of Jerry's dishonesty, cowardice, and overall lack of commitment. Falling victim to an extreme lack of communication, each goes on a different direction: Samantha sets on a getaway trip to Las Vegas, while Jerry's mission takes him to a dismal town near Toluca, Mexico, where he must concentrate on locating and retrieving a legendary pistol known as "The Mexican". Not surprisingly, their paths are marked by a series of complications: while Jerry competes with the locals who are also fiercely determined to possess The Mexican, Samantha is kidnapped by Leroy (James Gandolfini), a hitman intent on indirectly pressing Jerry to complete his mission.The Mexican clearly establishes its protagonist as a victim of circumstances, whose lack of maliciousness endangers his mission as well as his life. Often amusingly portrayed by Pitt, Jerry's inadequacy is stressed by highlighting his foreignness within the isolated and hostile Mexican town, where the character is again constrained by an inability to communicate (by either not speaking the language or not understanding a particular situation). On the other hand, The Mexican focuses on the character's female counterpart in order to demonstrate the positive results of effective communication. This is --sometimes humorously, other times dramatically-- explored in the unlikely relationship that evolves between Samantha and Leroy, who after spending many hours together on the road, develop a sensitive awareness of each other's emotional needs. This parallel plot successfully depicts a displacement of the bonding that the Jerry/Samantha couple desperately needs. In spite of this strength, The Mexican often falls victim to its own silliness, which prevents its actors from exploring bolder representations of their characters. Therefore, The Mexican is most successful in those scenes where its actors fall on either end of the spectrum of comedic to dramatic representations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, meandering, but half of a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of "MouseHunt" (not a recommendation), this movie never really fulfils any promises the teaming of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts might suggest (and not only because, as several others have noted, the two spent surprisingly little time together on screen). It has to be said that the sections featuring Roberts with hitman James Gandolfini are overall better than the ones involving the not-too-bright character played by Pitt, and you almost wish the movie had been about them instead of the long tale about the title handcrafted gun that it is.J.H. Wyman's script suffers from a few too many endings, and some moments are painfully contrived (like an execution carried out to the end of Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made For Walkin'"), but the film overall works as a painless way to pass two hours in a cinema. You can't help feeling that all concerned were shooting for something more, however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to see all the negative comments about this movie. Normally I am pretty critical of movies and this is one of the few movies I watched that I thought was a classic. Mostly it was one of the few movies from America that didn't have one of 10 standard plots. Like LA Confidential, most Tarentino and Guy Ritchie movies it actually contained more of a story than special effects.Also it is the perfect date movie (I saw it on a date). It has plenty of guns and violence for the guys but then also Julia Roberts for the girls doing what she does in every other movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited to see "The Mexican" when i saw the trailer for the movie, but i was so disappointed when i finally saw the movie at the theater. If you think "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is over-hyped, then go and see "the Mexican." Not only is it over-hyped but the plot isn't explained very well. It's also very long and boring. By eliminating some of the useless moments in the movie, this two hour long movie could have been shortened to an hour. Even two of Hollywood's biggest stars can't save this movie. Don't waste your $7.00 on this disaster!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mexican is one of the most wholly original films that I've ever seen. It mixes quirky, realistic conversational comedy with crooks and guns in a way that you might think rings bells of Pulp Fiction or the more recent Snatch (also with Pitt), but doesn't. It's mostly a relationship movie, focusing on those couples who love hard. Jerry (Brad Pitt) and Sam (Julia Roberts) just can't "get it together", even though they're deeply in love. Should they call it off, or keep trying? The Mexican tries to answer that question. (very mild spoilers ahead) The rest of the film is made up of a very involved story about an antique pistol called the Mexican. Jerry has to get the gun for a gangster that he sort of owes. Sam is infuriated that he has cancelled their Vegas trip, and explodes when he tells her he has to go to Mexico. We follow him there and her to Vegas, where she is kidnapped by a hitman named Leroy (The Sopranos's James Gandolfini). That opens up into an entirely different plot and a character as interesting as the leads, who are incredibly interesting themselves.And it's a good thing they were willing to take pay cuts to star in this film. If they hadn't, I fear it wouldn't reach an audience, and be filed away into obscurity with four copies at Blockbuster. But because it's backed by the heavyweights (Roberts may be the biggest star in the world), it will be seen, and I think, enjoyed. The two leads are at their very best, and Roberts in particular shows incredible range. Her performance here dwarfs her work on Erin Brockovich. Pitt absolutely proves that he's simply one of the best actors working, with or without the looks (which I, of course, don't notice). He is all about charisma, and it shines through in Jerry, an extremely unique character who lets Pitt's ingenuity run wild. James Gandolfini may play another gangster here, but he's miles away from Tony Soprano. He has a great screen presence and, again, the film showcases his incredible range.The situations that the characters find themselves in are equal parts horrible and hilarious. The little tidbits of reality that are thrown into the extravagant plot bring it down to earth and leave the audience saying "that doesn't happen in movies". That's why the Mexican is so special. It doesn't care that it's a movie. Wild, funny, crazy, awful stuff keeps happening, and we just keep experiencing it. One scene that I won't spoil involves the meeting of Pitt and Gandolfini, and it startled me, and made me want to thank the filmmakers for developing ALL of its characters, and making an interesting scene out of what a lesser film would have made mundane.See The Mexican because it's got your favorite stars in great roles; see it because you've probably never seen anything like it before; and see it because it's really, really fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's a movie for movie lovers, not for discriminating cinema critics i own it and have just enjoyed for yet another time after a year or two interval. you have to be someone who like Pitt showing his goofy side. look at him in 12 monkeys, watch the zany moves. it appeals or not. to many of us, it's quite enjoyable. it's not supposed to be deep. it's only supposed to be incidentally moving. it's a Comedy! Of course Pitt is inept and on point from scene to scene, that's how the character is obviously drawn. of course Roberts is lost and wacky. ditto. okay they're stars. can't they still do a 'small' movie without being lambasted for not turning in a movie worth an Oscar!?!?!?! it has sweet twists. it moves with a symmetrically crafted exaggerated sentimentality, it's intentionally Designed that way. if you love, say, The Big Lebowski, how can you not put this on your love list as well. If you loved Snatch, you'll love this. Don't let there over analyzers get to you. You can see from all the comments and voting how this type of film puts people in two camps. These are really talented actors who get what they're up to and a really talented director doing great work. Just love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mexican" bored the frijoles out of me. This amusing but anemic Julia Roberts &amp; Brad Pitt asphalt epic borders on being a romantic screwball comedy about a priceless antique pistol with a deadly curse on it. Sophomore scenarist J. H. Wyman's infuriatingly complicated script intertwines the frantic, often feeble-minded misadventures of our two attractive superstars in a hither &amp; yonder plot that simmers instead of sizzles. Bumbling, trouble-prone, crime syndicate gofer, Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt of "Snatch"), breaks up with his clueless girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts of "Erin Brockovich"), after his mob boss packs him off to Mexico to fetch a treasured firearm known as "The Mexican." Meanwhile, Sam high tails it to Las Vegas in her shiny new VW Beetle, but a hit-man accompanies her much to her chagrin. "Mouse Hunt" director Gore Verbinski struggles futilely to blend farcical comedy with grim tragedy. Blake Edwards mastered this balancing act, and only Harold Ramis has had a light enough touch recently to make it work. Alas, Verbinski keeps things light, but the action lacks hilarity. The moments of mirth are too fleeting, while the brutal, straightforward violence dampens any frivolity Verbinski &amp; Wyman conjure up. Brad and Julia must have been searching for something outlandish when they agreed to co-star in "The Mexican." Julia portrays a flaky Sandra Bullock-type "28 Days" heroine, while Brad behaves as if he were a Hugh Grant imbecile trapped in a Quentin Tarantino tough guy movie. Pitt blurts out self-consciously pretentious dialogue and paints a florid personality with his fluttering fingertips and airy gestures. Things go wrong from the get-go for Jerry and Samantha. Jerry has promised Sam he will quit his life of crime. Nevertheless, he must perform one last task for double-crossing mob lieutenant, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban of "Best In Show"), who threatens to kill Jerry if he backs out. Apparently, Jerry was responsible for sending crime boss Arnold Margolese (an unbilled Gene Hackman) to prison. Somehow, Jerry's car collided with Margolese at a Los Angeles intersection, and authorities discovered a tied-up man in Margolese's trunk. Actually, neither Verbinski nor Wyman satisfactorily explain this accident as well as how Margolese's thugs coerced Jerry into committing crimes for them. The humor and the heartbreak in "The Mexican" cancel out each other. No question, the Brad Pitt part of the movie tops Julia's half. The car rental agency scenes when Jerry, and later his pal Ted (J.K. Simmons of HBO's "Oz"), requests a car with a more Mexican flavor to it is cute. Verbinski delights in skewering Americans as tourists, reversing the usual stereotypes of Mexicans as ignorant peons. Curiously, a running gag involving a mangy dog clenching a deflated football in its jaws goes nowhere, although it appears based on a similar gag from Blake Edwards' "The Pink Panther Strikes Again." Most of the humor Verbinski and Wyman drum up is of the smirk-a-lot variety. Nothing in "The Mexican" will make you laugh out loud and embarrass yourself.This murky, flashback-riddled melodrama emerges as confusing, half-baked hokum with too much bloodshed. Winston/Leroy behaves inconsistently when he allows Jerry to get the drop on him. Several people die tragically in flashbacks that imitate the sepia-toned movie-within-a-movie in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." Although everything is Mexican, you get the overall impression the producers based their depiction of the era on the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s and 1970s. Interestingly, every time somebody relates the story of the gun, they change the details like the synoptic Gospels. Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts dumb themselves down considerably to impersonate the two wildly dysfunctional leads. Verbinski sics them on each other in most of their scenes. Watching them rip into each should have been lively, but instead they sound like they're rehearsing for a bad soap opera. In an early scene, Roberts pitches Pitt's suitcase and sneakers from their motel room balcony while she argues with him about his selfish conduct. Roberts plays such a cretinous character that it is difficult to harbor any sympathy toward her. As Julia flicks go, "The Mexican" bottoms out somewhere between "Mary Reilly" (1996) and "I Love Trouble" (1994). Pitt fares better off as lame-brained Jerry, spinning on his heels and babbling his dialogue in a spin on his imaginative "Twelve Monkeys" performance. Nothing goes right for pitiful Jerry. One obstacle after another challenges him, whether he finds himself wrestling with the inevitable language barrier or friends who betray him. By the end of this opus, Jerry rises above everybody else as a man and a hero. He winds up better off than he began.The same cannot be said for poor Julia. She plays an airhead who prattles loquaciously off on a tangent when anybody quizzes her about herself. This is as close as Roberts has come to playing white trash. She is rarely convincing in a hare-brained role that only Sandra Bullock could have done justice. Worse, Julia and Brad hug each other twice and kiss only once! Julia has not appeared in such a smooch-free movie since her co-starring turn with Denzel Washington in "The Pelican Brief." The chemistry between Brad and Julia fizzles rather than sizzles. Verbinski and Wyman don't help much by isolating them from each other for about 75 minutes of screen time. Surprisingly, hulking James Gandolfini steals the show with the best performance as a gay gunsel with a conscience.Widescreen lenser Dariusz ("Dark City" &amp; "The Crow") Wolski provides the kind of polished picture-postcard photography that takes your breath away. Visually, "The Mexican" is an impeccable looking movie. Matching Wolski shot for shot, composer Alan Silvestri infuses the storyline with recurring Ennio Morricone style musical cues to inform audiences when to chuckle. Verbinski stages a couple of reckless driving episodes that momentarily relieves the general ennui, but J. H. Wyman's script appears to have suffered irreparable editing because several loose ends are left dangling. Take a siesta and skip "The Mexican."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrasts don't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a type of film which you don't see very often - movies which are created out of two contrasting genres mixed up together. Sometimes this approach succeeds - From Dusk Till Dawn, suggests itself as one of the successes: an outrageous joining together of the hard-boiled crime movie with the vampire movie, with Salma Hayek's raunchy snake dance being used to conceal the all-too-visible stitches where the two genres were sewed together in the middle of the film.The Mexican is a mix-up of the screwball comedy and the hard-boiled crime movie, with a touch of the character-driven sentimental redemption movie thrown in: in this case, the genres intertwine throughout the film's length.Trying to pull off this combination is a noble effort. The problem is that, in The Mexican, the genres inherently work against each other. The jolly japes of our accident-prone protagonist don't sit well next to the often unpleasant violence. In particular, the touchy-feely gay hit-man making contact with his deeper feelings is in grating contrast with his propensity for blowing holes in people - and this is despite a) the dramatic justification for the shooting in the hotel room and b) the fact that James Gandolfini is by far the best thing in the movie. The multiple monochrome flashbacks to the constantly revised history of the gun in olde Mexico, too, are misjudged: frequently humorous, but capped with savage tragedy, the audience is left emotionally confused. Well, this audience was, anyway, as was his wife.Brad Pitt phones his performance in. I mostly don't like Julia Roberts very much. This film offered nothing to make me change my opinion.</fullReview>

The acting of Roberts is instable, and at one point I had the feeling she was playing a completely different role. Pitt's acting is better but by far not as good as I've seen him acting before. The best acting in this movie is been done by James Gandolfini. He challenges Roberts much more then Pitt does. Now for the good things: the scenery is nice and the movie is actually pretty funny sometimes. And counting it all up it ends as an average movie, not worthy to visit a cinema for, worthy enough for a cheap bargain and a weekend which would have been boring anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry's a lovable fool, Samantha is, well, just a fool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story about the pistol is far from interesting. The continuous flashbacks are very boring and make the movie move in an even slower tempo. Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts who play the lovers Jerry and Samantha have absolutely no chemistry together. Julia Roberts usually isn't believable as someone's love interest so I'd blame it on her. How she became part of the A-list is beyond me. She's not Oscar-material (Hollywood obviously disagrees) but I guess one could call her an okay actress. However in this movie Roberts' character Samantha is such a dislikeable person that I have trouble watching any scenes she's in. In all fairness I guess the writers' are more to blame for the character's flaws than Roberts. Throughout the movie Jerry and Samantha fight constantly. Now, I do think that a quarrelling couple can be sexy, passionate and interesting but that unfortunately does not include Jerry and Samantha. I just can't see them either have a past or a future together. Luckily enough Pitt and Roberts only have a few scenes together. However even though Roberts have better chemistry with James Gandolfini her character Samantha is so annoying and boring that I never stand watching their scenes together. Despite Gandolfini's wonderful acting. What I find entertaining (yes, there is actually some good moments) about this movie is Jerry's and his partner Ted's run in with the locals. Brad Pitt's Jerry is a charming fool and J.K. Simmons is perfectly cast as Ted. My favourite scene is the conversation between Jerry and the car thief (Rochard Coca) when Jerry has to shoot him in the foot. The funny moments are unfortunately few and far between and I'd rate this movie a 5 out of 10 or a weak 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lesson In Turd Polishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looks nice, but that's about it. If Verbinsky had spent more time worrying about the terrible script, the plot holes, the contrived characters, and the utter lack of dynamics - instead of staging pretty pictures - maybe the story could have been saved.But then again, Verbinsky came out of commercials (read: studio's bitch) and so I seriously doubt he's to blame. Especially since the two A-list leads got the film bankrolled in the first place. It's a shame because, like it or not, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt are great actors.But a movie is only as good as its screenplay, even if studios honestly believe that its the cart that leads the horse to the box office. Oh well.James Gandolfini gives a great technical performance if you can get over the fact that he's just a device for the screenplay to incorporate quirkiness for its own sake. Having a professional killer wear his heart on his sleeve the first minute he's introduced (to Julia Robert's annoying, self-absorbed character, no less) is not only disrespectful to his character, it undermines any suspension of disbelief for the audience.Take MIDNIGHT RUN, for example.The hardened bounty hunter (DeNiro) doesn't chitchat with Grodin until circumstances dictate otherwise, usually motivated through action. It's a natural, credible progression.But THE MEXICAN is so desperate to be offbeat, that it's like your parents trying to impress your friends by pretending to be down with Eminem. Too bad, because Gandolfini has great range, and it would have been nice to see the character develop a bit, rather than bolt from the gate, saying, "Hey, look at me, I'm so quirky! Now let's analyze the fact that I'm gay!" Please.As for Julia and Brad's character, there's not much to say. It's if they were afterthoughts with lousy dialogue and ridiculous backstories. Julia's character literally whines, screams, and bitches her way through the ENTIRE movie leaving us wondering what the hell Brad sees in this narcissistic woman. And by the end of the second act, you're praying that she'll catch a stray bullet or get hit by a train or run into something to shut her up. You'd think she'd grow out of it or transform. But, nope - it's one beat all the way through like a broken record. And this, of course, makes us think less of Pitt's character who, apparently, is not only a loser, but he's bitch-slapped and loving it, thank you very much. How depressing.As for the plot about the fancy gun, who cares? Honestly. Verbinsky's contrived flashbacks are okay once. But we keep seeing them over and over, which means that at some point during the rough cut, they realized the movie wasn't working. Again, I bet the screenwriter's not at fault. I'd love to hear his opinion on the final cut. The sad fact is that when you have stars like Roberts and Pitt, everyone becomes star-struck instead of story-struck, and so the blame probably lies with the people who greenlighted the film, and NOT the people who actually made it. And that's showbusiness. Or rather businessshow, according to the priorities these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off-the-wall fun, filled with clever stereotypes, but slow at times, too (weirdly)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mexican (2001)A crazy, fun, off-the-wall, slightly indulgent spaghetti western styled would be Tarantino farce. It's great and it's lame compared to what it could have been.Brad Pitt makes it work most of all, and his half of the movie playing off of clichs of Mexican life, especially as seen through the movies, is funny and whacked. The other half of the movie features, somehow, Julia Roberts and that's the wimpy boring half of things. You sense even an attempt at some "Pulp Fiction" stuff in general, even with the dumb thugs and witty conversation, and in fact it sort of works. But not compared to Tarantino.It's fun to see what might be a whole new genre of movies developing over the last 15 years--camp excess, part comic part grotesque, and playing off of movie and storytelling clichs. Call it postmodern if you want, but it's mostly a different kind of parody than previously.One weird part of the billing of the movie is the two leads, who are together at the same time for only a few minutes in first half of the film (which gives nothing away). Later they have some screen time at once and are maybe less charismatic together than you might have expected.The director, Gore Verbinski, might have little to show for himself up to this point--but this might be watched as a turning point for him since he went on to further campy fame with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Not so bad.The fact is, it's a comedy (a black comedy, maybe, but not so dark in tone). Pitt is a natural for this kind of humor--notice that Tarantino picked up on this himself and so Pitt appears in "Inglourious Basterds" to great, similar effect. Here he's attractively boyish at times. Gene Hackman shows up in "The Mexican," by the way, and he's always effective. If brief.You do eventually wonder how it's all going to work its way together, the two very separate plots. The writer needs some credit for audacity but there is a longer term problem of development--taking a great idea and complicating it, making it matter, something beyond this great set of basics. You'll see how it goes, and you'll wonder how something so outrageous could actually get sluggish after awhile. And after an hour of more or less sluggish sameness you'll be frustrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't pay money to see this movie. There's virtually no plot. No chemistry whatsoever between Pitt and Roberts. Shoot, is there really a story line? I know I really didn't care what happened to these characters. I didn't feel that they were real enough for me to connect with them.And, no, that's not because I'm not a drama lover.

		<shortDescription>a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When America heard about Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts starring together in a film, everyone was excited. When I viewed this film I was deeply shocked and dismayed at what I saw. The way I viewed Pitt and Roberts was like watching a train wreck. They never gain an ounce of chemistry and seem to grasp for straws. They have a scene where Roberts kicks Pitt out of their apartment. This scene is ridiculous because Of Roberts' reason for doing so. This reason is one of many terrible scenes to a story that doesn't ever get off the ground. What I wanted to see was these two talents in a good film with at least a chance to produce great moments where the characters come off amusing. Instead, both talents are stuck in an abysmal mess that sucks every inch of life from their characters. I felt uncomfortable the whole film wondering just how could such talent be so misused. Yes, I'll even admit, James Gandolfini was good as the gay hitman, but his counterpart of Julia Roberts is saddled with a badly annoying personality. She talks real fast which literally rips the earth's ozone layer of oxygen. The dialogue to this film is awful and there are moments that seem to be from another film and planted in this one as a prank. I'll end my diatribe here. I agree with critic Roger Ebert that Pitt and Roberts,could in any way, be on screen because the characters would be "a long shrill slog" and that's the point I make. Their characters are so full of inane bile that this film doesn't deserve the talents this film provides. BOMB/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this film when it first came out in the theatres, and, for the record, i gave this film a chance, had somewhat high expectations for it considering the actors who are in it, and, to my utter horror, have found that it is the worse film ever made. i wish gore verbinski could erase this film from his resume, and i'm sure every other sane film critic would agree. this is probably his most embarrassing work to date. i'm glad he was able to salvage himself with "the ring" and "pirates". everyone makes mistakes, i guess, but not many people make the mistake of directing the WORST FILM EVER MADE. this film was so boring and lackluster that it caused the friend that i saw this film with and i to stop watching popular films on a whim for about 2 years. we were just so p***ed that we would never get our $20 back, and didn't want to make that mistake again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some good moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..but as a whole, this is worth seeing once. Nothing to add to your collection, its really not that memorable. I did like some of the interaction between Julia Roberts and James Gandolfini. She seemed more relaxed with him than I've ever seen her with anyone. Maybe because he wasn't her leading man - the majority of the time, Roberts' characters have man trouble, in spades. In 'Something to Talk About' her husband cheats on her. In 'Erin Brockovich', her boyfriend does not understand her enough to stay with her. In 'Steel Magnolias', she gets pregnant despite a horrible medical past, because 'it might help things.' In 'Pretty Woman' she's a 'bum magnet' who ends up a Hollywood Blvd. hooker. Her part of a triangle in 'My Best Friends Wedding' exists only so she can try to break up the wedding she's the maid of honor for. She gets to laugh with Rupert Everett, her gay friend.But this time around, she is not going to be romantic with James, since he is her kidnapper, but even more so when she finds out he is more interested in men anyway. By contrast, her scenes with love interest/hunk deluxe Brad Pitt are like a continuation of the list above. Shall we presume these roles are easily identifiable for her? I could care less, but it sure was fun seeing her have a laugh with a guy for a change. Maybe she should stick to gay men. The stars do not have a ton of scenes together, thankfully. They act like they just met. Brad's best scenes are when he is alone or in a jam. At times he seems to be channelling his '12 Monkeys' character. The plot offers some fun, some insight into love and relationships, and its always fun hearing Nancy Sinatra sing 'These Boots are Made for Walkin.' 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what is the purpose of this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailor was nothing like the actual film. The trailor implies that the plot will play off the interaction between Pitt and Roberts (even the tag line is "love without the safety net" or some such totally inapplicable epithet), whereas in reality the two are scarcely even in a scene together. I did like James Gandolfini's performance... he greatly exceeded my expectations. Pitt and Roberts, on the other hand, have both done MUCH better work. I am surprised that they would participate in this SLOW, long, seemingly pointless film. If viewed as a complete satire, the film has some value in that I could say "it's so bad that it's kind of funny." However, viewed literally, it is one bad joke after another. It was like a student film featuring new and overly eager actors. That is my way of saying that the acting was REALLY conspicuous rather than natural (Gandolfini is the exception). Also, I didn't see the much needed chemistry between Pitt and Roberts, which may account for the film's lack of emotional effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitt vs. Pitt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start with saying some positive things about The Mexican. By times the dialogues were good and witty. Gandolfini is good at playing a tough gay gangster. Julia Roberts was - contrary to most commenters' opinion - quite OK in her role as emotional sponge. These last two characters were also the only ones who could make the humorous content of this movie any thing close to funny. Which brings me to the not so positive things. First of all, Brad Pitt: wouldn't I have seen an other movie he's in, I would simply have said he is crap. But maybe, as some suggested, he just cannot act in comedies. In any way, this is a very far cry from Fight Club. In the early scene between him and Roberts with the things flying out of the window, he just made me sit in bewilderment. It looked as if this was his first major film as a very bad B- actor. He may also have been a bit misdirected. In the scenes with Teddy he acts as a street- wise thug, which is quite strange considering his inaptness in being handy and communicating with the Mexicans. Of course, this is a comedy, but consequence in character should be essential. All this was compensated a bit for by the entertainment value.</fullReview>

The storyline and script was full of worthless one-liners, stupid love scenes and predictable, meaningless, petty plot twists. Nothing was believable nor even likeable. The reel scenes were pitiful and simple. The movie was poorly filmed, so unchallenging that I literally tried to go to sleep during the middle of the movie, then I tried to read but the theater was too dark.

The truth is you have Brad on the one hand who's cool and even fairly talented. Yet on the other hand there's Julia Roberts, lacking much talent and losing her appeal on the big screen at an accelerating rate. Well it seems to me the director has taken this into account and has left Julia out of most of the movie, and thankfully spared us slotting the two together in too many scenes.With movies about Mexico the flavour of the month this movie does little to inspire you, and gives even less of an insight into Mexicans and their way of life.

You can't help but enjoy Jerry's awkward mannerisms and empathize with a multi-dimensional character.Roberts is a let-down in this film. The alternating plots will keep you engaged as Jerry struggles with himself and the supposed curse, paralleling Samantha's growing relationship with the gay hit-man who keeps her hostage. However when Roberts and Pitt are together the chemistry just doesn't seem to be there.The juxtaposition between the story behind "The Mexican" to Pitt's and Roberts' characters was twisting and pretty cool at the end.

		<shortDescription>Mildly Recommended Inspite Of Brad Pitt And Julia Roberts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mexican is a romantic comedy film that features Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts together with James Gandolfini,J. K. Simmons and an uncredited Gene Hackman.The screenplay has a plot that is an unusual mixture of romantic comedy and road movie.It was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to make it. It was directed by Gore Verbinski.In the story,a clumsy criminal is put in a position where he not only has to save his own skin, but that of his girlfriend in this comedy with strong undercurrents of romance. Jerry Welbach is a low-level Mafia "mechanic" whose ineptitude is countered by frequent bursts of dumb luck. Jerry's girlfriend Samantha wants him to get out of the business, and after his latest blunder lands capo Arnold Margolese in jail, so does mid-level crime kingpin Bernie Nayman. But Bernie insists that Jerry do one last errand for the mob before they let him find employment elsewhere -- he has to go to Mexico and recover a rare and very valuable pistol, which is said to be cursed. While Samantha objects to Jerry taking the assignment, he isn't in much of a position to argue; Jerry heads south of the border, while Samantha, in a huff, sets out for Las Vegas. Once in Mexico, Jerry finds the pistol easily enough, but making his way back to the States proves to be an unexpected challenge. Meanwhile, Jerry's superiors want insurance that he'll return with the goods, so they hire Leroy, a hit-man, to kidnap Samantha and hold her hostage until Jerry comes back. However, Samantha and Leroy quickly strike up a friendship, and she soon learns the gunman has a sensitive side he doesn't show to the world -- along with a few other secrets. The Mexican marked the first screen pairing for mega-stars Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt -- though, given the film's narrative arc, they play only a handful of scenes together.That made it less interesting just like the story - which was overbearing and boring at the same time.The comedy did not provide too many laughs and the romance between Jerry and Samantha was least interesting.Despite of the presence of the mega-stars,this is one movie that I mildly recommend as it falls short in entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the reason why most people hate The Mexican is because they probably read to much further into it it. They see names like Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and they expect a thrilling ride...well I am sorry to report that is not the case over here! The Mexican is what it is , a summer time mess about movie. Its one of those movies which basically you watch for the sake of watching and you don't really expect much from it. Oddly enough it is still one of the weird reasons why I found my-self drawn to this movie , after sitting all the way through it I do agree with most viewers that at times it feels rushed , messy with some mind numbing moments but having said that it does tell us something about very useful about relationships and in its own little way I guess that it offers us advice about it which one just can't but think about. Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts were okay with Roberts performance over taking Pitts by miles but for me the real star of this show was James Gandoflini as the sensitive but very wise hit-man who I personally felt I learnt a bit from about relationship advice. Another good point of the movie was it moved at a quick enough pace and finished well enough as well although there was not much of a plot to elaborate on, it did have a few emotional moments due to Gandolfini. To conclude for me The Mexican was less of a movie and more of a relationship counselling session which told me some very interesting questions regarding the people who we love in general and how far we go and sacrifice for them. Its far from the one of the best movies made but having said that there is a lot worse out there. Worth a look at if nothing good is on TV or if your bored and fancy a no brainier rental.THE Mexican - 6.8 OUT OF 10LOVE WITH SAFETY OFF.</fullReview>

There is no prominent Mexican deserving of the film's title. My other gripe is the whole hit-man switcheroo at the end. So who exactly sent the fake Leroy? Oh well, guess I'll have to pay better attention next time. In any case, I could really relate to Brad Pitt's character. Things in real life, at least for me, are always getting messed up for one stupid reason or another. One of my favorite details of the movie is when Pitt's character drops his gun on the ground. Too funny! Ultimately, that's why I liked the movie- the things getting messed up part. It's fun watching him channel Donald Duck throughout the movie. The whole romance thing with Roberts character was nice too. I'm not a fan at all of Julia Roberts- in fact, I'm the opposite- but I think she did a good job for once. That's it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I was expecting to get and what I actually got out of The Mexican were, really, two different things. It's easy to assume that anything Brad Pitt is in is going to be some sort of mushy, generic love comedy of some sort, although films like Twelve Monkeys and Snatch often prove otherwise. But, with Julia Roberts also starring it seemed to really want to go down that path; however, pleasingly it didn't.The Mexican is the kind of film that relies on its quirky little sequences and scenes rather than a ground breaking plot or this or that. The character of Jerry Welbach (Pitt) is a gangster's lackey who comes off as far too bumbling to be any good at his job for a respected crime boss whatsoever but we are, in a way, fooled into thinking that this guy is actually a bit of a 'blagger' which means that whatever the situation he can often trick his way through it. This is also put across in a very early scene when he's arguing with his girlfriend Samantha (Roberts) who's up on a balcony as he's below; desperately trying to rectify a situation.This is where the film splits into two different types of film. Through Jerry's bumbling, Samantha gets an encounter from a heavy connected with Jerry's employer called Leroy(Gandolfini) and a separate plot opens up with them. Now, we have their road movie exploits and Jerry's comedy happening the other side of the American border giving us one or the other to map onto. Whereas Jerry trying to retrieve an ancient gun, that's importance is put across to us through amusing and at times tragic flashbacks, is more of a slapstick affair ? the road movie segment is relies on actual humour coming off the script. Even if it is a bit weak on most occasions, tiny things like lines including: "Will you rape me? ? Not likely" as well as a sequence where the two and a homosexual hitchhiker they picked up are all jumping around on a bed to a cheesy sounding pop song are good examples of what to expect- not funny but not expected and if it doesn't make you laugh, it will advance the characters in a neat little way.Where The Mexican fails to become a truly great film is in its final hurrah. The last third is the weakest and this is a shame as the foundation had been set for an entertaining, well made and well thought out road drama turned comedy with an element of love and gangster thrown in. What the film does to contribute to its own downfall is that it, to me, suddenly changes genre. What was a gangster crime story suddenly turns into a bit of a mis-adventure, 'Indiana Jones' type of a film where the ancient pistol MacGuffin every one's been chasing takes over as the sole focus. Now, instead of having Jerry of here; Samantha and Leroy on a road trip over there ? we have loads of other characters we caught glimpses of appearing from nowhere and suddenly getting involved.What's even more disappointing is that the film starts its downfall early on into the final third so the last forty minutes are very disappointing as it becomes messy, un-funny and as I said ? it turns into a bit of a B-movie adventure film akin to Indiana Jones than what it started off as which was the opposite.The Mexican still has its moments. Its moments include: love, loss, tragedy, comedy, gangster shootouts and slapstick and for a film able to pack all of this into a semi-road movie, semi-cause and effect detective hunt has to be worth at least a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gay hit man Leroy (James Gandolfini) holds Jerry's (Bradd Pit) girlfriend (Julia Roberts) hostage until he gets a gun (The Mexican). Sounds simple, but there is a whole lot of comedy and talk about relationships in that plot.I don't know why people diss Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts for their acting ability. They both do a credible job and this is one of the best jobs that Julia Roberts has done. I just like Brad Pitt, and not because he has Angelina, which is a good reason to think he has his sh*t together, don't you think? He is not a brilliant actor, but he does a good job and does a fine job her.Gandofini is brilliant as the gay hit man. GLAAD agrees and gave him an award for this performance. It was well deserved.Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pretty decent. The script is fairly well written, but what the actors do with it is what truly makes this movie. The quick switching between the different story lines keeps it interesting.Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts give their standard performances (basically good), but James Gandolfini outshines them both in his supporting role and gives one of his best performances ever. The chemistry between he and Roberts is much more prominent than that between the two "stars", Roberts and Pitt. The fact that Roberts and Gandolfini spend much of the movie together is a big plus.Definitely worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did enjoy this movie which was surprising as I had been told it was so bad. The bad hype this movie has gained has been very much overrated and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good sarcastic humor. It is a mixture of genres with a little romance, action and comedy together. Though don't watch this movie with too much romance in mind. Many people who watched this movie watched it thinking it was going to be some sort of love story and was sorely disappointed. It is more in style with the movie The Break-Up with a relationship gone sour so expect Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt to fight a lot instead of kiss and romance. All round I found it very much enjoyable. It's true the plot does get a little chaotic (especially when the flashbacks on the gun's alternative histories are intersected with the main plot) but not so much that the viewer can't follow but can be little overwhelming. It is a very different type of film to what Hollywood usually brings out so it is probably better to go in with no expectations and an open mind. Though generally if you liked Gore Verbinski Pirates Of The Caribbean you'll probably like this movie as the sarcastic humor is quite similar.</fullReview>

I think the relationship between Julia Roberts and James Gandofilini is great and I have always thought Brad Pitt has some pretty good comic talent. The story is better then some, the action is good.I think maybe the reason people didn't enjoy it was because who starred in it. If I remember correctly Julia was just coming off an Oscar win with Erin Brokovich and people were expecting great things. Of course this isn't Brokovich but everyone seems to be having a good time though I see in the trivia that Brad Pitt didn't want to do this but was under contract. Even more so I think he did a fine job. Most times actors are under contract it looks like there just walking(I think Johnny Depp had to be under contra in Secret Window) But again everyone here looks like they are having a good time. Take a chance and watch it. A pleasant surprise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the performances fine, as I did not know what to expect from the movie. I couldn't remember what the movie was about so I took it as I went along with the movie.I already sensed from the beginning that it was a comedy, thus I did not take the movie seriously in any way. Sure there were some cliche spit splat jokes here and there, but overall, I thought it was carried through alright. There were times though, where it felt like I was watching some acting on a set, rather than the movie itself but the performances were good enough.Julia Roberts is always does what she's good at. She's excellent at playing crazy. Some might be irritated with her character, as she complains about everything and goes back and forth etc. But I found it quite amusing and in some cases, emotional.Brad Pitt did a good job in being a funny joke. You just wanted to slap him sometimes to wake him up, just because he didn't notice the most obvious. But he had a good enough character in the movie. And I liked his relationship with the dog, who acted great! :).Mr. Soprano himself... he was great! I loved his character. He did a great job in the movie and he had good chemistry with Julia Roberts.There were a few others with funny enough acting. Gene Hackman had a small role and did what he had to do :).The story itself is pretty simple, but it all becomes understandable in the end. Whilst you watch the movie, you really start wondering what the point of the movie is... but The Mexican explains it all in the end. I won't put any spoilers here though.It's worth a look, if you can start the movie with a very open mind and not expect ANYTHING what so ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best crime comedy of 2001!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's exactly what The Mexican is: a dark crime comedy. Do not be fooled by the trailers, this is not a romantic comedy! It couldn't be, the two love ones are only in three scenes together.The story focuses on Jerry (Brad Pitt), a normal guy who, through a series of accidents, is forced to do different jobs for mobster Margolis (Gene Hackman). The film starts off with Nayman (Bob Balaban) telling Jerry that he only has one job left: he has to drive to Mexico to pick up an antique gun. Jerry's girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts) is upset by this, and drives off to Vegas, only to be kidnapped by hit man Leroy (James Gandolfini). That's when things get complicated.This is a very cool, funny, and often dramatic movie. Gandolfini's turn as the gay hit man Leroy is touching to say the least. Balaban's character is an unusual villain, the small nerdy type, but he still pulls it off right. Even Hackman's cameo was done well.Incidentally, the two most boring performances came from Pitt and Roberts. Pitt played the everyday 'hottie' hero role, and Roberts was just annoying as she whines and whines through the entire movie.Still good, stylish crime film, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

You really feel for the poor guy and all the crap he has to go through, while laughing at the ridiculousness of it all and his reactions to everything.I didn't find any unfairly poor treatment of Mexico in this flick. In fact, I thought it was pretty accurate. I've been to Mexico plenty of times, and I could picture any number of friends of mine in the same situations as Jerry.Don't take this movie so seriously and you will enjoy it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining twist on the traditional modern romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As has been the case with nearly every romantic comedy ever made, Jerry (Brad Pitt) and Samantha (Julia Roberts) are in a wonderful relationship that is nearly destroyed by a lot of stupidity. There is a horribly frustrating encounter between the two in which Samantha refuses to believe that Jerry is being forced to retrieve this priceless pistol from Mexico or else be killed. Never mind the gun, Jerry, you promised to take me to Las Vegas. I don't care if they're going to kill you, either, it's your life, or me, you decide! Why can't we ever have a conflict introduced in a film like this that's not introduced as a result of a nerve-grindingly stubborn woman or a complete moron of a boyfriend? In the recent The Bachelor, for example, which was an otherwise very entertaining film, much of the conflict comes as a result of Chris O'Donnell's character DAYDREAMING at the most crucial moment, which happened to be a moment on which any flesh and blood human being would be focused like a freaking laser beam.Jerry is forced to go pick up this pistol in Mexico, charmingly named The Mexican, by his criminal boss, who is in jail partly because of Jerry. So needless to say, Jerry owes him a favor, to say the least. The movie picks itself up and dusts itself off is when Samantha is kidnapped by James Gandolfini's wonderful character, Leroy. Samantha's stubborn departure early in the film separates her and Jerry for the most part of the rest of it, but they are still involved with each other, entirely through Leroy. He has been sent to kidnap Samantha as sort of an extra inspiration to get Jerry to complete his task, and the interactions between Leroy and Samantha are arguably some of the most entertaining parts of the film, along with Jerry's pathetic attempts to fit in among a completely and hopelessly foreign culture.Leroy and Samantha ultimately wind up searching each other's souls and helping each other out enormously on an emotional and sociological level, while Jerry struggles down in Mexico to get the pistol and then return to Samantha. The conflict, as well as the drama, is increased along the way as Samantha complains to Leroy about Jerry, listing all of his inefficiencies and shortcomings, while Jerry is at the same time running into one troublesome situation after another, mostly due to mistakes that come as a result of his seeming inability to stop thinking about her. He can't wait to get back to her, and she can't get over her anger that he left in the first place.Clearly, this is a fascinating story compared to the general slop served up in romantic comedies, and I think that the only thing that really takes away from the film a great deal is the initial formation of the rift between Jerry and Samantha, which the rest of the film concentrates on filling. This is the tough spot for romantic comedies, and if The Mexican had had a better introduction of the conflict, the film would have been nearly perfect as a romantic comedy. It did, at least, only have the horribly stubborn girlfriend, rather than the horribly stubborn girlfriend combined with the abysmally moronic boyfriend, as was the case in the above-mentioned The Bachelor.Probably the film's strongest points are the complexity and diversity of the characters, as well as the originality of some of them (Leroy, for the most part), and the interactions between them. The conflict is curiously explored as Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, the two huge names associated with the film, are separated for most of the movie, but kept tied together with the fascinating character of Leroy, who never seems to surprise us. While the premise is not very interestingly presented, the film itself attempts to solve it in interesting and fun ways, leaving us with the feeling that we didn't just watch the exact same romantic comedy that has been released five or ten times a year for as long as many of us can remember. Pitt plays a character that doesn't fit very well with his iconography, and the film has it's share of tactical flaws, but as a whole it meets its lofty expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mildly amusing at times, "The Mexican" nevertheless fails abysmally from start to finish - surprising, considering the strong cast (I expected much more from Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini.) The movie is slow, the performances lacklustre and the story about the search for a legendary Mexican pistol just generally uninteresting. In what I assume was supposed to be a "cute" angle to the movie, I found that I got tired very quickly of hearing Gandolfini and Roberts dispense relationship advice to each other.Just dreadful, and not worth the effort to watch.2/10.</fullReview>

However, I was not too crazy about THE MEXICAN. There was something missing. I would suggest renting this if you want a few laughs. However, it's rather dull.

		<fullReview>Those hoping to see Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts performing together in the same movie may well have to wait for the pair's next joint effort - for `The Mexican' is definitely NOT that film. Indeed, it is safe to say that the two stars share less than ? of the film's total running time occupying even the same country let alone the same scene. Still, despite that limitation, `The Mexican' turns out to be a rather fun, rather screwy comedy crime caper, offering an offbeat plot, stylish direction and first-rate performances by a talented cast.The plot involves Pitt, as a young man named Jerry, who is sent on assignment to Mexico by a crime boss who wants him to retrieve a special Mexican pistol named, appropriately, `The Mexican.' Meanwhile, Roberts plays his long time girlfriend, Samantha, who has just about had it with Jerry's inability to commit to their relationship and who decides she is going to move to Vegas to start life anew as a waitress or a croupier. While in Mexico, Jerry runs up against some serious setbacks, while in Vegas, Samantha is kidnapped by Leroy, who holds Samantha as a bargaining chip to ensure that Jerry doesn't engage in any funny business on his way to completing his mission.Ever since `Pulp Fiction' in 1994, we have been subjected to one film after another in which criminals and hit men talk about the mundane matters of civilized living in between shoot-outs and gangland-style executions. This is now the standard for any crime film that wants to be considered `hip,' `cool' and `contemporary.' Sometimes this technique works and sometimes it doesn't. In the case of `The Mexican,' it mostly works. This is due in no small measure to the playful screenplay by J.H. Wyman, who has managed to devise both humorous situations and high-spirited dialogue exchanges for his characters, a flashy directorial style by Gore Verbinski, who knows how to maintain an effective balance between humor and violence, and, above all, by delightful performances not only from Pitt and Roberts but from James Gandolfini, who literally steals the show as Roberts' gay kidnapper, a confidante who keeps offering words of wisdom to a brokenhearted Roberts on matters of interpersonal relationships. Gandolfino creates a character of amazing depth, variety and subtlety, managing to seem threatening, decent, ruthless and caring, all while remaining within a very tight range of emotional expression. It is one of the most effectively understated, yet rich, performances I have seen in a movie in a very long time. In `The Mexican,' Pitt once again demonstrates his undervalued skill as an actor. The slightly quizzical, slightly befuddled expression he conveys throughout the film not only heightens the comedic elements of the screenplay, but creates a great deal of audience sympathy for this likable, well-meaning young man who just happens to be way in over his head with the rank company he is forced to deal with. Roberts, likewise, does a stellar job as a woman who is alternately compassionate, frustrated, headstrong, feisty and committed. Yes, one hopes that, in their next venture together, Pitt and Roberts will choose a vehicle with a bit more substance than `The Mexican' seems to have ? and that they get to spend a little more on-screen time together as well. In the meantime, however, `The Mexican' does provide a number of ancillary pleasures to make it well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The mexican is a road movie that keeps you interested throughout mainly due to a funny script and some superb acting from Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini. Some of the reviews for this film are mixed but i cant see why some people didnt like it. Bradd Pitt plays a guy who is paying off a debt to a gangster because of a road accident that putt him in prison. He gets sent to Mexico to do one last job, which is to collect an antique pistol that is said to be cursed. Without telling you more of the story the journey is a big adventure that is a joy to behold to the viewer . Pitt comes accross very enthusiastically as if he relishes the role, maybe that is because he plays along side his real life love Julia Roberts. Some of the dialogue with the native mexicans is very funny as is the story of how the pistol was made. Gandolfini is also superb and for me he is very much underestamated as an actor.Julia Roberts is , well ....Julia Roberts! Her talents as an actress are Overestamated , but thats just my opinion. Sit back and enjoy The Mexican. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS - "The Mexican" will be enjoyed by the same audience that loved "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels", because it is a dark comedy cut from the same mold. Except that this one is set in California, Las Vegas, and Mexico. Brad Pitt (Jerry) and Julia Roberts (Sam) are fine here, but it is a bit disconcerting to see them in such roles, with a heavy reliance on "over-the-top" acting and liberal use of the "F-word." It could have been a much better movie with more sensible writing. Still, I rate it "7" of 10 for good, quirky, fun entertainment. The psychology-speaking gay thug, Leroy (James Gandolfini). Gene Hackman in a small role as Margoles, the convict responsible for the entire caper. The snarling, football-loving dog in the pickup truck.The film starts out with a malfunctioning traffic light in L.A., followed by a great crash. Much later we learn that Jerry's inattention caused the crash, Margoles was in the other car, with a bound and gagged person in the trunk. For this he gets 5 years in the pen, and hapless Jerry has to work for his men for the duration of the sentence. He botched what would have been the last job, so he is sent on one more, to retrieve a treasured gun, the Mexican, which awaits with one of Margoles' men."Murphy's Law" prevails - whatever can go wrong, does. What could have been an easy caper, and a 15-minute movie, turns into a much more complex one. Sam is kidnapped just to make sure Jerry doesn't screw this one up. People get killed, passports get lost or swapped, crooks turn on each other. At some points it reminded me of "Romancing the Stone", running away from crooks in a foreign country.This film has lots of entertainment to offer for those who like off-beat capers, and who are not easily offended by cursing and shooting. However, many viewers will undoubtedly be totally turned off by "The Mexican."</fullReview>

Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts act their parts (as brainless, argumentative but committed lovers) to the hilt. They are a delight to behold in every scene. The story follows the trail of their attempts to locate and deliver an ancient gun ("The Mexican") in the crossfire of gangsterland political machinations. The script keeps you on the edge of your seat - which is useful, as the twists and turns of the plot - for more than two hours, are not quite enough to sustain knuckle-edge interest on their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realized about a quarter-hour into this film that I was grinning like an idiot, and had been since the movie began. That is the effect this movie has. The plot is twisted, and the characters are charming. It pulls off comedy, emotion, and suspense all at once. Brad Pitt is a great comic actor. As in "Fight Club", one subtle twitch of his face and the result is perfect comic timing. He should get an award or two for this role. Julia Roberts is comfortable in any role, and she shows off her comic ability here as well. James Gandolfini is great as always, but does every movie need a subplot involving homosexuality nowadays? I love the obvious inspiration the makers got from the old Looney Tunes cartoons, especially the stoplight running-gag. It gets a bit contrived toward the end, just a little cheesy, but all in all this is a really good movie. And the ending has a few surprises, too. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. "The Mexican" is nothing but a big tease. More than 2 hours long, the laughs are too few to be considered a comedy. Many interesting situations and nice efforts from Brad Pitt and James Gandolfino. Julie Roberts is fingernails on a chalkboard in all of her scenes. Alternating between sensitive and obnixious, she again shows why she is the most overrated actress working today. Brad Pitt shows some nice comedic timing and Gandolfino provides us with a touching portrayal of an insightful psychotic. Watch for "Seinfeld" alum Bob Balaban. The movie is sloppily directed, but interestingly photographed. The pace is just torturously slow, except when it needs to be. Gene Hackman turns in an understated cameo, but in the true sign of a weak movie, the dog steals every scene he is in. I am intrigued by the comedy potential of Brad Pitt after this role and "Snatch". This actor could really be something special over the next decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Galdonfini at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS AHEAD !!! *** The only reason that kept me awake while watching this movie was the acting of Mr James Galdonfini. Galdonfini plays an untypical mob gay guy. While a hit man in the exterior, he struggles to find some love in his live and he needs to tell his problems to someone, Julia Roberts. That setup is what really drives this movie. The directors made a big mistake deciding to kill Galdonfini's character by Brad Pitt's one. The only guy that you take care of passes away!! and the movie ends. Bravo galdonfini.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mexican is one of those films that you either have to like it or have to hate it. I was told by someone who hadn't seen the film and only the previews that they felt it wasn't that good of a movie. I went to see this film and was pleasantly surprised.The performance by Roberts is not necessarily her best. Her character is actually quite annoying and has litle to no depth. Whether this is on the part of her or the character remains to be seen, but comparing this role to "Pretty Woman" will get you nowhere. The scenery is good, but the plot holes could swallow any tequila Mexico has to offer. Why does Jerry smuggle a gun through the airport in his luggage? In a metal lunchbox, no less? It is questions like that that keep you asking why, why, why, and a lot of times you do not get an answer. I would probably not go see this movie again, but not necessarily because I didn't like it. Overall, I enjoyed it, but it just seems to be one of those "one-time" films, despite the fact that it was number one in the box office the weekend of March 9-11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the Mexican expecting a truly modern dark comedy akin to some of Tarantino's movies of the last few years. It didn't quite make it but if that was the only disappointment then the movie would have still been entertaining. This was Brad Pitt's best roll ever next to Fight Club, but Julia Roberts who is usually wonderful with any film or script came up short but it didn't feel like it was her fault. She was basically a one gimmick comedy routine and about the fourth time she started babbling and whining at somebody you realized that's all she was going to do in the movie. Her character bounced back and forth from being kind of an immature, whimpering brat to being a collected, calm, adult counselor for James Gandolfini. It just didn't work. James himself was excellent, as usual, have we ever been disappointed, but his character was a little too hard to betray. I don't think he quite pulled it off as a gay hitman but I'm not sure anyone else could have either. Nonetheless he was the best person for the role. The whole thing was pretty predictable from the previews most of the entertainment coming from Brad Pitt as he stumbles through the Mexican countryside getting into everything from jail to rabid dogs. He definitely had fun with the movie. Gandolfini saved the rest of the film up until the end when they brought in Gene Hackman as though they had found him vacationing in Mexico and asked him if he had 10 minutes to do a quick movie.All and all it was viewable but was about twenty minutes too long and left me with the feeling that they were so excited to get Julia and Brad that they forgot to write a script until the last minute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that I am a huge Julia Roberts fan! I have seen every movie (as far as I know) and I have posters everywhere. She's just a goddess. Anyway, The Mexican did prove to be slightly disappointing. I had a hard time following the plot with the *numerous* backstabs and twists and turns. The only part I followed, seemed rather unrealistic and silly. However, it was *quite* the enjoyable laugh. The movie has both it's wonderful as well as disappointing factors. I would recommend seeing it for yourself. It's worth the viewing. And my opinion should not say anyone elses'. It's a good movie but I think it depends a lot on your mood when watching it. =) Go Julia! (This was one of her funnier roles...)</fullReview>

The characters in this movie are dull and without color - what a waste of talent. For me, the movie did not have any highlights, nothing I will remember it by, just 2 hours spent indoors out of the cold.

It is not just adventure, but it also has a lot of good humor and romance. The best thing about this film is perhaps its humor.

		<fullReview>The Mexican lacks focus but has its moments. There are several excellently engaging scenes, but the whole remains uneven.You would think that when two stars as enormous as Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt are cast in a movie together, they would share the screen most of the time. Luckily, the masterminds behind The Mexican have ended up separating them. In the very few occasions when Roberts and Pitt get together, it becomes painfully obvious that their chemistry simply doesn't work.In their two separate story lines both do very well, however. Roberts gets to show her flare for snappy comedic timing with the wonderful James Gandolfini as they build an unlikely friendship on the road. Pitt is as hunky and charming as ever in a role that suits him perfectly.The Mexican has its flaws and it's little more than two hours of rather disposable entertainment, but as such, it works.</fullReview>

I laughed so much when I started to realize he was gay. And I thought Brad was hilarious and very lovable. The way he was so understanding and patient and a really good guy but still kinda careless. And how Julia was so sweet to the gay-guy and did nothing but talk all the time. The end was really good when she shot him and he opens his mouth and the smoke comes out. And when they are talking in the car and start to fight about nobleman... And it was also a little sad when Frank died. And how aggressive "Leroy" became. And when he killed the real Leroy later. People who don't like this movie are strange. :) I was laughing all the time and so was all my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the viewer who wrote that the script had possibilities. Brad Pitt doesn't take himself too seriously and it's refreshing. Julia Roberts takes on the role of a whiny nagging girlfriend and ... it's refreshing, too. Sam truly irritated me; Roberts usually plays likable women, even if they're strident like Erin Brokovich. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was a rip-off. However, the second time I saw it, I realized that if you disregarded the starpowers (Pitt and Roberts) and the misleading teasers (romance???), you've got a good story.I thought the story of the Mexican, la pistola, shot in sepia tones with tongue-in-cheek overacting, was hilarious. Some of the lines of the monologue were unintentionally funny, like that bit about the pistol not having a good aim.Also, the movie had too many twists and turns that towards the end, I just wanted for it to end.Ultimately, the script might have been the best thing about The Mexican.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I wouldn't call The Mexican the best film these actors in this film have done, they do what they can. Brad Pitt, who has been great in Fight Club and Snatch, and is marginal in here as a guy who has to do one last job for a boss or else he'll be killed. Julia Roberts (not quite as annoying as she was in Erin Brockovich) is his girlfriend and is upset and as a result leaves him as he goes to Mexico to retrieve it. Meanwhile, James Gandolfini, in one of his best roles, plays a gay hit man who will make a trade with Pitt along the lines. Sometimes really funny, but often fluffy with Gandolfini stealing the show once again as he usually does (shows how the Sopranos can top over all). Gene Hackman has a bit part. B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just think that NOBODY should watch this movie, it is horrible and literally goes on forever and ever. The movie runs on to long, they should cut out the parts when the Mexican keeps switching from the man and the enemies, to the man, to the enemies, to the man, to the wife, etc. The story was hard to follow and from what I could get out of it, it was stupid and made no since. The whole thing with the wife being with a frod was confusing and probably didn't put much into play, it just made the movie longer, but I guess it gave you a break from the stupid man trying to 'save' the Mexican. You didn't learn to like any of the characters and in the end, hated them all. Worst of all, when I went back to the movie rental after maybe two years after my awful experience with the Mexican, I saw the horrid words on the box 'Now three extra hours added!'

		<fullReview>I don't understand the critics on this one, I will agree, to a certain point, with the critics most of the time. However I think they just trashed because they didn't want to like it. It had an all-star cast, it's easy to be critical. However this is one of my favorite movies. The acting is phenomenal! The screenplay is inspiring and the directing is fantastic! Gore Verbinski has only recently gotten credit as a good director with Pirates Of The Caribbean, however he used many of the same techniques in this movie, and I believe shot it better. Johnny Depp got an Oscar nod for his performance in Pirates, and I know that he's an amazing actor but you gotta give it up to Verbinski's directing skills as well. Depp is a great actor, but only with great directing(i.e. Tim Burton). I think this movie was meant to be a clich, a staple in Hollywood(The cast and script), much like Cameron Crowe's Jerry Maguire. The problem is to make such a movie is a huge risk. When critic's don't get it, or see the director's point of view, these movies will fail. But if you do get it, a cult following is sure to happen.

		<fullReview>After an atrocious opening--Julia Roberts squabbling with boyfriend Brad Pitt over a balcony in a parking lot--"The Mexican" improves, even comes up with some clever and funny bits of throwaway comedy. Although her performance is uneven, Roberts really shines in her scenes with gay hit-man James Gandolfini--so much so that when she's paired up again with Pitt, we miss her happy spark. Nearly all the scenes with the two main stars together are weak. The scattershot script tries combining too many different elements into its mix, leaving one character in particular (a charming one) shafted much too early. All this leads to 20 minutes of dead space in the final act that was simply torture to sit through. Might've been a wonderful black comedy, but the screenwriter didn't bother to take the viewer's feelings into consideration. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie That Failed For Unfair Reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mexican is a fun and unusual movie, mixing romantic comedy with road trip adventure. It also has some great cinematography and a fine soundtrack, a mix of music from Spain, Mexico, and the U.S. The story has twists (including a surprise cameo from a likable star near the end) and keeps you guessing. Also love the quirkiness, both in dialog and in the "fake Mexican old movie" that keeps replaying, complete with a recreated projector feel. So why did this unique movie fail? All the negative comments I hear about it just make no sense.1. "Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts were apart most of the movie, and the ads made it seem like a romantic comedy between them." Okay, I'll admit the film was badly marketed, but we're rating the movie here, not the ads for it. And was the fact that they're apart really that big a deal? I think it's a GOOD thing when a movie is not formulaic.2. "It goes on too long." Actually, it's only 2 hours long. The pace may drag a bit in the middle, but if you stick it out, you're in for an incredibly suspenseful and thrilling ending.3. "There're Mexican stereotypes." If you pay attention to the story, you'll see the movie is romanticizing Mexican culture and ultimately portrays it in a positive light. Yes, there're stereotypes (this IS Hollywood we're talking about) but there have been far worse ones.What's interesting is that Gore Verbinski's next film, Pirates of the Caribbean, would go on to be a MEGA HIT, in spite of doing many of the same things (combining different genres, having a quirky style, and having a running time that many consider "too long").For a two hours that will be unique, and unlike most films out there, don't listen to the critics and enjoy The Mexican.</fullReview>

I didn't think this film was particularly amazing, but it had some very good elements. For starters Brad Pitt was pretty good here, although Julia Roberts was not really effective and kinda wasted (though she doesn't have loads of talent TO waste ). Gandolfini and Hackman were pretty convincing in supporting roles as well. The screenplay could have been better, but i liked Verbinski's direction and the score was very good. The cinematography was also very good, the story just didn't unravel that well and the ending was a bit disappointing as well. --- IMDb Rating: 5.9, my rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie! I have to admit I did not realize that when I first saw it and when I was only half-paying-attention in a hotel room (after not seeing it in the theaters because the preview made it seem so, so stupid). The script is very, very smart - the acting is spectacular (and obviously with big stars -- especially now), and the editing is flawless, and at times truly carries the story. The directing is not as good as the script -- or perhaps I should say that the words spoken in the film are far, far stronger than the images shown -- who really knows who is in charge of what (?). Occasionally it goes over the top -- but that said -- this is a very enjoyable story, with stellar performances by beautiful people. If you have never seen it, you will not regret spending your time with this film. This will be especially true if you have ever had a lover who seemed so, so right, but also so wrong -- or taken up a gig as a reluctant criminal trying to quit for good -- that is to say -- it is works knowingly in clichs, but remains fresh. 8 stars seems about right.</fullReview>

So with the horrible content and the boring story line this is not a must see movie.Though this movie may star two amazingly beautiful actors, this might be one of the worst movies they both have played in. Not to mention the within the first 10 minutes there is over 15 uses of the F*** word and the gay relationship is digestible. You cant watch the whole movie because of gross contents. The only good in the movie is Bradd Pitt, who was said to be forced into doing the movie due to contract and did not want to participate in the film. All together don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember seeing such poor performances from a top Hollywood actor, let alone two top Hollywood actors. After about two minutes of this movie I already knew it was going to be bad. Very bad, you have no idea how bad.Just plain nonsense that last for almost 2 hours. And the worst part is it's not one of those funny bad movies, it's a movie that doesn't realize it's bad. And somebody please explain to me what possible sense James Gandilfini's character made in this movie. They tried to be funny with a gay killer, but the result is a wide open mouth, a consequence of infinite senseless scenes. The ONLY single thing the movie's got going for it are the very cool clothes Brad Pitt's wearing.So shockingly bad it hurts. A definite skip. A waste of time and health. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like enviorment in which the movie has taken place. The legend of the pistol is told in a brilliant manner. Compliments go to the director who did an excellent job. I just hope there were more movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even worth renting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was supposed to be a comedy, albeit a dark one. It ended up being singularly unfunny, and painful to watch. How many times do we have to see people in the bathroom? Why on earth did the writer or director think that was funny? The number of people killed or maimed or otherwise tortured was numbing. Some movies make me sorry I wasted the time watching them. This movie made me ashamed for those involved in its production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Chick flick' that drags in too many ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has a movie had so many useless add-ons. Well, maybe there was one but THE MEXICAN has one too many side stories. From Jerry's story, to Sam's problems, to Sam's kidnapper 's life to the fable of the Mexican itself, THE MEXICAN wastes your time by giving a soul to everyone and expecting the audience to 'feel for the characters.' It fails but THE MEXICAN does succeed on a couple points.Samantha cannot take anymore of Jerry's garbage and takes off. Jerry guarantees to finish one more job for his boss and collect the Mexican, a gun with a curse so they say. Other people want this gun and hire Leroy, famed assassin, to kidnap and kill Sam if Jerry does not deliver the gun to them.Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt are not together as often as people thought they would be. THE MEXICAN is a good 'teenage chick flick.' The humor works and so does Pitt 's over-reacting. The story is a stinker and Leroy's role drains the movie from respectable to typical goofy fluff that only Hollywood would think of. You might want to see it for the star power but THE MEXICAN is an overlong waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and quite entertaining but just lacked a bite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry is indebted to mobster Margolese and is forced to travel to Mexico to collect a valuable gun and bring it back to the US. Jerry's girlfriend reacts badly to this and leaves him to go to Las Vegas. However when Jerry finds returning from Mexico difficult the mob begin to suspect that he plans to keep the gun for himself and send hitman Leroy out to get Samantha as insurance.This was severely hyped as a star vehicle for Pitt and Roberts and as a light comedy. However the film doesn't live up to the hype. The plot is OK but is really in two bits. Pitt's section is the comedy and is too slapstick at times as everything that can go wrong does go wrong, and Roberts' section is more serious revolving around her relationship with Leroy. The latter is the better and Leroy is the most interesting character in the film. The story surrounding the gun is well told and interesting but starts to feel a bit dry before the end comes.Pitt and Roberts are good together at the start but spend most of the time apart. However both give good performances that are a bit more manic than their usual roles. Gandolfini is excellent as Leroy and gives the film a real weight and emotional core. The support cast also has some real quality in Gene Hackman and J.K. Simmons.Overall this was a disappointment that will act as a distraction but goes downhill whenever Gandolfini is not on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another typical Hollywood ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a couple of huge names and a huge studio and add a huge amount of hype and you'll get a huge return on your Hollywood producers' investment. Even with the internet, people still rely on advertising to tell them what movies to see. So, here we go again...another piece of crap flick with Pitt playing a cardboard cutout character, Roberts overacting, and Gandolfini playing a mobster with personal problems...right out of the Sopranos, duh! Weak story, thin plot, poor drama/action, wandering, pointless, poorly directed, generally weak flick. Wait for broadcast on this turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, oddly not appreciated by IMDb filmgoers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a really interesting phenomenon to me that such a warm, humorous film with such believable characters can receive such poor rating from people here. I have lost a lot of respect for IMDb as a result but I have a theory to explain it:I suspect most IMDb participants are Americans (wouldn't it be great if the rating breakdowns also showed country of origin?) and perhaps this isn't the kind of film yanky-doodle-dandies want to see. Having their super hero's like Brad Bitt making goof ups like dropping their gun or doing naff things abroad and treating foreigners with ignorance in their own country probably didn't go down too well in USA.The film is full of great acting portraying really interesting and unusual characters and great intelligent conversation. It has an atmospheric soundtrack, a good story with a lovely subplot, it's funny and uplifting.Don't be put off by the people who slag it off.Algis Kuliukas</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One last heist! Bring back the gun called "The Mexican".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stars with exceptional credentials can sometimes be wasted in an over ambitious project. This is a prime example. An inept criminal(Brad Pitt)promises his girlfriend(Julia Roberts)that he will change his ways after one last job. While he goes to Mexico to retrieve an ancient pistol, "The Mexican", his demanding sweetheart is kidnapped. Gene Hackman and James Gandolfini support the toothsome twins Pitt and Roberts. The attempts at comedy are not all that humorous. The story line is not the easiest to follow. The finale is different and pretty neat. Just look for the smoke. Beware of the lack of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Gandolfini's "The Mexican"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERThe usual way for an actor to steal a film is to over-act shamelessly. In 'The Mexican' however James Gandolfini walks away with the show simply by being the only actor not to showboat. Apparently Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt took big pay cuts to make 'The Mexican' because they liked the script so much. Sadly the script doesn't seem quite so keen on them. Both are cast against type (Not a good idea if, like these two, you don't have much range), and as a result spend two hours saying "Look at us, we're playing against type.' Roberts (a performer who does most of her acting with her teeth) is Sam, a self-obsessed, shrewish hysteric. Brad Pitt is Jerry, her boyfriend, an incompetent moron, who runs odd jobs for the mob. This is played for laughs, just as well as he wouldn't last till lunchtime with real gangsters. Faced with playing these two caricatures Pitt and Roberts resort to wild mannerisms and shameless mugging in a futile attempt to hold our attention. Fortunately the tooth-some two spend little time on screen together, as they generate little heat between them. As one final job he is sent south of the border to retrieve a legendary pistol, 'The Mexican' of the title. Needless to say he screws up. Why he has to undertake this mission at all is never explained, 'The Mexican' is being held by the mob-bosses grandson. Couldn't they just ask him to bring it home? Why send someone as incompetent as Jerry to undertake this important mission is also left unexplained. Sam, failing to appreciate that Jerry isn't just being selfish in choosing to go rather than get his head blown off, high-tails it to Las Vegas. No sooner has she set off than she is kidnapped by 'Leroy' in order to ensure that Jerry remains compliant. Leroy, played by James Gandolfini (Julia Roberts was instrumental in getting him cast, and in this - if not her own performance - she does the film a great service), is the one recognizably human character. Instead of the frantic arm waving of the purported stars what we get from Gandolfini is a subtle, nuanced performance. By turns funny, touching and brave, Gandolfini unfortunately highlights the absence of these qualities in the rest of the film. It is surely down to Gandolfini's skill that we care about Leroy at all, as the script doesn't give him much to do but trade therapy-speak with Sam. Leroy, as much as Sam and Jerry, is a walking, talking clich: He's gay so he must be sensitive; He contemplates giving up being a hit man as soon as he finds love; he is full of self-hatred; like any gay character in a mainstream film, he does not get a happy ending.It is hard not to believe that Leroy is gay just to try and make the film seem more hip, but this is a misnomer, as his newfound love for Frank - unlike that between Sam and Jerry - is not held to be of any great importance. Yet it is this brief relationship that provides the only moments of true emotion, Gandolfini is heartbreaking in these scenes, as Leroy finds and then loses love. Never resorting to the sort of weep-fest that Oscar voters love so much, Leroy - realizing Frank's death - exacts his revenge and moves on, brokenhearted but stoic. It is this disparity between the two couples that underscores the shallowness of the whole enterprise. Sam, for all her psychobabble, has no real idea of love beyond her own self-absorption. When Jerry kills Leroy she protests "But he was my friend." but has forgotten him by the next scene. We are expected to side with Jerry for killing Leroy, for it turns out that Jerry had already met the real Leroy and this wasn't him. This Leroy is really Winston (in an earlier scene when Sam sees the name tattooed on his arm 'Leroy' dismisses Winston as being someone he hates), and his intention was to steal 'The Mexican' for a rival gang. This sole fact is supposed to undercut the validity of 'Leroy/Winston' as a likable character. Why? He pretended to be someone else but his personality was true, and it was this, which made him the emotional core of the film. That Leroy isn't Leroy is supposed to be a twist, but you can see it coming over the horizon. When Sam finds out Gandolfini's name is Leroy she is surprised, isn't Leroy a black name? Sure enough the real Leroy is black. In a blatant piece of foreshadowing Jerry (before meeting Leroy/Winston) mentions that he has met "Leroy, from Michigan.' which makes Gandolfini's New Joisey accent rather a give-away. The filmmakers think that we should side with Jerry rather than Leroy/Winston because he is prettier. His death has repercussions for the rest of the film, if they had to kill him off couldn't they have waited till nearer the end? With the only likable person out of the picture, the remaining half-hour drag's on through the tedium barrier. For a film purporting to be fast-paced the two-hour running time is deadly. A lot of screen time is given over to Jerry's 'comic' adventures, and it is these, which would have benefited from a more drastic edit. The flashbacks to the creation of the gun are also wearing, displaying Hollywood's picture-postcard idea of south of the border folklore. These and the modern day Mexican's depicted are strictly stereotyped either sneaky tooth-flashing villains or mustachioed upholder of honour. The ending is cynically sentimental, the mob boss (a bored looking Gene Hackman) wanting the gun so that he can give it to the Mexican family whose ancestor we see in flashback, dying for the forbidden love of a man considered beneath her. If only Sam and Jerry had emulated these doomed lovers, but then self-absorbed as they are they would probably consider it to be "avoiding commitment".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mexico is not an Old Country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen in all my life a movie that describes worst Mexico.I don't really know in what part of the country they were exactly because nowadays a few cities in the country have that kind of buildings and cars. In all the movie I didn't seen a new car, a new building or something like that all was old and dirty, and believe me Mexico is not like that.The movie is kind of good, I've to admit that I saw it almost from the beginning to the final credits.I can't believe that a production can show a country like that. If you are going to do a movie about other country at least you can study some things about that country, and put the country like it is. Mexico is almost like US, I don't know why they show Mexico like an old and delayed country.Americans I've only one thing to say, I'm Mexican and I can tell you the city where I live is not like the one that you'll see in this movie.</fullReview>
