		<shortDescription>Typically stylish cop flick that is better than the average - 76%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know about you but there are two words that I associate with disastrously bad films. Two words that fill my soul with dread and my bowels with fear. And those two words are... "sports drama". Two OTHER words that carry similar feelings are "Martin Lawrence" so to find a film with him in that I like is something of a surprise. "Bad Boys" is as traditional an action-cop film as you can imagine, filled with hot action sequences, fast cars and beautiful women. And Martin Lawrence.Lawrence is Det. Marcus Burnett, straight-laced family man and partner to Det. Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) who is Burnett's polar opposite. He's a fast-living ladies man with a passion for sports car and when $100 million dollars worth of heroin is stolen from the Miami PD, he and Burnett are put on the case. But in order to trace the drugs, they need to protect murder witness Julie Mott (Téa Leoni) from local hoodlums led by suave gangster Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo).As you'd expect from a Bruckheimer &amp; Simpson production, this follows a strict mantra of "style over substance" which makes "Bad Boys" feel like an update of another Miami-based cop show "Miami Vice". The suits are sharp, the action is loud and the cars look way beyond the economic means of cops. And despite the characters being way too familiar ("Lethal Weapon", anyone?), Smith and Lawrence bring humour and chemistry to their roles and lift the film beyond your expectations. In truth, this is the sort of film where you switch your brain off and just enjoy it and thanks to Smith and Lawrence, you can do just that. They spark off each other really well, seeing them in good stead for the almost inevitable sequel."Bad Boys" is not what you'd call a classic but it is an enjoyable movie that you can enjoy if it's on TV or a rental DVD. Sometimes, you just want to relax in front of something undemanding and while that may sound like criticism, it isn't. The male half of the species will enjoy this much more than their girlfriends (well, she didn't mind it...) but this sort of thing isn't likely to expand your mind that much. Get yourself some popcorn, slouch on the couch and watch the epitome of the blockbuster cop movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay: The Next Big Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no high hopes when I walked into this film. I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny. And it was funny, and then some. It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time. I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.Michael Bay, former music video and commercial director, has made an incredible directorial debut. The film never stops. When it isn't action-packed, it is funny. It is sexy, fun and always moving. Christian Wagner's editing is phenomenal. I love action movies that really try to be action movies. A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably. They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. "Bad Boys" doesn't just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story. It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.Watch "Bad Boys" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish. You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on. There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this. At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers."Bad Boys" of course isn't the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about "Bad Boys" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either. Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film. He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty entertaining buddy comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'buddy comedy' genre is fairly well-known, there have been plenty of them, all of them primarily based on the basic idea of having two main characters who are, well, buddies; they act like friends to each other, they get in fights, they help each other out, they compliment each other. It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations. I think that's a little unoriginal, but, hey, that's the only complaint about it, and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good, it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy, action, or both. It takes off immediately, and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are well-written, well, for stereotypes at least(because, lets face it; they are). The comedy is well-done and often made me laugh out loud, and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it's good. For an action comedy, it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies, and buddy comedies. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boys, Good Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detectives Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have three days to find $100 million worth of heroin from a crazed drug-dealer in Miami in this fast-paced and comedy/action thriller. The witness to a murder (Tea Leoni) of one of Smith's best friends is also along for the frantic ride that is fun, clever and highly entertaining. Watch for then-NBA star John Salley in a great cameo as an imprisoned computer hacker. A rare winner from a sometimes trivial cinematic genre. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Full of Clichés, An Excellent Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The honest and efficient Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is a married cop with three children, having difficulties for the payment of his mortgage and for having sex with his wife. His partner is the also honest, efficient and wealthy Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), who inherits a large amount from his family and although living like a playboy, has not resigned to his position in the police department. After a daring robbery of heroin from the police department stores, the two detectives try to find some clue about the gang. The chance appears with the hooker Julie Mott (Téa Leoni), the witness of the murder of a 'working girl' friend of her. The detectives are assigned to protect her and chase the killers. Although full of clichés, 'Bad Boys' is an excellent action movie, in the same line of 'Lethal Weapon'. There are lots of funny parts, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent as the two partners with different behaviors and Téa Leoni is gorgeous. I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when Will Smith was an unknown actor, and now I saw it again on DVD, with the intention of watching 'Bad Boys II'. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Os Bad Boys' ('The Bad Boys')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a successful marriage of comedy and action/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This high-action crime drama stands out for me because it succeeds at doing what other movies* have tried and, in my opinion, failed to do -- integrate genuinely funny comedy into the mix. The success is attributable partly to the comedic talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence -- who have the ability to deliver crude, rude dialog such that it's funny nevertheless -- and partly to a story that combines suspense and humor into a believable whole. Our two heroes are police detectives Mike Lowry (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence), who are a kind of tough-cop variation on The Odd Couple . Lowry is suave, slick, self-controlled, well-to-do, heroic, and a real ladies man. Burnett, on the other hand, is an ordinary guy who manages to stumble reasonably effectively, if somewhat ineptly, through his work and his married life.So imagine what happens when Burnett has to convince a key witness, Julie (Téa Leoni) that he's Mike Lowry -- not just for a few hours, but for a few days. Furthermore, this is no pre-planned, well-orchestrated masquerade. A large stash of confiscated heroin has been un-confiscated right from police headquarters, and both the heroin and the perpetrator must be found within four days, or Internal Affairs is going to take some big-time disciplinary action. Lowry and Burnett are called in because they were the ones who captured the heroin in the first place, and because of the one trait they share -- a renegade approach to police work, which may not have their boss's approval, but which does get the job done (and at one point, causes a store owner to think they're out to rob him). The various twists and turns of the investigation lead to Lowry getting knocked out of commission at the same time that Julie witnesses a murder and refuses to deal with anybody but Mike Lowry. But Marcus Burnett is the only one available to deal with her, and since waiting for Lowry to recover isn't an option ? Subsequent events include Lowry's bachelor pad being invaded by Julie and her dogs, while Lowry stays with Burnett's wife, Burnett trying to keep his wife from finding out what's really going on, and Burnett and Lowry trying to find the heroin and keep Julie alive. For all you action movie fans, plenty of cars, plenty of buildings, and plenty of people get blown up along the way. (Looking over this review, I see that I've belied the high level of violence, which I definitely should warn you against.)BAD BOYS kept me both amused and on the edge of my seat throughout. I'm afraid I did have two small complaints, however. First, I wish the resolution of the Burnett-pretending-to-be-Lowry story had been timed to coincide with the resolution of the main plot. As it is, the comic subplot ends, leaving the rest of the movie to proceed in a rather formulaic and pedantic fashion. Second, I wish more time had been spent on Lowry's problem of stepping into Burnett's shoes. The swinging bachelor having to play family man would have been good for a few laughs that we never got.Aside from that, however, this is an action movie that stands out among the rest.One final note concerning the DVD "Special Edition" release. BAD BOYS was a movie in which the music was particularly effective, and the DVD actually lets you listen to the music track by itself. I wish DVDs of other movies with great music had this option.* Three examples that come to mind are 48 HOURS, KINDERGARTEN COP, and another Michael Bay film, ARMAGEDDON. 48 HOURS was grim enough to seriously stifle the humor, even with Eddie Murphy in the lead role. KINDERGARTEN COP made me laugh, but the crime drama felt like an unwelcome intrusion. In ARMAGEDDON, I felt the stakes were high enough that humor didn't seem appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bay of bud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay - just the man's name is enough to set some cinephile's teeth on edge and to have people spouting such phrases as "downfall of Hollywood", "all that is wrong with modern mainstream cinema" and even "the lord of darkness". Not me though. I happen to enjoy most of his movies on a basic, visceral, testosterone-fuelled level and this one, his first full-length actual movie, remains a mindless pleasure.Let's face it, it takes some doing to make Martin Lawrence actually funny (I think it's been managed with this film, it's sequel and, arguably, Wild Hogs so far) but Bay manages to do it through some bizarre form of osmosis by placing him alongside the fantastic Will Smith. Smith (in the role that really started his transformation into the leading man moneymaker he would become) and Lawrence play two detectives who may bend the rules now and again but always get the job done. They ARE the bad boys, but in a charmingly cheeky way. Lawrence is a happily-married guy while Smith is the very epitome of a single ladies-man so some confusion arises when they have to swap identities in order for Lawrence to bring in a material witness (played by Tea Leoni) to a shooting that has been linked to a large drugs robbery. Hijinks ensue along with some frenetic action sequences.It's all really rather good but nothing spectacular, with the film coasting along through some of the duller patches thanks to the chemistry between Smith and Lawrence (and, enjoyably aggrieved in the aggrieved captain role, Joe Pantoliano). Leoni isn't as irritating as she can be in the damsel in distress role and Tcheky Karyo gives us an enjoyably urbane bad guy.The action, as to be expected from Bay, is good stuff with plenty of bullets flying and explosive material just waiting to be lit up. It's also worth mentioning that while it's, ummmmm, a little choppy in places here there is nothing quite as bad as that eye-hurting car chase in The Rock and no overuse of Bay's standard tricks while he gets used to his commanding role.Sit back, crack open a cold one and enjoy.See this if you like: Lethal Weapon, Running Scared, The Rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny, thoroughly entertaining action comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys is a great action comedy from producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. It features Will Smith (in his breakout performance) and Martin Lawrence, an unlikely pair who quite simply are the best movie duo I've seen since Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. The film features incredible action sequences (i.e. the Ether truck chase scene featuring massive explosions and pervasive gun fights) which all lead up to the film's action-packed climax which could only be done in a Jerry Bruckheimer film. The film also stars Tea Leoni (who is pretty good in playing the damsel in distress), Joe Pantoliano (whom we all know as Ralphie on The Sopranos, as a police captain) and Tcheky Karyo as the villain. (He was also the French officer opposite Mel Gibson in 2000's The Patriot) The movie features comedic one-liners from Smith and Lawrence as well as a few by Leoni. It also features a few sex jokes and just plain "disses". However, the characters are so underdeveloped that all we are left with is action and comedy. This formula is also seen in the recent summer blockbuster Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, in which we could care less about the characters and just look for the action. However, Simpson and Bruckheimer's Bad Boys succeeds where T3 does not. By the end of the movie, we care about the heroes because they are fun to watch. In T3, the great Ah-nuld is just a figurehead for a movie romped with action-packed sequences and jaw-dropping stunts. This is one of only three good Michael Bay films (right next to Pearl Harbor and The Rock) and should seen by any action movie fan.Lenny's Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last great buddy cop action movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pretty sure that BAD BOYS is the only film of Michael Bay's that I like. Well, technically, while it is the only Bay flick that I like, I can also say that I LOVE it, too! I know that it's supposedly a mindless action buddy cop flick, but it is hugely entertaining and extremely well done. THIS is the type of movie where all of the Bay trademarks work: the driving musical score, the quick jump cuts between and within scenes, funny dialogue (which actually is funny in this film!), strong leads, some seriously sexy females, and characters that sweat all the time (and there's a reason for it here: there in Miami!).Actually, the jump cuts are a big part of why BAD BOYS works. They move the story along nicely and are perfectly placed during the film. Also, Bay does a great job with the camera angles, accentuating the scenes. You don't have time to think or analyze the action, just enjoy. The movie moves at a speedy pace, but not too speedy. And the scenes where the film slows down are all very well done. A really solid action film.The main reason to love BAD BOYS is the ideal pairing of Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as Detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry, two of Miami's finest undercover narcotics cops. Lawrence is especially impressive as Marcus Burnett with his hilarious stand-up routine being a part of his character, but that's a good thing. He's a laugh riot throughout. But his stand-up act is actually toned down, believe it or not, perfectly to satisfy the constraints of a film; they could easily have screwed up his character, but Lawrence is extremely likable and funny, without being too over-the-top. Smith is very good also as Mike Lowry. He is so comfortable in this role that you could foresee a star in the making based on his performance here. Both actors give really solid performances and do a great job of carrying this film. I find Smith (just slightly) more believable as a cop than Lawrence, but still I go with it b/c the 2 have such great chemistry.The story is moot: some bad guys confiscated drugs from the police station. The cops have to catch the bad guys and get the drugs back. That's the plot! Main reason to enjoy is the humor, fast pace, and chemistry of the leads. Typical cop buddy stuff. Been done before and to death, but it still works in this film. We've seen it in LETHAL WEAPON, 48 HRS, STAKEOUT, etc. In fact, this may be the LAST really good film of its kind.Also of note are sexy Tea Leoni as an important witness the guys need to help catch the bad guys (she and Smith should have gotten together in the end!), Joe Pantoliano as the basic-always-in-a-foul-mood-yelling-cops-boss, Tcheky Karyo as the big bad guy himself, and a host of great supporting characters, most notably Sanchez and Ruiz (the funny sidekicks to the 2 main cops), Mike's doorman Chet (who almost steals the film!), and JoJo (Michael Imperioli of SOPRANOs fame). The film also has working in its favor great cinematography showcasing the sights of Miami, catchy 90s music, and a memorable score, all driving the story along. Bay can hang his hat on this one! It's a keeper!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Buddy - Cop Film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best Buddy - Cop Film to me, although only two it seems to have a variety of different moods like others sequels. The second one Is the LETHAL WEAPON Series and the RUSH HOUR Films come in at a good third.Mike Lowrey(Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) are your average buddy cops, you know one's married and the other is a player, but one thing they have in common is their bad altitudes for solving cases and a lot of body bags. When one million dollars in heroin has been stolen by a evil Frenchman named Noah(Tcheky Karyo)in their prescient, a close friend of Mike dies and the only witness is named Julie(Tea Leoni). The boys get set to handle this case with some very violent and hilarious outcomes.Now this movie has one of the best introduction to the main roles ever. The action scenes are greatly handled and never blown out of proportion. The acting is top notch and Martin and Will have what I think is their best roles to date. Michael Bay may have also delivered he's best film, next to CON AIR. Now part II is also great, not better, but funnier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And yet another movie no one really needs. These comments do not contain spoilers. Feel free to read on.The first third of the movie started out very well. Okay acting, humourous and not too bad action. But as soon as Mike and Marcus started swapping their roles it got so bad - really bad. The story went nuts and made absolutely no sense at all - there are so many storyholes and ridiculous scenes, the acting got absolutely worse throughout the rest of the movie, and in general nothing made sense anymore. Why the heck can't they simply tell the truth? For example when Marcus got the witness in Mike's appartment - what the heck did he still play Mike there? And why can't this looser Marcus tell his wife what's really going on? Who the heck wrote this cr*p? I'm sorry. This is too sad. And what about that fact that two regular cops are driving a Porsche there? A bad joke? Was Porsche sponsoring this movie? Tea Leoni was horribly miscast. In the end where everything's over already you have the whole cavalry coming there. I've counted 8 police cars and one (or was it two?) helicopters. My god, this whole movie is oh so wanna-be Lethal Weapon, it made me 1. feel disappointed (since the movie started out very well) and 2. puke (when the movie was over).My ratings: cast 3/10 (bad bad... including Lawrence), action 4/10 (wanna-be 'we is teh cool' type of brainless action), story 1/10 (oh my...), directing 6/10, camera 8/10. That's all I can rate because the rest was simply ridiculous. Oh well, there might also be that one thing to mention: I liked the overall colour tones -- nice and intense warm colours in some scenes (eg. club at Max in the beginning) and cold sterile ones in other scenes (eg. drug labour). One thing for sure: I am definately not looking forward to see Bad Boys II.Overall: 4.5/10 - NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!</fullReview>

The plot is simple, and is followed through until the movie's end (which is very action packed). Bay does well directing the picture and Jerry Bruckhiemer heads up another good film. 10/10.

		<shortDescription>A good idea but a terrible script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like a good action comedy. I loved Martin in Blue Streak, Big Momma's House, loved Rush Hour, Men in Black, etc. These kinds of comedy's usually are very entertaining and do very well at the box office. I was very disappointed with Bad Boys. The script was horrible. The dialogue was either cliched, strained or cheesy - mostly a bunch of mindless bantering and arguing between Smith and Lawrence that makes you want to fast forward to a good part (but except for some action sequences - their aren't any). The characters were cliched as well, but what was really bad was the plot itself- horribly deficient and full of holes.Near the beginning of the movie, Martin Lawrence's character, Marcus Burnett, has to assume the identity of his partner Mike Lowry (Will Smith's character) in order to protect a witness who saw her best friend murdered by some drug kingpins. Mike Lowry is the only cop she trusts, (and only knows him by name). Marcus arranges to bring her into protective custody, and claims to be Mike who is indisposed at the time. In the process, Marcus saves her life numerous times but yet for some reason doesn't tell her he is really not Mike. Later she meets Mike and the both of them save her lousy hide several more times. She obviously trusts both officers, but they still can't reveal their true identities for whatever reason. She is beautiful but other than that, her character is annoying and if they had just shot her, it would have really helped the film.The two officers get into all sorts of problems attempting to pass of as the other, and the longer the charade goes on the more you realize how little thought went into developing believable characters who react logically with their environment and situations. The film is an insult to anyone's intellect who has more than two brain cells firing.Don't waste your time watching this movie! It's not worth the $2 at Blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frivolous but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typically bombastic and derivative actioner from the Bay/Bruckheimer team, this time taking the form of the age-old '80s "buddy-buddy" movie and reinventing it with the casting of not one but two black men in the leads: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Surprisingly, the central pairing is what makes this film work just fine. Despite the juvenile and unnecessarily crude script, Lawrence and Smith have a successful enough screen chemistry to provide a fair quota of laughs along the way (their pairing proved successful enough for an sequel in any case). In fact this film works just fine as an action comedy without ever breaking any new ground. Every scene and situation is sign-posted and clichéd but nonetheless I still found myself enjoying the laughs, antics and comedy situations in which the protagonists find themselves.The action sequences are often loud and quite splendid, although I would have liked a little more originality in the settings and events rather than the predictable old shoot-outs and gun-battles. At least the choreography is spot-on and the action is greatly improved by the bombastic music score which just pumps sheer adrenaline through the listener's system. Highlights to watch out for include an excellent car chase scene and the final, bloody battle at the aircraft hangar which doesn't disappoint in any respect.The usual cast of solid faces flesh out this big budget enterprise: a young and surprisingly beautiful Tea Leoni is the fragile but feisty witness; Joe Pantoliano is the stressed out superior and the sneering Tcheky Karyo is the evil European bad guy (a nice part but Karyo is grossly underused; to see him in a similar but far better role check out KISS OF THE DRAGON). Even Marg Helgenberger and Kim Coates have brief cameos. On a final note, BAD BOYS is one of those films where the two characters have to swap identities halfway through, leading to a major running gag which never lets up and provides some worthwhile situations and banter. Frivolous but fun entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Popcorn Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's definitely something to see when watching a film that kick-started a lot of Hollywood's contemporary stars. Although Will Smith was already a popular sensation with his hit TV series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990-1996), this would be Smith's first entry into the action genre of films, thus having to never turn back after that. Martin Lawrence was pretty much in the same seat except that he didn't have as much notoriety as Smith. However, this film would too have Lawrence jump into the action film typecast role. Then there's the biggest realization of all. Other than directing a number of music videos, this would end up being the first film helmed by action director Michael Bay. It's interesting that there wasn't even a transition for this man. Straight from music to action blockbusters. Not even a TV movie before this, he must have had some connections.The plot follows a drug heist headed by mastermind Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo) where two cops who grew up together through childhood, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) only have a couple days to figure out where the deal to sell the drugs is going down. The only way these two can get the information is by protecting eyewitness Julie Mott (Téa Leoni), who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. For three writers consisting of Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland (who both wrote for comedy sketch shows for Dave Letterman) and Doug Richardson (Die Hard 2 (1990)), the script actually has nothing that stands out as something without good quality. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have energetic chemistry and work off each other well. Both also properly emote at the right times and give the right amount of clues to the audience on how each one grew up compared to each other. Will Smith is the smooth, calm and collected one. Even when he's mad, he's still calm. Martin Lawrence plays the opposite; a hyper, loud and rambunctious married man.Plus, there's a slew of other casting choices that make each scene worthwhile. Theresa Randle (a popular actress during this decade) plays Marcus' wife named Theresa (oddly enough). Joe Pantoliano plays Mike and Marcus' captain on the force that definitely acts like one. And then there's Nestor Serrano and Julio Oscar Mechoso who play another pair of cops who work along side Mike and Marcus. The only actor who isn't interesting in their role is Tchéky Karyo as Fouchet. Aside from trying to get his plan into action without being caught and speaking with his foreign accent, there's not much to say about his performance. Sure, Karyo is an unfeeling man with no conscious but much of his scenes don't involve him interacting directly with the main leads for the majority of the time. It just feels like there's a disconnect. Other than that, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have some very comical exchanges. Plus, with the film having an R rating, they both can really unleash their thoughts uncensored.Téa Leoni as Julie also adds some inventive scenes that aren't usually exploited in the buddy cop genre films. Although this film is in that vein, it doesn't feel so much like that here. Does the Julie character act with courage - yeah but does she do it because it's needed - no. It's always good to have a headstrong female character but here, Julie is just there to get Marcus and Mike hot headed. Then there's the action and special effects to this film. From what it looks like, this movie looked like it used no CGI, just practical effects. The action is also abundant as well with plenty of fistfights, shootouts and an occasional explosions. Which again, are all real looking. It's funny to see a movie directed by Michael Bay and see a movie done completely with practical effects and infrequent explosions. It just doesn't feel like the same guy everyone knows of today.However, the cinematography shot by Howard Atherton (best known for Fatal Attraction (1987)) isn't anything to cheer about. There are some camera shots that capture the Miami setting, but much of it is closed quarters. Whether it be in someone's home or warehouse, the angles from inside just don't suffice. There are a number of slow-motion shots (most likely due to Bay's request) that look good but again don't always stand out. Finally the music was an enjoyable listening experience. Composing the film score was Mark Mancina who had his first successful music release with Speed (1994) and then Fair Game (1995). Here, Mancina thankfully has a main theme for the franchise using guitar and what sounds like islander type drums. Considering the setting and who is starring in the film, it sounds appropriate. The action cues, which sound familiar to that of Trevor Rabin (but not entirely synthetic), are also lively enough to match the sequences that are displayed on screen. It's at those points; more percussion is used along with strings and horns. It is certainly effective. It's a fun watch.The plot's main villain isn't well defined and the cinematography is rather plain looking but the rest is wholesomely entertaining. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have peppy chemistry along with a number of other cast members. The catchy music and action sequences coalesce nicely too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One pretty slick film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a café, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bad Boys 1995" tells of the antics and adventures of a couple of constantly quarreling Miami detectives (Lawrence &amp; Smith) who have to juggle a small army of bad boy gangster types, a beautiful but reluctant witness, an irate wife, and miscellaneous police honchos, informers, etc. to the end of catching the perps who stole a ton of heroine from the police property room vault. One of the better flicks to come from the Bruckheimer and Bay team who brought us such Hollywood suck-excesses as "Pearl Harbor 2001", "Bad Boys" has lots of personality and sequel potential in addition to an abundance of raw action including firefights, chases, pyrotechnics, etc. Worthy of a second look by action junkies or any one old enough for an R rating who missed it first time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if u have time to kill, find better ways of doing it than watching this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching Hollywood movies 6 years back, watched some of the greatest classics and blockbusters of all times. Was amazed and awestruck that how was Hollywood capable of churning out such amazing stuff with such amazing consistency...but after seeing "Bad boys" and a few other disappointing movies, I realized that Hollywood too, wasn't perfect. Coming to the movie, the plot was an oft repeated one of two cops pairing up, both different in personas (infact diametrically opposite), and still great pals, one has a wife and kids and other is single and hot, the usual clichés. But that's not all that is bad about the movie..., there is more-the silly dialogues, lousy work by the lead pair, the female lead has no clue what to say or do, she often keeps mumbling and muttering in the background. Above all, the scenes are illogical and can't be attributed to be the actions of sane people. Martin Lawrence does ok in his role, but maybe he could have done better if he hadn't tried to fake that dialogue delivery style which looked very irritating and totally lacking in humor. Comic timing and wisecracks have to be differentiated from silly mannerisms, and this movie is a big example of that. Will Smith, is a little more subdued...but isn't able to emote much or come up with funny stuff. Téa Leoni has no role in the movie, she acts in the craziest, most insensible ways, invites trouble each time(if it was real life, she would have been killed the first time she tried to pull off those stupid stunts of hers), not to mention the male leads who too are guilty of this!!! The wife too is shown as an irrational human being who would make unjustified demands on his apparently busy husband. The movie is about the most irrational and stupid people we are ever going to come across. They do all sorts of crazy and suicidal things at the silliest pretext and dumbest logic!!! I hope there are no people of such kind anywhere in the universe. About the director, he must realize that a movie can be comic even though it has intelligent people in it, everything doesn't have to be so dumb. Besides, showing African Americans in such clichéd roles just tarnishes their image. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE MOVIE is the action scenes, and occasional good comedy. So, my advice is, if u have better things to do in life, don't watch it. If u really have to watch a movie, then rent some old favorite rather than go for it. GOD SAVE YOU.</fullReview>

Given how great of an actor Will Smith is, it hurts me to be so negative, but his acting is almost as bad as Lawrence's, even for a Bruckheimer production.If you like completely ridiculous movies with plots that are extremely far-fetched, but have lots of crap blowing up, and the sound on your TV is broken, you may enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Bad Could it Be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's what I asked myself BEFORE I watched this "movie". It had been playing on cable about 4 times a day for the last month so I finally decided to watch it. OH MY GOD! Why people like Joey Pants, Will Smith and Tea Leoni ever signed up for this piece of trash is beyond me. I hardly know where to begin.First, we all know that movies are shot scene by scene, but rarely is it so apparent as it is with this movie. Note the instantaneous switch from broad daylight to night as Tea climbs the stairs to escape the bad guys before jumping off the roof into the pool. Huh? I don't think even creative editing could have melded these disjointed segments together.The dialogue is so bad that the writer should have been ashamed to put his name in the credits. With the caliber of people in this movie I KNOW they could have add-libbed the entire thing and done a better job. And when Will and Martin go into their "spontaneous" arguments every time they are in trouble it just gets old very fast.The only reason I kept watching beyond the half hour mark is that Tea Leoni looked SO HOT in this movie. But even that couldn't keep me from pulling the plug after around the 1 hr 15 min mark. I could go on and on but then I'd just be wasting more of my time on this train-wreck of a movie.If you like action/comedy movies and or "buddy" movies you'd be better served by walking through that aisle in Blockbuster with your eyes closed and picking one at random. Few movies (with the possible exception of 8 Million Ways to Die) could be any worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys is one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie oozes style. Stylish good guys battle stylish bad guys in the stylish, sizzling city of Miami. I just can't say enough good things about Bad Boys.This is a film that works on many levels. Before Bruckheimer and Michael Bay became famous and lazy and made disappointing flicks (think Pearl Harbor and Armageddon), they made excellent movies like The Rock and Bad Boys. First off, directing is top notch. From the get-go, this movie moves along at a furious pace, and Bay's trademark slow-motion, close-up sequences are amazing.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence give first-rate performances as the supercool Miami Narc good guys. The villain Fouchet is also well-played by Karyo. Of course, there is the beautiful Tea Leoni. The assortment of smaller characters like Sanchez and Ruiz, Jojo, the Captain, and the goons add flavor to many scenes. Everyone is just so cool and stylish. I love Jojo the tire-man!Action sequences are some of the BEST ever filmed. The lobby shootout, Club Hell, and all the others. Even the soundtrack in this movie is awesome. Mancina's score fits this movie like a glove. And in between the action, there is hilarious humor and some quite moving emotional scenes. As for style...just watch. Miami, Miami Beach, Lowrey's black Porsche, the clothes, the bad guys, the women...its all there.I could go on and on about every single thing that is so great about Bad Boys, but I will stop here and invite all the action junkies out there to definitely see this!I give this movie 10/10. Action does not get any more stylish and cool than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilariously enjoyable as any black comedy and full of fast paced action, "Bad Boys," as a 'slick flick,' stars Martin Lawrence as Marcus Burnett and Will Smith as Mike Lowrey playing two cops who fall on to the trail of millions of dollars of Heroin stolen by a criminal mastermind named Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo) and try to recover it as well as rescue Julie Mott (Tea Leoni) who is also involved. Personal matters appear to Marcus Burnett who is obsessed with getting "quality time" with his wife Theresa (Theresa Randle) and almost loses his marriage when he is forced to switch names and use Mike Lowrey in front of Julie. The comedy works unmistakeably well, however, the only mistakes I find in here are the heavy profanity and the violence used. But I keep saying this to myself, how can you pardon the profanity if it works well with the script? Really many actors would probably have the problem with making the jump from TV to film, especially when their primary job had been comedy, with very little drama and no action, but Will Smith and Martin Lawrence succeed brilliantly. The comedic timing between these two actors is outstanding, and both pull off the dramatic scenes very convincingly, and the action scenes are well played and laid out thanks to the adrenaline charged directing of Michael Bay and the athletic prowess of the actors. Jerry Bruckheimer's skill for picking projects and finding the right people to make them come together seems to never fail, and "Bad Boys" is no exception.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

"Bad Boys" offers nothing new, but the archetypes work so well here that it's easy to overlook. Joe Pantoliano is genuinely funny when he's losing his cool, and the movie really rides on the chemistry between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. It's a bickering spouse partnership, and what could've been a stale formula outing turns into a great mismatched cop movie.But it's also a movie that's totally within Michael Bay's wheelhouse; some sort of loud high-gloss MTV genre flick.

		<shortDescription>Another Line of Buddy-Cop Rip-Offs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1980's and 1990's there have been numerous buddy-cop films that were in the long run very entertaining. Stuff like "48 Hours", Lethal Weapon", "Beverly Hills Cop" and more. Sure they're filled with excitement and intrigue leaving you fulfilled, but over the years, the tiresome formula has also spawned several rip-offs that were quite cheap. In 1995 "Bad Boys" was added to this list of cheap knock-offs with the direction that looks too MTV-like and has recycled plots from those action comedies that I have aforementioned. This movie is flooded with action sequences and the real reason behind that is to hide the fact that the storyline lacks any credibility behind it. The director (Michael Bay) thought the audience are only going to watch this movie to see explosions, bullets, and lots of dead bodies and not care in the least for logic and cohesiveness in the story. The inactive moments serve no purpose as were are left wondering if any of these pieces fit. Sure the pacing is very fast but at times it tends to just spin out of control. I mean if you lose control with the action scenes, you lose the story of the script and "Bad Boys" falls victim in that area. When it came time for brainstorming, the writers (Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland and Doug Richardson) had the simplistic idea (drug heist in Miami located in a police safe) and just have a way to wrap things up (like we know what will happen to the villains). Then we have like always the odd couple pairing of Marcus Bennett (Martin Lawrence) and Michael Lowery (Will Smith) who in spite of their hostility towards one another have mutual respect behind it all and a female witness (Tea Leoni) who's role is quite pivotal even if she messes up here and there at times. Sure there's nothing new to offer here, but it's the only thing about the movie that saves it from being entirely contrived. The poor script has very little thought and it truly brought this movie down quite substantially. In one very nonsensical scene Marcus and Michael are forced to swap identities when they are with the murder witness Julie Mott (Leoni). The comical elements serve no real purpose and it comes to the point of even caring about it at all. In fact sitcoms like "Three's Company" has managed to pull it off much better. I'll say that Lawrence and Smith are a likable duo. There's a great chemistry between the two of them goes beyond the humour factor. It's just that even their dialogue is just rehashed from other movies that executed them far better here. The supporting players are also victims to the formulaic tripe like the witty sidekick, the loyal wife (Theresa Randle), the corrupt criminal mastermind (Tcheky Karyo) and the always angry superior captain (Joe Pantoliano). If there was a positive thing about this movie was it was energetic and had a lot of style. The cinematography by Howard Atherton was very vibrant in colour and detail. The score by Mark Mancini compliments quite nice in terms of the chase scenes and the fights. But even the technical traits couldn't really save this film very much which in the end leaves "Bad Boys" an average film at most with lots of details that could've been handled with more care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A goofy action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys is a film directed by Michael Bay, and stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as two buddy cops. The film revolves around a drug heist from the vaults of a police station, and encompasses a related double murder, that needs to be solved by Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence). Fortunately for our buddies, one witness, Julie Mott (played by Tea Leoni) survived and will only assist Lowrey in his investigation, for fear of retribution from the criminal gang responsible for the heist and murders.This is a typical '90's action film, with buddy cop comedy, gun fights and explosions, and incomprehensible "switched identities" confusion. This film is pretty muddled where the plot is concerned, to say the least. The acting is typical Smith/Lawrence. They are funny and the buddy drama is well done, but it is difficult to take the two seriously, as they are often pursuing a punch line over any criminals. The heroes feel invincible, as they drop one liner after one liner during gunfights and car chases. This isn't always a bad thing, but leaves the viewer craving more of that, and less of the muddled Lowrey/Burnett swapping, or the wife who mistakes the switch for a cover-up affair with Leoni's character. Leoni herself was pretty good, but her character had little to do throughout the film, besides being the maguffin of the film.As you can see above, my opinion on Bad Boys is mixed. It's fun, and good for a laugh or two. The action is solid, if clichéd and a bit dated, but this is no complaint. The story, however, is a befuddled mess. The side characters are useless, and Lowrey and Burnett's buddy cop routine is strained during much of the film, due to incomprehensible identity swapping. The film is fun at times, and trying at others. It's worth a watch because it's fun, but for very little else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great buddy cop duo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is a single playboy cop with lots of family money. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is strictly a family man. Together they are a fast-talking smart Miami buddy cop duo. Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo) is a wily ruthless criminal leading a crew that robs the police evidence room of a large stash of heroin. The guys need to recover the heroin before others come in to take over the case. Mike's hooker CI encounters one of the crew. She is killed while her roommate Julie Mott (Téa Leoni) witnesses the murder and escapes. She is willing to only talk to Mike, and Marcus ends up pretending to be Mike.This is Michael Bay's big screen directorial debut. He already has much of his bombastic style. The best thing in the movie has to be the brash comedy duo. The movie sizzles every time they are together. The biggest problem is the switched identity gimmick. It's stupid and the movie struggles under the premise. There is some comedy derived from it but somebody needs to come up with a better excuse for the switcharoo. This is loud. This is cool. This has a great duo. But it's also overblown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm hot and cold on Michael Bay. I understand that his strength is in big action blockbusters and some are good and some are really bad. Bad Boys marked his directorial debut and for all intended purposes, it does its job well despite having a pedestrian plot.Good: You can already tell all the signature shots that Bay would use later in his career, but it is definitely somewhat toned down here. A very 90's looking film, but very slick and fast paced. The action is done well with requisite explosions. The big asset is Smith and Lawrence as the main characters. They play off each other well and make the generic buddy cop plot more fun. Joe Pantoliano is also entertaining as the police captain.Bad: The plot is pretty much every buddy cop movie ever made. Nothing about it really stands out and the villain is very weak. Tea Leoni doesn't necessarily do much other than react to the situations.Overall, it's a decent buddy action movie and a good start for Bay. Not one of his worst, but not his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>visually exciting, amusing and entertaining - a sexy action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the "love interest" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clichéd left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you're in a small box, whatcha gonna do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem.The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man.When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back.While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films.Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be "Bulletproof Hearts" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people.While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clichés, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Téa Leoni, and Tchéky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay's name doesn't inspire much confidence nowadays, what with those monstrosities that he calls Transformers movies. But the man has actually directed some good action films during his career. The case in point being his directorial debt, Bad Boys, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are also the two main reasons why this movie is bearable to watch.Because, well, the plot is crap. It's your average buddy cop film with charismatic main actors, nothing more. Absolutely nothing more. It hits every tired, old cliché there is and it doesn't even hit them with anything new. There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time.But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list.This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90&#x2032;s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day!Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case.100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters....A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna.This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons.It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star.It gave us Michael Bay and his editing.It's Lethal Weapon for generation X.It made Martin Lawrence endearing.Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies.The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain.It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite frankly, I'm sick of people endlessly bashing Michael Bay and his movies. His debut here is great for what it wants to be and brings back what was becoming an extinct genre in movies. This takes the buddy cop style and retrofits it with a highly stylized Miami backdrop, never- ending action and great characters. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence work extremely well together and have a great routine of ridiculous arguments and fighting. I like that this already has an established friendship, rather than another unlikely duo scenario. The plot here is great for what is necessary; an evil French mastermind trying to pull a fast one on Miami PD. When it comes to beautiful looking movies, you definitely can't even attempt to criticize Michael Bay. His talent in that area is obviously. Also, no one knows how to blow things up and cause mayhem and destruction like the mad scientist he is. While he might make movies that critics hate and oversimplify, I think it's obvious that he's a very talented director that knows exactly what he wants to do. Bad Boys delivers on every level for a buddy cop movie. It knows how to be genuinely funny, serious and action packed. I realize that there are those who just have an instantaneous hate for all things Michael Bay, but it's really no excuse to make Bad Boys out to be anything other than a great Buddy Cop action extravaganza. It's really fun to watch this every few years and remember what makes it so much fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so entertaining to watch and enjoy. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are absolutely hilarious. They two buddy narcotics police officers'who are foul-mouthed and at times crude. The action and humour in this movie is non-stop. Joe Pantoliano is also amazing. He makes the scenes with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence even more enjoyable. This movie has a good story, good plot, top notch acting and it is very well paced. Definitely one of the best cop films and one of the best action/comedy films released by Hollywood in years. I especially like the scene in which the two male leads and the female lead are in the shop for her to get shampoo. And then they get held up at gun point by the clerk, believing them to be robbers when in fact they are police officers. A perfect use of situational irony. If you like Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, you will definitely enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

Some I have already replaced like Seed Of Chucky and Freddy Vs. Jason. Lets first go to Bad Boys.This film is actually the first film done by Micheal Bay and this movie is very hidden in the shaddows along with the sequel. I am here to dig them up and talk them over.The film is about 2 cops Mike Lowry played by Will Smith and Marcus Burnett played by Martin Lawrence who have just 72 hours to reclaim a consigment of drugs and protecting a witness to a murder named Julie Mott played by Tea Leoni.The film has intense action, great comedy and is entertaining every single minute. I have heard talk about a third movie an I do hope it comes about. But for now we have Part 1 and 2 to watch again and again.Rated R For Intense Violent Action And Pervasive Strong Language.1hr 59min/119min.110 uses of the F-word.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two hip detectives, Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowery are on the case of the missing drugs got stolen in their police department. Now the narcotics division of the Miami Police Department might be shut down, if the drugs is found soon. But the drug investigation turns deadly serious, when Mike's beautiful police informant (Karen Alexander) got killed by the vicious criminal low-life (Tcheky Kayo). Which low-life and his men stolen the drugs. When an attractive woman (Téa Leoni) witness the crime, she asks Mike Lowery for help. But since the police department can't lose the witness, Marcus is forced to pretend to be Mike Lowery. Since Mike is a ladies man and Marcus is a family man. Marcus and Mike only have an few days to find the drugs before it is too late.Directed by Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Island, The Rock) made an wildly if uneven entertaining action movie with two enjoyable performances by Lawrence and Smith. Leoni is surprisingly good as the woman, who comes unexpectedly to their life's. Typical story made stylized by director Bay, who tries to make it fresh and different from buddy cop movies and he almost succeed. Since it is the directorial debut by Bay, who has great eye for action sequences.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an fairly interesting commentary track by the director, an isolated music score by Mark Mancina (Speed, Training Day, Twister), an behind the scenes featurette and more. "Bad Boys" isn't an great action movie, the premise could have been much better. Originally "Bad Boys" was going to be made with Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz! Certainly that would be a much different movie. It is made watchable, thanks to Lawrence, Smith and Leoni. It is a good if not totally successful movie from Bay. Followed by a sequel.

		<fullReview>Michael Bay's directorial debut, 'Bad Boys', is so beautiful to look at you could switch off the sound and just luxuriate in the stunning visuals. Bay's camera is rarely still, swooping energetically all over the place. If you are looking for mindless action with plenty of laughs thrown in then you have definitely come to the right place.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith star as two Miami cops who go after a bunch of bad guys who have stolen a huge amount of heroin from the two cops' police station. In the process they must provide witness protection to Julie Mott (Tea Leoni), a young woman who can ID the villains.The bad guy of the piece is Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo), and he is wonderfully sinister in a role quite similar to the one he would later play in the Jet Li martial arts actioner 'Kiss of the Dragon'. But the real treat of 'Bad Boys' is Joe Pantoliano as Captain Howard. Character actor Pantoliano is always likable, except perhaps as Cypher in 'The Matrix'. He takes his role which is pretty thankless - the screaming police chief - and really invests it with wit and charisma.The action scenes are dazzling and competently handled, climaxing with an explosive showdown at an aircraft hangar. On the whole, 'Bad Boys' is pretty forgettable. But it is very entertaining, and will definitely satisfy action fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay, now days, might not do that good of movies. I liked the original Transformers. But besides that one, what other good films did Michael Bay direct? Me, I think that Michael Bay's other good film is Bad boys with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Did I think that this was as good as Lethal weapon? No, but for a buddy cop movie, I liked it a bit more than Rush hour.I haven't seen this movie in a long time. so I can't exactly give you the story to it. But I sure know it was a good film. Michael Bay can't do good sequels. The only two sequels he directed sucked. Bad Boys II really blew and so did Transformers:Revenge of the fallen. At a time, Michael Bay wasn't so bad. But now days all of his movies aren't very good. Bad boys was a funny, fast paced, and fun movie. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence do a very good job and I can't help but give Bad boys a thumbs up.</fullReview>

Yes, the acting is bad, we've seen it all before in movies like Beverly Hills Cop and Lethal Weapon and there is no plot, it's just the two cops chasing bad guys and swopping identities, but as this is a Bruckheimer flick, it's the action which really does rule. No CGI cr*p. Best scenes are the hotel shootout, two car chases and the final raid. There is the comedy, such as:-SMITH : This is Mike Lowry. Why don't you whip it out for her, big boy?LAWRENCE : Yeah, on your forehead.I hope Bad Boys II is just as good.

		<fullReview>Most of you have already read the plot or even the movie, since it was launched back in 1995.What I want to write about is that everyone keeps dissing such movies because they have many discrepancies, but that's why people love them.Let's be honest, the main reason Bruckheimer made the movie is that two black funny actors put in such a situation would bring in crowds to the cinema and so, be a box-office hit, which it was. Every freaking critic alive says that these are mindless copies, but still people go to watch them.Most people live ordinary lives, go to work, get home, talk to the wife, eat some dinner and go to sleep, they want to be entertained my not complicated flicks such as Die Hard, Bad Company and Bad Boys.They do not present the kind of mind boggling action as some of M.Night what's his name, they just need the adrenaline, the rush of blood to the head while seeing Martin Lawrence driving a Porsche at 150 mph toward a brick wall.It's what works in Hollywood, it's what brings the money and that's all that matters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersWILL SMITH and MARTIN LAWRENCE put up a good performance in this one.THE PLOT.... marcus and mike, two, well worthy miami cops that get caught up in a tangled web of, murder, foul play, payback, revenge, and pure hell. when a bondage of one-hundred million dollars of narcotics are stolen from the police department. marcus and mike only have 3 days to find and catch the thives, and on the way of solving the case, mike ask one of his best-friend/girl to help him in her mate-n-date business where women will go with high rollers that call in and ask for a woman for a certian occasion. mike has warned his friend that the thieves could be some big-time ballers that want to party from the drug money and she is on the job. once when max (mike's girl) goes to the place where she's ordered to go, she brings along her bestfriend, julie. and when they arrive they run into a certian and familiar face that used to work for the miami police department and when max and julie discover herion on the table, they realize that this was not they're type of party so julie is requested to go to the bathroom and stall until max can go up and they can bounce in one peace. but, until a group of drug leaders and the lord comes crashing in and shooting max and the ex police officer, julie is upstairs, watching the whole murder and when she is spotted (and she could have been not if she would have stayed clear from sight) she is on the run for her life as the men come after her and she makes a near-death excape. then, she is on the run and wanting mike lawry. once when marcus and mike is at the crime scene and discover the police officer and their best friend, dead. and now, they know someone is missing from the scene cause of a glass with two shades of lipstick and that just happens to be.. julie, and now the only hope is to find julie, catch the thives, bust the drug operation, and make a big drug cracking in miami..In some sort of way this movie is quite irratating like a horror movie when someone does something so, so, stupid and it just make some people sick, but that's the punch line of making an action, horror, thriller, or whatever on the edge of you not knowing if they're going to make a excape or get killed. but here is some of the irratating momments..--WARNING-- SOME SPOILERS; YOU'RE READING AT YOUR OWN RISK(would you walk in a house with the main door, wide open, with a digusting aroma coming from inside?) (would you stay inside a house when the phone goes dead and the lights go off?) (when you was clear and not in sight of when a murder has taken place and knowing that if you were seen you would get be murdered also.) and.. (would you leave your protective costudy area, and knowing you were safe and could not be found unless if someone "f***ed up" and letting the bad people have a clue to where you were. would you leave?)That's what make me so irritated about some events in a movie. I would not let no child under the age of 13 to see this movie, cause, This movie is rated _R_ and is not there for you to say that it's o.k and let your child watch it and then be mad because of what it has in it. The movie has some, FOUL and PERSUASIVE LANGUAGE, and STRONG INTENSE-ACTION VIOLENCE..If you want a rush "Watch This" and I would reccomend along with this.. "ROMEO MUST DIE. SET IT OFF. MENACE II SOCIETY."^^ 2 Thumbs Up.*** Stars" I would not reccomend this movie for deeply religious people, children, or people who do not or take swearing offensively."</fullReview>

This movie might give some mystery when you first watch it. I've seen it so many times it's hard to remember the first time. The jokes are always funny, and you catch more of them as you watch a few times.A warning to parents and the younger audience, this move is LOADED with bad language. Not really a family movie.

		<fullReview>Is this the best action comedy of the '90s? Probably. This film is set in Miami, where Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are a couple of cops in the narcotics division. They make their career bust, busting $200 million worth of heroin. It is soon stolen, and they have a few days to get it back before the whole station is shut down. This leads them onto a trail, which is packed with action.With out Smith and Lawrence this film would be nothing. This is Smith's finest hour, as from then on he decided to do kid's films, with not much swearing or violence. The constant arguing between the two partners is hilarious and you will be laughing very often - as long as you like black humor. By that, I don't mean dark and sick stuff, but the kind of dialogue which can only be performed by black actors.I recommend this film to everyone, you will not be disappointed.I cannot believe that it is rated as 6.3 outta 10...should be more like 9.5/10, if you have a sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story to a certain extent in Bad Boys is relatively shallow(you can also argue that it's littered with various movie cliches). The enemies (along with their motives) are pretty under-developed and at times the humor seemingly goes threw a repetitious cycle. There either maybe excessive bickering or some fairly lame situations that play out as something that perhaps belong in a situation comedy. One of the biggest assets in the movie is the high amount of tension. The action sequences are so exciting (along with a rousing musical score), that it gets to a certain point in which you're able to look pass the various flaws. The pacing doesn't really bog down to a substantial level and the entire climax manages fairly successfully to top everything else. Almost every scene in the climax manages to top itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, this is one of my favorite movies. Michael Bay proves himself to be an excellent director of action packed movies. The soundtrack score of Mark Mancina reflects the thrilling scenes. This film was definitely the breakthrough for Will Smith. Humor, great scenes, car chases, shoot outs, girls ... all in one fantastic movie, a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so glad to see that some people like this film as much as I did. I don't think that it should've won any academy awards, but it deserved to be a hit at the box office. I think that the direction by Michael Bay was cool and I think that the chemistry between Lawrence and Smith is the best I've ever seen, even better than 48 Hours. The reason the critics didn't like it was because the script wasn't too great, and I'll admit it wasn't the greatest, but they were really stupid by saying that this movie wasn't good, I bet you some of them even liked it, but feared of being ridiculed if they actually had admitted that. So, just forget what you may have read from critics, and sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so awesome. It has great action scenes like the gun fight at the end and the very cool car chase with the porsche and the cobra. It's also hiliarious. Will Smith has always been one of my favorite actors and makes every one of his movies enjoyable. This is Smith's best movie yet. Martin Lawrance is also awesome. I've always been a big fan of action/comedies like Lethal Weapon. A lot of people complain about the swearing but I liked it. Producers Jerry Bruckhiemer and Don Simpson did a great job with this movie like they did with the first two Beverlly Hills Cop movies and The Rock. Michael Bay is one of my favorite directors and this is his best movie ever. I can't wait until the sequel comes out. Go out and buy this movie.</fullReview>

It's got jokes, guns, fights, fast cars, sexy women, it has everything. The chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is great. One minute they are the best of friends, the next they are winding each other up and finally they are hard-ass cops doing what they gotta do. Tea Leoni is well cast as Julie. She manages to be a very frightened murder witness and yet still keep her cool when the going gets tough.Watch out for the race scene at the end between Marcus and the bad guy, the film is worth owning for that scene alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is best to say Bad Boys is nothing but a watchable action comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay's Bad Boys is Bay's first feature film and it may probably be his finest film. Unfortunately it's not saying much because Bay happens to prefer the road of over-stuff and senseless rather than clear and capable. The story is simple and easy-going, Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are two detectives for the Miami Police Department (MPD), who are called to search a one-hundred millions dollars' worth of heroin that was stolen from a protected vault. The main anti-hero Fouchet (Karyo) plans out the heroin high-jack. Julie (Leoni), the protagonist just happens to be in the wrong place at wrong time, and becomes the key witness for the MPD. It is up Lowrey and Burnett to capture Fouchet and his men, and be sure Julie is in protective custody. Lawrence and Smith did a fine job occupied together as detectives; both men have characters and an understanding that delivers the moving drive to the script. Fouchet in other hand was lame. He was the leading villain, but he didn't seem cool, badass, or even interesting. Through-out the entire film, the guy seemed boring and unexciting. Though Bad Boys was not perfectly completed, but it is best to be said that Bad Boys is entertaining for those who are looking for it. It's no-where near the best example of ludicrous popcorn flick, but the flick does have the viewers that will surely be pleased with the entire film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet &amp; to the point?Cheers.)Bad Boys my arse. Somewhat bad, unless you're referring to Michael Jackson-Bad. This 1995 film was even too formulaic for that year, worse now 17 years later. Slowly paced and filled with already over-used clichés, it was almost as if they just wanted to make the full-on black Lethal Weapon. I figured I'd finally see it just to see what all the hype was about, especially since they followed it up with a sequel and talks for a third one is in the constant works. I wasn't impressed enough to move on. It doesn't help that I'm not a huge Martin Lawrence fan, although I do like Will Smith. Just not enough for a recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Solid Guy's Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say, Bad Boys is a solid action thriller which is preferably suited for a guy action junkie. A comedy cop buddy film, this is probably the film that re-enfranchised the genre after Lethal Weapon. Bad Boys has a lot of action to it, gunfights, car chases, the usual points that a buddy film has. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence deliver good performances as the squabbling buddies who just want to get the bad guys.The film has explosive action like most films of the same genre, maybe this is why this is in most people's eyes only a moderately good film. But you must also remember the genre has been done so many times with sequels and badly made crossovers, Bad Boys isn't a cross over or just another cheap studio attempt. Michael Bay directed Bad Boys, and he has made his mark in the industry with the likes of The Rock and Transformers, maybe because he did this film is the reason why I love this film on a Friday night.This film I would recommend for mostly action junkies or just a movie for the boys hence the genre. Not much is new here to some critics, I would agree with them yes but I would also say that Bad Boys puts a new look to an old genre that has been re-done so many times very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action film that will forever be stuck in the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bad Boys" is a 1990s cop movie. The music, the slow motion, the excessive amount of explosions and the reference to a retired Michael Jordan in 1995 give that away easily. Good films transcend time and a majority of the people that watch "Bad Boys" in the future will not be too impressed with what they see.The movie is in the action genre, but the plot seems focused around the lives of Mike and Marcus (Smith and Lawrence), cop partners with different lives who constantly argue with each other. Basically, what you get is Smith and Lawrence arguing or doing something stupid, action scene, Smith and Lawrence arguing or doing something stupid again, another action scene. It gets redundant and old very fast, especially because the plot is simple (someone stole heroin from the police) and the 'bad boys' or the antagonists are so distant from the film that they seem stupid.Michael Bay deserves credit for establishing himself as the best director when it comes to blowing stuff up. He will forever have that mark on Hollywood and this is where it started, but his interesting action sequences are empty and aimless thanks to a bad cop movie plot.The only thing keeping the entertainment value of "Bad Boys" up is the duo of Smith and Lawrence. While they argue way too much, there are some funny scenes and other scenes in which they come across as very bad ass. Without them, the film would basically be like someone trying to turn Walt Disney World's Indiana Jones stunt spectacular into a movie: there would be nothing interesting worth following and just stuff blowing up to keep people intrigued.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like action movies, 99% of them is pure rubbish. All you get in this kind of movies is an army of bad guys being shot with more bullets than were used in World War I and II together, all fired by our beloved hero. He comes out of the fight without a scratch of course and quickly spits out some bad one-liners when standing over all those dead bodies (think of all the movies with Seagal, Schwarzenegger, Stallone...) They make me sick!If you have seen one, you've seen them all. So why did I watch Bad Boys then? Well, as I said, 99% is pure rubbish, there is still 1% left and I consider Bad Boys to be one of this percent. OK, the story isn't very original, but the acting is OK and I had a good laugh from time to time thanks to Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Don't expect an intellectual movie when renting or buying Bad Boys. Just go for the action scenes spiced up with a nice dose of humor, which certainly make it worth a watch. When watching a movie I look for some quality time and a good and original story has a lot to do with that of course, but having a good laugh from time to time doesn't hurt either... That's why I reward it with a 7/10. I liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible spoiler here)Plot -- Two vice cops (Martin Lawrence and Will Smith) must protect a young woman who is the only witness against a lethal drug lord. Also at stake is millions worth of heroin, stolen from a police evidence locker.Critique -- "Bad Boys" is an appropriately mediocre feature film debut for director Michael Bay. Though clearly intended as an action-comedy, the film does not deliver enough laughs or thrills to be anything other than a passable time-waster. It's one of these movies you rent on a rainy Sunday afternoon, only to forget the next day. I'm shocked it was such a hit, but I guess the stars had a lot of fans (I do like Smith, but I don't run out to catch everything he appears in).Lawrence and Smith both have strong screen presence, but they've done better in other movies. As the story unfolds, circumstances force them to exchange identities, in a plot development that is...contrived, to say the least. I could practically hear the plot-mechanisms creaking and groaning. Still, it's not a total loss. The final half hour is quite diverting, with two consecutive action scenes. The two stars, as well as Joe Pantoliano as an obnoxious but dedicated police captain, have an undeniable charisma. "Bad Boys" has a slick, glossy sheen throughout. But that isn't enough to recommend the film. It's most telling that according to the Internet Movie Database, even Bay himself disliked the script, and had the stars improvise certain lines. This movie goes on for much too long; its flaws would have been less apparent in a tighter film. In fact, I would have welcomed more explosions and a higher body count.Rating: (**) out of fourReleased by Columbia Pictures</fullReview>

How very convienient for instance that a girl would accompany her friend to work, that just happens to be a hooker. What's she going to do, wait for a few minutes until they're finished??? When they're running from the club and apprehend a truck it just happens to be full of ether. I don't think ether just happens to be everywhere the same way it is in this film. Then of course the bad guys bullets can't penetrate the barrels because they don't blow up unless the good guys shoot at them.This is a really lame cliched story saved (in part only) by the antics of Will Smith and Martin Laurence, a beautiful woman and a lot of guns and explosions.

		<fullReview>Before these two stars (or even blockbuster director Michael Bay) were household names, there was Bad Boys. Moderately successful, the film went on to be a cult favorite. Why, you ask? Because, my dear friend, it is a fun movie. A couple of trash talkin' idiots as Narcotics Officers, running rampant through the otherwise serene streets of Miami, trying to prevent a massive drug deal of ridiculous proportions, while still finding time for well timed comedic elements, is my definition of fun. The plot, while paper thin, is executed with a type of seriousness that makes us believe that, "Yeah, okay, this could happen".Will Smith carries this film rather professionally, and short and married Marcus (Martin Lawrence) is the perfect anti-thesis to his tall playboy Mike Lowery. Teo Leoni does her job as the terrified witness, but doesn't excel in any way. Good old Joe Pantoliano is perfectly cast as the permanently exasperated and voluble captain, and Theresa Randle and the other cast also perform well.The true star of the movie though, in my humble eyes, is Tchéky Karyo, who absolutely dominates and redefines the character, "The Mean Bad Guy". Everything about him oozes hostility, I can vividly remember cracking up for extended periods of time whenever he would speak, just because the dude sounded so p***ed off! "Looks like I'm catering this party, Eddie" or "You're F*CK*NG with my timetable!!" was the reason I almost got my ass kicked for laughing so much in the theater. Brilliant.The soundtrack, especially the main Bad Boys theme, rocked. I hear the sequel doesn't sport this theme, hopefully Dre can step up.Minor quips include ridiculous black / white stereotypical jokes, which all major producers seem to think sell like sex. Also, the "switcheroo" element of the plot was abysmally wretched to the point of inducing vomit. Why, why insult my brain so?But all in all, this is a great movie for guys, and for patient girls who put up with guy movies so they can spring "Maid in Manhattan" on us at a later date. Not recommended for older dudes, or people with a strong critic in them. After all, this movie isn't going to win Oscars, but damn it, it's fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of 80's cop movie clichés, but it's still better than Bad Boys II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot in this movie is absolutely nothing spectacular and is VERY basic. There are also plot holes all over the place. The constant arguing between Smith and Laurence also gets on the nerves and spoils the slight chemistry that they have. But Michael Bay's direction puts a glossy shine on an otherwise cruddy movie. But he made the movie in 1.85:1. Why?The plot, for what it's worth, concerns a dealer (Tchecky Kayro in a virtually nameless role) who s an idiot member of his gang. Beautiful Julie Mott (Tea Leoni) witnesses the slaying and is marked for . She calls the cops but for a dumb reason will only talk to Mike Lowrey (Will Smith). Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is the only person there who can take the call and assumes the role of Mike in order to take Julie into 'in-home' protective custody. Why he doesn't just reveal to her right away that he told a little white lie only to get her out of harms way?I dunno. Perhaps it is because it's the only plot element that the legion of writers could abuse to inject the slightest amount of comedy and drag out an 85-minute to 2 hours. It irritates beyond comprehension and the film should really have been dumped in the direct to video bucket instead of having a cinema release. But as long as the film masquerades as a proper Hollywood movie everything will be okay.A Hollywood movie it certainly is. It took 10 years for Bad Boys to be made and many changes to the script took place in that time. It was originally set in New York and was to star John Lovitz and Dana Carvey as the leads. It was shopped around Hollywood, chewed-up and spat out by many studios, until Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer picked it up and thought that turning it into a shiny and bright action adventure could redeem it. The budget wasn't too high and Bay did as much as he could considering the tiny amount of money he had (even spending part of his own salary) and did an impressive job too. The action scenes certainly make up for the lulls in the plot. Too bad there is not enough of them. The van chase, shootout in the lobby and final battle are way cool and Mark Mancina's score is incredible. Too bad the score isn't available on CD but there is 5.1 isolated score on the DVD. Everyone should see Bad Boys at least once as there will be something for everyone but do not expect a great or original plot. There isn't one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Tea Leoni was good. So was Tcheky Karyo. Smith and Lawrence were OK, but all the best lines were given away in promos. The script had gaping holes. The action sequences were adequate, they blew a lot of stuff up pretty well, but the film was SO formulaic that I couldn't really concentrate on anything else. I gave it 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great action-comedy. Action and comedy are my two favourite genres, so it's no surprise that I like both in the one movie, one of the reasons I loved most of the 'Lethal Weapon' series. (except the first) Bad Boys is no exception, it is very funny, with a lot of violence and action mixed in. There is a lot of coarse language, also similar with the 'Lethal Weapon' series (especially No.4), and it is great for a buddy cop movie (which the 'Lethal Weapon's' are too). So, if you liked this, you're more than likely going to like the 'Lethal Weapon' series. (except the first)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lawrence and Smith show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The producers of this film appear to be parodying some of their own better made action features involving two cops. In this case, narc cops working in Miami. The director, Michael Bay, indulges his two stars in what becomes a show where the two leads trade barbs and funny lines, perhaps to amuse themselves. This is a total rip off of much better cop films the producers have made.The irritating factor of watching the film resides in Martin Lawrence's take on one of the cops, the supposedly normal Marcus. He has a knack for turning serious situations into his screen "shtick". Will Smith doesn't fare much better.As an action movie, it owes big time to the crisp cinematography of Howard Atherton who gives it a great look and captures the Miami scenery in its splendor. The art direction of Peter Politanoff takes us to some out of the way places and even familiar ones around Sun City. The music score is by Marc Mancina.This is highly recommended for fans of the two stars who will probably have a ball watching their idols.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A smooth talking ladies man and his very married partner are the "Bad Boys" in question here. Together this cop duo show plenty of attitude while pursuing a ruthless crim who has stolen millions of dollars worth of coke from under the noses of the Miami P.D. There are explosions and gunplay aplenty, a sexy girl and a useless, unfunny subplot propelling this romp."Bad Boys" is another cop buddy action flick with absolutely nothing new on offer. Both script and action sequences borrow much from other, superior action movies, and the whole film is just far too formulated to make any sort of impression.The cast are uninspiring, the story seriously lacks some fresh effective humour, and not only are the bad guys totally predictable and one dimensional (they can't shoot straight either - but what's new?), but the good guys are void of depth too.Still, all things being equal, "Bad Boys" never pretends to be Oscar material. So, if dumb, loud action films are your thing, then by all means give these boys a whirl, or rather let them give you one!Tuesday, May 23, 1995 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited about seeing Bad Boys, I just decided that I wanted to see the movies because I love Will Smith and I noticed that over all, most people seem to like this movie. My only thing that was holding me back from seeing this film was Martin Lawerence. For the most part, he annoys me and it seems like he has the same part in every movie, but I have to admit, I could tolerate him during this film.Marcus and Mike are two partner cops on the force together, they have been friends for a long time, Marcus is a married family man and Mike is still living up his one night stands. The boys are assigned to a missing dope case that turns into murder and helping the only witness, Julie, survive. Marcus takes the role as playing Mike to make sure that his family is safe, but you can guess how this story is going to turn out from here.Bad Boys was a pretty good buddy cop film, but it could have been funnier. Still, it was more original than most buddy cop films, considering that at least these bad boys had been friends for a long time. I would recommend Bad Boys for action movie lovers, it's worth a good watch, otherwise, it's an OK film for any average film fan.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As two hard-line cops who work hard at their job, and do their best along the way. When a "career bust" in heroin disappears from the city police's locked evidence cage, it's up to our two heroes to find out where it went and why.In the classic style of "Beverly Hills Cop," "Lethal Weapon" and "Tango and Cash"-meet-the-Wayan Brothers style, this movie entertains you at least as good as the aforementioned comparisons Lawrence and Smith are highly volatile in this action/comedy, pulling off gritty one-liners while kicking major butt. There is the predictable presence of car-crashes, explosions and obligatory chase scenes, but the performances of Smith and Lawrence totally redeem the predictability of the movie.Their characters are well developed and are convincingly portrayed with the greatest of talent. The one-liners take an appropriate break when the drama is high, and Smith shows a very gifted side to his talent as a thespian in the portrayal of his character. I must also say the same thing about Lawrence. I never thought I would like Martin Lawrence as a dramatic actor, but his abilities really shine in this film. He is quite believable, as is Smith. Very talented actors. I'll never think of either of them as strictly comedic actors again. I was actually impressed with them both. I liked them both better in these more serious parts than in the comedies they've each done. Also, I highly recommend the "Special Edition" version of this movie on DVD. There are the usual stunning music videos at the end of this version (featuring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, of course) and, while I find them completely self-serving and to be the height of arrogance, they are also entertaining.I would also like to add that the cinematography of the scenery between scenes is breath-taking. Michael Bay must have spent days scouting the scenery that was filmed in this movie. He captured some of the most beautiful areas of Miami. Finely and expertly done.Afterward: Tea Leone was extremely believable in this movie. Much better than her stiff and sometimes halting performance in "Jurassic Park 3." MUCH better.This is an excellent movie and I can't wait for Bad Boys 2 to come out on DVD!! This was great fun with beautiful cinematography and a solid story-line.It gets an 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of Michael Bay, who never has a cut longer than five seconds and seems to be in love with three different shots that he rehashes for all of his movies (The .25 second long tight close-up showing a character expressing shock, someone running in slow motion and the shot from ground level looking up at a character or a number of characters as the sky rolls slowly above him/her/them.)What "Bad Boys" has going for it, and why it succeeds where "The Rock" and "Armageddon" failed miserably, are Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who flat-out carry this movie. It's pretty obvious that a number of scenes (Pretty much every scene that's good for a laugh) was ad-libbed, and it's equally obvious that Smith and Lawrence had a great time filming this.Aside from that, the movie is a strictly by-the-number buddy cop-flick with absolutely no surprises that suffers even more because of Michael Bay's seizure-inducing camera techniques. Check it out strictly for Will and Martin.</fullReview>

The twist is that Smith's character is some millionaire playboy who takes a job as a drug cop because of the excitement and the satisfaction of ridding the streets of scum. Like all of his other roles, Smith brings absolutely nothing to the part, and plays it just as stupidly as it is written and conceived. Martin Lawrence, on the other hand, has never been good or funny in anything he's every been in, ever, so no surprises from him.Now they're making a Bad Boys II.

		<fullReview>This is a great movie for the deaf. If you like a movie where the principal actors spend most of the time shouting - and I mean shouting - at each other about issues outside the plot, then this is the movie for you. I love Will Smith but what was he thinking? Clearly this is a movie for Will and Martin Lawrence, not for an audience. Lawrence is atrocious and so convinced of his prowess as a comic actor that he spends the entire movie stammering (at full volume) in what he presumes to be funny self deprecating and witty confusion. Well it's not. Its so tedious in fact that I thank god for the mute button. There is barely any actual conversation, just shouting. Sadly Wills character is barely removed from the Fresh Prince and in order to wear his clothes and "look cool" the writers invented a device that has him inherit money so he can buy himself a Porche and a cool apartment whilst enjoying being lead fodder for criminals. Will is a better actor than that. I can suspend disbelief so far, but come on! All I can say is thank goodness it was on TV and that I didn't pay to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 7/20/2007 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Michael Bay): Worthless Michael Bay-directed garbage. After this one, I think Michael Bay has been cemented in my mind as one of the worst directors of all time. As you can tell, I'm not one of his fans. This time, he has taken a couple of pretty appealing movie stars and turned them into worthless action heros with the occasional one-liner thrown in (Aka -Travolta &amp; Cage w/ Face-Off). This time he's done it with Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence. He has the unique ability of spending lots of money blowing things up and devoiding the audience of all caring for it's characters. This movie is about a bickering cop due who become involved in a major drug deal and protecting a witness, played by Tea Leoni. She provides some of the only nice moments in the movie with some witty lines despite her weak character. Smith &amp; Martin bicker throughout the whole movie, their cop boss yell at them a few times, things blow up, there are a few car chases, people get killed and the good guys end up winners in the end. That's about it for this mindless action-comedy movie from one of the biggest money wasting directors of our time, who has very little good stuff to show for it. America, please give up on this genre and this director before we all go bankrupt!!</fullReview>

The acting of Martin Lawrence is awful. During the whole film he is overacting and a pain in the neck. Will Smith is not much better, he tries to be the super cool, charming black hero who can get every woman.The story is all the way predictable, after the first 5 minutes you know how the movie will end. So the story is not exciting, it doesn't astonish the audience, it is just boring and you always can easily guess what will happen next.If you want to watch a senseless action movie better watch XXX because even this crap is better than Bad Boys.

		<fullReview>Bad Boys, unlike Bad Boys II, that spawned from the loins of this film, runs less then two hours, coming in at 118 minutes. The reason I mention this is because I wanted to start my comments by saying something positive about this film.Bad Boys is without a doubt one of the more insipid, tasteless, humorless comedy/action films ever to be put on celluloid. Bad Boys is so bad it makes a film like Smokey And The Bandit look like Academy Award stuff in comparison. At the beginning of this film, we get a group of criminals, led by the evil head criminal Fouchet(Tcheky Karyo), who are intelligent enough to steal $100 million dollars in heroin from a police vault. Unfortunately for them, they get away with the heroin, but leave their brains back in the vault as they then become the stupidest criminals to pull off a heist since Peter Falk concocted The Brink's Job. They kill stupidly and randomly, starting with a girl friend of Mike Lowery(Will Smith), then one of their own guys, all in front of a witness, Julie Mott (Tea Leoni). So of course instead of going into hiding, getting their job done and selling the heroin, they decide it's a better idea to chase down Mott and shoot at some cops, shoot up the city and make themselves as conspicuous as possible. Compared to the actions of Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowery though, these drug dealers are Einstein.Burnett and Lowery are partners, who must find the heroin and the crooks, protect Mott, their only witness, and do it within three days time so their department doesn't get closed down and they are out of a job. We know this because their boss Capt. Howard(Joe Pantoliano)keeps calling them in to yell, scream and holler this point several times during the film so that they couldn't possibly forget let alone the audience. As if all this wasn't enough, we get this totally ridiculous side plot, having to do with mistaken identity, that is straight out of an old Doris Day/Rock Hudson movie. Why they put it in this film is beyond me and totally unnecessary. It does give Martin Lawrence a chance to do mug for the camera, act stupid and annoying, sort of like Jerry Lewis in some of his worst movies.The only interesting worthwhile actor in this film is Tea Leoni, but they give her a case of the stupids along with everyone else so her performance is wasted. Martin (I never met a four letter word that wasn't funny) Lawrence seems to have most of the screen time, and it is excruciating to watch. Will Smith isn't quite as bad, but he just phones this one in and appears disinterested throughout. The so called "banter" between Lowery and Burnett, is never funny just forced. There is no rapport at all between them.Michael Bay might know how to stage an action sequence, he just doesn't know how to film one. He seems to think that action sequences are the same as a music video, filming them with quick cuts, shaky camera, incomprehensible close-ups at crucial moments, slow motion of Burnett and Lowery firing their Weapons, so that when there is something going on it's unwatchable to the audience. It is incomprehensible that this film did as well as it did. It's amazing what star power will do I guess. Worst then that, and even more astonishing, is that this mess bred a more inept sequel. At least we had eight peaceful years before Bruckheimer and Bay dropped the second bomb. Be thankful for small favors. </fullReview>

Luckily for them there is a witness The only problem is the timing as Martin Lawrence is forced to pretend to be his partner Mike Lowery well trying to keep their only witness safe. Joe Pantelione is great as the cliché Sergeant. With great lines and great chemistry Bad Boys is easily the best buddy cop film since lethal weapon. Although I find the second Bad Boys to be more entertaining this will always be a classic and you can see what Michael Bay can do with an R rated low budget action film.

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Thrilling And Hilarious Action-Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys is an excellent,thrilling and hilarious Action-Comedy that combines great direction,a fantastic cast,amazing Action,non-stop laughs and a memorable score and soundtrack. All of those elements make Bad Boys one of better Action movies of the 1990s that is Michael Bay,Martin Lawrence and Will Smith at their best.Set in Miami,Florida,Bad Boys tells the story of Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence)and Mike Lowery(Will Smith)long time best friends who are also Cops and partners in the Miami Police department and are good at their jobs. When a large supply of Heroin is stolen from the police department Burnett and Lowery have to try and get back the dope while protecting and watching over a murder witness Julie(Tea Leoni)with Action,thrills and laughs coming from every corner.Released in 1995,Bad Boys is a terrific,Action-packed and hilarious Action-Comedy that looking back on the movie seemed like a big gamble at the time because it was the directorial debut of director Michael Bay with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith(who were both on very funny hit Sitcoms Martin and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air)in lead roles. But the gamble was a big pay off with Bad Boys grossing 141 Million dollars dollars worldwide at the Box Office and is one of the better Action-Buddy-Comedy films in the genre that is still watched to this very day and is one of my favorite Action-Comedies. Bad Boys is a movie that I have loved since I first saw it in theaters in 1995 and is a film that I watch to this very day whenever it's and is just a movie that is just pure,solid entertainment from start to finish for 2 whole hours with Action,thrills and laughs that come at a non-stop rate and is a film that grabs your attention with lots of style. While Bad Boys has an air of predictability and the storyline isn't very groundbreaking or revolutionary there is just something about Bad Boys that makes it so re-watchable after many viewings. The Action scenes in Bad Boys are terrific and memorable with plenty of gunfights,explosions and chases that are exciting and well-done like any Jerry Bruckheimer-Don Simpson production. All of the Bruckheimer and Simpson style is in this film:slow motion,flashy visual style and camera movements presented in all of it's glory in this film. Also,Miami,Florida in Bad Boys is stunning and gorgeous and is one of the best movies set in Miami because with Bad Boys you as a viewer are sucked into Miami and you are having fun while being thrilled. The Comedy and laughs in Bad Boys are just hilarious and funny with scenes and dialog that come alive thanks to the antics of Burnett and Lowery whether it's the back and forth bickering between them or the one-liners that are said. The thing that makes Bad Boys so entertaining all of these years what holds the movie together is the duo Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery. Unlike most Buddy movies or Action-Buddy-Comedy where the duo are put together and take time to gel together,Burnett and Lowery are already partners and best friends who know each other like the back of their hands. You feel like there is a love and brotherhood between the two and when there is always trouble they will be there for one another no matter what. We also see the differences between them in terms of their personal lives where Burnett is a married man with kids and Lowery is a bachelor with a lavish life style,but when they get into a shootout or chase the two manage to work together and get the job done. Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery are a great and funny duo that are in my opinion one of the better buddy cop duos in the Action-Comedy sub genre. The ending of Bad Boys is fantastic and great with plenty of Action and thrills that will leave viewers smiling and wanting more. A wonderful ending.The cast is wonderful. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent and hilarious as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery,with Lawrence and Smith being funny and having great chemistry. Tea Leoni is terrific,beautiful and sexy as Julie,a witness who's being watched by Burnett and Lowery. Tcheky Karyo is fantastic as Fouchet,the main villain. Joe Pantoliano is great as Captain Howard,Burnett and Lowery's commander. Theresa Randle is memorable and beautiful as Theresa Burnett,Marcus' wife. Vic Manni(Ferguson),Frank John Hughes(Casper),Nestor Serrano(Detective Sanchez),Julio Oscar Mechoso(Detective Ruiz),Marg Helgenberger(Captain Ailson Sinclair),Michael Imperioli(Jojo),Saverio Guerra(Chet),Mark Macauley(Noah),Karen Alexander(Max),Emmanuel Xuereb(Eddie Dominguez)and John Salley(Fletcher)give good performances as well.The direction by Michael Bay is wonderful and stylish,with Bay giving the movie a nice pace and a cool visual style using different angles and doing a great job with the Action scenes. Fine direction,Bay.The score by Mark Mancina is great,intense and matches the Action throughout the film. Good score,Mancina. There is also a terrific Hip-Hop/R&amp;B soundtrack with songs that goes with the energy of the film.In final word,if you love Michael Bay,Martin Lawrence,Will Smith,Action films or Action-Comedies,I highly suggest you see Bad Boys an excellent,thrilling and hilarious Action-Comedy that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of My Favourote Will Smith Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People say a lot of negative things about Jerry Bruckheimer, however the man does know how to produce a solid action flick. Movies like "Armageddon", "The Rock" and "Con Air" are all superb action movies of the highest calibre. Plot In A Paragraph: Mike Lowry (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) two Miami detectives, must protect a witness to a murder while investigating some stolen heroin."Bad Boys" still holds up very well twenty years later. OK, some of the dialogue is a little hokey and lame, but that is only a minor problem and really only nit picking, and it's hard to criticise a movie for that when it gets so much else right. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence (improving a lot of scenes) are a lot of fun, and have great on screen chemistry. Tea Leoni is gorgeous, but her delivery at times is awful, (though I'm not sure if it was the fault of the dialogue itself) Joe Pantolianao steals all his scenes as Captain Howard</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most enjoyable romps I have seen. An excellent and difficult production, bolstered by great performances. Wonderful movie, and I should know, I practically grew up on it. This cast interacts with absolute precision, whether walking around a room or interrupting each others' wisecracks. Certainly the characterizations are shallow and quickly changeable, often for little or no reason.As social commentary I give it an eight; for story and acting a five. It's worth seeing for some inventive uses of sound and the actors. This is a great film with a tone reminiscent of other great films. Quality work that draws you in and doesn't let you go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys is just a pure action classic! I am a sucker for buddy cop films and Bad Boys is without a doubt my favorite buddy cop film. It is also the perfect action comedy. It seems as though with action comedies there are two possible things that can happen. You can have a film that has mostly comedy but with some action, though not BIG action like Beverly Hills Cop for example. Or you can have a film with a ton of BIG action yet just have some humorous moments here and there like Die Hard for example. What I always loved about Bad Boys and it's sequel is that it has equal amounts of action and comedy. You can be at the edge of your seat watching an intense action scene then laugh out loud in the next one and so on. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were perfectly matched for this film. at the time the two were big sitcom stars on TV and have yet to have a break out hit on the big screen. This film was also Michael Bay's directorial debut. This film had a fairly small budget for an action film and what I've always appreciated about this film was how Bay was able to make a fun, entertaining, explosive action film while staying on budget. He even sacrificed part of his salary just so he can film extra action scenes. The point is Bay proved in his debut that he can work with a budget long before his high demands with Transformers. Now Michael Bay these days seems to be a popular magnet for hate and criticism. I feel as though he does NOT deserve the amount of hate he gets. Whenever I hear someone say "I hate Michael Bay" I always bring Bad Boys to their attention hoping to prove to the viewer that Bay is talented. Sure, obviously he isn't Spielberg good, but Bay is good enough that people should give him a chance. One things for sure is that even though film analyst, critics, and all sorts of film buffs love to hate Bay, the general audience seem appreciate his works since all of his films have been box office successes. Bay knows what audiences want and gives it to you. What's so bad about seeing a brainless action film every once in awhile?!?! Haters act as if Bay murdered a village filled with children when he does his films. When Bay presses all the right buttons in his directing machine he can make something truly entertaining. Overall this is without a doubt a film I can re watch at least 5 times a month. This and its sequel are not only on my top 10 all time favorite action films but also my top 10 films in general. Love or hate Bay, Bad Boys is his best work. 10/10-Gerry T</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad boys. Fun film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the nineties there was one name that was becoming synonymous with big, loud action movies. And that name was Michael Bay. How times change! However, don't be put off by seeing the man responsible for Megan Fox and Transformers' name in the credits. 'Bad Boys' is actually quite a fun film.It's nothing new, i.e. two bickering cops do their best to protect a material witness while fending off various attempts on everyone's lives courtesy of 'the mob.' But it's fun and its two stars (Martin Lawrence and Will Smith ? believe it or not, back then Martin Lawrence was the 'star' and Will Smith just the supporting cast member. Again, how times change!) play off each other nicely. They shoot, they playfully berate each other, while watching each other's backs at all times. There are car chases and shoot-outs, plus a load of wise-cracks to keep you entertained.I would almost say this is the perfect loud, dumb action movie. However, the only downside (in my opinion) is the film's length. It doesn't really need to be nearly two hours. The 'extra' plot lines revolve around the witness to the murder believing that Martin Lawrence's character is really Will Smith and vice versa. A lot goes into this plot line and I couldn't see the need for any of it (it almost degenerates into 'farce' at some stages). I'd rather the writers had played the film ? a little ? straighter and had more serious stuff with just the odd one-liner to keep things a little happy.But that's a minor gripe. The film is still fun and should be enjoyed with a big (bad) bag of popcorn.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys is probably one of my all time favorite gangster movies. Will Smith and Martin Lawerence were perfect together. They definitely made this movie worth watching. Officer Marcus Bennet (Martin Lawerence) and Detective Mike Lowry (Will Smith) are ordered to protect a murder witness, while investigating a case of stolen heroine. This movie is well acted, decent screenplay, and very funny. The humor was just as superb as the action. However there are a couple of things I disliked. I didn't think the shootouts and fight scenes were directed that well. Those parts aren't set up as well. Anyway I love this movie. I was cheering and laughing the whole time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't Expecting Much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some oddball reason, I have never gotten around to watching the Bad Boy movies until now. They didn't strike me as a film that I would like. I always liked Will Smith in any movie that he does. I liked some of Martin Lawrence's movies but not much. I saw this film on sale and I told myself to buy it and I'm happy I did.Smith and Lawrence play two foul-mouthed cops with a mission to recover stolen narcotics and to deal with one sexy witness.Speaking of sexy, that's the way to describe Tea Leoni in this film. She would keep any guy glued to the screen. Smith is good as usual. This has to be Lawrence's best film.This movie has a great mixture of comedy and action. There are plenty of great car chases and some the lines are hilarious and memorable. I hope Bad Boys 2 is even better. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

This film has a very good technically ,effects ,actions ,story ,actors... and not at all a very-very good director ,MICHAEL BAY. Look at the release date ,it's 1995 !!!....In 1995 ,bad boys movie wasn't just a film ,and wasn't just a good action movie. In 1995 that movie was the great breakthrough of todays action movies. The directors ,the actors are done a very good job ,I think Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the best pair to make this film successful. Everything in this movie is so GOOD.... And in the end look at the numbers ,They spent 19,000,000 $ to make this fantastic movie ,and in the of the premiers they gross more than 7x profit !!!....but the accurate number is 141,407,024 $ !!! And look at this movie is exciting ,it's funny ,and one of the most enjoyable movies...I hope you agree with my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun action comedy. But a little over done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad boys not doubt was full with loads of laughter and packed with action. The action never really stood out in a way, but it was some very decent shooting scenes. Definitely some scenes were well overdone. But more positives reflect from this movie then negative. It does more then enough to keep you very entertained and connected with what's going on and certainly keeps you laughing! What makes this movie so favoured is for two main reasons.1) The casting was superb and a sure excellent choice. Not one actor/actress was disappointing never the less the script was too superior to the acting, it was not brilliant but very decent and very funny. The now familiar but up coming star in those times, the legendary Will Smith. (mike Lawry) Was as you would expect powerful, funny and himself! Flawless job. Along side him another star. Martin Lawrence (Marcus Burnett) as you would expect too he was very funny and also a delight to watch. A great partnership to watch, them too together were truly historical they offer many many laughs.2) Is just simple. You just don't see many flicks like Bad Boys today. It's funny and action packed. It doesn't really get better then a action/comedy like this. The plot too was a tad original and it lead to a fun adventure.I wouldn't really say negative because this movie was superb. But one thing is for sure, some scenes were a little overdone. Perhaps it was the camera shots or the background music or even the look on the actors faces. The phenomenal director Michael Bay did a magnificent job. After making many minors he stepped up to make his first real movie, with a bigger budget and bigger cast for the big screen. He impressed the world and that is truly reflected on the movie. However some scenes were made too tense, the music in the background or the heat in the actors playing there roles needed to be cut down a little, the tension was to high but the situation is not that big. So yes. Michael Bay or even the movie editors could have cut down some unnecessary "hype" But nothing real major.All in all. a great flick and excellently executed by Michael Bay. Although a little over done Bad Boys will leave you laughing thanks too the good humour from Smith and Lawrence. Also leave you satisfied with its decent action. A sensational blockbuster to always be remembered.</fullReview>

There is plenty of shooting and blowing up, especially at the end of this film.Helgenberger plays it straight and then provides comedy relief.While the language in the film becomes salty at times, unfortunately, it is needed and you might even become calm with it eventually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is how you make the perfect action/ comedy film. Its got a superb cast. The chemistry between Smith, Lawrence and Leoni is great. The jokes never get old and the action being a Michael Bay film is superb. The plot is not a multi-layered one which critics seem to be demanding all the time theses days but its good and keeps the film on the move. Fans of Lethal weapon and Rush Hour will enjoy this a lot. I just hope they make a third Bad Boys as it has a lot of good potential. If you are a Michael Bay fan than you will know he likes to have a flashy, stylised look about his films (The Island, Bad Boys2) and like all his films, I recommend you see them in Blu-ray to get the most out of these gems.</fullReview>

Must say that Will Smith and Martin Lawrence look great on the screen,just complete each other.In a way they remind me of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover that's how good they are.Tea Leonie is a great auditioned as well and the evil guy...Oh my God-he is just great-his accent,his looks just everything.One of the bad guys who are so great that u actually start liking them(Jeremy Irons in Die hard?!?) In the end-the casting is absolutely amazing every single actor is on the spot.The dialog is one of the best,so many unforgettable lines.One of the best action-comedies of the 90's.Don't miss it and just have fun!</fullReview>

Will Smith's cop is quite the opposite. He is a single playboy with an inheritance. He doesn't need to work but wants too. THey are an unlikely duo. The cast also includes Joe Pantoliani as their angry boss, Marg Helgenberger as his boss, Tea Leoni as an unemployed photographer who gets caught up in the mess. THe film is your typical action adventure with comedy and drama mixed in with the elements of the film. Of course, we are introduced to the cops while they are not in uniform in Will Smith's expensive sports car being carjacked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lawrence and Smith are truly on form, in an action thriller- Bad Boys. Swearing and action violence that keeps the thrill's coming and the action rolling. Bad Boy's, which was made in 1995 has had an advantage over previous cop thriller's, firstly there's more hype and suspense than previous and secondly u could never get bored of Smith or Lawrence, especially in these genre's.As for Michael Bay, who has had a bumpy directorial path along the way, end's his shame and misery here, and still "has got it" in the sequel- Bad Boy's 2. So respect's to him, and the stunt coordinator's worthily deserve stupendous credit for part 2, whereas, shades of the action are lost in part 1. But don't worry from here on in, because u should get enough thrill's from this one, to then thank god for the second, which just get's better and better as the years stroll on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, two household names that are very successful Hollywood filmmakers often renowned for releasing that "same old clichéd garbage" and "those movies with the 'splosions," bring us Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, box office magnets themselves, in what can only be described as a vastly entertaining romp through Miami as two cops try to reclaim their career-long stash of stolen heroin. It also involves Tea Leoni in very attractive outfits.With films like these, it's a race to see the newest and most intriguing way of getting our heroes into those situations we know and love (and love to hate): car chases, gun-fights, explosive climaxes, and evil meanies with foreign accents and the inability to shoot anything that's not a vase, a column, a window, and maybe the occasional wall.However, to mix it up a bit, we get a nice little subplot about mistaken identity, as Martin Lawrence's character tries to mimic Will Smith's character, and vice-versa. Such provides just enough humor and acting to leave the whole thing worth it, and what do ya know but you can't help but feel for these bumbling heroes as they run along getting into mishap after mishap before saving the day by blowing up everything in site (which includes some of their friends which the film failed to acknowledge at the end, but whatever).So for the visual bonanza and exciting demise of warm, sunny Florida, look no further: these are the bad boys.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many people, I like Michael Bay and enjoy all of his films. Bad Boys is a good combination of comedy and action. The enjoyment of this movie is mostly due to the beautiful chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The two work so well together you get the feeling that they're real cops. Michael Bay handles his first film well with medium music video shots, and a lot explosions. For the dramatic scenes, he uses slow motion shots to help make the scene real. An interesting info is that pay gave 25,000 of his directors fee to make sure he has an explosion at the end of the movie in the drug hanger. Keep up the good work Michael, and I can't wait to see The Island.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bad Boys" - Same old stuff, but still "badder" than the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know who encouraged the creative teaming of comedian Martin Lawrence and rapper-turned-actor Will Smith in this big, loud, explosive action-comedy from 1995, but it's certainly an inspired team-up."Bad Boys" plays a lot like a collision between every buddy-cop movie we've ever seen, and since many of those ideas were exhausted in what seemed like eons ago, almost nothing here seems fresh. But what keeps the movie afloat is the dynamic interaction between stars Lawrence and Smith.This film, which in 1995 was the latest collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, the team that was responsible for heavy-hitting Hollywood action vehicles such as "Top Gun" and "Beverly Hills Cop," brought audiences another big blockbuster to rake in the cash."Bad Boys," directed by Michael Bay, starred Lawrence and Smith as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery, a pair of Miami narcotics cops whose careers had been made by a huge heroin bust from a few years earlier. As the film opens, a crack team of vicious thieves/drug dealers led by Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo) breaks into the Miami P.D. headquarters and steals their career-making bust.As a result of this f**k-up, Internal Affairs, specifically a bloodthirsty agent named Sinclair (Marg Helgenberger), comes down hard on the cops' Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), who's afraid that this theft will become a public relations nightmare. To further complicate matters, Julie Mott (Tea Leoni), a witness to the murder of a close friend of Lowery's that was committed by Fouchet and his thugs, is forced to go into protective custody and results in having the two detectives to have to switch identities until the stolen heroin can be recovered.Burnett and Lowery then go to work to track down the bad guys, the dope, and protect Julie - and they only 72 hours to do it in. And then get ready for the explosions and the action that "Bad Boys" has to serve up to you.The movie works largely as a result of the comradeship between Lawrence and Smith, who both according to the IMDb, ad-libbed a fair number of their scenes together because reportedly Michael Bay didn't like some of the dialogue in the screenplay. The acting from these two is brilliant, and so is the acting from many of the supporting players too.The action sequences, as you would expect from the former music video director Bay, who's also making his big screen directorial debut here, is of the flash-and-cut-type, giving way to many exciting scenes and slow motion shots of the actors in threatening poses.Given that this is Bay's feature directorial debut, it is certainly a fair way for him to enter into the world of action directing. Too bad some of his more recent work doesn't quite live up to the standards he may have defined himself with here. The film's sequel, released in 2003, which is bigger, badder, and louder, really upped the action and dynamism between the two returning leads."Bad Boys" is an excellent action movie that's certainly entertaining and fun to watch again and again.8/10</fullReview>

The Acting is VERY good Martin Lawrence is VERY funny here and does very well here his chemistry with Will Smith is so on and personally i like him as an actor it's just he has done a few basically average movies lately i hear Bad Boys 2 was very good so i am gonna go check that out. i liked him LOTS. Will Smith is just as good here and cracked me up lots of times i personally think he is one of the best out there today he did GREAT here. Tea Leoni is VERY sexy and beautiful and her acting is pretty good too. Overall well worth the watch highly recommended ***1/2 out of 5 with only a few flaws to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad BoysStarring: Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Tea Leoni and Joe PantolianoGenre: Action/Comedy/Crime/ThrillerRated: RBad Boys is one of the best action/comedies ever! Bad Boys is about these two hip detectives Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Bennett (Martin Lawrence). Marcus is a hen-pecked family man and Mike Lowery is a foot-loose fancy free ladies' man. These two are detectives for the Miami Police Department and they have 72 hours to find $100 Million worth of heroin before Internal Affairs shuts them down. Lowery becomes more involved after a friend is murdered by the drug dealers. Matters become complicated when Lowery and Brunette have to switch places to convince a witness (Tea Leoni) to the murder to cooperate. One of my favorite parts was when Marcus telling Mike how difficult this switching places thing was and then Marcus said "I wanna be like Mike. BOW!". This is one of my favorite action films done the man himself, Jerry Bruckheimer who also did "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Bad Company", "Gone In 60 Seconds", "The Rock" and the sequel to this film "Bad Boys 2"! This is one kick ass Action/Comedy flick!</fullReview>

Smith and Lawrence are really funny and cool together in this stupid but really entertaining and funny actioncomedy. The jokes were often very good and the actionscenes were awesome. With Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor) as director this is also a very good looking movie with a cool music score by Mark Mancina.

		<fullReview>This action comedy is the film that set both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence careers into Hollywood stardom. Also it was the movie that successfully made Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay very well known in the movie industry. Both all four of these guys would work again on a sequel to this movie, but I am not going to talk about that movie, I am on about this movie.Hip-hop rapper Will Smith is surprisingly convincing as action hero and Martin Lawrence is pretty much the same. These two make a very funny duo. But there is a flaw in this film of course which is that this film is as original as you would expect but then again most action film are never really original these days are they? The action sequences are well done and handled very well thanks to director Michael Bay. The storyline as I said is not that original but there are very funny moments and both Smith and Lawrence pull it off very well in my opinion. I wonder though would this film work if it didn't have elements of comedy. I don't thinks so as you would agree when you see this film it is very enjoyable to watch if you're just bored or want to watch a great action flick besides Matrix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action and comedy at their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys was the sleeper hit that when released in 1995 that made stars of all those involved and to this day is still loads of fun to watch. Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) were the best buddy pic buddies in an action film released in 95 and Micheal Bay showed what he could do. If you're looking for action and comedy at their best then look no further than Bad Boys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as funny as I hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into this movie thinking that it was going to be hilarious, it was funny, but not very. There were a few things that I'm still laughing about, (I just watched it yesterday). I am a HUGE comedy fan, if there's a big comedy, I WILL watch it, and despite the fact that this was not all that funny, I still liked it, and I will go see Bad Boys 2 at some point in time.This IS a movie worth watching, with enough laughs to not annoy you (there's nothing worse than a movie trying to funny and failing). It's definately worth the watch.The funny thing is that I think if the movie came out today, it would be rated AA (PG 13 for you Americans).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Lawrence and Will Smith star as two Miami cops who don't exactly play by the rules in this action-comedy. After one hundred million dollars worth of heroin is stolen directly from the precinct, Internal Affairs threatens to shut down the department from fear of an inside job. In order to catch the culprit?a deadly French reprobate?the two cops?one married with kids and the other a dedicated bachelor/second generation rich kid?must switch identities in order to acquire vital information from the sole witness on the case (Leoni). Action sequences are far from remarkable, and the formula has been seen time and time again, but stylish direction and two charismatic leads make it enjoyable to watch. Not truly memorable, but plenty of fun. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now a successful film actor, Will Smith teamed up with Martin Lawrence in this buddy movie which, although not very believable or entertaining, does bring together two film actors who are on their way up. Martin Lawrence who had a small part in Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing' brings his experience together with Smith who can now be regarded as a serious film actor. Apart from the fact that Smith acts with Lawrence in a film, there wasn't much substance to 'Bad Boys' that could lift it out of its own action packed genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BAD FILM !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is utter pants. I urge you not to watch it, unless you liked Face-Off, Con-Air, Independence Day or films of that sorry nature.The plot is, hold on a minute, there doesn't appear to be one. The idea behind the film appears to be a lame excuse for a series of poor action sequences where you feel no real emotion for those involved. I honestly wanted to see Martin Lawrence's character killed (maybe I'm not alone).I don't understand the high rating many people have given this film; what do they enjoy about it? Maybe they think it's a spoof.Anyway enough of my moaning, if you ever want to see a good 90's action movie, I'd opt for Point Break every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys is the type of action flick I'm becoming accustomed to seeing Hollywood pump out. Put a glossy shine of new paint on the same old ideas but without any heart. Throw money at the screen. Put the emphasis on explosions and gunshots. Disregard characters and story. It's very much a hit or miss affair.This flick has a lot of fans, but I can't get behind it because it simply doesn't work very well. It pours a lot of talent into trying to be as hip and loud as possible, but boil it down. Remove the two high profile lead actors. Take away the infamous licensed song from Inner Circle the movie owes it's identity (and title) to and in no way is Bad Boys memorable. There wasn't a joke, set piece, or crazy stunt that forever immortalized it in pop culture or to set it apart from the long list of action flicks I've saw.The best thing that can be said about Bad Boys is Will Smith. He has a certain level of charm and easy-going coolness about him, he's easy to like and he's not a bad actor either. However that doesn't shade the fact that the movie's villain is in no way memorable, the story is predictable and borderline stupid without the much needed fun factor to counterbalance it, and Martin Lawrence is often annoying.I think when people look back and try to remember why they liked this entry into the buddy cop genre, they're going to have a hard time. It doesn't ask much of you, but the style the movie wants you to buy into never once feels real. It's manufactured and soulless. I'm sure the bantering between Smith and Lawrence took a lot of work to get right too, but it feels forced. The kind of crazy cool tough guy dialog you expect guys in slick, over the top action vehicles to say. Not an original bone in it's body, Bad Boys has entertained many of people, but it didn't do much for me.</fullReview>

It was obvious that Martin Lawrence overacted and tried too hard to be funny, which didn't work well and the female character whined too much that she was totally dislikable. Will Smith gave the best performance as a cool, smooth cop. It was his best performance so far.

		<shortDescription>Sorry Boys, Way Too Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to rate somewhere among the 25 worst high-production-value movies of all time. The plot and story line are so weak and poorly developed that a lot of the action doesn't make sense, nor does the dialog and reactions among the actors during the scenes. A lot of the problems they encountered throughout the movie could have been resolved by applying high-school-level common sense. But then the movie would only run for a half-hour or less.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are supposedly a detective team along the lines of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the "Lethal Weapon" series, or the spy team of Bill Cosby and Robert Culp in the 1960s "I Spy" series.The difference is there is no chemistry between Smith and Lawrence, unless you consider a cocktail of hydrochloric and sulfuric acid "chemistry." Their non-stop verbal abuse of each other without comic relief quickly stopped being entertaining and migrated to the tedious and boring. I found myself surfing other channels, but came back because other interesting shows were either in Spanish or German with Spanish sub-titles.Sure, watch the movie for the first time if it's on TV and there's nothing better. It will help if you're of age and have a pitcher of Margueritas or a bottle of wine handy. If not, consider having a root canal that day and be on Codine -- the movie will replace your focus on the pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>average crime comedy with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently the crime genre has gone through some dramatic changes. Take Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. It was sharp, controversial and dealt with crime issues in such a succinct way it was a marvel, shocking and powerful to watch. And sadly that has been replaced by either pointless comedy and dialogue or ridiculous action sequences.Comedians Will Smith (Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Hitch) and Martin Lawrence (Blue Streak, Martin) try as they may, are unable to capture such brilliance as Scoursese and Robert De Niro did in the crime genre and deliver average performances and jokes in this average crime comedy by Michael Bay. Detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry discover there has been a drug bust and there only chance of recovering the heroin, is if witness Tea Leoni is willing to cooperate. Whereas the two leads strike up an interesting partnership, it soon wears down and becomes tiresome as the slow moving plot drags along with the detectives trying to find out the mystery to their case. The on screen relationship between Lawrence and Leoni is interesting but far from jaw dropping. There are occasional funny moments but the whole name swapping business is ridiculous and childish.This was Smith's first noticeable film appearance and put him on the map as an established star. He has developed more since this film but this was a good blockbuster for him to get started and he does fairly well as Mike Lowry.Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) plays a good angry Captain Howard but he's hardly in the 2 hour film to establish his character fully. In many ways it's a very obvious plot but the action sequences towards the end are very impressive and are worth watching. The sequel was average and this probably just has the edge with the action sequences.If you're a fan of Will Smith its worth watching but otherwise it isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The directorial debut from Michael Bay (The Rock, Armageddon, Transformers) is a fantastic action comedy thriller. Basically Det. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is the married family man, and Det. Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is the single loose cannon. They are partners in the Miami Police Department about to take on a highly dangerous case involving $100m of heroin, the biggest drug bust up, stolen from police headquarters. Marcus and Mike have 72 hours to reclaim the heroin before the Internal Affairs Division gets involved, and to keep an eye on the high rollers, including drug kingpin Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo), Mike asks hooker Maxine, and she gets her (not hooker) friend Julie Mott (Deep Impact's Téa Leoni) to tag along. At the house of former cop Eddie Dominguez, Fouchet kills Maxine, and Julie witnessed the murder and managed to escape to contact the police. But she will only talk to Mike, and not knowing what he looks like she phones, and when Mike is not in the right place, Marcus had to answer the phone pretending to be Mike before she hung up and for the information. As the case continues, Mike and Marcus have to keep up the pretence of being each other, which is causing problems for his Marcus's wife Theresa (Theresa Randle), and Mike with concern of his apartment. There are a couple of gun shooting before she eventually finds out their pretending, and then Julie is kidnapped right under their noses and they have a final gun fight. Also starring Memento's Joe Pantoliano as Captain C. Howard, Marg Helgenberger as Capt. Alison Sinclair, Nestor Serrano as Detective Sanchez, Julio Oscar Mechoso as Detective Ruiz and Saverio Guerra as Chet, the Doorman. The action sequences (many things blowing up) are fantastic, Smith and Lawrence are equally as funny and profane (swear a lot) as each other, this film film has equal numbers of hilarious jokes, heart-beating action and gripping thrills to keep you engaged. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a fortune of drugs is stolen from the police department Detectives Burnett and Lowrey are charged to get it back. They trace one of the packets of drugs to one of Fouchet's men who is having a party with two girls. Fouchet finds the man first and kills him and the girl, although the other, Julie gets away and flees to Lowrey for help. However Marcus must pretend to be Mike to win her trust and they must not only swap lives but also protect the witness.Action movies and buddy cop movies are never going to be confused with Shakespeare. So it's no surprise that this is noisy, senseless and full of guns and explosions. However it still manages to be fun. It has all the cliches of the shouting boss, the fast cars, the European bad guys, bickering partners etc but it's still fun! Not because it's well made but simply because it has style and energy which goes a long way. Bay manages to direct in his usual MTV style ? all slow motion and pumping music but he is still good at this type of glossy action.Smith and Lawrence also go a long way to make it enjoyable. Both are fun in top speed trash talking mood and they both look cool running after speeding cars etc. Leoni is a little irritating and I much preferred her friend who got killed in terms of looks and personality ? nut I guess they didn't want too many black faces in a mainstream movie. Randle is good and Pantoliano is a good boss ? who is also the subject of `white' jokes which makes a nice change I guess. Karvo is a so-so baddie but really is a poor man's Alan Rickman. But any film that manages to have cameos from Imperioli and Kim Coates (!) is well worth the cast.Overall this is hardly innovative but is good fun. Plain and simple ? big dumb fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Momentarily entertaining trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the shoddiest (and most derivative) script ever to hit mainstream cinema, Bad Boys just about warrants a watch. Everything about it screams "product", and the entire film rests on Will Smith's undoubtable charisma, but there are enjoyable elements. The action scenes are suitably ludicrous and reasonably well handled. Some of the jokes (though far, far too few) manage to stick. And the score is absolutely terrific. But you cannot help but feel that it has been wasted here.On the downside, Martin Lawrence proves yet again that he is to comedy what Michael Bay is to subtlety. Tea Leoni is irritating as hell (she can't act - what WHAT legs she has!), Teresa Randal is wasted, and Tcheky Karyo continues to urinate on his reputation with an utterly flat euro trash villain. Forgettable, empty, flashy. Perhaps the quintissential Bruckheimer movie, but probably also the least entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was the stand in for Vic Manni (Ferguson). Bad Boys was an awesome film to work on because I really got to see the pros at work. Man when I think how huge Michael Bay is now and that was his first feature. I remember when I said bye to him at the wrap party I said "Good luck" and he said, "Thanks, Ill need it." I also got to do some precision driving. I drove one of the black Suburbans in the final chase scene. Ken Bates, the legendary Hollywood stuntman directed it. What a guy. he was awesome, totally friendly and full of great stories about the stunt business. I think he won an Oscar for the rocket sled he designed for the tunnels. Barry Waldman the producer of Domino was the second unit producer. Another real nice dude with a good sense of humor. I even attended the premiere and after party in L.A. Will Smith was real nice too. After all I'm a homeboy from Philly. I never really spoke with Bruckheimer or Simpson, but i could tell they were total pros. After all they'd already done Bev Hills Cop and Top Gun. One of the coolest locations was the legendary Biltmore Hotel former home of Al Capone. That place is incredible. It was so cool watching the stunt guys scurrying on top of those high Spanish tile roofs shooting machine guns. One of the actors i got friendly with was Tchecky Karyo the French actor. He starred in La Femme Nikita, one of my all time fa-vs. Hes not a bad guitarist either. Always strummed an acoustic on set. Id like to thank Dana McFadden of Ellen Jacoby Casting for giving me the chance to work on this great film.</fullReview>

The ordinary: a terrific looking girl (with attractive muscular legs) in distress that causes mischief; a ruthless foreign supercrook; an unexpected traitor in the police force; lots of gunbattles, car chases and fuel explosions. A harried police supervisor and the ironpantied hostile administrator.What's new is that after years and years of white/black cop buddy movies, this is the first successful black/black buddy movie to my knowledge. It works, I think, because these guys play human comedy rather than the demeaning pink-gummed stepenfetchit stuff of say Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Bill Cosby would be proud. One focus for the comedy comes from that proven device of switching identities and its pretty effective stuff.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this had a great beginning. The opening credits scene was as good as the best of the James Bond flicks. Those overhead shots of Miami at night were awesome, too. Unfortunately, a few minutes after that great opening, the movie starts to go downhill and then accelerates most of the rest of the way.The two leads, played by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, spend most of the film yelling at each other. That's entertaining? No. The action scenes are very good, but these stupid characters are just annoying and wear thin very fastIn this end, all this is, is another overly loud, stupid buddy movie with ridiculous profanity, and a very predictable script which includes an easy-to-guess ending. I am a guy, and I love crime movies and a good action flick....but this is just mindless machismo, led by one of the worst examples of that in the history of Hollywood: Mr. Smith.Why does Smith always have to prove to every audience that he is the coolest, hippest, meanest, nastiest dude on the planet? Is he that insecure? The same, to a lesser extent, goes to Lawrence and to producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay, who never any object that wasn't worth blowing up on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of a new action movie era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay is a much hated director but I don't think that this is right or really justified. Fact simply is that he has changed and upgraded the action genre over the past years. He gave action movies more style and certainly also made them more fun and entertaining to watch. It was never really a genre that was ever being taken serious as a genre that delivered real quality or any new stars. Now days the action genre is definitely taken more serious when comparing it to 15 years ago. If it weren't for him, we would probably now still be stuck with overblown and stupendous Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris type of action movies. The fact that studio's dare to spend lots of money on action movies now days shows how well the genre is doing, by both a wider and new range of public but also certainly the critics. As long as he doesn't attempt to make any "Pearl Harbor" type of movies again, I'm happy to continue watching his movies and will always be eagerly awaiting his next project."Bad Boys" is Michael Bay's first movie and its also one of his best. It's fast, stylish, action filled, great characters but above all it's fun!Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are a golden duo. It's no coincidence that the best moments of the movie features the both of them in those sequences. The two of them are the main reason why the movie is so much fun to watch. The dialog and chemistry between the two are great! This movie also marked the big breakthrough of both actors. Lawrence decided to keep continuing on the comedy-genre road, while Smith by now is fully taken serious as an Hollywood actor, that still is also a much demanded and popular one, who is also perfectly capable of playing serious roles and already is a two time Oscar-nominee.The two of them will make you almost forget that the movie also has a truly splendid supporting cast, such as Téa Leoni and the always great Joe Pantoliano in a typical Joe Pantoliano-role. The movie its main villains is being played by Tchéky Karyo. I really like this guy and he serious needs to make some more Hollywood-type movies! His character is this movie is perhaps a bit underused and not featured enough but still Karyo adds a lot with his acting to the movie.The movie is made with lots of style, that gives the movie a real fast and pleasant pace and also uplifts most of the action sequences. You know, this movie really didn't had the highest of budgets but they managed to do an extremely good job with the resources they had. Even though the movie isn't, it still looks and feels like an $100,000,000 production. There is never a slow or dull moment in the movie and it features lots of action, such as gun fights, big explosions and car chases. You know it's one of those movies in which the story really isn't that important. They basically could had given these guys anything to do and the movie still would had remained just as much fun to watch. It's a movie that even makes you forget that there is a story! You just sit back and let this movie entertain you. It's a movie that never looses any of its power, not even now almost, 15 years later. I loved this movie in 1995 and I'm still loving it now.The fact that this movie is great looking is also thanks to the editing by genre specialist Christian Wagner, the musical score by Mark Mancina, who was really great and hot in the '90's and the touch of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who definitely helped to evolve the action genre.Highly fun and entertaining! Definitely a recommendable movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Martin Lawrence and Will Smith play two buddy cops who couldn't be more different.Marcus Burnett(Lawrence)is a strait laced,more conservative family man who likes to do things by the book.his partner Mike Lowery(Smith)likes to fly by the seat of his pants,and bend the rules as afar as he can without breaking them.both work for the Miami Police dept.following the largest drug bust of both their careers,the drugs(over $100milion worth of heroin)are stolen and they have only a few days to recover it before the dept discovers it missing.during the course of events they enlist the help of a woman who witnessed a murder related to the case.complications quickly ensue.they soon discover that their is an international connection to the case.now they must avoid getting killed,protect the witness,get the bad guys and return the heroin.it all adds up to an action packed,thrilling,and sometimes funny 2hour ride.Smith and Lawrence have great chemistry,and the banter between the two pals is sure to elicit chuckles.for me,"Bad Boys" is a 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is just "Bad"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After catching glimpses of "Bad Boys" for several times on TV I finally decided to watch the whole thing intact. But after doing that I found myself puzzled. For what reason is "Bad Boys" so highly regarded as a great action movie? In my desperate attempts at trying to grasp any form of entertainment from this feature I finally came to the realization that it's impossible for me to like it. Much to some people's surprise I found the film's "style" to be a shallow, incompetent imitation of John Woo's ultra kinetic Hong Kong films. Everything that "Bad Boys" does has been already made, only much much better.So what is "Bad Boys" all about ? Well, uh, it's about Will Smith running around in slow-motion while talking a lot, and yeah there's this other guy Martin Lawrence who also talks a lot. They're cops, they are the Bad Boys who talk their mouths off, run their legs off, shoot their guns off. Naturally Michael Bay does all that in slow-motion, because that's what action movies are all about you know, slow motion. Oh and did I forget to mention that there is a generic bad guy, not bad as the two titular anti-heroes mind you. This character, he's your basic action movie villain who is obviously evil for the sake of being evil. And of course is the person who our two brave "Bad Boys" must defeat in an epic slow-motion battle to the death filled with over-the-top explosions, one-liners and car chases all directly taken from the "generic action movie clichés" handbook."Bad Boys"'s overly simple plot exists for the sole purpose of providing us with enough reasons to watch the series of action sequences the movie's made of. That wouldn't have hurt all too much had these scenes been directed capably, yet Bay demonstrates an inept ability to create an entertaining action piece. All such sequences are bleak and devoid of originality, stuffed with slow-motion, randomly used, making less sense as to why it was added. The usual reason would be to enhance certain dramatic moments in a movie, or for stylistic approach during complex action scenes. Seeing as the first one is impossible to integrate here and the second is just not directed with any understanding of detail what we are left is an approximately 40 minutes of slow-motion that does it's job in extending "Bad Boys" into a near two hours length. Making this already boring film into an test of will. More than once I was tempted to turn off my TV and stop wasting time with the predictability on screen, fighting of the urge to laugh it all off in denial.I'm not actually sure there's anything more to say about "Bad Boys". It's such a sub-par movie that it's action becomes forgettable soon after viewing, leaving only the flaws to remind me why I should never watch anything stamped with the sign "Hollywood Action Movie". Then again it's not such a big surprise why so many people liked it. It's crude visuals could prove to be impressive enough for people not as familiar with the genre as the more hardcore fans. Then again I don't count myself amongst genre fans so it's anybody's guess why it appeals so much to audiences</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that shows what Michael Bay was destined to be: a great action director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you mix stolen drugs, too wise-cracking savvy cops and high octane action together? You get "Bad Boys," the 1995 sleeper hit directed by a then unknown commercial director Michael Bay and staring two television stars named Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. "Bad Boys" is perhaps the epitome of the 90's with all it's stylishness and flashy colors that is guaranteed a rare treat for action fans.In every scene, it is evident that Martin Lawrence and Will Smith has chemistry and it is not hard to believe that some of their lines were improvised through the filming of this production.However most praises definitely go to the then, unknown Michael Bay who got his start in directing commercials and music videos. Every explosion and camera angle was a grave representation of what would become Michael Bay's trademark in his later films: directing visually stunning movies that make even the little guys look heroic and intimidating figures of royalty.If you haven't seen "Bad Boys" by now, you'll be doing a grave injustice to the world by not seeing it. If it hasn't already become a cult classic it will surely be one in the near future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With his 1995 directorial debut "Bad Boys", Michael Bay established himself as the premier action film director. Using a budget under 25 million dollars, and two stars in the making; Bay crafted an action film that delivers. The talented Will Smith and Martin Lawrence lend enduring charisma that helped revive a dying genre as well as create a comedy that can be appreciated across races.On a technical level, "Bad Boys" delivers amazing bang for the buck. Highly stylized gun fights combine flawlessly with chase sequences. The score by Mark Mancina is slick and draws the viewer into the world of our heroes. Filmed with vibrant reds and oranges, "Bad Boys" has a warm look that accentuates the heat of Miami. Quick editing serves to keep the laughs and action flowing, while still being simple enough to establish the surroundings.Comedy is difficult, but I dare say that "Bad Boys" is one of the funniest films I have viewed personally. The comedic skills of Lawrence and Smith shine brightly and are aided by Leoni in a refreshingly delightful performance. Lawrence and Smith are articulate while hip, breaking a color barrier between the humor of whites and blacks. More amazing is the meshing of action and comedy, as both are served as high points. Here is a world that is believable, action packed, funny, stylistic, and most importantly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, with the upcoming Bad Boys 2 I felt I had to watch the original first, so I could comment on whether No 2 was better or worse than the original. But the really freaky thing was, as I watched Bad Boys, I became more and more convinced that I had seen it before. Yet I couldn't remember a damn thing about it. It was only right at the end, with the airfield climax, that I was certain I had seen it already.And that really sums up Bad Boys.... a movie that you will watch, then instantly forget....or blot from your memory vigorously.Its just plain formulaic cop-buddy movie-no brainer action movie stuff. You know whats going to happen within minutes of the films opening scenes.In fact, what this movie put me in mind of was a Starsky and Hutch episode. Think about it...You have the yelling police chief in the form of Joe Pantoliano. He's no Capt. Dobie, but he gives it a shot.You have the two buddy cops who love each other dearly, but are always bickering.You have the constant arguments about who drives the best, the "don't mess up my car" dialogues etc.The only thing missing is Huggy Bear.In short, this movie is dull and predictable. The action scenes are looking very dated now and fail to impress.About the best thing I can say about this film is that it isn't I Spy, which was even duller.I'm hoping BB2 will be better, but I'm not holding my breath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all time worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never, ever walked out of a movie. Never. No matter how awful it was, I stuck through it to the end.Had I not been with someone while sitting in the theater watching this worthless piece of celluloid garbage, this would have been the first time.BAD BOYS is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's like watching a feature length beer commercial. Loud, pointless, and pathetically predictable.**SPOILER**Within the first five minutes, I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end. I was right. I predicted the bad guy would not really be dead, and would come back for a final attempt to kill the heroes. I predicted that the heroes would be saved by the tough chick who they rescued. I predicted the three would then walk off together as equals.This movie appears to have been created from a ACTION MOVIES FOR DUMMIES manual. It is brainless, witless and lifeless. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are both funny, likeable actors, but they are no match for a leaden script and direction that's more geared toward them looking good than acting well.Hey, if you're thing is explosions, car chases and obnoxious machismo with zero plot or intelligence, then this is the movie for you. Perhaps one day, the team of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay will produce something of quality. That day has yet to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome thrill ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS)This is absolutely without question, one of the best action movies I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. They pulled it off perfectly. The film is about two cops who switch lives while trying to recover stolen dope. Tea Leoni plays Julie Mott, the witness. Will Smith plays Mike Lowrey and Martin Lawrence plays Marcus Burnett. Will is the more serious one and Martin provides the humour which is an important element in an action flick, there must be a laugh or two. I could go on and on about everything I liked about this film. I liked the scene where they were in the shop and Will and Martin broke out into this huge argument after the shop clerk pulled a gun on them. I also liked the scene where Julie tells Marcus that she thought he was gay. That was so funny. I read on the IMDb under Trivia for Bad Boys that that whole scene was improvised, director Michael Bay told Martin Lawrence that he could improvise. Good job. I like how the movie ended and I cannot wait to see Bad Boys 2. I give this 10/10, awesome action/comedy!!</fullReview>

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are brilliant as the roles of Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett. Bad Boys is not awesome just because it has great action scenes, it also contains a great dialogue, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are hilarious. Another aspect that makes Bad Boys such a great movie is the sound track created by Mark Mancina. The music is the soul of this film, it makes the chase scene and the car scene that much better. This is the type of movie all guys love to see. Michael Bay is a genius, this is without a doubt one of his best films. Any way you look at it, this movie is one of the greats of the 90s. All I can say is I am counting the days down until July 18 2003 when Bad Boys II hits the theaters.-R.F. 2003</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys has everything in a buddy-cop movie - the duelling comedy between the two main characters, the angry as hell boss, the pretty lady, the crazy foreign bad guy, blah blah blah, but this film just makes it all work together perfectly. Smith and Lawrence are one of the best and funniest double acts I have ever seen on screen, and that alone is reason enough to give this a watch. Joe Pantoliano is often hilarious as their boss too.Although more of an action comedy than a serious crime thriller, Michael Bay keeps it serious enough throughout so that the viewer, whilst laughing his ass off, will still pay close attention to what is going on, and actually care what happens, something most action comedies fail to pull off.Bad Boys can also proudly boast of having on of the best finales ever in a movie of its kind, with an explosive shootout in an aircraft hanger. Its easy to see where the budget went here, and it is used to great effect.With never a dull moment and plenty of top notch humour and violence, i give Bad Boys a very solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>´Bad Boys´ is my number 136 movie. ( outta 750 about )I do like it, because it is a good action movie, and it is just fun. I also liked ´Armageddon´ and especially ´The Rock´, which were also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay. The story : Markus Burnett ( Martin Lawrence ) and Mike Lowrey ( Will Smith ) are two cops. One day Mike´s wife is killed by a drug dealer. She ´visited´ him with her friend Julie ( Tea Leoni ). So she is the witness and she has to be taken into custody. She just wants to talk to Mike Lowrey, but since he is outta house, Marcus Burnett has to pretend to be Mike Lowrey. Marcus Burnett has a wife, so he brings her to the house of Mike Lowrey, without letting him know that ( at first ). Then he tells him this stuff, and since Tea Leoni thinks that Marcus is Mike, Marcus has to stay in Mike´s house, while Mike spends the nights in Marcus´ house. Julie says Marcus who the killer is, so Marcus and Mike just have to find and kill him. But that is not that simple, and Julie has been abducted by the drug dealers. During a ?drug party" Marcus and Mike free Julie and kill the murderer.I think this one is the worst of the three action movies mentioned above, but still good. It is worse than Armageddon and way worse than ´The Rock´, which I consider to be the best action movie after ´Jurassic Park´. But I do not recommend it to guys who do not like provoking action movies, because this one provokes a lot of reactions. All in all, I rated ´Bad Boys´ 8/10, because it is a good and fun action movie. But there are definitely better action films. If you have any quetions, feel free to ask them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an above average film with some good action and very bad comedy. Bad Boys(1995) has been made with many parts from many different buddy and action comedy flicks. Its a combination of Beverly Hills Cop(1984), 48 Hours(1982), and Lethal Weapon(1987). The movie even rips off the mens room scene in True Lies(1994). The acting was decent in sports but was nothing special overall. The direction are by the numbers and the visuals are generic. Bad Boys(1995) tries to deplicate many Hong Kong action scenes without borrowing the best parts of those type of movies. This is a great popcorn movie that's great for curing idleness and not good in compelling film watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain good stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be honest. The first time I saw this movie, it was in a cheap theater, I was not impressed by Will Smith's first excursion into the action foray. My friend went to see it with me because of Martin Lawrence's "You So Crazy" and was anxious to see it. He liked it more than I did. I gave it a second chance on VHS when it was released. I liked it more. The humor was better and I appreciated the talky tone of the film. It was different from other action films in this respect.The basic outline is one of a typical action flick. Bad guys perpetrate a big crime and its up to a buddy team of cops and a beautiful witness to foil the crime in only a few days. Several things elevate this film to one of the better in the genre. One is the direction of Michael Bay. A veteran of music videos, he is no stranger to the quick-cut, breakneck pace that a hip, modern action movie might require. Another is the chemistry of the two leads. Smith and Lawrence work together, and play well off of each other. The screenplay by George Gallo, who brought another action film "Midnight Run" to new heights, and Michael Barrie is talkier than usual for an action film. It provides the usual cheesy punchlines here and there, but isn't afraid to stray from the plot a little here and there. Many critics of well-oiled action flicks see this as a crutch. I see it as an oppurtunity to get human qualities from the characters to add what realism possible to the script.These aspects of the film earn it an 8 out of 10 from me. Fans of action comedy will be pleased with the results. As my friend, an avid action-comedy fan, says: "It has everything you could want in a movie: action, guns, explosions, humor, and beautiful women." As far as the genre goes, I would have to agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film, a bit like Desperado: our heroes are perfect shooters, almost no-one can shoot them. Téa Leoni looks great, almost as good as the Konig tuned Porsche and the Cobra. The car chase at the end is an excellent work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Jerry Bruckheimer's better films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys is another one of the typical highly glossed action films from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay, but it works much better than many of the other mediocre films produced by Bruckheimer (such as Armageddon, Gone In 60 Seconds, Coyote Ugly).Martin Lawrence and Will Smith work very well as this movie's odd couple, in a police partnership that goes further than police partnerships might be expected to. Not only are they partners, they are also best friends, despite tremendous differences in personality (which was the same for Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh).While the movie may get a little excessive at some points, the entertainment value is high, due mostly to the quality performances delivered by Smith and Lawrence, as well as Tea Leoni. It seems that a huge amount of narcotics, Smith's and Lawrence's career bust, has been stolen, and they are assigned to investigate the disappearance. What follows is a very well thought out and interesting crime film that rivals many of the better James Bond films, even if it borrowed heavily from the traditional Bond formula.Bad Boys is clearly exaggerated in many ways, it is unmistakably a Hollywood film, but it does not fail to entertain beyond the mindless cinema that is common from Bruckheimer as well as Martin Lawrence (remember that idiot film, Big Momma's House?). This is not necessarily destined to be a classic action film (that distinction is reserved for nearly flawless films like The Fugitive), but Bad Boys is definitely worth the time to watch. Action fans are guaranteed to love it, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Best Black Action Film I've Seen Without Denzel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some very skilled gang members break into the police station and steal millions of dollars worth of drugs. A young woman, Julie Mott (played by Tea Leoni) is witness to a murder. She seeks the protection of Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), whom she's never met, and ends up living with his partner, Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) who pretends to be Mike. All this while there's still a crime to be solved...I liked this movie. I didn't think I would. It was very black (by which I mean the actors talked as stereotypical black men would and lived like stereotypical black men would, which I can't identify with). It was directed by Michael Bay (who, I have to concede, knows how to make a good car chase). And it starred Martin Lawrence, who is generally not funny (although I liked "Black Knight") and something of a poor man's Eddie Murphy (which isn't really a compliment).But for kicking back with my dad and a half dozen cans of Old Milwaukee, this was alright. Plenty of guns and bombs and stuff I normally don't go for, but seem so much better when you're hanging out with your father half in the bag. And it had Tea Leoni, who has a very strange quality about her. She's got almost an exotic look which makes her attractive, though not in any conventional way. Since her role was basically just to be "the chick", she did more than alright (she had a fair share of action scenes).I watched this a while back, and don't really remember it well enough to analyze particular parts. The "pretending to be your friend" plot line is nothing new, and there's certainly nothing new about cops shooting and blowing things up ("Die Hard", "Lethal Weapon" both do it better). But if this is what you want fro ma movie, and want to hear "The m-f word" a few dozen times, this is a movie you'll get into. Oh, and they drive really nice cars. Michael Bay loves nice cars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most superb action type high-pulsed plot line I've ever witnessed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After perceiving a film, have you ever undergone a sort of ineffable conversion ? A type of conversion, where you may fathom that you were just witnessed to one of the most immaculate action packed, adrenaline sense, and light melodramatic films of all time? I incidentally experienced a feeling such as this in the aftermath of seeing this spectacular film. The plot is short and precise, the dialogue crisp and coherent, the acting surprisingly non-superficial and droll and all aspects which constitute to making a film everlastingly stick in your head, is what Bad Boys 1995 is made of. Words cannot begin to describe the sensation that was prevalent to me whilst watching the nonstop action of two vivacious black cops (Martin Lawrence and Will Smith) as they avidly followed in the consummate steps of a scrupulous villain.The saga begins with a brief introduction of the habitual hectic lives of the two protagonists. At first it appears all "cheerio" and glamorous but after an overtly callous verbal accost over the telephone the two cops have to get down to business! They speed to their precinct and are privy to the fact that several tones of heroine have been recently purloined by a perspicacious antagonist and his subservient crew. In the midst of their incessant search for the villain (Tchéky Karyo), the life of the most gorgeous ( I've ever seen in my opinion) brunette white woman (Tea Leoni) falls into jeopardy when her best friend is unexpectedly murdered for not divulging critical information. From here on out, the hilarious and unified black cops do everything in their power to pursue justice.On top of a brilliant plot outline, the theme of the soundtrack supplements the tensions in the film in ways that I can't even begin to describe. I mean how brilliant does the sonorous line "Bad Boys, Bad boys, Whatcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do when they come for you!" sound when it is placed in a film that is just that! I will candidly acknowledge that this is the greatest film I have ever seen in my entire life (and not only action film, the greatest FILM) and I would highly suggest that you do as well(although such an opinion might be chastised for its naivety due to the fact that I haven't seen many films, at least in comparison to the potato couch nonstop television viewers nowadays..).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best action films ever made! Great fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a number of other reviews on this site and I have to say that I'm shocked that some people feel so strongly in the opposition of this film. This film is, without a doubt, one of my favorite action/comedies!!!The action is non-stop and VERY well done, quite intense. The story is excellent. The cast is nearly perfect, with a number of superb characters. The cinematography is fantastic, as is the overall direction of the film. Michael Bay is a truly fantastic director. Yeah, he's a bit "flashy", but doesn't over-do it (too much) and he has just enough of the flash in his films. Personally, I love his style.As I mentioned above, the cast is excellent. At first I wasn't sure if I could accept Will Smith in this role, since I'd only seen him in "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air", but he really nailed the role and did an excellent job. Martin Lawrence is usually not an actor I enjoy watching on the screen, but he was able to pull it off. Sometimes his comedy is very funny, but at other times, I can't help but cringe. Joe Pantoliano is a personal favorite of mine, his character in this film is nothing less than perfect. I enjoyed every scene with him in it. Tea Leoni was a perfect choice for her role, she looks great and pulls of the character quite nicely. Tcheky Karyo shows his true acting talent in this film, excellent antagonist. Marg Helgenberger was a nice touch in the film, although her role is somewhat small, yet important to the story. Theresa Randle was another nice touch, very well done. The entire cast is superb in the film.The humor in this film is very well placed, very good and extremely abundant. I can't remember a time that I've laughed more during an action-comedy film. Will Smith's comedy is superb as is Martin Lawrence, for the most part. The chemistry between Will and Martin is very good, you can tell that they had a lot of fun with their characters.If you are into action films, then you should definitely check this out. Be warned though, this film is rated R for its violence and language, and there are plenty of both. I cannot wait for the upcoming sequel, also directed by Michael Bay, it's going to awesome! I truly hope that you'll see the film and I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here you see a soon-to-be giant at work + someone who already is a star!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys is really good, I mean almost everything Bruckheimer did in the 90's was, but this has the best of all. Ok you got Cage in Con Air, but with this one two great stars are born. First of all Will Smith, all of his following movies were pretty good and successful (except Wild Wild West) and of course one of the best new Directors of the 90's, Michael Bay. He is terrific, the way he works with the camera man, slow motion, turns, colours, really GREAT. You see the music ? video influence. Michael Bay is going to be one of the greatest soon (among Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas), with his status proven with The Rock (his best one yet (GREAT FLICK!!)) and Armageddon (pretty good, but better at the box - office) and now he's making Pearl Harbour well this is a success story that will carry on for a long time.Well back to the film, everybody is great here, but I must say I especially like Tea Leoni and Theresa Randle and I regret that I haven't seen those pretty and talented young ladies in other big and good movies except Randle in Space Jam three years ago and Leoni in Deep Impact (which was big but not that good) two years ago. Well the last thing I want to say goes out to Bruckheimer, please make a sequel with as much of the original cast and crew as possible, it is bound to be great. Do it, there have been sequels of worse films made a success. And by the way, you have a little few action movies on your list right now (those are the flicks that made you great REMEMBER THAT!!), so I suggest you make Bad Boys 2 to cash a few bucks more that you will with Remember the Titans, Coyote Ugly and Gone in 60 Seconds. OK Pearl Harbour will be big business, but that's not an action movie like Con Air, Face/Off, Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon or Die Hard, so do BB 2. Also make another action flick with Bruce Willis!!!!!!!! Please!!!!!!!!!??????????8 out of 10</fullReview>

If you want to catch Lawrence at his best I suggest everyone see "Nothing Lose"(loved this film!). Anyway I think this was a brilliant film. Smith and Lawrence made a great team. This is definitely Bruckheimer's best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best action/comedies around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about black humour that I love. And I don't mean humour that is gross or dark, I really mean humour by black actors/artists. Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor were funny in their day. Whoopie Goldberg has me in stitches when she is on stage or in a movie. Chris Rock is an up and coming comic genius. And the two guys in this film have me in laughing almost every time I see them on screen. Martin Lawrence was the best part of Boomerang and in Bad Boys he is hilarious as the married side kick to Will Smith's bachelor playboy. And of course Will Smith launched his career with this movie. He is very funny in The Fresh Prince television show and he shows here that his propensity for comedy is excellent. Together these two are brilliant, one of the best cop buddies since Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh.Bad Boys is a story of two cops that have to protect a witness that saw her best friend murdered. Her best friend may have had information on some guys that committed huge crimes that involved drugs. Now it is up to the two heroes to try and crack the case and not get into too much trouble in the process. There are so many cliched things about this movie, but sometimes cliches are good, if you have likable actors to carry out the script. As in every buddy cop movie, you have the two partners that are very different but have a mutual respect for each other. You have the police chief that does nothing but tell them how much they have cost the department, how they could be suspended if they are not careful and how they are the best at what they do but a little too care free. You have the bad guy with the foreign accent who is charming and debonair but as deadly as a rattlesnake. Take any good cop/caper movie from Lethal Weapon, Stakeout, Beverly Hills Cop to films like Last Action Hero. They all have the same themes, but what makes them all good, and that includes this one, is how well they are executed. A lot of the credit has to go to Smith and Lawrence, but I also think special attention has to be given to Michael Bay. He was a new comer here and he proved that he has a great eye for action. The chase scene that starts in Smith's apartment and ends on the street where Lawrence almost dies, is one of the most emotionally charged scenes I've seen in a cop comedy. It kind of reminded me of Lethal Weapon 2, when at the end I thought Riggs was dead after his battle with the South African bad guy. That had power, this one is even better than that.Bad Boys is great entertainment and Smith and Michael Bay have become major players in Hollywood now. This is the start of it all and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. It is funny, action packed and likable. You can't go wrong. If you like some of the films that were mentioned in the review, then you'll have a hard time not liking this one. An excellent film.</fullReview>
