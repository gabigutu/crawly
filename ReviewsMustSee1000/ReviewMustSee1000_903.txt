		<shortDescription>Hopefully this film will finally give Sam Rockwell, the recognition he deserves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow conviction is definitely a deeply moving film and very well acted by Hilary Swank, Minnie Driver and Juliette Lewis. However Sam Rockwell is the one who really shines in Conviction. He plays his role as this man who got wrongfully convicted of murder, really raw and powerful. His character had many different emotions in this film. He had to express many different emotional feelings in the role. He had to be angry, sad, and happy and he portrayed it very well. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this film, I'd be truly surprised if he doesn't get his recognition, he is severely underrated, so much so that it actually angers me, that the Academy doesn't recognize Sam Rockwell because he is definitely overdue for an Oscar nomination or win.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>.Conviction - one of the best films of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loyalty: It something we all expect from our loved ones, but we so rarely receive. How loyal would our families be if we were convicted of a crime we were innocent of and sent to prison for the rest of lives? Would they put all their worldly desires away to do everything in their power to see to our injustice? I dare say that I know that it takes a special few that have such perseverance or such conviction.Hilary Swank stars in the film so aptly titled Conviction. Here again Swank portrays the real-life Betty Ann Waters. Betty Ann's brother, Kenny was convicted of a violent murder in their home town in Massachusetts and sent to prison in 1983. Betty Ann and Kenny grew up in a dysfunctional home and were tossed around to a plethora of foster homes during their childhood and adolescence. The only family they had was each other. Their relationship was so close and intimate that there was no doubt in her mind that her brother was incapable of murder. Kenny was a self-admitted bad boy. He had been arrested so many times in their small community that when Kenny's neighbor turned up murdered it seemed to be an easy assumption that Kenny was the perpetrator of the crime.Betty Ann had no money for high-paid lawyers and when Kenny tries to kill himself in prison, she came up with a solution to their problem. She will go to college, then law school and then become a lawyer and find the evidence to set her brother free. This sound like a plot made-up in a studio office, but it is the true story of this amazing woman. And, there would be no movie, if Betty Ann's astounding story didn't have a happy ending.Telling this story is difficult. But the even script by Pamela Gray provides a good point of departure for Tony Goldwyn's direction and the moving performances by the actors. Without hesitation, Hilary Swank is definitely back, her disappointing performance as Amelia Earhart last year could have ended her trip down the red carpet to win Oscar gold forever. Her performance playing Betty Ann is subtle and convincing. But it's not just Hilary Swank's performance that should be noted. Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Kenny Waters is amazing and heart-wrenching. His scenes in prison are remarkable as he so effortlessly depicts the wide range of emotions from complete hopelessness when years of imprisonment wear on him to utter joy when he learns that his sister has done the impossible. And lastly, Minnie Driver makes a great impression playing Betty Ann's law school friend. It's a role that could garner attention at award time, and hopefully will lead to more roles in the future.Conviction is one of the best films of the year. Its story of never-ending loyalty and love of a sister. It is inspirational and uplifting. This film will make you believe again, that with desire, perseverance and the conviction to never stop trying, almost anything is possible.For more reviews and news written by Kay Shackleton, see here: www.examiner.com/movie-awards-in-national</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swank Is Back with a Sharp Cast in an Inspiring Fact-Based Story Bordering on Incredulity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making decidedly wrong turns into rom-com in 2007's "P.S. I Love You" and historical biopic in 2009's "Amelia", Hilary Swank is back in her element as Betty Ann Waters, a working-class single mother of two whose fierce loyalty to her troublemaking brother Kenny knows no bounds, in actor/director Tony Goldwyn's time-spanning, fact-based 2010 drama. Written by Pamela Gray (she and Goldwyn also collaborated on 1999's affecting "A Walk on the Moon"), the inspiring, potentially melodramatic plot line often borders on incredulity, but Swank's trademark iron-jawed tenacity is on full display here. At the same time, it's a primarily economic performance teetering on lunacy as her character is tightly bound to Kenny since they shared a painful childhood due to the neglect of a horrifying mother.In 1983, Kenny is convicted of the bloody murder of an elderly neighbor largely on the basis of testimony from two former girlfriends, both of whom claimed he confessed his actions to them. Neither Kenny nor Betty Anne can afford a good attorney, so she decides to become a lawyer even though she's a high school dropout. Also serving as one of the film's executive producers, Swank come back securely to the against-all-odds territory of Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" (2004) by following Betty Ann's sixteen-year journey from her GED through college, then law school, and finally passing the bar ? all while she was raising two boys and working part-time at a local pub. The ending is predictable from a mile away, but the journey is not. The introduction of DNA evidence provides a linchpin that spins the story close to Lifetime-level dramatics, especially when Betty Ann solicits the assistance of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization devoted to overturning wrongful convictions. Gray's screenplay is solid enough, and Goldwyn's direction is assured within the back-and-forth treatment of the timeline.However, it's really the acting that is aces here. Beyond Swank's sterling work, Sam Rockwell brings an unpredictable furor and a surprising vulnerability to the showier role of Kenny. His rapport with Swank never feels forced, and the devotion of their sibling relationship is what really grounds the threat of hysterics in the film. The periphery is populated by a powerful squad of actresses turning in sharply etched work - Minnie Driver as Betty Ann's law-school friend Abra, whose comic spark highlights how pivotal her character is in representing the audience viewpoint; Melissa Leo ("Frozen River") as the malevolent arresting cop, whose secretive hostility provides the impetus for Kenny's conviction; Juliette Lewis as Kenny's dentally-challenged ex-girlfriend with a drunken confession scene that reveals the actress's long-forgotten raw talent below her usual giddiness; Karen Young in a brief scene as the unforgivable Mrs. Waters; and Ari Graynor ("Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist") as Kenny's embittered grown daughter. It's the cast's cumulative work that makes this movie intensely watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, dramatic story told well through emotional performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Conviction" is a simple, dramatic story, told well. Betty Anne (Hilary Swank) puts herself through law school for the sole effort of freeing her innocent brother Kenny (Sam Rockwell) from a life-sentence in prison for murder. Swank and Rockwell both carry this emotional film on their very strong shoulders.There are very few courtroom scenes, very few law school scenes, but it is filled with emotional connections between brother and sister as she visits him in prison, and as she tries living her own life. The characters dominate the beginning of the film, and the steps Swank has to take to free Rockwell keeps the film going towards the end.It is shot well, as this is clearly Massachusetts and it set the right feelings for the film without overpowering it. The highlights are Swank and Rockwell as they both play characters with elements that we have seen before that have given Swank Oscar wins and have given Rockwell popularity. Here, he has toned down his comic antics just enough for his performance to remain popular but should also give him his first Oscar nomination.The story may be missing a few elements that would have given it more substance to make it more interesting, but it seems to me, that's because the film-makers had a few restrictions in keeping to the true story. This may actually be a true story and not just based on one.I recommend "Conviction" for its emotional performances and for telling its simple story well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspirational true story of commitment &amp; life's struggles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Conviction is based on an inspiring true story of Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank), a high school dropout who over 18-years put herself through law school to represent and hopefully overturn her innocent brother's, Kenny Waters (Sam Rockwell), murder conviction. Betty Anne is a working mother of two boys who believes that her brother was wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in prison for a 1980 bloody murder of a woman living in a trailer next door to him in Ayer, Massachusetts. Kenny's ability to appeal his conviction using public defenders has been exhausted and without a lawyer, he will die in prison. That is when Betty Anne decides to dedicate her life to save her brother. With a newly earned law degree in hand, she hopes to exonerate her brother with new evidence and the new science of DNA.(My Comment) This is a story of what a devoted and inseparable loving sister can do for her brother when he needs her most. Their family bond for each other, while growing up on a farm, is stronger than any prison can break. The movie shows Betty Anne Waters' commitment in freeing her brother as the only thing that will make her life complete. The struggles she endures to become a lawyer, and her willpower to save her brother from any further pain is inspirational. The bond between Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell seems very real, including the steps that she takes as an obsessed lawyer to set him free. Their performances were brilliant, and I believe that both of them will be nominated for an Oscar. This is a movie to see.

		<shortDescription>Guilty until proved innocent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This type of film has been done before, but I don't seem to get sick of the subject. But I wish things like this never happened, to rot in a cell for something you did not do must be hell. I believe in justice, but feel most justice systems are flawed. Democracy comes with a price for some, and this story smashes that home! Us common people will be swallowed up in legal rules and regulations when facing an uphill battle like this, and unless you have the financial means, or in the case of this story a sister that will go to the end of the world and back, some people will be found guilty until proved innocent.This film has a great cast to bring home this great story, and it makes for compelling viewing. I am still to see a role that Sam Rockwell fills that I don't care for, he has been a great actor in so many solid films.10 out of 10 as the film picks you up at the beginning, get's you involved, makes you feel part of the pain caused by the legal system, even with you knowing the out come of the story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONVICTION ? CATCH IT (A-) Conviction is a Heart Hitting True story of a sister fighting for her Brother for 18 years to get Justice. I must say more than movie, the story in itself is simply heart wrenching so, I really applaud for the director, producers for choosing such an incredible true story to be told on screen. The only flaw in the movie was its length and sometimes I found the editing of flashbacks little irritating. The performances in the movie are truly incredible and every time I saw Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell, it brought tears in my eyes. The chemistry between these two actors is amazingly genuine and real. Even the young Brother and Sister played by Bailee Madison and Tobias Campbell had an awesome chemistry and it made the whole movie very relatable. Melissa Leo, Minnie Driver and Elle Bardha did a respectable job. One of the shocking performances in the movie is indeed from Juliet Lewis, who was outstanding in her 10mintutes role. My jaws were literally dropped to see her in middle aged role. You have to see to believe how good she was, I won't be shock if she gets an Oscar Nod for that. Overall, it's an inspiring tale of how far a Sister can go for her Brother, to get Justice. Truly Inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Courtroom Drama of the Twentieth-First Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Ayer, Massachusetts, the siblings Betty Anne and Kenneth 'Kenny' Waters are very close to each other and they are neglected by their single mother and prostitute Elizabeth Waters (Karen Young).In their come of age, Kenny (Sam Rockwell) is a troublemaker with a baby daughter hated by the local police department and Betty Anne (Hilary Swank) gets married and has two sons. When their neighbor is stabbed to death, the police officer Nancy Taylor (Melissa Leo) that has hatred for Kenny, arrests him and he is sent to court for trial.Kenny and Betty Anne can not afford to hire a lawyer and Kenny is defended by a public defender. He is sentenced to life without probation, based on the evidence of his blood type and the testimony of his girlfriends Brenda Marsh (Clea DuVall) and Roseanna Perry (Juliette Lewis).When Kenny tries to commit suicide in prison, his sister tells him that she will complete her elementary school and high-school to go to law school to reopen his case and overturn his sentence."Conviction" is the best courtroom drama of the Twentieth-First Century. The inspiring story of a waitress that decides to study to become a lawyer to defend her beloved and innocent brother that was sentenced to life without probation and release him after twenty years is one of the most beautiful examples of dedication, determination, devotion and fraternal love.The top-notch performances of Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell and Juliette Lewis deserved nomination to the Oscar. The tragic and ironic fate of Kenny six months after his freedom is not mentioned in the film that stops the journey of the Waters family in the best moments of their lives. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "A Condenaç?o" ("The Conviction")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brother's faith and a sister's devotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been wanting to watch Tony Goldwyn's 'Conviction' for a long time. Now movies like this have been done before. While there is the story of 'guilty until proved innocent' but what makes this one stand out is the authenticity with which the brother-sister relationship is portrayed. One doesn't see many Hollywood movies explore sibling relationships unless it's in the form of mockery like 'Stepbrothers'. There are but a very few exceptions like Kenneth Lonergan's beautiful 'You Can Count On Me'.Swank and Rockwell are very convincing as sister and brother. Their on screen interlude appears very natural and this only makes Betty Anne's determination to prove her brother's innocence all the more believable. Needless to say, both actors are at their best and they are supported wonderfully by Melissa Leo (who plays a bent copper), Juliette Lewis (she seems to have mastered playing trailer-trash characters), Clea Duvall (the lying wife), Minnie Driver (the charming friend) and Peter Gallagher.One can easily relate to Swank's Betty Anne struggling with the bureaucratic legal system and her drive to free her brother. Unless one has money or the right contacts, one can recognize the situations where Betty Anne is passed over from one administration to another.'Conviction' is a compelling watch. It involves the viewer right from the very beginning and even though you can predict the ending, it's Betty Anne and Kenny's faith in each other that keeps you hooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid performances, poignant real-life story, but average movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Difficult to write anything negative about such an triumphant story. The New York Times ran an touching article October last year regarding the real-life story of Betty Anne Waters, a single-mom who put herself through college and law school to exonerate her brother. Much has also been said about the incredible performances of Hillary Swank and Sam Rockwell, but supporting roles from Minnie Driver and Melissa Leo (I'm glad she's getting recognition since Homicide Life on the Street) are no less vibrant. So why the average rating?The level of drama does not rise above Hallmark Made-for-TV movies. The plot, story pacing, and overall tone of the film are very one- dimensional. There are too few moments where we see these characters interact on any level that's not (melo)dramatic. My favorites scene involves Minnie Driver and Hillary Swank shopping for groceries. It's the only time these characters feel real.I keep thinking Conviction has the premise of a David E. Kelley TV series, where the Kenny-theme could serve as a season long arc. The characters are interesting enough, but I was hoping for so much more. Conviction is by no means a bad film, but it's not a very good one either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story this movie is based on is quite amazing, even more when you think it actually happened in real life... but the movie itself is quite poor. The script never rises beyond the melodramatic, cheesy, predictable stuff. The characters are flat, one-dimensional, without any development. The music never leaves a certain melancholic tone which drags the film the whole way through. In general, I felt disconnected and unmoved even in moments when I realized that the story was at a crucial point...It's too bad that such a good story got wasted with such a bland and unremarkable film. The 2 stars go only to the actors, who tried to put forward a decent job... unfortunately, it's not enough.Unless you are bored to death and have absolutely nothing better to do, do not waste your time with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convicted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are major problems with this film, both regarding accuracy and dramatic tension, among which are: 1)for the film to work we must believe that the accused is not guilty,, and 2) we must understand why his sister felt a need to become a lawyer to save him. The film does not develop either point successfully and thus fails totally. first of all, the accused is presented as a loser, and a violent one at that, with little in the way of redeeming features, with an inferred motive and no showing of alibi. There is no coherent reason given on why his two wives/girlfriends would both accuse him. Even more important, why did his sister believe him to be not guilty, other than because he was her brother. As it turns out, from the facts of the case, there was more evidence, not presented in the movie, that would have convicted the guy, not the least of which he had in his possession a piece of jewelry belonging to the murdered woman, and had vowed to kill her. He was also shown to be even more violent than presented, having recently committed and been convicted of other violent crime. The brutality of the murder strongly suggests someone with a motive, and no showing of anyone else with such motive other than the accused. The film shows recantations by his partners, but the record does not support that this occurred. Even if it did, such recantations are problematic from people close to the accused years after the fact. As to his sister's commitment to becoming a lawyer, this status did not really affect the case. Anyone could have pushed for the DNA evidence and located it and I question if the dramatic presentation really occurred. Even if it did, it might have been cheaper to hire a lawyer than to spend 3 years at law school. Finally, the DNA did not, i repeat, did not, mean he was innocent. It merely meant that the DNA found was not his, according to the test. Even if we assume the test was correct, it might have been that of an accomplice. The DA was willing to retry, but politics got in the way. I doubt that the vicious portrayal of the attorney general was accurate either. Finally, since this guy killed himself six months after he was released, which the movie also conveniently fails to mention, this is suggestive that maybe he knew who the killer was, and he decided to do away with him. Also any portrayal of Barry Scheck as a hero is disquieting since I remember quite well his disgusting performance defending OJ Simpson and trying to convince the dimwits on the jury that the blood evidence and DNA was contaminated or that the police framed OJ. Oh sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much sibling devotion as conviction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I will never accept it!" Betty Anne Conviction could have been a TV special that, alas, is nothing special on the screen. The true story is unquestionably compelling: Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) goes to law school to become her brother, Kenny's (Sam Rockwell) lawyer for the purpose of proving him innocent of a murder for which he is spending his life.The translation to the screen is formulaic and documentary-like in its series of predictable scenes leading to Kenny's release. Granted, life is not as exciting as drama, but the artists on this film, especially writer Pamela Gray and director Tony Goldwyn, craft a serviceable plot with little inspirational dialogue or action that could reveal depths of sister and brother and even close friend Abra Rice (Minnie Driver), who attends law school with Betty Anne and helps with the defense.Because we all know the result before seeing the film, the burden is on keeping the momentum going with interesting characters and events. Unfortunately, Swank's perpetual crying and her authentic regional accent and Rockwell's goofy antics are not enough to give heft to an interesting premise. Juliette Lewis as Roseanna Perry, a key witness, is so much the trailer trash Lewis has always done well that the film's biographical integrity could be questioned.The last third of the film saves it from the abyss because unforeseen complications keep Kenny from leaving prison, and the ensuing investigation is more dynamic than the circumstances of his conviction. As for that, Betty Anne's conviction on behalf of her brother is daunting, a testimony to love that surpasses any romantic notions our fairy tales can conjure.Compromising the authenticity once again are the ending titles, which tell about Betty Anne's subsequent life as a waitress and public advocate but do not mention that Kenny 6 months later in 2001 fell and died in a freak accident. Not to mine those ironic implications is dramatically unforgivable unless the filmmakers don't want Betty Anne's beatification to be compromised by something as messy as fate.In the end, Conviction is the real deal of sibling fidelity and an embarrassment to any of us who might not step up if one of our siblings were so convincingly convicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Conviction" stars Hillary Swank, Sam Rockwell, Minnie Driver, Melissa Leo, Peter Gallagher, and Juliette Lewis in the true-life story of Betty Anne Waters, who becomes an attorney in order to free her brother Kenny of a wrongful murder conviction.I saw Betty Anne profiled some time ago -- back then, I think she was still in law school.Kenny Waters is convicted of the murder of Katharina Brow (since she was German, I assume the original last name was Brau) who was viciously knifed in her home. The crime occurred in 1980, when there was no DNA testing, and Kenny had the same blood type as the perpetrator. Several witnesses, including Kenny's wife and ex-girlfriend, testify against him.Betty Anne, a mother with two children, makes the decision to go to law school in order to free her brother. At that time, she doesn't even have her GED. She comes up against wall after wall, gets divorced, and her children, probably more to help her than anything else, finally go to live with their father. She moonlights running a bar.Betty Anne contacts Barry Scheck (Gallagher) of the Innocence Project to enlist his group's help. Scheck needs evidence -- by then, it's been about 15 years since Kenny's conviction.This is a powerful story because it shows, again, what the determination of one person can achieve, and how his or her passion can inspire others to help.Hillary Swank is a gifted actress, and it's a shame that she hasn't gotten more roles like she had in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby. She's natural but intense as Betty Anne, and she can really pull at the heartstrings. Sam Rockwell as Kenny does a wonderful job, and the two have great chemistry together. You could feel his hopelessness, and his fear of being let down.Everyone is good in this film, with Juliette Lewis as an ex-girlfriend and Melissa Leo as policewoman Nancy Taylor standouts.The problem I have with this film is that, strip the movie of Hillary Swank and you've got a Lifetime movie. It just doesn't come off like a feature film in the way the story is told or in its focus. It's just a little bit left of cloying. Also, note to writers -- Kenny wasn't in jail, he was in prison. There's a difference.Despite this, it's a wonderful story, all the more dramatic because it's true. And you can't get enough of its message: One person can make a difference.</fullReview>

Some points are badly introduced and rushed whereas others could have deserved more consistency. The rhythm is also quite uneven with a few long passages.Even though, the beauty of the story and its extraordinary aspect compensate for those flaws. Hilary Swank is very good and did a great job with her "Boston" accent. Sam Rockwell is also very solid and, albeit not much on screen, shows undeniable presence in every of his scenes.All in all, Conviction is a pretty solid movie overall, but too consensual and conventional to make it an excellent feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opportunity to share an unbelievable but true journey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true story of a man convicted of a bloody murder in a Boston suburb in the 1980s . There are witnesses who say that he told him he did it and there is blood typing evidence (this is before DNA analysis) which strongly suggests it was him. The only thing going for him is his sister who is sure that he didn't do it. You have seen this relatively simple plot play out many times on television on Dateline, 20/20 or on similar programs. The only difference here is that you have another magnificent performance by Hillary Swank playing Betty Anne Waters who is going to take the next 18 years of her life completing High School, going to college and then law school in order to see if there is way to get her brother his freedom. You also have Sam Rockwell, playing the brother Kenny, in a performance that should earn him an Academy Award nomination. The screen play by Pamela Gray and the direction by Tony Goldwyn gives us pieces of their childhood which clarifies their great devotion to each other. The struggle of Betty Ann to become a lawyer and her determination to find the evidence that would be the key to saving her brother allows us to understand this person. Her interaction with Kenny similarly provides insight into his pain and bravado. The difficult lives of the people in the community where this happened and the very questionable actions of the police and district attorney Martha Coakley (who subsequently was defeated in the recent US Senate race in Massachusetts to replace Kennedy) was brought out by a stunning performance of Juliette Lewis who played one of the witnesses who recounts what really happened to make her testify against Kenny. We had the good fortune to meet at our preview screening Swank, Rockwell, Lewis, the real life Betty Anne Waters and her good friend and fellow law student Abra Rice who was well played in the movie by Minnie Driver. They confirmed that truth is stranger and at times more unbelievable than fiction. I recall reading about the well known lawyer Barry Scheck, who was depicted in this movie, and wondering about his decision to devote his career to the Innocence Project where the new science of DNA matching is applied to old crimes. It turns out that over 250 innocent people have been freed from prison due to his efforts. There is one particular line in this film stands out in this regard as Swank as Betty Ann remarks that if Massachusetts had the death penalty her brother would have been killed before she had chance to make a case for his innocence. Swank, speaking for herself at our screening told how making this movie allowed her to understand the unique life affirming experience that these people went through. Watching this film also gave the audience the opportunity to share this journey. Filmrap.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hollywood Sermon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story behind this film is the kind Hollywood loves to go on about: underdog troublemaker but nice guy at heart gets railroaded by corrupt cop and flawed system. Along the way we are treated to some liberal philosophizing, such as, "Gee, you know what? If Massachusetts had the death penalty, Kenny would be dead." You're right sister, we need to stop executing murderers. For me the Kenny character just didn't turn my crank, and I ended up not caring if he were exonerated or not. He seemed like a small-town thug waiting for baby sister to get him off the hook. If there had been some redeeming quality about him that got my sympathy, I would have joined his cheering section, but he wasn't a character I could root for. There's a lot of over-emotionalism in this flick, including righteous indignation disguised as temper tantrums, like when the lead character throws things around the house and her two sons have to gently calm her down. And is it worth sacrificing your marriage and your kids to wage a one-woman war against the system? It comes off as heroic, but the main character never questions the huge cost her crusade levies on the lives of her family and friends. So I couldn't pull for sis, either. Moreover, Hollywood's continual obsession with people wrongly incarcerated gets old. Poor characterization and the predictable plot won't allow me to award "Conviction" anything more than three stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Conviction, and I have to say it was one of the most powerful pieces of American Cinema I have ever seen, The story was so amazing and the acting was so great that it will stick with you long after the movie is over,The fact that it was a true story made it even more rewarding, This is a story that proves Blood really is thicker than water. Sam Rockwell puts on a performance that will make the Academy stand up and take notice, He should have won an Oscar for Moon, and now Conviction as well, and Hilary Swank kills it, I love what she did, I felt the relationship they had as though they were real life siblings, and Minnie Driver is sensational as well. This movie will make you remember times you've had with you're own family members and make you ask the question, How far would I go for my sibling? Easily one of the top 3 films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My only complaint is that in the footnote section of the movie where they write what happened to the main characters---they leave out Kenny Waters. I think it is of utmost importance to let viewers know what happened to him and its ridiculous to leave it out. For what purpose? So as not to dampen the last heartwarming lake scene where he and his sister revel in his freedom?.....The movie had plenty of downer aspects and blue collar, depressing moments so I would rather the director tell it like it is. Kenny died in a tragic accidental fall within six months of his release. I think the bizarreness of that alone, adds greatly to an already compelling story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A devoted sister fights for her brother's freedom in a truly incredible story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is incredible. Performances by Swank and Rockwell definitely deserved nominations at big award shows. It really pulls on your heart strings while depicting Betty Anne's devotion and dedication for her brother whom she loves so much. She's an incredible woman. The whole time while watching Conviction, I just kept thinking, Wow this is a true story, Betty Anne Waters and Kenny Waters are real people who actually had to endure this on going battle. I had not researched the case before watching the movie so I did not know if Kenny was innocent or not but the whole time leading to the results of the DNA test I was hoping he was. I would have been devastated if he wasn't. Betty Anne sacrificed almost 20 years of her life to free her brother. Sam Rockwell did a fantastic job of portraying Kenny who became very frustrated for being incarcerated for a murder he did not commit. The fact that he had a little girl when he was convicted made the story even harder to take. He missed his daughter growing up. Conviction made me cry many times but it was all worth it to get the satisfaction of discovering that Kenny was innocent and released from jail. Absolutely amazing story and movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the American way of life: injustice. And the story between a brother and a sister.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this film you stop to wonder how many innocent cases there are where the sibling does not become a lawyer to put things right.The American legal system, so this film tells us, is so complicated that you need to be a lawyer to operate it. In that it does not differ much from other legal systems operating today, however, so it seems, the American system is more dependent on money or personal sacrifice in order to get to some sort of justice.This is a depressing tale in spite of its "good" outcome where some justice is indeed done. However, in the closing text I did see no mention of a multimillion settlement against the state and only a mention that the police officer who was most responsible for the injustice, fabricating evidence etc, did not get convicted on account of some technicality of law.What makes this film excellent though, is that it hints on a fact to often neglected, the fact that the victim reproaches itself for the wrongdoings committed against it. This is done in order to survive injustice, which can otherwise not be survived. The victim must see itself as guilty somehow, otherwise its life becomes unbearable.If therefore somebody appears to be guilty like when you get a gut feeling there is something wrong or the like - then be very careful! That gut feeling can be totally wrong and just stemming from the victim's survival instinct of victimizing itself to make its world livable.That is also the chief reason why we have to fight for justice. People go around thinking that it is quite OK that there exists poor people and rich people and not as it should be where everybody has the same.Every child born to this earth knows that total material equality is the only thing that can be accepted but as it grows up and is faced with seeing some people having a thousand times more than other people it tells itself that this is OK, because if it was not it could not survive. It's definitely time that we flushed that garbage down the toilet!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtle, well acted, mediocre screenplay of an inspirational story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ordinarily, a screenplay this dry, plain, dull, and lengthy would turn me off right away. Additionally, the director somehow manages to lose the audience with how disjointed his interpretation is. Many times, films like this I will not even finish watching.However, that was not the case here. In fact, this film has two things really working for it, a profoundly inspirational story, that manages to reach through its modest screenplay, right past the awkwardness of its director, and deeply touch the viewer regardless, and also some really well crafted performances from it's entire cast, that manage to bring this story to you in a very personal way.Much credit to all the actors for breathing life into this film, which gave very little to work with, in regard to script &amp; dialog. It never ceases to impress me how Sam Rockwell chooses some of the most challenging parts an actor can play. In order for this film to work, and for the truth of the story to be realized, he has to portray someone who every person but his sister believes is guilty, and yet still portray a man who would be capable of having a person care for him so much that they'd sacrifice their entire adult life for him.How do you juxtapose those two qualities into one character? Potential vicious murderer &amp; life long loving family bond of unbreakable proportions. If ever there were two qualities that would seem mutually exclusive, it's those, &amp; yet Rockwell does itSwank does a dutiful performance in her part as well, everything played pitch perfect. It's not a film that will tear through cinemas like Erin Brochovich, or even compete with other more notable wrongful conviction themed films, but it is a solid presentation nonetheless, most assuredly due to it's performances, &amp; it's heart</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Free this film from any undeserved scrutiny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me a MES (male emotional softie), or you can call me a MESA since it is my last name, but the motion picture "Conviction" is in my list as one of the most inspiring movies I have ever witnessed. The film tells the true story of the Waters in a not so much watered-down version; maybe a bit overdramatized but that comes with the "make a movie out of a true story" territory. So before you convict me of First Degree Punicide, let me get to the narrative: The film is based on Betty Anne Waters' incredible plight to free her brother from jail. Betty Anne was a working single mother in Massachusetts who put herself through law school in order to represent her brother Kenny, who had been falsely convicted of murder in the early 80's and therefore imprisoned. Kenny was no angel, but not a murderer. He got the shaft with a life sentence primarily due to the demonic behaviors of a female law enforcement officer and more "women behaving badly" which I will not elaborate on or else I will be once again convicted of being a "plot spoiler". After several appeal denials, Betty Anne decided that the only way to fight injustice and help her little brother (from the same broken-house mother) is to get a legal education and go from "tending a bar" to "passing a bar". Pamela Gray's screenplay of "Conviction" sure was a bit weepy and over-sentimental at times, but when the narrative focuses on "family helping family at all cause" there is nothing wrong with that. So I exonerate Gray for any sentimentality charges she has been falsely accused of by some film critics. Director Tony Goldwyn did not construct a perfect film in "Conviction", but I object if anyone says that he did not admirably present an uplifting movie about long-term resiliency and sibling support. What marveled me the most of "Conviction" was its stellar cast. I think the Academy should have been convicted of snubism for not nominating Hilary Swank for a Best Actress Oscar this past year for her brilliant leading performance as Betty Anne Waters. And the same charges are also pending for the Best Supporting Actor oversight of Sam Rockwell's tour-de-force work as the frustrated Kenny. Melissa Leo deservingly fought her way to a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "The Fighter"; but that was not the only powerful performance she had in 2010. Leo's performance as corrupt cop Nancy Taylor in "Conviction" also does deserve thespian justice, even though she played a villainous character swarming with injustice. You gotta check out Peter Gallagher's cool performance as Barry Scheck, an advocate of those "wrongfully convicted of crimes" who checks into the movie halfway in. Juliette Lewis' thespian work as a drugged-out trailer trash queen only gets around 10 minutes of screen time but she sure makes the best out of it, her character might have been toothless but her performance was flawless. And let just make a quick mini-point by stating that I absolutely loved Minnie Driver in this by driving the charisma right through in playing Abra Rice, Betty Anne's devoted best friend and law school peer. Driver's work as Abra also did provide the picture some well-needed comic relief from an otherwise gripping &amp; serious dramatic narrative. There is plenty of worthy-evidence to warrant "Conviction" with an exemplary motion picture recognition. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Conviction finds Hilary Swank trying to overturn the conviction for murder of her brother Sam Rockwell who was tried and convicted of robbing a neighbor woman of cash and jewelry. In her effort Swank goes several extra miles to achieve her end.The key in this film is the relationship of Swank and Rockwell. In a pinch they really feel they've got only each other. The film lays that out quite clearly with several flashback episodes showing their childhood and the neglect they had from their mother who was more interested in having a good time. The two kids learned to rely on each other.Swank has her problems, she gets married and has two sons, and later is divorced from her husband and they share custody of the kids. Rockwell however is in and out of trouble for all kinds of petty crimes. And it's well known he did not get along with the victim. Later he's arrested and released for the murder/robbery and he earns the special interest of arresting officer Melissa Leo. Two years later she arrests him again because of additional evidence. Rockwell is tried and convicted and given a life sentence.All of which does not faze Swank in the least. Few would do what she did, she put herself through law school just so Rockwell could be her first client. She even gets Barry Scheck of the Innocence Project to aid in her effort, but the leg work she has to do herself. Scheck is played here by Peter Gallagher.In a year where Melissa Leo won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for The Fighter, she might well have gotten some consideration for her portrayal of Officer Nancy Perry. Quite frankly Rockwell is a complete jerk in this film, especially with his sexist remarks to Leo. But all it does is fuel her desire to see him in jail. Let's say Leo cuts quite a few corners and if it weren't for the new use of DNA evidence, Rockwell would still be in jail. At that it's still a long way from exoneration.However the best scenes are between Swank and Rockwell. Swank is unshakably convinced of her brother's innocence and goes the extra light year to prove it. The two really do come across as brother and sister. Conviction is quite the commercial for The Innocence Project and for Barry Scheck's legal talents. But most of all it's a story about family loyalty and blood bonds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was probably on of the best movies that I have ever seen. The amount of Loyalty, Emotion and Love involved in this movie is so intense. And to know that this is a true story only makes it more heartrending. This also tells us something about how most justice systems are flawed. One can't even imagine what it is like to spend a whole life behind bars for something that you didn't do. You do lose hope when the system turns against you. But the positive thing that can be learnt from this is that if you really try hard you can achieve anything. Hillary Swank has shown again what a fine actor she is. But the credit must go to Sam Rockwell. His performance in this movie is outstanding. He really did justice to this demanding role which required him to portray a range of emotions throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who needs some motivation and inspiration in life, if something is not working out as it is supposed to be. Watch this movie and be inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally engaging with a powerful cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, Conviction seems like a very mixed bag. There had been little to no promotion for it out here while the trailer hadn't really been attached to any recent screenings. I do recall seeing a trailer for the film one time online months ago, but that's it. Truth be told, that's usually the best way to see a film. No scene has the chance to be overplayed because you had seen the trailer however many times. Conviction is very much an independent film and is borderline nonexistent even though it had a limited release last week. The result was not only an extremely emotional and powerful film, but Conviction also features some of the strongest performances of the year.The dramatic film jumps around in time right from the beginning. We're shown the horrific aftermath of Katharina Brow's gruesome murder and then jump back to the present day where we see Betty Anne visiting Kenneth in prison. Soon after that, we travel back into the past where we're shown the adult lives of Betty Anne and Kenneth. They're very much a part of each other's lives even when they both have families of their own to worry about. Kenneth's run ins with the law become more frequent as he seems to be picked up whenever the law is broken in Ayer, Massachusetts. Then, we jump even further back into the past during Betty Anne and Kenneth's childhood. They were very close even at that age, but they didn't live normal lives. They were stealing, trespassing, and breaking and entering at an early age. The time jumps were kind of infrequent and abrupt; they seemed to just happen at whim but provided quite a bit of background history about Betty Anne and Kenneth that was crucial to the overall story.I'm honestly not a fan of Hilary Swank. She's just never done anything for me. The main point of interest for me was Sam Rockwell. Ever since his magnificent performance in last year's Moon, I've been trying to see as many of his films as possible and they very rarely disappoint. Conviction relies on the chemistry between Swank and Rockwell though. The whole movie wouldn't be anything without the connection those two have. Swank is incredibly family driven as the aftermath of her devoting most of her life to freeing her brother takes its toll on the rest of her life and her family. Rockwell is as fantastic as ever as just a simple expression on his face seems to say more about his character than any kind of reaction could, but his emotional outbursts are just as spectacular. Before he went to prison, Kenneth Waters seemed like a family man with a warm personality that cracked a lot of jokes but flew off the handle at the drop of a hat and lost control that usually resulted in a trip downtown. Prison is tearing him apart and it shows not only in Rockwell's performance but Swank's as well.Conviction is one of the most effective dramas of the year that delivers an impact you'll be feeling long after you leave the theater. It takes you on a roller coaster of emotions that is well worth the ride. All the chips on the table lie in the hands of Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell while their on-screen presence alone seems to drive the film even when they're not saying anything. One of the best aspects of the film is that Betty Anne believes her brother is innocent and even when that comes into question, she doesn't want to hear any of it. Near the end of the film, it doesn't really seem to matter if Kenneth is innocent or not. Betty Anne believes it to be true and that's good enough for her. Her passion seems to be the underlying factor that drives the film. If you're looking for a film that feels heartfelt and genuine, then Conviction is a film you may want to look into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring story, excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Goldwyn's Conviction is a searing dramatic tale that's heavily based on true events, and is essentially the underdog story boiled down to its most effective elements, with inspiration running throughout its truly remarkable storyline. Hilary Swank can be a force of nature in her work, and she's dynamite here as Betty Anne Waters, a small town girl who is very close with her rambunctious sibling Kenny (Sam Rockwell), who grows up as the troublemaker of the two, running afoul of a nasty local police officer (Melissa Leo). When his next door neighbour is found stabbed to death, Leo sees it as her opportunity to get rid him for good, and tampers with evidence, until he is convicted. Guilty until proved innocent is the mantra with this difficult tale, and because it's based on a true story that happened in real life, it unfolds at a snails pace of tragic events in which a satisfying outcome sometimes just seems out of reach. With Kenny in wrongfully convicted and rotting in prison while his wife and daughters edge towards moving on, Betty does the unthinkable: with no previous experience in college, let alone law, she decides to study for the bar exam, in order to eventually represent Kenny in court, and prove his innocence. It seems like something from a movie, and here we see it, but this is something that really, really happened, which to me is extraordinary and essential to make known. She persists through many obstacles both great and small, and with the help of a dapper senior colleague (Peter Gallagher), and a perky fellow law student (Minnie Driver) she passes the exam and sets out to defend her brother. It's a rocky road, beset with the decayed and deliberately lost memories of years before, and the police officer's longstanding belligerence. Unreliable witnesses, uncooperative testimonials and all sorts of stuff get in her way, but Betty ain't a girl to quit or back down, a character trait which Swank seems to have been born to play, and is the lighthouse which guides this fantastic film along its track. Rockwell exudes burrowing frustration as a man in a position of incomprehensible sadness, hopeful yet resigned to his fate which has been orchestrated by evil, targeting him in wanton cruelty. Painful is the word for him here, and when Rockwell sets out for a mood in his work, you damn well feel it. Juliette Lewis briefly rears her head as a dimbulb witness who plays a part in Betty's quest, as does Clea Duvall very briefly as another witness who seems to have no idea what she actually saw. Melissa Leo is an actress who is utterly and totally convincing whether she's on the good or the evil side of the coin, holding the audience in rapturous awe with seemingly little effort. Here she's so nasty it radiates off the screen, providing a core incentive for Betty's struggle, whether or not the events actually played out like that. Director Tony Goldwyn is an actor himself and uses that experience to forge a film with respect and sympathy for its two leads. One of the most underrated films of 2010.</fullReview>

Convinced that he's innocent, Betty Anne puts herself through high school, college and, finally, law school in an 18-year quest to free Kenny.Hilary Swank takes the lead here, uncovering the facts and utilizing DNA evidence (when it finally becomes available) while at the same time sacrificing her marriage and time with her kids. Minnie Driver is in the best friend role, helping her locate the evidence and through school. Sam Rockwell plays the brother who truthfully you don't have much remorse for as his character is so aloof.Swank, and Rockwell are excellent as usual, which helps because the movie doesn't move at the fasted pace, it managed to keep my interest throughout though and I really felt for these characters, helped along by multiple flashbacks to their tormented childhood.There are also some fantastic performances from Melissa Leo as the arresting officer and Juliette Lewis, who in a very small role completely embodies and transforms into her character. I could not take my eyes off of her or those bad teeth. Just incredible.This one tugs at the heart and is inspirational. Honestly I wasn't ever sure how it was going to play out either. 3/8/16</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kenny Waters (Sam Rockwell) is convicted for the brutal 1980 murder of Katharina Brow in Ayer, Ma. His sister Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) is a working mom who goes back to school to get a law degree and get his brother out of prison. Fellow older student Abra (Minnie Driver) befriends her. Sergeant Nancy Taylor (Melissa Leo) was the investigating officer. He was convicted by the testimonies of his ex-wife Brenda (Clea DuVall) and ex-girlfriend Roseanna (Juliette Lewis).This is a sincere true story. Director Tony Goldwyn tries to bring something powerful but I can't shake the feeling of a made-for-TV movie. It's not about the effort or the look. The movie rolls out very traditionally without any surprises. It's very functional but it's missing a big over-arching style. The extended flashback probably takes too much of the early momentum. The audience already knows about his conviction. Short bursts of flashbacks would be more compelling and allow the audience to question Betty Anne's resolve more. The most compelling drama is whether Kenny is actually guilty. Goldwyn isn't able to find the needed structure. The cast is some of the best around and they have a few big emotional moments. Rockwell is great once again. I just think Goldwyn could have done better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell are outstanding in this true tale of a sister who puts herself through Law School to overturn the wrongful conviction of her brother. The acting is superb, but it is aided by excellent pacing that is a masterclass in editing. Children grow up, marriages fail, but all these episodes are relayed matter-of-fact, reminding us of the focus and determination of the female lead. Nothing will deter her from her task, and nothing is as important. At one moment one of her sons implies she has wasted her life on a futile task. She is flabbergasted by the comment - it has not occurred to her that her mission could be interpreted this way. When she does get close to revealing the truth, the ugliness of the human actions that created her brother's hell are incredibly difficult to take. Human corruption knows no depth, but then the heights of human determination are also on display here. An incredible story, done justice by a superb production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspirational story about brotherly love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm sorry you wasted your life on this. Your brother killed that woman."Inspired by a remarkable true story in which a sister practically gives up almost two decades of her life in order to save her brother who has been convicted of murder and has been sentenced to life in prison. It's an amazing and inspirational story, but unfortunately the film suffers from being overly manipulative at times and too conventional. Conviction has Oscar bait written all over it, and despite having a heavy clichéd script the excellent cast elevate the film and make it worth recommending. Many people remember Tony Goldwyn from his villainous role in Ghost, but he has also directed a couple of rom-coms. This is the first time he directs a fully dramatic film and it suffers from being overly sentimental at times (the score is way too melodramatic). The film is saved however by its excellent cast. Hillary Swank is amazing as this working mother who decides to put her personal aspirations aside to help save her imprisoned brother. In order to do so she decides to finish High School and go through law school. Not an easy task considering Betty Anne has two children to maintain. Sam Rockwell plays Betty's brother, Kenny, who was arrested in 1983 for a brutal murder. Betty and Kenny had been very close since they were young because their mother was constantly working so we get several flashbacks of them spending their childhood days breaking into nearby homes and dreaming of a better life. This always got Kenny into trouble with the local authorities. Years later, when a woman was found brutally murdered in a trailer near to Kenny's place he was the first suspect. After some incriminating evidence against him he is sentenced and that is when her loving sister decides to dedicate her life to free him. The degree of devotion she has for her brother is unprecedented and truly inspirational.The question one asks throughout the film is how far Betty is willing to go to help her brother considering it has led her to lose her husband and any attempt to have a life of her own. It has even affected her relationship with her two children, played by Owen Campbell and Conor Donovan, who feel neglected at times. There isn't one second in which she questions what she is doing and takes it more as a responsibility and a debt she has for her brother. Swank gives a powerful performance and her devotion to Kenny is completely believable. Rockwell is also great as Kenny in both the prison scenes and in some of the flashback scenes where we see some of his wild behavior. He plays his character extremely well, up to the point where you are never really sure whether or not this guy is guilty for the crime he has committed. The only person who seems convinced about his innocence is his sister and that made the film all the more compelling. Minnie Driver plays Abra Rice, one of the law students who befriends Betty and helps her on the case. Her relationship with Betty could've been explored a bit better, but the entire focus of the film was on Betty's devotion and effort to try to free her brother so she is only introduced as this friend who helped with the case. The family dynamics between Betty and her children and between her and her ex husband is barely touched upon because the filmmaker's devotion was focused on the relationship between the two siblings. It didn't hurt that they were played by Rockwell and Swank, two extremely talented actors. I'm a huge fan of Sam Rockwell and I could personally watch anything he does so I might be a bit biased but their relationship in this film is what sold this movie. Melissa Leo has some small scenes in the film, but her presence is always welcomed. The film has its flaws and at times the pacing of the film does begin to drag and feel repetitive, but the performances more than make up for it at the end. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of film are made that are based on a true story, and most of these films claim to be inspirational, but seldom are. Finding a truly inspirational film, that is based on a true story, is like finding a needle in a haystack, in this case, that needle is called Conviction. Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) came from a dysfunctional family, dropped out of High School, got married, and had kids, while she was still a child herself. She never wanted to be anything more than a housewife, until her brother, Kenneth (Sam Rockwell), was convicted of a murder she knew he couldn't have committed. It took fifteen long years, but Betty Anne got her GED, finished college, and went to law school, with the hopes of one day getting her brother exonerated. Hilary Swank stars and thrives in roles like this one. Despite her beauty and talent, she is one of the most down to earth people in Hollywood, and is always very believable as a normal, every day person. In most of her films, she is the kind of person audiences empathize with and cheer for, making her perfect for this role. She is paired with Sam Rockwell who is one of the most underrated stars in Hollywood. The man has immense talent, but is seldom talked about, because of the awful films he decides to star in. I have admired Rockwell for a long time, but this is the first time I can remember rating a film he was in higher than three stars. Conviction is a real story, written by the people who lived through it. It is heartfelt, inspirational, and most importantly real. The film may have bombed in theaters, but it is a true gem that was seriously overlooked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always admired people who stand for the belief/faith no matter what, although I would probably not fond of being a person very close to them... Even if they are right and the justice is finally served, the time and circumstances around affect them and their relations. One of the examples of the above we can in Conviction where a single (luckily successful) fight against injustice saw several declines and comedowns at a personal and financial level. The characters are well performed (particularly Hilary Swank as Betty Anne Waters and Sam Rockwell as Kenny Waters, Juliette Lewis as Roseanna Perry), but as 18+ years were fit into 1 hour 40 minutes, both the script and the character development were not totally seamless, enabling some aridity and abeyance. Anyway, it is the strongest performance by Rockwell I have seen, and it could have been awarded for at least a major nomination. So I am generally pleased with this movie and have decided to bestow strong 7 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swank And Rockwell Excels In Conviction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conviction is a film directed by Tony Goldwyn. It stars Hilary Swank as Betty Anne Waters and Sam Rockwell as her brother Kenneth "Kenny" Waters. It is is the inspirational true story of a sister's unwavering devotion to her brother. When Betty Anne Waters' older brother Kenny is arrested for murder and sentenced to life in 1983, Betty Anne, a Massachusetts wife and mother of two, dedicates her life to overturning the murder conviction. Convinced that her brother is innocent, Betty Anne puts herself through high school, college and, finally, law school in an 18 year quest to free Kenny. With the help of best friend Abra Rice, Betty Anne pores through suspicious evidence mounted by small town cop Nancy Taylor, meticulously retracing the steps that led to Kenny's arrest. Belief in her brother - and her quest for the truth - pushes Betty Anne and her team to uncover the facts and utilize DNA evidence with the hope of exonerating Kenny.In her study group, Betty Anne learns about the new field of DNA testing and realizes this could be the key to overturning Kenny's conviction. She contacts attorney Barry Scheck from the Innocence Project. The backlog of cases will mean waiting more than a year unless she can pass the bar and find the blood evidence from Kenny's trial herself to have it tested. At first she is stonewalled, then told the evidence was destroyed, but she refuses to give up, and she and her friend Abra embark on an odyssey to recover any evidence that might still be stored away somewhere. At the time of the trial, Kenny's blood type was shown to be identical to the killer's but DNA testing didn't exist. In the process, Betty Anne learns from an acquaintance who is now a police officer that Nancy Taylor was fired from the police department for fabricating evidence in another case. This deepens Betty Anne's suspicions about Kenny's conviction and the "evidence" given at trial. Finally the DNA results come back and establish that the blood was not Kenny's. Betty Anne and Kenny are overjoyed and think he is about to be released, after 16 years in prison, but Martha Coakley, of the District Attorney's office, refuses to vacate the conviction. They claim there was still enough evidence to convict Kenny as an accomplice, and Kenny is convinced that no matter what they do the authorities will find a way to keep him in prison to avoid admitting to a botched prosecution. Betty Anne is heartbroken but again refuses to give up.Betty Anne, Abra, and Barry Scheck visit the other two trial witnesses, Kenny's ex-wife and ex-girlfriend. Both tearfully admit that Sergeant Nancy Taylor coerced them into perjuring themselves at the trial in order to get a conviction. With an affidavit from Kenny's ex-wife and the DNA evidence, Kenny's conviction is vacated and he is freed from prison after 18 years in June 2001. Betty Anne is able to persuade his daughter, Mandy (Ari Graynor), who he had only known as a small child, that he never stopped trying to reach out to her while he was in prison despite his ex-wife's efforts to estrange them. He is able to reconnect with his daughter and is reunited with his sister, and her sons. The epilogue states that Betty Anne secured a large civil settlement from the City of Ayer for Kenny's wrongful conviction, but former Sergeant Nancy Taylor could not be charged with a crime because the statute of limitations had expired. Katharina Brow's real murderer has not been found.Less compelling -- and more manipulative -- than it should be, Conviction benefits from its compelling true story and a pair of solid performances from Swank and Rockwell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, entertaining film, well worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story and this film have all the ear marks of being a riveting and stunning film. Unfortunately it doesn't quite reach that level of being really stunning but it definitely fits the bill for being entertaining and interesting and well worth seeing. It is a fantastic drama, held back by perhaps a slightly less than impressive lead performance and the pace of the film stumbles a little bit here and there as you try to figure out what time period you're in. But don't let those small complaints deter you because this is an uplifting and excellent film that will have you cheering.I admit I am not a big Hilary Swank fan. I think she overacts and she's over rated a lot of the time. She does okay in this role but in a role that is loosely comparable to Erin Brockovich in a lot of ways she doesn't fit the bill. I think a different actor could have done more with the part but she does okay. Sam Rockwell does an excellent job as the wrongfully accused brother of Swank's character. Rockwell goes through so much in the film and the transition he goes through in jail is plainly displayed by his performance.The triumph of the film is what Swank's character goes through over the course of years to save her brother. The moments of breakthrough she has in his case will have you cheering and rooting for her success. Director Tony Goldwyn has a lot of experience in Television and far more in acting. Conviction plays out like a television show in its pace where they try to cram a lot into the hour and a half film. Sometimes you just feel like you have to try hard to keep up. Still Conviction is a great drama, well worth seeing, it will entertain you and has a terrific story. Definitely worth your time. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muddy Waters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell elevates "Conviction", a film whose title refers to both the unwarranted incarceration of Kenny Waters (Rockwell) for the 1980 murder of a Massachusetts woman, and the personal conviction (conviction, noun - a fixed or firm belief) of his sister Betty Waters, who spend decades steadfastly standing by her brother's side, dedicating her life to proving her brother's innocence.On one hand the film's plot is derivative of fare like "In The Name of the Father", "The Wrong Man", "The Hurricane" and "A Cry In The Dark", in which men or women are falsely imprisoned and are made to endure unjust confinement, but on the other hand it differs in some respects: the length of time Kenny is incarcerated for is far longer than is typical of this genre, Kenny's innocence is left ambiguous for most of the film's running time, and the film stresses both the toll incarceration takes on loved ones, and the scarily arbitrary way in which Kenny's conviction was overturned. Indeed, though Betty puts herself through law school, becomes a lawyer and teams up with the Innocence Project (a non-profit organization dedicated to proving the innocence of wrongly convicted people through the use of DNA testing), it is sheer luck that redeems the years and years of effort she puts into freeing her brother. The film boasts some good performances by Hilary Swank, Juliette Lewis, Minnie Driver and Peter Gallagher, and the love siblings Kenny and Betty show for each other is very affecting, but director Tony Glodwyn isn't quite convincing in his suggestions that Betty's life suffers as much on the outside as Kenny does inside jail; this aspect of the film is poorly written.The film has been accused of being a glorified television movie. Such criticisms are valid, but the film works well in its own limited way. To see the zenith of this genre, see "Murder on a Sunday Morning", "Paradise Lost 1 and 2", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Capturing the Friedmans". To date there have been over 300 post-conviction DNA exonerations in the United States. A study by Ronald Huff, director of the Criminal Justice Research Centre, and professor of sociology Arye Rattner, estimates that in the United States alone, over 10,000 people are wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year.8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quite interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Conviction is based on an astonishing and certainly inspiring true story. So, I expected Hollywood to become it into a cloying melodrama with many tears and few narrative integrity. To my surprise, screenwriter Pamela Gray and director Tony Goldwyn took the opposite road, focusing on the facts and carefully controlling the emotions from the film not to suffocate the story, bringing as a final result, a concise, frugal and very interesting film which does not spare emotive force.The title of the film (Conviction) works on two levels: on its simplest way, it speaks about the conviction of an accused man which is more based on his personality and reputation than in the investigation of facts and examination of evidence. And on a deeper way, it describes the strong conviction which impulsed his sister for years in order to prove his innocence. The axis of the film is obviously the crusade of the woman for justice; but what I find most interesting about the film is her personal evolution, starting as an insecure girl from the town and ending as a strong woman who believes in herself and is consent of all the things she sacrificed in order to fulfill the moral debt she feels with her brother.And the credit of that mainly belongs to Hilary Swank, who brings an excellent performance in that role. Swank took an absolute possession of her character and she "dissapears" into it without falling into the exaggerations and histrionic juggling the Oscars like so much. The rest of the cast also makes a solid work, from the great Sam Rockwell to Minnie Driver, without forgetting Melissa Leo and Juliette Lewis. But the movie belongs to Swank, and her hypnotic presence is definitely one of the best attributes from Conviction.I also liked the sober emotional balance from the screenplay, along with its discipline of sticking to the facts without using unnecessary drama. The complains I have against this movie is that a few parts feel kinda dull, and that the ending looses some force. However, that does not avoid me from recommending Conviction as a very solid film with many positive elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conviction is A Magnificent Obsession ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilary Swank turned in another power-house performance. Her common personality is even more impressive than Erin Brockovich's.Based on a true story, Swank goes to bat for her brother, convicted of murder. They both come from a family that defies the term dysfunctional. In fact, it puts the latter term into new dimensions.It's hard to believe that Swank went to law school to get her degree so that she could help her maligned brother, Sam Rockwell, in a great performance as well.The film shows how one has to combat a justice system which is often designed to be against all concerned. Along the way, she covers corruption and a massive cover-up.Directed by Tony Goldwyn, who was so good in "Ghost" as the killer. Tony has now moved behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood is really losing Reality!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would certainly not give the highest of rankings to Conviction as a movie but as a subject it is the most inspiring.I have surfed internet about the real life characters of the movie and certainly there were a lot of missing things or subjects which could've created a little bit interest in the audience about the movie.I am not a person who follows a movie from start to the ultimate end. Start being considered as watching trailers and finding out about the story and characters of the movie. Conviction was recommended to me by my brother as he said that Hilary swank gave a rocking performance and you should check this movie out and surprisingly he didn't give any remarks about the story and theme of the movie.So i picked this movie after about 6 months of recommendation and guess what it was really emotional and inspiring.Nowadays most of the movies are based on fantasies and there is really the discussion as to which movie have better graphics and action.But conviction is a movie which is based on real happenings and thats what really matters in our daily lives. i mean a sister sacrificing so many years just to prove his brother innocent. We don't hear a lot of stories like this in our daily life.I mean i have read people crapping about the story on the internet.It's just they don't get it.They don't get what relationships mean to a human being in real life.A similar movie to this which i have watched before is The Hurricane, which was also an inspirational one.And i have greatly observed that the justice system just really sucked as they have convicted a person and ruined his life based on people's hunches.I don't think we are suppose to give opinions about the most of what i have written here but i just feel like that people should know that there is just way too much more to a movie than entertainment.In the end i will say that Sam Rockwell and Hilary Swank rocked as they both are on of my favorite actors. i didn't even knew that Sam Rockwell was in the movie after i have watched it.The movie should have nominated for some Oscars as it is way more better that The Social Network,which is based on the life of a person who is a billionaire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a real story, a younger sister works untiringly to prove her brother's innocence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is based on real people, a brother/sister team of rascals in Massachusetts. They were inseparable as kids, and got into small troubles all the time growing up, partially because of an uncaring mom, and partly because they happen to be rascals.Hilary Swank is the grown up high-school dropout Betty Anne Water, working at a bar. Her grown up brother is Sam Rockwell as Kenny Waters. Kenny gets into scrapes, nothing real serious, but gets local law enforcement riled up at him. When a woman is found murdered, clues lead to Kenny, he is arrested, tried, and convicted with several very incriminating testimonies.Betty Ann doesn't believe Kenny is guilty, but after appeals seems at a dead end. But she makes a bold move, she decides to get her GED, then enroll in college with the intention of becoming a lawyer. She had no desire to practice law, she wanted only to use it as a way to get Kenny out of prison.Minnie Driver is good with her best Boston accent as fellow law school student Abra Rice, who becomes a friend of Betty Anne's and helps her in her quest.The DVD extra includes an interview with the real Betty Ann. That was worthwhile watching. SPOILERS: Her almost fanatical devotion to her brother came with a cost. It resulted in her marriage break-up and her two young boys going to live with their dad for a while. But she never gave up, even when told all the evidence from 16 years earlier had been destroyed per department policy. But persistence paid off, she did manage to locate the box of evidence, and was able to use modern DNA analysis to exclude Kenny as a possible perpetrator. But she still had to get sworn statements from some trial witnesses who confirmed they had been pressured by the then administration to testify against Kenny. He was released, but in a tragic irony died about 6 months later in an automobile accident.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Conviction is an conventional movie but made all the better because of the female performances.This is in fact an all too rare Hollywood movie because the driving force and perspective is from a woman's point of view. It helps the the script is written by a woman, Pamela Gray. The direction by Tony Goldwyn is fair yet unremarkable.The real joy of this movie is watching the female cast do their thing. Hilary Swank is convincing in her role of determined and loving sister. Minnie Driver is excellent as the loyal friend.Melissa Leo gives a brilliant performance in very few scenes and absolutely nails the crucial part. Clea DuVall is superb in her small role as is Juliet Lewis.It is refreshing to see woman actors that are real and unaltered. Each face has a history, unmarked by the disturbing Hollywood fashion for cosmetic surgery.Conviction is an actors film. There is what some could call a "familiar" story but it is enlivened by the ensemble cast and the thoroughly committed performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing Drama with Competent Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard some good things about the movie "Conviction", and actually after 20 min or so recalled reading the real story it was based on. This sort of put a damper on the viewing experience as I more-or-less knew the outcome, but it was still a good view. Directed by Tony Goldwyn whom I later recognized as the actor playing the villain in Ghost, does a good job to focus on the brother-sister bond that is so strong and well- defined. This really anchors the film well. Especially Sam Rockwell but also Hillary Swank are up to the task. Supporting role from Minnie Driver and Peter Gallagher help round out a very competent group of veteran actors. Movies based on true stories always seem to be a little dearer to the viewers heart as they are not all make-believe. This was a good watch, recommended and worth a viewing.</fullReview>

She has to manage her family ,do part time job as waitress,goes to law college ,study the case,dig out hidden facts and finally get release her brother .The director has tried his level to give the best, without giving chance for contravention.No body in the movie has overplayed.This being a real incident any criticism about any character will blemish the image of real hero/heroine.I really salute the real sister.I believe that this real sister still continue to fight for the release of innocent prisoners.Good job done by the production team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When her brother is convicted of a crime which he didn't do and goes to jail for life without parole, a sister devote her life to become a lawyer and get him out of prison. Simple this may sounds it takes 18 years to complete. And that's the 'Conviction'. And behold this is not just a sugar coated tear breaking drama of fiction but true life events that does a better job than fiction.Hillary Swank plays the sister (Betty Ann Waters) who is married with two teenage sons and husband separated just for the very reason of her obsession of getting her brother out of jail which ultimately hits the balance of her family. Swank does a commendable job in the role showing off her brutal ability of portraying woman with courage once again after her Oscar winning 'Million Dollar Baby' in 2004.Sam Rockwell plays the brother (Kenny Waters) who is a small time felon back home, always getting in to trouble where ever he goes and first choice of the police department when something goes wrong in that small town. But for sure when he was convicted of a brutal murder he had nothing to do with it but had no choice but to go behind bars for the rest of his life. Sam somehow has this thing for crooks and prison roles which I loved from the time he played Wild Bill in the 'Green Mile' (1999). And this time he is a convicted murderer with a heart that he well plays.Just as the plot is very touching and extraordinary the story telling itself is well done. Starting from the scene of the murder back in 1980 and swing back and forth with the lives of Betty and Kenny it gives a vast understanding of changing times and hardships both has to go though to reach their ultimate goal.And the building up of characters which is a severe element in this kind of movies is brilliantly done. If not you might actually won't feel the weight on Betty Ann's chest and the relief and gratitude on Kenny mind.Read my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Human beings are capable of doing great things and often many atrocities. Conviction is a sign of great love that Betty feels for his brother Kenny who is imprisoned unjustly. Betty then chooses the hard way, with one end, out of jail. Hilary Swank's interpretation has merit, much like Melissa Leo, awarded at the last Oscars. Conviction forcefully denounces the judgments of the American judicial system, imprisoning innocent people with false testimony and corrupt cops move by ignoble purposes. Conviction looks like a TV movie but it's the best female performances, a story with great force, his spirit of denunciation that makes it advisable to recommend a movie.</fullReview>

What surprised us most is that it doesn't just aim to push the buttons (though it does) but rather leaves space for doubt and drama.Most of all it is a memorable film that lingers after - the performances, the sense of justice, the fight to see that justice out are strong here - and it would make a great film to show to teenagers (Though the murder scene is pretty grim).If you like films based on real events (Like Erin Brockovich) you will enjoy this: it is well made, well acted, and a fascinating look at how drive and determination can, against all odds, sometimes win...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is based on an interesting true story , and could have made a good movie. . Unfortunately, it quickly devolves into a lifetime network cliché.Basically, a hard luck white trash family becomes even unluckier when one of the brothers is falsely accused and convicted of murder. Hillary Swank reprieves her role as a poorly educated but not too dumb white trasher, good looking but evidently too poor for orthodontic care.The film has high rent cinematography , but low brow script writing. This is demonstrated early on when , yes, an adult male insults a child, and is promptly beaten to a pulp. This transpires at a wedding reception where a man questions the wisdom of bringing a small child to a rowdy, white trash jamboree. Sam Rockwell, all 170 lbs of him, instantly beats the guy, nearly popping his head like a zit. A toothy swank looks on, smiling like a mutant hyena.It's not that the above scene is a Lifetime Channel cliché, it's that ALL the scenes are. Swank puts her life on hold to defend her brother, getting her GED and a law school degree from some matchbook degree mill. In spite of her disadvantaged background, she is smarter than every man the legal system has ever produced. Major credibility problems, even for the Oxygen Network crowd. They are usually satisfied by simplistic "woman better than men" stories but this one is silly even for them.Hillary Swank has made a career out of these kind of roles, and her "unusual " appearance has simultaneously attracted and puzzled audiences for years. I once heard her humble brag about not having health insurance when she got her first Oscar. I hope she can afford a dental plan now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an amazing film, and is made truly special in it exceptional acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was essentially a film about someone brother being falsely accused, and a woman's struggle to try to prove her brothers innocence. The film was excellently portrayed not lingering to much on the emotional side and instead focused more on the story, which was interesting as the subject can be seen as more emotional. However the nature of the convict played by Sam Rockwell, showed a happy and sort of borderline outrageous man who really was a bit of a joker, and so any scenes with him in were sure to brighten the mood. Rockwell did also excellently portray sadness, so he was not always a joker type person which helped to keep the tone of the film.The sister character played by Hillary Swank was played exceedingly well, even in the situation, which is a woman spending a large proportion of their life to prove someone else's innocence, its really quite amazing, however Swank really did carry the film through, and was emotional enough without becoming eccentric.Other characters were kind of underplayed but were crucial, such as the role of the two sons, who showed the viewer how much of Swank's characters life, had been spent on this case but without becoming melodramatic, that other films often show. Instead this film was more realistic in its viewing of the story.The character of the best friend played by Minnie Driver was also crucial, my only criticism being that this character kind of became irrelevant about half way through the film, and this character just followed Swank around for the rest of the film, and when the eventual conclusion came they were nowhere to be seen and at the very end you just wonder what happens now.Apart form my one criticism I really enjoyed this film, It gave a realistic view of a difficult situation, especially as the case was a real life case. The main was this was done is in the films incredible acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1983, Kenny is convicted of the bloody murder of an elderly neighbor largely on the basis of testimony from two former girlfriends, both of whom claimed he confessed his actions to them. Neither Kenny nor Betty Anne can afford a good attorney, so she decides to become a lawyer even though she's a high school dropout. Also serving as one of the film's executive producers, Swank come back securely to the against-all-odds territory of Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" (2004) by following Betty Ann's sixteen-year journey from her GED through college, then law school, and finally passing the bar ? all while she was raising two boys and working part-time at a local pub. The ending is predictable from a mile away, but the journey is not. The introduction of DNA evidence provides a linchpin that spins the story close to Lifetime-level dramatics, especially when Betty Ann solicits the assistance of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization devoted to overturning wrongful convictions. Gray's screenplay is solid enough, and Goldwyn's direction is assured within the back-and-forth treatment of the timeline.However, it's really the acting that is aces here. Beyond Swank's sterling work, Sam Rockwell brings an unpredictable furor and a surprising vulnerability to the showier role of Kenny. His rapport with Swank never feels forced, and the devotion of their sibling relationship is what really grounds the threat of hysterics in the film. The periphery is populated by a powerful squad of actresses turning in sharply etched work - Minnie Driver as Betty Ann's law-school friend Abra, whose comic spark highlights how pivotal her character is in representing the audience viewpoint; Melissa Leo ("Frozen River") as the malevolent arresting cop, whose secretive hostility provides the impetus for Kenny's conviction; Juliette Lewis as Kenny's dentally-challenged ex-girlfriend with a drunken confession scene that reveals the actress's long-forgotten raw talent below her usual giddiness; Karen Young in a brief scene as the unforgivable Mrs. Waters; and Ari Graynor ("Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist") as Kenny's embittered grown daughter. It's the cast's cumulative work that makes this movie intensely watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>16 years after her brother was convicted of first degree murder, his sister, a divorced waitress with two kids, passes the bar exam and officially becomes her sibling's attorney, ready to take on the heel-dragging Massachusettes justice system and fully exonerate him at any cost. Well-produced, well-intentioned legal drama-cum-star vehicle (fashioned for its executive producer, Hilary Swank) has artificial spirit and courage, along with some puzzling and unanswered questions surrounding the gruesome killing in question. The victim, a German woman who was robbed, beaten, and stabbed in her own home, arouses no curiosity or sympathy from the filmmakers--this is strictly a showcase for the leading lady, who keeps flashing her thousand-watt smile. There are moving moments, along with excellent supporting performances from Minnie Driver, Melissa Leo, and Juliette Lewis; but accented Swank (attempting a nonchalant tour-de-force) appears to become a lawyer in the amount of time it takes most people to get through high school. Her character's hurdles are interesting--and the passage of time is neatly executed--but there are no real surprises here. The based-on-fact movie-formula seems ready to curdle. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a motivation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I've been fighting for my brother's case, someone told me about this movie. After reading the plot and watching the trailer, I couldn't help bursting into tears. Is it gonna be me and my brother next??? Right now I'm still in Pharmacy school, not Law school like Betty Anne Waters, and I've been swamped with exam after exam, thus I haven't got a chance to watch this movie in person yet. Of course it will be the first thing I do after midterms. However, again, I'm still fighting for my brother's innocence in the meantime. Fighting the system is something beyond my plan of life, but this movie has given me the motivation that I need more than ever. Thank you, director Tony Goldwyn and writer Pamela Gray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought for sure the brother was the killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He never once said ( correct me if I am wrong), "I did not kill her." They made him look guilty the whole movie,and it was not as if had he been shouting he was innocent from the rooftops that would have made the audience believe him. BUT why make him seem so guilty the entire time. Granted he had been screwed by the system and had every right to feel like it would happen again, but then when Swank wants him to take a test he acts all nuts and does not want to take it. He did not act shocked the first time he was accused of murder by the female police officer, and instead joked around about how good she looked. You would think no matter how many times a person had gotten in trouble, this accusation would have shook them to the core. Maybe I am missing something here, why make an innocent man look so incredibly guilty?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar material, sadly overlooked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top performances from Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell, Minnie Driver and Peter Gallagher; also good performances by Bailee Madison and Tobias Campbell who played the young Betty Anne and Kenny Waters. The movie will not leave you indifferent for two reasons: The true story is moving and the movie delivers admirably the sentiments and passion of the characters. It is not a romantic story; it's a drama, by any definition. However, I have not seen love so strongly projected nor passion conveyed as well as this film does. Tony Goldwyn worked out the right formula to make you understand the bond between the main characters. If you liked the "Winters Bone" movie for its poignant depiction, take note that this one is as good and should have merited a nomination for best actress. It's not a fun or entertaining film, it's simply a good movie, a really good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a lot better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew the story, had seen it on the news shows and Oprah. But with the ratings post on IMDb (my most trusted source for reviews), I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see a deeper look at this story of a failed justice system and sibling loyalty as portrayed by Sam Rockwell and Hilary Swank. Unfortunately the film never reaches the level of talent its actors provide. Simply put, there wasn't enough character development that would provide the basis for me to care about these people and the ghastly circumstances that began unfolding in their lives once Watters was arrested and charged. Why was this man singled out and what were the motivations that led the police to "frame" him for murder. The only touching and real scenes for me were the ones toward the end of the film with the daughter Mandy and her revelation that she had been lied to by her mother for so many years.Just left me wanting to know more details and more of the "true" story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Hilary sad-sack story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is described as "inspirational", "brave", "a triumph of brotherly love" etc? But putting such boasting statements aside, it is a very American tale of someone overcoming huge difficulties and ending as a winner of some sort.Hilary Swank is specialized in playing white-trash characters hoping for ? and hardly ever finding ? a better life. Refreshingly, in this movie, she has a brother who is trashier than she is. Therefore, I was hoping the great Sam Rockwell could perform the miracle to elevate this movie from the usual Hillary sad-sack story into something more thrilling. Unfortunately, this is not such miracle. It is the story of a very unhappy family with nine children and a trashy mother ? two of those children growing up wild and loose, committing petty crimes. Then Kenny ? played by Rockwell ? graduates into big crime, allegedly murdering and robbing a neighbor. It is never clear whether he committed the crime, even if it seemed quite likely.Despite evidence against him, his sister Betty played by Swank, embarks in a crazy crusade to prove his innocence. Based on nothing else than her belief in his innocent. She studies to become a lawyer, while at the same time destroying her own marriage and personal life. Very stubbornly (and rather selfishly) Betty pursues her only goal, tramping over the lives of her husband and children.Finally, Kenny is acquitted, mainly because DNA tests of the evidence cast doubt on his conviction. But it is a far cry from stating he was innocent. His acquittal belongs to the dubious realm of guilt (or innocence) which cannot be proved or disproved.Anyway, guilty or innocent, he is portrayed as an utterly unpleasant character and not much more pleasant is his sister Betty. Stubborn, unreasonable, narrow-minded, self-righteous she is made of weird stuff for a heroines. In the end, it is very hard to feel much sympathy either for her or her brother, despite the fact she made it through college for such a narrow goal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More self serving than drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I find myself agreeing with the general sway of view reviews here on IMDb but not in this case. This is all the more unusual as I am a fan of Law and Order type movies and (like most of the free world) left of center on the America penal system. Story line points aside Swank and Rockwell are very good and play off each other wonderfully in this film. So why am I not raving about this movie? Well for a start it makes an obvious effort to 'tell the facts' even if that kills momentum, it places the history it wants to record ahead of the drama. There are a few times during the movie when I found myself asking 'why did they bother telling me that?' when it was obvious the film makers wanted me to know something that had little to do with the story being told at that particular moment on screen. Later when reading around the story online the reasons became clearer. I do not know how much of the real story was lost in translation to screen play and I do not know how much was altered to suit individual family members. I do know that if you ignore the 'based on a true story' and simply view this as entertainment giving it 6 out of 10 is more than generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a Realistic Legal Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a practicing attorney with substantial trial and appellate experience, I usually hate movies and shows about law, especially the courtroom scenes. Directors often "Hollywoodize" compelling and exciting real-life cases, "dumbing down" the American legal system, and adding unnecessary dramatic factors that actually result in making them cheesy, hokey, or outright ridiculous. Moreover, these Hollywood court scenes mislead the American public about how our courts work. Of course, if you are not a lawyer, you may not care much until the next time you're on your soapbox ranting about how Casey Anthony got one over on our "broken" legal system; but try to imagine being a football fan and watching a movie in which the heroic team scores a 10-point touchdown to win the game.Rockwell's hopelessness when Swank visits him in jail, and Swank's attempts to inspire hope and refusal to cut his last lifeline, are nothing short of brilliant. The whole cast, for that matter, is top- notch, and delivers an outstanding performance throughout. Ele Bardha did not have many speaking lines, but his non-verbal performance was textbook.This film is only based on a true story, and not a documentary, so it's obviously not 100% representative of the real Waters case. However, the movie is very realistic, and relies on its compelling story and convincing actors, rather than Hollywood courtroom gimmicks. This is one of my favorite legal movies, and I plan to research the actual case further. Anyone who has dreamed of going to law school to fight injustice should see this movie, as should anyone who is fascinated by the law. Attorneys should keep a copy of this film in their collections, and put it on every once in a while when they need a reminder of why they "crossed the bar" in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Goldwyn's Conviction is superb. From the finely interwoven screenplay, through the wonderful cinematography, casting and script, to the brilliant performances of the cast, this film is a work of art. Perhaps like many true life event based movies the film needed a strong dose of conviction from the leads played compellingly by Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell and Minnie Driver with versatility demonstrated in different ways. Juliette Lewis also provides a sharply drawn appearance. Conviction does not have high spots because even when the story is dragging along at the bottom line of desperation in the pursuit of justice there is something happening to convince you we are going to get there somehow no matter what.And Conviction always leaves room for doubt. Doubt that Betty Anne is going to survive the journey intact. Doubt that Kenny may be too far gone to save. Doubt that Abra is going to stick to the middle road and raise spirits enough to give the search for justice a chance.Through the screenplay of Conviction we see the narrow politics of power at many levels but it is the blood of a family which takes this film to its heights. It is an emotional journey because that is what family is about.A must see film.Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful drama based on a true story? A woman becomes a lawyer to prove her brother's innocence of murder?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew very little about this film before seeing it, in fact I almost gave it a pass as I knew nothing of the case it's about either. No surprise there really, I don't think it even featured in news bulletins here in the UK. Needless to say, it's based on a true story; a powerful drama about a sister who refuses to believe her brother is guilty of murder. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary.When Kenny Waters is charged with the brutal murder of a woman in 1982 the evidence, plus testimonies from the police and two of his former lovers, are enough to convict him. His sister, Betty Anne Waters, refuses to believe his guilt and sacrifices her marriage and a big chunk of her life to go to law school so she can prove it. There she is befriended by fellow student, Abra Rice, who supports her in her crusade. She eventually passes the bar exam and, as a qualified lawyer, is free to find the evidence that might clear her brother. By now many years have passed and DNA evidence is now permissible in court, but how to locate the original evidence and also get the witnesses to tell the truth? Well, I'll leave you with that burning question or the Spoiler Police will be fabricating evidence against me (again).Quite well made with some flashback sequences that (for me) didn't really work. They seemed to be thrown in at random and only served to break up the flow of the storyline rather than enhance it I'm afraid. Very powerful performances from both Hilary Swank as Betty Anne Waters and Sam Rockwell as Kenny Waters. Honourable mentions must also go to; Minnie Driver as Abra Rice, Melissa Leo as Nancy Taylor, Juliette Lewis as Roseanna Perry and Peter Gallagher as Barry Scheck.Although it's quite an inspirational story I'm afraid I found it hard to warm to any of the characters, particularly that of Kenny Waters. I agree that he did not deserve to go to jail, but I didn't find much sympathy for him; particularly when he's shown beating a guy up for suggesting that a bar is maybe not the best place to bring his baby daughter. Of course it's alright in the end because he offers to buy the guy a drink! There is obviously a very strong bond between brother and sister forged from them being brought up in foster homes. I know some will draw great inspiration from this film, but for me, sadly, I didn't enjoy it all that much. I will still deem it recommend though, but mainly for the performances.My score: 6.6/10.IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 14,849 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 68/100 (based on 174 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

		<fullReview>And it tells me, that the movie is good. It may be cliché-ridden to a point that might seem unbearable to some. But the actors elevate the movie above that. And while I'm not a fan of the "based on a true story" (or facts or whatever it is they write in front of the movie), this one has a strong story to tell.And while I don't agree with another reviewer that Sam Rockwell needs to be recognized (with this movie), because he is known and respected by his peers and the audience has come to know him very well now. Confessions ... and Moon are just two of the higher profile pics he did in recent years that earned him a status for the viewing audience. The industry insiders knew him and adored him way before that. But it's not only him, on the contrary. It is Hillary Swank again. And it's Juliette Lewis and Minnie Driver. The movie might play out the way, you kinda expect it, but it still is very emotional all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Admirable Performance By Hilary Swank In A Somewhat Plodding Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admired Hilary Swank's performance in this. I don't say that lightly because I've had very mixed reactions to her work over the years and have no real expectations when I watch one of her movies. But she was quite good in the role of Betty Ann Waters, a working class mom (and ultimately a working class single mom) who sees her brother convicted of a brutal murder, is convinced of his innocence, and with no other way forward commits herself to the daunting task of getting a law degree in order to take his case and exonerate him, eventually by the use of DNA evidence, and by getting some of the original witnesses to recant their testimony. That this is fact based makes me admire not just Swank's performance, but the real Betty Ann Waters' tenacity. Swank demonstrated that, sometimes adopting a frighteningly obsessive look that is vaguely chilling - as if nothing (not even her own kids) matters as much to her as getting her brother out of jail. She seems willing to sacrifice it all to pull this off. It is a somewhat chilling performance, my admittedly negative gut reaction to her tempered somewhat by the knowledge that she's right - her brother was innocent. Swank also played well with the rest of the cast, and especially with Sam Rockwell as the wrongfully convicted brother.Strangely, though, for a movie based fairly solidly on real-life, the story itself didn't pull me in particularly strongly. I kept watching because Swank was good, not because the story was particularly interesting. Watching Betty Ann struggle with law school, then watching the search for evidence didn't really make for either good drama or good suspense. It seemed like a long, plodding story - even though its runtime is less than two hours. It's strength, though, is in the performances - especially that of Hilary Swank. It's definitely one of her better performances. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film with outstanding performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a great movie based on a real story, that on the hands of a TV channel would be just a forgettable good TV movie but on the talented hands of former actor Tony Goldwyn becomes a great film with memorable performances and a wonderful storytelling to make you inspired and involved. Hilary Swank plays Betty Ann, a woman who believes that her brother Kenny (Sam Rockwell) was wrongly convicted for the murder of a woman and Betty decides to prove his innocence. Her move is to go to a Law School, work hard and become a lawyer, the rest is entirely her strength, persistence and power to make whatever she can to free Kenny, even if that may ruin her life with husband and children to look after. The twists and turn of this story are perfectly presented, everything is well made, looks very consistent and in the end what you have besides being a outstanding drama is the importance of never give up on things no matter how difficult they are. But people want to see films like this even with all the inspiring observations made? Most people wouldn't go see it, but they should and if not for that at least for what the great cast does here. This is a brilliant place for Swank and Rockwell show their talents, both outstanding actors giving their best performances (as usual) and you believe in their characterizations, their relation as brothers. Minnie Driver as spectacular as well as Betty's friend, and Julitte Lewis has many good moments as one of Kenny's accusers. "Conviction" made an relevant study about how the Judicial system works and how circumstantial evidences or the lack of them changes drastic realities between being innocent or guilty of a crime, and here there's the whole thing about Kenny being convicted in a time where DNA tests weren't made and Betty uses that to make her case, years later. An really captivating film and a real must see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama of sister's quest to have imprisoned brother exonerated, proves to be a mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Conviction' is one of those true stories that on the surface appear to be made for the movies. Hillary Swank plays Betty Anne Waters who went to law school, not to pursue a career but for one reason alone: free her brother who was falsely imprisoned for 18 years on the charge of first degree murder. In a series of flashbacks, we soon learn the sad story of Betty Anne's brother, Kenny, who was blamed for the murder of a local woman two years earlier, in the small town of Ayer, Massachusetts in 1980. Director Tony Goldwyn wisely doesn't sugarcoat Kenny, who has a nasty temper and is not always that likable. In one of the best scenes in the film, Kenny gets into a verbal argument with a man in a bar, while holding his infant daughter in his arms. He hands his daughter to the child's mother and then proceeds to punch the man in the face who falls to the floor; Kenny then brandishes a broken beer bottle over the fallen man's face and threatens to kill him. Soon afterward, he parades around the bar reassuring everyone that everything's okay and then gets up on the stage and moons the audience, who all appear (including sister Betty Anne) thoroughly amused.While we see in another flashback the reason why Betty Anne remains loyal to Kenny even after he's convicted of murder (as children they were painfully separated and sent to foster care), it soon becomes obvious that the discerning film goer has little reason to sympathize with the surly Kenny, except for the fact that he's an innocent man who's imprisoned for life. Sam Rockwell is quite convincing as bad boy Kenny but once he's locked up, he has little to do except have bitter conversations with his sister and occasionally tussle with the correction officer, who's in the room overseeing the siblings' jail house t?te-?-t?te.'Conviction' reaches its highest point of interest during the courtroom scene where the false testimony of Kenny's two ex-girlfriends along with a corrupt police officer, Sgt. Nancy Taylor (played by a steely Melissa Leo), seals his fate. Then its downhill until the denouement, where the slow pacing and awkwardness of the plot undermine the overall narrative. Ostensibly, Betty Anne went to law school singularly to free her brother. But in reality, she hardly uses any of her legal skills to get Kenny off the hook. There is no dramatic courtroom scene where Betty Anne, acting as her brother's counsel, goes toe to toe with a determined prosecutor and saves the day, presenting her closing argument to a jury. Instead, while she's in law school, she merely learns about DNA testing and Barry Scheck's Innocence Project (which she could have found out about, merely by doing some research at the local library).Betty Ann is next pitted against a series of unassuming antagonists: courtroom and police office workers who fail to put much effort into finding a box containing all the evidence from Kenny's trial. After repeated tries, Betty Ann hits pay dirt after buttering up a court clerk and running into a sympathetic police officer who remembers Kenny from his first year on the force. Betty Ann's domestic problems which include her husband leaving her and her teenage sons' decision to live with the father, are dull subplots that take us away from arriving at the happy resolution.'Conviction' picks up again when Betty Ann, accompanied by her law school buddy Abra Rice (well-played by Minnie Driver), team up with Barry Scheck and extract a signed confession from Kenny's ex-wife, who reveals that she committed perjury after Sgt. Taylor threatened to have her daughter taken away from her. After Kenny is exonerated by DNA evidence and the ex-wife's affidavit is presented in court, Kenny is released from prison. Taylor, however, cannot be tried, as the statute of limitations has run out.Much is made in the film about Kenny's reconciliation with his estranged daughter Mandy, who was not allowed to communicate with her father due to the ex-wife preventing any kind of communication between the two, while Kenny was incarcerated. In researching the true story the film was based on, I couldn't find any information about a daughter and I presume this character was invented in order to enhance the narrative.I've never been much of a fan of Hillary Swank as she has always struck me as a cold fish. Here again she's unable to exude the requisite warmth, reflective of Betty Ann's personality. On the other hand, Swank, more a driven character type, ably conveys Betty Ann's cold obsession in attempting to free her brother.'Conviction' is not always exciting or dramatic in parts and would have probably been better off as a made-for-TV movie. But it's also an interesting, offbeat tale, presumably with a happy ending, based on true events. In reality, director Goldwyn deemed it irrelevant to reveal what actually happened to Kenny in real life. Five days before 9/11 and six months after he was released from prison, while taking a short cut home, Kenny feel off a 15 foot wall, hit his head and died a couple of weeks later, with Betty Anne at his side. While the case initially brought against Kenny remains unsolved, the culprit leading to Kenny's ultimate demise is easily discerned: Bad Karma!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film inspired me to stop being lazy and actually write a review for the first time. If I had to choose one word to describe this film, it would be "touching." The character development was solid, the acting was superb. Everything was so well done and I found myself choking up at least 3 times during the film. Granted, I can be an emotional guy, but I haven't been moved by a film like this in a very long time.The film got me to thinking about my own sister or even any one of my family members. Would you sacrifice almost 20 years of your life towards proving a family members' innocence? It's sad to say, but I don't think it's as common as it should be! Hilary Swank did such a great job at convincing me that it never crossed her mind NOT to do it. This quality must be so extremely rare in a person.If you have a heart and you're willing to open it up and let this film touch you, you won't be let down. If you're trying to act tough around your girl, maybe you should watch something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hillary Swank once again gives another wonderful performance. The movie was OK, but needed more drama and to be a little bit shorter for it to be really good. Swank, plays Betty Anne Waters, whom decides to fight for her brother, Kenny, when he is sentenced to life in prison for murder. She basically gives up her life to become a lawyer and along the way apparently sacrifices her own family since she gets divorced and even her own kids don't want to live with her. She teams up with fellow law student, Abra. Once they pass the bar she finds the evidence from her brother's trial that was supposed to be destroyed. And using DNA tests and getting witnesses to admit their lies, she is able to prove her brother's case.What I didn't like is that her brother doesn't really seem to be all that grateful for her efforts and never even professes his innocence. I'm sure is the movie had told his whole story, we would probably learn he wasn't a choir boy.FINAL VERDICT: A little long but worth watching for Swank's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did she spend her life pursuing this yearning at the cost of her own family for nothing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Betty Waters a waitress /law student/mum, kind of like a superwoman on her own, Kenny a lovable guy, good dad and decent husband. Kenny and Betty are siblings who grew up thick as thieves even after they grew up. Leading happy lives amidst all hardships, same as any middle class family in society, Kenny a lovable but a tough guy has a temper; a temper leads him into a confession during an argument with his wife. Fast forward a few years and that confession he made gets him arrested on the day of his grandfather's funeral. The authority disrespectfully, walks up the isle during the funeral service in church arrests Kenny Waters disrupting the entire service and disrespecting the dead( taken out of true incidents this is a shocking revelation of how the law enforcements back in the day was in the state of Massachusetts). Kenny is tried for the murder of Katharina Brown and is found guilty of first degree murder and is sentenced for life. The state of Massachusetts not having the death penalty at that point of time saves him the death sentence. Betty who loves her brother dearly believes him and that he was unjustly sentenced for a crime he did not commit and pursues and appeals however loses again. Betty who is fanatical over her brothers freedom works her way through law school and passes the bar exams and becomes a qualified attorney and represents her own brother in another struggle to save him from his sentence and reunite him with his family, sadly she finds out that all the evidence that are over 10 years old is destroyed in the state of Massachusetts. Did she spend her life pursuing this yearning at the cost of her own family for nothing?Based on a true story "Conviction" is a wonderful story that has very profound issues discussed in it. Academy award winner Hillary Swank is outright convincing as the exasperated Betty Waters and she really works up the emotions in the viewer and gets us to relate with her emotions of a sister who is fighting for her brothers' freedom. She puts her life on hold for Kenny, which does not seem fair from one perspective since she is giving priority to her brother and not her kids, in a perfect world this is quite infrequent, but we should not forget this amazing story did happen in reality and Hillary Swank really lives it through. Minnie Driver who plays Abraham who turns out to be Bettys' only friend from law college does a good convincing job as well, although her character did not really have to pull any heavy weight. Sam Rockwell (Sam the Man!)...... What can I say; I am surprised that this man has not won an Oscar yet, not even a nod. He is just on the game all the time, the love, the laughter, the anger, the pain, the misery, the depression, he nails it on! He is so switched on and is flawless. I love watching this man at arduous portrayals as this. How do you spend 16 years in jail? Sam Rockwell is just the actor, but imagines the real Kenneth Waters who watched his whole life pass by in that cell. Who was in prison knowing that he will never see his daughter Mandy again? The days he will never get back, its true justice that this movie was picked up by director Tony Goldwyn and made known to the world.; isn't it? If this is the USA that boasts equality and lush humans' rights, how many more people must be unjustly sentenced and how many would be exonerated in countries where the infrastructure alone cannot hold a proper system of law?

This connection makes the movie more interesting as it gives the viewer a chance to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of the system. More importantly it shows the resolve of a sister to seek justice no matter what the cost. The movie shows how a sister uses her conviction that her brother is innocent to wage a long drawn fight to overturn his conviction.

		<shortDescription>Sibling Devotion: Stepping Up To The Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONVICTION is based on a true story, a fact that affects us in many ways: 1) that Pamela Gray created such a fine script without becoming maudlin or overbearing, 2) that a commitment and love between two abused siblings can be so strong as to overcome all odds in their rocky life, and 3) that our judicial system is so flawed that innocent people are imprisoned without a regular chance for recourse. All of this comes together in this striking film that actor turned director Tony Goldwyn makes so compelling. Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) and her older brother Kenny (Sam Rockwell) are shown in flashbacks to have been neglected and abused children, placed in numerous foster homes by their incompetent mother (Karen Young) and the two siblings are very close, participating in pranks that eventually lead Kenny into situations that require police intervention. They both marry and have children, but Kenny is abruptly arrested one day and accused of a brutal murder and robbery by lone female police officer Nancy Taylor (Melissa Leo). Not able to afford a lawyer Kenny is convicted on circumstantial evidence and sentenced to life without parole. Betty Anne is devastated, convinced of Kenny's innocence, and after attempts to alter Kenny's fate she realizes the only way she can afford a lawyer is to become one. A waitress by day, this high school dropout finishes school and college and enters law school against the wishes husband Ben (Owen Campbell): Betty Anne essentially sacrifices her life (including an ultimate divorce and separation from her two boys) to become an attorney. In law school she gains a friend in Abra Rice (Minnie Driver) and together they work to find a means to free Kenny (Kenny in desperation attempts suicide in prison and Betty Anne extracts a promise from him that he will never attempt that again or her work for him will all be in vain). Through years of investigating dead ends Betty Anne gains the support and advice from New York lawyer Barry Scheck (Peter Gallagher) who defends victims of the court system, but Betty Ann must find DNA evidence that would exonerate Kenny: the case is now 16 years old and she is told all evidence has been destroyed. The struggle to find 'destroyed evidence' and then present that to the courts proves a near impossible task - especially when Kenny refuses to have his DNA checked 'because it may match the blood from the crime'. Despite all impediments Betty Anne and Abra continue, uncovering startling facts that keep the story alive right to the last minute of the film. Hilary Swank is astonishingly fine as the indomitable Betty Anne as is Sam Rockwell as Kenny. But this is a cast so well selected that there is not a weak link: rather, each actor no matter how minor their role turns in splendid performances. Juliette Lewis has a stunning cameo as a seedy ex-girlfriend of Kenny, Clea Duvall is the gritty wife of Kenny, Bailee Madison and Tobias Campbell play Betty Anne and Kenny as children, Ari Graynor as Kenny's grownup daughter Mandy, and of course the above mentioned Melissa Leo and Minnie Driver in well- developed central roles. The film is raw, painful to watch because of the situations involved, but in the end it is one of the finest examples of the triumph of the human spirit on film. Highly Recommended.

		<shortDescription>Powerful true story about a man wrongly convicted and the woman trying to free him. Very inspirational and moving. I say A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true story about a sister (Swank) knowing that her brother (Rockwell) who is prison for murder is innocent and fighting to prove it. Two years after being questioned and let go in a murder case Kenny Waters (Rockwell) is convicted and is sent away for life. Knowing that he is innocent Betty Anne Waters (Swank) attends law school in order to become her brothers lawyer. This is one powerful movie. I've always thought that Sam Rockwell is a very underrated actor and in this movie he gives a powerful performance. The fact that this is a true story makes this movie all the more inspiring, moving and gut wrenching. This is a must see and I don't want to give anything away, but this movie explores and exposes the flaws in the legal system. This movie is a roller-coaster ride of emotion that will make you address your feelings on the subject matter and root for justice to prevail. Watch this film!!! I give it an A.Would I watch it again? - Yes, I would make some people I know watch it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONVICTION is the inspirational true story of a sister's unwavering devotion to her brother. When Betty Anne Waters' (two-time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank) older brother Kenny (Sam Rockwell) is arrested for murder and sentenced to life in 1983, Betty Anne, a Massachusetts wife and mother of two, dedicates her life to overturning the murder conviction. Convinced that her brother is innocent, Betty Anne puts herself through high school, college and, finally, law school in an 18 year quest to free Kenny. With the help of best friend Abra Rice (Academy Award nominee Minnie Driver), Betty Anne pores through suspicious evidence mounted by small town cop Nancy Taylor (Academy Award nominee Melissa Leo), meticulously retracing the steps that led to Kenny's arrest. Belief in her brother - and her quest for the truth - pushes Betty Anne and her team to uncover the facts and utilize DNA evidence with the hope of exonerating Kenny.OK this movie is just a one time watch. i was expecting if not much but somethings from it which it didn't quit meet up. well that i also realised from the Tomatometer rating before watching it. its just a plain simple story with plain simple plot, nothing much is happening which is strange. the only thing in it worth watching in this movie is the acting.Direction of this movie is above average which could have been much better for sure. this movie and its story had so much potential in it. i won't be so neagtive about this movie since i did liked it to some extent, that explains the 3.5 stars. screenplay has some flaws in it, not a perfect plot to follow but that doesn't much bother you or is not much of a bad thing. cinematography and everything is good. nice story.Acting wise it was good. i mean in my Oscar predictions, i nominated Swank. Hilary Swank, my second most favorite actress has performed very well in it, one of the best performances this year and of her own best. totally loved her. good. Sam Rockwell was absolutely brilliant in the movie. awesome. Julliette Lewis was a surprise package. other actors did well too.well this is a drama movie based on facts about love of a sister towards her brother, who for his sake become a lawyer to get him evict from the jail in which he's been more than 15 years. its somewhere flat but overall a inspirational movie with good performances that worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The case for defending Kenny Waters (Sam Rockwell) never looked good from the start. Considered the neighbourhood hoodlum, the authorities referred to him as 'trash'. His family couldn't handle him, so he grew up in foster homes. Even the filmmaker, Tony Goldwyn (grandson of Samuel), proceeds as though he is representing the prosecution.When a local woman is murdered in an ineffably horrific way, the finger inevitably points at Kenny. He is arrested, but quickly released because of the dearth of evidence incriminating him. But, as the film forcefully reveals, innocence is meaningless when society has already written you off. Two years pass and new (perjured) testimonies from previous partners are enough for Kenny to be given a life-without-parole sentence. But the evidence against Kenny overlooked one thing: he was innocent. Sensing, not knowing this, Betty Ann (Hilary Swank) resolves to get her brother out of jail ? whatever the sacrifice. In the end the cost to her was to neglect her two children, ignore her own ambitions and divorce her husband. Done not in the name of justice, but in the name of love.Failed by society, she is forced to become a lawyer for the sole purpose of attempting to free Kenny. After around 15 years of setbacks and false hopes, science comes to the rescue: emergent DNA testing proves Kenny's innocence.I'm used to Rockwell playing unsavoury types, so his portrayal of a neglected individual, with a propensity for violence but a fierce loyalty to his family, touched me in a way that I did not expect. Swank is back on top form, reminding us why she won two Oscars by the age of 30 ('Boys Don't Cry' and 'Million Dollar Baby'). Blemishes, chapped lips, bags, unwashed hair and whatever else she needs to get her next Oscar nod ? it's all there. Juliette Lewis impresses in her cameo as the nefarious ex-girlfriend, and Minnie Driver is convincing as the friend who helps Betty Ann unconditionally.Much is chronicled about the 'system' in this story. But people put Kenny Waters behind bars, not a nebulous 'system'. If the depiction is true, a police officer with a grudge schemed to put Kenny behind bars, people analysing the DNA were purposely tardy and corrupt officials bribed witnesses to perjure their testimonies.People don't like to admit when they've made a mistake. That's why people like Betty Ann Waters are so important. www.scottishreview.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There really isn't much in Conviction that we haven't seen before. Guy gets wrongly convicted (maybe) for a grisly murder; outside folks try everything to get him out. The twist in this case is that his working-class sister, a bartender, gets a law degree to help prove his innocence.If it weren't for the cast, you'd never have heard of this movie. Chances are fairly good, really, that you haven't heard of it anyway. Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank plays Betty Anne Waters, a working single mother does all she can to ensure her brother's release from prison. Brother Kenny (Sam Rockwell) is doing life for a horrifying murder of an older lady. His trial is swift. Betty's devotion to her brother - shown tautly in flashbacks - is stronger than even her bond with her family, as the fight to prove his innocence takes precedence over almost everything.Problem number one is that Kenny's trial doesn't seem wrongheaded or one-sided in the least, certainly not to the average viewer. Is he innocent? Don't know. Did he not receive a fair trial? Looked fair from here. So we need to take it on faith that Betty Anne's conviction (ha!) of her brother's non-guilt isn't unfounded. She's aided by the only other "older student" in her law class, played with knowing grace by Minnie Driver, and later on by the famous Barry Scheck, founder of The Innocence Project. Together, this legal trio must fight corruption, red tape, and ennui on the part of everyone else.Problem number two is that the whole thing is just a manic-depressive's dream. One moment Betty Anne is gloriously happy! She did something right! Woo! And then moments later she's a sad panda, because some obstacle, unforeseen by her but totally predictable by the rest of us, pops up. But then all is awesome again! And on and on and on it goes, and where it stops we just plain don't care.The background of the relationship of Betty Anne and Kenny makes things worse, not better; if it were meant to clarify, anyway. We see Kenny the thuggish bully, although he stands up for little sis. We see them both as products of a broken home, eventually sent to separate foster homes. But so what? All we see of Kenny lends credence to the theory/fact that he's a violent, violent man.The ending is a foregone conclusion, but I'll be helpful and not mention what exactly it is. The trouble is that it's not only foregone, it's sort of a letdown. There are no loose ends, and there are no actual twists. A leads to B leads to C. Despite the best efforts of the cast, Convicted isn't worth anyone's time. Swank, possibly cognizant of a one-dimensional plot, overacts, and when she looks mad or gloomy she looks exactly like Matt Damon, which isn't flattering when you're supposed to be Hilary Swank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Conviction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pitch: Oh my god, they falsely imprisoned Kenny! You bastards! The Review: True stories have always been a staple of cinema, and when it comes to recognition, either from audiences or their peers, then it's sometimes the sheer magnitude of the events that can determine how much attention you should give. So try this one for size: guy gets arrested, tried and imprisoned for murder but proclaims his innocence. OK, you're thinking, so far so typical, but then how about this: sister of imprisoned murderer believes his innocence but can't find a way to convince anyone, and their poor background means they can't afford fancy lawyers. So she decides to become a fancy lawyer herself, attempting to put herself through a degree, law school and then to attempt to overturn the conviction.If it sounds like a TV movie of the week, then the material might well be a staple of that genre, but the acting talent here raises things up a level or two. Sam Rockwell is one of the most versatile actors of his generation, so manages to inhabit Kenny Waters successfully to the extent where he fully engages your sympathies, but that you still believe he might have been capable of the crime in question. Taking the other main role of his sister, and carrying the film for long stretches, is Hilary "I've got two Oscars me" Swank, portraying a naivety at first, then a grim determination to see her quest through, and at the same time rid herself of the giant Eighties hair she's portrayed with at the start of the film.This is one of the side effects of the passage of time the film portrays; not only through a large chunk of adulthood, but the film also has a choppy narrative which allows it to cast back to the childhood of Kenny and Betty Anne, putting valuable context around their later situations and strengthening the bond between them, so we can understand exactly why Betty Anne gave up such a large part of her life on this quest. There's a few famous faces along the way, including Minne Driver as Betty Anne's best friend at law school and Juliette Lewis as a key witness at the original trial; Melissa Leo has also picked up a Golden Globe this year for her efforts in The Fighter, but she may be the only one from this cast to trouble the engravers at awards time and her role here is tiny.The reason for that is not the strength of the acting, which is at least good across the board, or the story itself which is compelling, but the direction, from Tony Goldwyn. You might remember him from such films as Disney's Tarzan (he was Tarzan) or Ghost (he was the creepy bad guy), but you might not remember him from his other directorial efforts, which have been predominantly TV shows, and this TV background does show through, unfortunately. The story, despite its epic sweep through the characters' lives, does occasionally get bogged down; at the point when one crucial piece of evidence is missing, the characters spend so long looking I was tempted to offer to help myself. The movie also leaves out one crucial detail about the lives of the characters after the events of the movie that could have put an entirely different, and possibly more interesting, spin on the outcome. That said, if true stories with good acting are your thing, then I'm convinced you'll get something from Conviction.Why see it at the cinema: It's the performances more than the visuals that will draw you in on this occasion, although there is the occasional well-framed image that deserves a big screen outing.The Score: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CONVICTION': Four Stars (Out of Five) Real life tale of a poor working class high school dropout mother who put herself through law school in order to represent her wrongfully convicted brother. The film stars Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell in the two leading roles. It co-stars Minnie Driver, Melisa Leo, Peter Gallagher, Juliette Lewis, Clea DuVall and Loren Dean. It's directed by actor turned director Tony Goldwin (who's done some sappy romances and a lot of TV but also did the outstanding 'THE LAST KISS') and written by Pamela Gray (this is the second teaming of Goldwyn and Gray. She also wrote 'A WALK ON THE MOON', which Goldwyn directed).Swank plays Betty Anne Waters, a part-time waitress and mother of two (in Ayer, Massachusetts) who spent eighteen years trying to free her wrongfully convicted brother Kenny (Rockwell), who was sentenced to life in prison, without the possibility of parole, for the murder of Katharina Brow in 1983. The two always had a special bond, which the film does a good job of showing, and Betty made it her life mission to free her brother, sacrificing her marriage and at a time custody of her children. We watch through flashbacks as we see how the police had it out for Kenny, a local troublemaker, from the get-go and organized his entire botched and biased trial. His conviction was spearheaded by a corrupt police officer by the name of Nancy Taylor (Leo).The film is almost exactly what you expect going into it, nothing shocking or original but effective none the less. Goldwyn's directing is more than adequate and the script is well written (although the real life story, which you can read online, would have made an even more compelling film). I'm not a big Hillary Swank fan but I'll admit she has talent and shows it in the right role. She's decent in this film. Rockwell, like always, steals the show though. The supporting cast is all good as well and fittingly cast. The movie is a good old fashioned court drama film and inspiring true story, if you're into that this is one you won't want to miss.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sincere without being nuanced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I watched the film expecting it to be another typical Hollywood emotional reworking of time tested and clichéd family dramas. Add to it the fact that it was based on a true story. It turned out to be exactly that.The only thing in the film that stands out is that it explores the deep and uncompromising love that a brother and a sister share despite (or maybe because) of a troubled childhood. And the lengths to which the sister is willing to go to prove his innocence. The film is very solid in this aspect, without being extraordinary. Hillary Swank and Sam Rockwell turn in believable performances. The direction is nothing special but is not bad either.The only major problem is that it does not give the proper sense of the really long time it took for the sister to ultimately achieve what she did. Otherwise the film was sincere even though it is not the best in this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small town justice, big time story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Based on a compelling true story and spurred by a "60 Minutes" segment, the film tells the story of Betty Anne Walters (Hilary Swank) who dedicated 18 years of her life to proving the innocence of her incarcerated brother, Kenny (Sam Rockwell).The natural assumption would be that Betty Anne wrote letters and hounded police and attorneys so that no one would forget Kenny. The truth is far more fascinating. From an abusive and underprivileged childhood, Betty Anne rose above all an reinvented herself once her brother was found guilty of murder. She got her GED, graduated from college, then law school, and became his attorney. With assistance from Barry Scheck and The Innocence Project, old evidence was re-analyzed and witness testimony was contested. The outcome is public record and more proof that fact can be stranger than fiction.Pamelay Gray's script is handled by director Tony Goldwyn, who is known mostly for TV projects. He is talented enough to let the story and his excellent cast do the work. Swank, of course, is the perfect choice for this role and seems quite at ease. Rockwell, one of the more under-appreciated actors around, is very strong in capturing the lovable Kenny, as well as the red-hot tempered alcoholic who was always in trouble with the law. The relationship between this brother and sister is established via childhood flashbacks and prison visits. We never once doubt that Betty Anne would commit to this challenge, even if we do question the wisdom of doing so.Have to mention some of the rest of the cast. Minnie Driver is Abra, Betty Anne's law school classmate who joins her in Kenny's cause. The movie never really explains why she does this, but she adds a nice element. Melissa Leo is the cop with a chip who railroads Kenny. We see later how her life turned out and can only think she deserves every bad thing that can happen. Ari Graynor plays Mandy, Kenny's teenage daughter and an almost unrecognizable Clea DuVall is excellent as her mother Mandy. The performance that really jumps off the screen is that of Juliette Lewis. We first see her testifying in court and almost two decades later as a burned out shell of a person. Her few minutes here are staggering to watch.It would be easy to dismiss this as just another melodrama, but it is really fascinating to see what the love of a sister can accomplish. I was shocked that the end trailer didn't mention that Kenny died just 6 months after his release in a freak accident. Betty Anne is on record as saying that while tragic, at least he died a free man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kenny and Betty Ann Waters are siblings that have seen a lot in their young lives. Brother and sister have experienced poverty, but they have clung to each other in a bond that no one will be able to break. Kenny shows signs he can be dangerous when he drinks, something we become aware at the angry confrontation between and another man at a bar where he has been partying with Betty Ann.When a heinous crime in the area is committed, circumstantial evidence ties Kenny to the crime. Betty Ann knows her brother did not have anything to do with the murder, but the dogged investigation by a police woman points that Kenny did it. Complicating things, when the case goes to trial, his former wife, Roseanna, proves to be convincing enough in her testimony against her former husband.Betty Ann Waters, who never believes Kenny committed the crime, realizes she must take action and become more involved if she wants to get Kenny out of jail. With the help of another law student, Abra Rice, she becomes a lawyer against all odds. Reopening the case, she finds an ally in Barry Scheck, the notorious lawyer that figured prominently in the O.J. Simpson's process. Her perseverance pays off when the hard nosed police woman, Nancy Taylor, is confronted and the evidence is reexamined. Winning her brother's freedom was a crusade well worth her efforts because she proved her love to an innocent man that did not deserve the raw deal he got.Directed by Tony Goldwyn, based on the true story of Kenny Waters, this film is inspirational because it shows how even situations that feel hopeless are not always lost. The screenplay by Pamela Gray delves into the situation as no doubt it really happened. A courageous woman is at the center of this story that says a lot about a justice system that can be twisted by a rotten person, Nancy Taylor, who is never ashamed for what her actions did to a man that did not deserved what he got.The casting of Hillary Swank as Betty Anne was a plus for the creators of the film. Ms. Swank is always convincing, as she is in this movie. It is easy to believe her as the lady that never gave up to save her brother. Sam Rockwell has some good moments as Kenny. He goes from violence to despair having to prove his innocent. Minnie Driver, Peter Gallagher, Juliette Lewis, Clea DuVall, Loren Dean and the wonderful Melissa Leo, are seen in the vast supporting cast.To his credit, Tony Goldwyn keeps things under a tight control with this satisfying look at how justice works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conviction a story of family loyalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONVICTION: 2 ? stars out of 4. Starring Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell, Minnie Driver and Melissa Leo. Directed by Tony Goldwyn. Rated: R, strong language, violent images In "Conviction," performances overcome the weaknesses and flaws in a story that is more gripping in real life than it is on the screen. The movie centers on the strong bond between Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) and her brother, Kenny (Sam Rockwell), and the extraordinary efforts she undertakes to exonerate him from a gross miscarriage of justice. The movie scores in showing Waters' tenacity and determination to prove her brother, who is serving a life sentence, innocent of the murder for which he was convicted. To do so, this high school dropout decides to return to school, gets her GED then goes on to college and law school. This should be the most compelling part of the movie because Waters paid a hefty price to achieve her goal, costing her not only her marriage but also her children. Yet director Tony Goldwyn rushes through this part of the movie. Instead he concentrates on the efforts of Betty Anne, her friend and fellow lawyer, Abra Rice (Minnie Driver), and the head of The Innocence Project to overturn Kenny's conviction. And while this makes for interesting viewing, it also is rather formulaic as we have seen this scenario many times before. The heart of the movie, though, is the unwavering devotion between Betty Anne and Kenny, who were raised in the most harrowing of circumstances and yet survived by clinging to each other and watching each other's backs. Their fierce relationship and unconditional love are what keeps you riveted to the screen. At times "Conviction" is superficial, especially when dealing with Betty Anne's personal life, and manipulative ? Goldwyn does everything but paint a black mustache on the wonderful Melissa Leo as the small-town police officer whose investigation helped convict Kenny ? but the sincerity of the cast is what draws you in. Swank is bulldog-tenacious albeit a bit too self-sacrificing as Betty Anne. Driver brings a sense of humor and street smarts to her role as Rice, while Juliette Lewis steals her one big scene as a trashy ex-girlfriend of Kenny whose perjured testimony helped convict him. But the movie belongs to Rockwell as the swaggering, irresponsible Kenny. He is someone aimlessly drifting through life. He is tough and cocky, but underneath his rough exterior beats a good heart. Rockwell's ability to display the many facets of Kenny should earn him a best supporting actor Oscar nomination. "Conviction" is flawed, yet still will draw an audience into its story. But because it shrugs off many intriguing aspects about Betty Anne's struggles, it fails to reach its potential as great cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Conviction" Needs to Get Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell, Minnie Driver, Melissa Leo and Juliette Lewis. That is the list of experienced actors and actresses heading up the true story of "Conviction." The 20-year story line exposes a corrupt legal system. With an outstanding cast and a poignant subject matter it is destined to deliver an emotional power house of a story. Right? It just has to. So why do I feel like I have seen yet another "innocent-man-is-wrongly-accused" movie? I am confused on why the director (Tony Goldwyn) chose the opening shots that he did. The first scenes do stick in my memory. A lone camera walks through a seemingly empty trailer home in Ayer, Massachusetts in 1980 quietly showing us a gruesome murder scene.Then we are shuffled ahead in time to see Kenny Waters (played by Rockwell) meeting with his sister Betty Anne (played by Swank) in prison. Then we are sent back in time to when Betty Anne is in her first year of law school. Maybe audiences who like to be confused will enjoy the opening. It didn't set any tone for the movie since it takes a straight shot to tell the rest of the story with a few wisely placed flashbacks. We are taken back roughly to the 1960s showing the bond being developed between Kenny and Betty Anne as children. They come from a broken home and we learn that they only have each other in this twisted world. Goldwyn tosses us into a bar where we see Kenny's violent, friendly and class clown traits all within five minutes. As an actor, Rockwell is a likable guy. He has a playful confidence about him that seems to win audiences over for the most part (i.e. his role as Chuck Barris in "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"). The man that Rockwell portrays here also seems to be liked ? not only by his sister but also by the police department in Ayer. Well, all except Nancy Taylor (played by Leo), an officer on the Ayer Police Department. We don't know why Nancy has it in for him. It would have helped if Nancy had a background telling us why she wanted to arrest Kenny so bad. After a couple of years Kenny is arrested and tried for the murder in 1980. He is hauled off to prison because of the testimonies of his girlfriends (one of whom was supposedly assaulted by Kenny) and Taylor. After Kenny's suicide attempt in prison, Betty Anne dedicates the next 20 years of her life to obtain her GED, go to college to earn a law degree and to work on this one case to prove her brother's innocence. Aside from the story line, the cast was a joy to watch. Where has Juliette Lewis been? It was good to see her for a brief time on screen. She does give a brilliant and humorous performance. Swank and Rockwell could possibly each earn an Oscar nod. Personally, I think Swank should earn an Oscar nod simply for rising out of bed in the morning. I am still torn on why I don't have anything more than a middle ground feeling for Kenny or Betty Anne considering the actual court case or the performances. Maybe it's because I didn't connect with Kenny's plight. Innocent or not, it seemed as if he was headed for trouble. Not "murder" trouble but trouble nonetheless. Maybe it's because there was a woman who was murdered in 1980 and I don't know anything about the actual victim. I am sure her life was just as important as Kenny's life. Should you see this movie? Your Honor, I would like to cite precedent of "The Hurricane" or even, ahem, "An Innocent Man." We have seen most of this film before in one way or another. Your Honor, if you haven't seen those legalese movies or a similar "an-innocent-man-is-jailed-and-the-legal-system-is-corrupt" movie then please make a motion to see "Conviction."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going in I knew what the story was about, a woman who completes her education to free the brother who she believes was wrongly convicted of murder. I'd read that Waters, (Swank's character) finishes high school and college and goes to law school; there is a passing comment about her getting her GED, we then see a classroom filled with people younger than she; the professor calls on her and asks, "What is a contract?"...all of a sudden she's in law school? Swank is married, and has two children, we don't know what the husband does, but if her clothes are any indication, he's doing okay. She and her husband are having problems, on a visit to her brother in prison, she's not wearing her wedding band; in a later scene she is wearing it, subsequently they divorce. At this point their two sons are probably 11 and 13, four years later they're still the same size. These are just a few of the things that really annoyed me about the film, coupled with a running time of an hour and forty five minutes during which flaws in a more tightly edited film would not have been nearly as glaring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even the excellent performances of Sam Rockwell and Hilary Swank can't save this absolute farce of a film. Conviction is such a drag. There is nothing interesting about the story. But just the fact that it's a real story about a brother and sister, who spent most of their childhood in foster homes, fighting for justice managed to attract a lot of good actors. Once they're on board, director Tony Goldwyn lets them do all the work. He just sits by and watches them work while translating the screenplay in a color by number fashion. The pace is steady only because the director makes no attempt at capturing your attention. Depicting real events hardly matters when what you see on screen isn't the least bit believable. Not worth your time. Just skip it.Rating - 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed A Much Tighter Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This should have been an impacting human drama about injustice . Based on a true story about a man Kenny convicted to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for murder it revolves around the man's sister , a lower working class girl called Betty Anne working as a waitress who convinced of Kenny's innocence goes to law school in order prove he did not commit the crime , This is inspiring stuff on paper , a real life David versus Goliath and since it stars Hilary Swank a women who herself is an example of a real life fairytale this should in theory be a great film . However it never really takes offOne thinks much of the problem may lie in the screenplay by Pamela Gray . I'm probably going to receive some stick here but I went in to the film with a very open mind and for periods felt I was watching some chick flick on the Hallmark channel . The screenplay lacks a narrative drive . . I expected plot turn after plot turn of Betty Anne building up hope for Kenny only to have these hopes dashed after one obstacle after the other gets in the way . This isn't really the case the screenplay meanders to a large extent in order to build up that there's a very strong family bond between Betty Anne and her brother . This is unnecessary and holds the story up to a degree . I for one would have preferred it if the story concentrated on an innocent man knowing he is innocent finding himself facing the rest of his life in a hellhole prison but the story is told through the eyes of Betty Anne . This is understandable but there's not much brevity to the storytelling and the film never reaches its full potential despite the best efforts of the cast</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very Hilary Swank movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilary Swank is an actress who has the internal strength and the talent to create a type of feminine characters feminist movies can be built around. Following 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'Amelia' now comes 'Conviction'. Again her hero is taking an unusual path, she will go with her feelings and against all odds, fight adversity and fight her condition as a woman to succeed in a career and reach a goal that seems unachievable. The danger is repetition, variants around the same subject and the same type of character are good only when they reinvent themselves and bring new points of view, new angles. This does not happen in 'Conviction' and not even the facts that the story is inspired by reality and the character she plays is taken from true life do not help. Nothing seems too real, the characters develop on expected paths, and the result is a film too long, I wish I had seen the documentary instead. Good acting from Swank and her supporting team does not make this movie take off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kind of Film the System Does Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of film that Hollywood can do supremely well and it can do it in a way that doesn't compromise modern sensibilities. Yes it's the old story of someone, in this case a woman played by Hilary Swank, taking on the system and against all odds winning. It's manipulative in that it plays on your emotions and throws in some last minute glitches but it's also a believable portrayal of characters who come from a poor background, their accents and speech patterns. It's not groundbreaking but it's a perfectly good film that you'd have to be either dead or dead cynical not to enjoy. It has some of the same characteristics as The Fighter though it isn't as good as that.Best of all it's great to see Hilary Swank in a role that really suits her. She's a terrific actor but I never really bought her as Amelia. Sam Rockwell too gives an outstanding performance managing to pull off the difficult task of portraying someone with a dangerous and volatile personality and yet convincing you that he's actually charming and one of the good guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Kenny Waters (Sam Rockwell) is convicted for murder his sister Betty Anne (Hilary Swank), convinced of his innocence, studies for a law degree and the bar in order to prove his innocence. The ensuing battle takes 20 years and encompasses the advent of DNA evidence, political expediency, police corruption, and a dose of good luck.This mildly inspirational story is based on truth, and remains interesting all the way through, as setbacks and triumphs are encountered. At the heart of it, Swank and Rockwell make us believe in the devotion of this brother and sister to each other, despite their undisciplined and rather wrong side of the tracks upbringing (and they are aided in this by the actors playing them as children). Minnie Driver gets a solid supporting role as Betty Anne's friend, but all the performances are good.However, my engagement with this movie hinged on the appalling miscarriage of justice here, and how it continued even after DNA evidence exonerated Kenny. Well worth catching.</fullReview>

Apology about perjury was given right after the trial, and not after all those years; B. The unfortunate death of Kenneth Waters just 6 months after his release, not much of the shown happy-end and sitting by the lake. Sadly, they failed to mention it even in the epilogue.Yet these movie inaccuracies do not in any way diminish the story, and having found out the truth only inspires you more about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film! In mi opinion Hilary Swank is the best actress alive. She can make every story come to life, and the emotions come out of the screen directly into your brain, involving your every thought around the story. This makes this movie so much stronger, because it's based on a true story. I love when a movie makes you almost cry, and i said almost, because i always contain the tears, i don't know why but i do it. I've only cried with Braveheart and Million Dollar Baby, and the only reason i gave this movie a 9 instead of a perfect 10 is because i was able to contain the tears, though i felt the same level of emotion. In this movie you will find the same strong willpower on the main character that you found in Million Dollar Baby, the story is very different but the character itself isn't. She has to struggle a lot in the path to make her ultimate dream come true. Will she be capable? If you wanna feel strong and real emotions, you MUST see this film. Hilary Swank will be the most powerful actress of all times, and the good thing is that she has a lot future movies to prove this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clear message to human's potential when ambition is higher than the dream itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conviction is based on the true story of Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) who puts herself through a law school in order to represent her brother, Kenny Waters (Sam Rockwell), who has been wrongfully accused of first degree murder. Of course you already know or at least have an idea about the result of this story but the momentum build-up is interesting enough too keep you focused. While it doesn't rely on a tense atmosphere and thrilling "detective" experience, it manages to impress thanks to the beautifully and detailed characterization of the process which Betty Anne had to go through. There's a clear stamp on what ultimate will and unstoppable ambition could make a man achieve: the ultimate act of (brotherly) love. The story is compelling and feels powerful because you know it's true but it lacks in objectivity and at times it draws too much attention on the flaws and mistakes in the legal system or the lack of interest of the "system" that it almost becomes a manipulative story. Other than that, I don't have many troubles with the story. It's rudimentary but it will definitely convict you to watch it till the end thanks to the both lead impressive performances.This film heads the lights on the academy award winner Hilary Swank. She deserves some praising and recognition for her deep portrayal of this ridiculously optimistic character and her way of expressing feelings and thoughts through gestures. She's a true fighter that won't give up for anything and won't accept failure in any form. Another impressive performance is Kenny's unstable personality screen adaptation by Rockwell. A very talented actor who made himself known thanks to his roles in "The Assassination of Jesse James" and the science-fiction drama "Moon". He is definitely one of the actors to be watched on this next decade. The problem that irritated me is that while Kenny aged... Betty Anne looked the same for more than 16 years which to me was a little bit awkward. I mean, if you use makeup on Kenny, use it Betty Anne also... don't they age the same?... Just askin'.Technically the movie was so and so. It tried to combine emotionally engaging shots and great cinematography with "flat" filming, thing that I disliked. There are some contrasts though that I found deeply moving like the empty court-room at the end and the press waiting outside the "liberty" doors. It was a great contrast that pictured the whole movie as what it is. A clear message to human's potential when ambition is higher than the dream itself. Besides that, the music used was too simple and inconsistent to really assimilate it with the picture.Overall, Conviction is a good movie most people will enjoy thanks to it's true story and powerful performances. It's far from being a stand-out but it's definitely one of the most overlooked pieces of filmmaking this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best performances since "Doubt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title Conviction has two meanings. The first and most obvious is in reference to the conviction of Kenneth Waters (Sam Rockwell) on an account of murder in the first degree. The second refers to his sister's conviction. Her conviction that her brother is innocent and her conviction to help him win his freedom at all costs. Conviction tells the story of Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) who spent nearly twenty years of her lifetime becoming an attorney in an attempt to prove her brother's innocence. At times her devotion to this cause seems dangerously obsessive, but a little insight into these two loving siblings' rough and underprivileged past helps us understand Betty Anne's commitment to her brother. Conviction reels us into this true-life saga and into its dynamic and wonderfully realized characters and keeps us hooked for the tale's duration. The result turns out to be an ultimately satisfying and emotionally rich motion picture, full of spot-on characterization and sporting a well-wrought screenplay by one Pamela Gray.Conviction succeeds as one of those rare movies about people and people alone?a truly character driven story. This is as much a movie about loyalty and devotion as it is a courtroom drama, deriving its power from the characters who inhabit it. Each character is fully realized as a person, a true human being, not just a pawn in some story arch. As an audience member, these characters really fooled me. Never once were they unbelievable or inhuman. Of course this wonderful characterization is due in no small part to the fantastic performances found all over this film. Hilary Swank as Betty Anne Waters is right back on her game. I was a little worried about her after her dreary over-performance in last year's Amelia, but this is some of her best work to date. The key to Swank's performance is not in the emotion she exerts outwardly or in her strong and telling facial expression, but rather in the way she may arch an eyebrow or purse her lips. The performance lives not in the choice of words, but in the way the words are spoken as they role out of the mouth.But here I am goggling on about Hilary Swank when really I could highlight almost half a dozen actors worthy of recognition. The strength of this movie is in the performances by the actors if nowhere else. Minnie Driver in an important supporting role is strong and audacious and she creates a human being out of it, rather than just being a sidekick to Betty Anne. Sam Rockwell as the accused Kenneth is also perfectly cast. The acting in this movie is some of the best I've seen in a few years. It doesn't get much stronger than this. Not only are the main actors and supporting actors brilliant, but every single little tiny insignificant actor is excellent. The cop that first arrests Kenny, one Officer Nancy Taylor, inhabits about five minutes of screen time, but the actress's (Melissa Leo's) performance is so convincing and so believable and perfect that it's a role I'll never forget. Juliette Lewis plays a drunk former lover of Kenneth's who testifies against him. She's delivered one of he best performances of the year in my opinion but she was only given maybe ten minutes of screen time. This is really top-notch acting. It's rare when an ensemble is this good not only in the main cast but also among the supporting and even bit roles. As I was watching it, I kept thinking, "Wow, this is full of absolutely gang-buster performances." As Betty Anne progresses through law school, nearly dropping out several times, she's tried not only in the classroom but in her personal life as well. Her sons leave her to live with their father, she practically alienates her best friend, not to mention that she begins to look like she hasn't slept in a couple of years. There's a particular scene in which she goes to visit a woman who testified against Kenneth, and instead of acting belligerent and nasty to her, she remains tactful and quiet to her, although we all know that she thinks this woman is as sleazy as it gets.Once Betty Anne begins to shape up in law school and finally passes the bar, she annexes the aid of her new found attorney friend Abra Rice (Minnie Driver). Abra serves as a slightly more gutsy and strong-willed shoulder to lean on as Betty Anne continues on through this torment. Her words are sharp and often painful, but full of wisdom. Minnie Driver handles this all carefully (which isn't surprising because she's one of the most talented yet underrated actresses of the new century). Near the end of the film, most of the loose ends are tied up and the conflict is resolved. One of the final shots of the movie features Kenny holding his dear sister Betty Anne in his arms while sitting on a bench together on the shores of a lake. It's a beautiful shot that pretty much sums up the theme of the whole movie: that when a person is that loyal and loves another that much, they will be willing to do anything for them, whatever the costs. Even if this means loosing their husband and their family. The film is a hurricane of emotions, but in the eye of the storm is the simple principles of love and loyalty and that's what fuels this fire of a movie. It doesn't make profound statements and no proverbs emit from the mouths of these characters. Instead, the message is put across in an almost equivocating way, but ultimately crystal clear as a bell. And what a message it is!www.colewebbharter.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The true story of Betty Anne Waters, a working mother who puts herself through law school to represent her brother Ken Water, who has been wrongfully convicted of murder. At one point in the film, her two sons ask each other if they would do the same for each other what their mother is doing for her brother. The one kid says something along the lines of "You'd throw your whole life away for me?" That's a pretty fair question, since Betty Anne's journey was 18 years. From 1983 to 2001 her main goal was to free her brother, this took a toll on her marriage and her kids. The question I walked away from this film was, could I do that? I have trouble sticking to a health routine, could I really spend 18 years with one clear goal in my mind, something that isn't going to be 100 percent certain? At points during the film I was moved, mainly the performances from Swank, the always reliable Rockwell and surprisingly Juliette Lewis who steals the scene she is in. The performance from Rockwell further proves to me how underrated and under-appreciated he is in the industry. Swank gives her usual dedication to the role, both throw on accents that apparently aren't really true to form, so I hear. The whole movie feels like an award winning piece, but there are some issues with it that actually make it feel like a wannabe award winning piece. The film weaves in and out of different time periods for the most part in the first half. It's distracting and doesn't fully give the audience the full weight of Betty Anne's journey. We start off with them as adults, Kenny already convicted, then we shoot back to when they are kids, then we go to before he is convicted, then back to kids, then to convicted, then back to kids, so on. I felt that the film seemed a bit rushed with the journey she takes and I did not fully feel the emotional weight of her undertaking. This was the key part of the film that they needed to hit and I think they missed it. The film loses points from me due to the fact that the filmmakers chose to ignore some bits of facts regarding the ending because the test audiences found it too depressing. Yes, we know she gets him out because that's part of the story. DNA evidence was was used to exonerate him. The film ends with him out of prison and then some title cards appear to let us know where the actual people are now and what happened afterwards. They choose to ignore the fact that Kenny, 6 months after getting released, died. To me, that puts a whole new perspective on the matter and was a piece of information I think the film needed to give the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine film with a touching, exhilarating story, a compelling script, top-notch production values and tight direction. It can't be a great film, because you know the outcome or it would not have been made in the first place, so there is no true dramatic tension. The political message is powerful and the Innocence Project, which is admirable and staffed by enlightened, committed lawyers every bit as admirable as the lead players of the movie, is the real star, and their star keeps rising. The flat-footed depiction and compression of the law education detracts from the story line: at one point she is about to flunk out, and the next thing you know she's passed the bar. This is worth going to see, and you wish that creep the prosecutor were not beyond the statute of limitations. Remember: if Massachusetts had a death penalty a grievous error would have been committed but for the heroes this film depicts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Goldwyn's (The Last Samurai, The Pelican Brief) "Conviction" is a must see at TIFF. Based on the true story of Kenny Water's (Sam Rockwell) murder trial, "Conviction" reveals how powerful the bond of family can be.Betty Anne (Hilary Swank) is Kenny's sister and long time best friend. An inseparable duo, Kenny and Betty grew up on a farm and have been there for each other for as long as they both can remember. Kenny is a wild card and has a history with crime. A brutal murder occurs in his small town and Kenny is the lead suspect. He is put to trial and sentenced to life without parole. Betty Anne refuses to believe he's guilty and will stop at nothing to prove his innocence; even it means she has to become a lawyer to do it.Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell are the life-blood of this film. Their performances are Oscar worthy and their chemistry is undeniable. Swank (Academy Award winner ? 'Boys Don't Cry') plays a single mother whose purpose in life is to save her brother from dying in prison. Swank delivers an emotionally taxing and versatile performance as a believable sister to Rockwell. Betty Anne is a woman from humble beginnings who was always getting into trouble with her brother. Her evolution into a mother and obsessed lawyer is moving. The bond between Swank and Rockwell seems real and it amplifies the importance of every step she takes towards trying to save him. Rockwell is not outdone by Swank in any way...read more @ http://www.myetvmedia.com/film-review/conviction/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aptly named movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conviction is a movie driven by the love a sister has for her brother. In 1983 Kenny Waters (Sam Rockwell) is on trial for murder of a neighbor in small town Massachusetts. Kenny is no saint as the flashbacks through his life shows. No one believes that he did not commit this murder except his sister Betty Anne (Hillary Swank). We are shown their poverty stricken, unsupervised upbringing. They are two of nine children to a single mother. They grow up making mischief but leaning on each other.Kenny drinks, commits petty crimes and sleeps with rather trashy women. So when a murder is committed in their small town he is pulled in as one of the usual suspects. He is soon released for lack of evidence. After being relentlessly pursued by a police officer that is sure is committed the crime, he is arrested two years later. Hearing testimony from his female acquaintances that claim he admitted to the crime he is found guilty and sentenced.Betty Anne continues to believe that he is innocent and sets out to prove it. The only way she knows how is to become his council and represent him in court. So, this is where this "based on actual events" story is astounding. Betty Anne decides to get her GED (yes that's right she didn't graduate high school), bachelor's degree, apply and graduate from Law school, pass the bar and fight for her brother's freedom. WHAT! This is amazing the level of determination and belief this woman has for her brother.As the years go by Betty Anne's marriage ends, her children grow up and she still continues to work, go to school and stay on the path that will one day release her brother. This movie truly highlights the strength and determination of a focused mind. It took 12 years but finally she gets her chance to fight for her brother when no one else would. Due to the current implementation of DNA evidence Betty Anne is able to defend her brother in a way that was not possible in 1983.I won't tell you how it ends. The ending is not the greatest part of this story. The most compelling part is the sheer will of this woman to keep fighting even when all seemed lost. This is truly an incredible underdog movie worth your time.www.rivareviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egregious miscarriage of justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The legal system is not perfect. That is amply illustrated in this compelling movie about a man who is a victim of a miscarriage of justice. There are so many things that can go wrong. Evidence can be withheld. Witnesses can be influenced. Evidence can be tampered with or lost. All this undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary, which is one of the three main branches of the government. If a court cannot dispense justice fairly and with impartiality, then the integrity of our entire political system is placed at risk. For this reason, this is an important and relevant movie. When a court convicts an innocent person, that signifies a breakdown of the system. This movie dramatizes such a breakdown. Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell give strong, compelling performances as the sister and her victim brother. Melissa Leo gives a chilling portrayal of the police officer who led the initial investigation. The movie has a cogent, well-structured story and keeps the audience engaged. This movie is worth watching.One of the problems raised by this movie is the reliance on DNA tests to prove or disprove guilt. The question is: how reliable are DNA tests? If other evidence can be tampered, why not the DNA samples? Another problem is the reliability of witnesses. According to the movie not one, but TWO witnesses committed perjury. True, they may have been coerced, yet they lied, they knew they were lying, their lies became a matter of public record, and their lies created a lot of havoc, not only for the accused, but for the state itself. And why was their testimony given so much credibility? To me, this is the real crux of the story. Why do witnesses lie? Does the concept of perjury mean anything? At what point will someone decide to conscientiously deny an irrefutable fact?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has solid directing and performances with a few scene stealing performances that make for a memorable viewing. The strong point of this film is the story and it's roots in the truth of history. A small performance by Juliette Lewis as Roseanna Perry steals the entire movie.It's all about connection and the endurance of spirit. The connection between Betty Anne Waters and Kenny Waters is a bond that is symbolic of the most unconditional sense of love and adoration. Betty's journey to free her brother is long and arduous. It is one that is met with countless obstacles, but she never gives in, she never waivers.On a side note, I found it rather sad that a part that had been left out of the film was the truth of Kenny's fate. Truthfully, once he was finally freed, he only lived for what I believe was another 18 months. Apparently he had an accident not long after his release. He fell and hit his head traumatically, a catalyst for his passing.</fullReview>

Hilary is good with her everlasting belief and Minnie is a cool supportive friend.The story was interesting to tell but the director failed to his job: he can't edit properly the multiple timelines and each part suffers: their childhood, the murder and the investigation. The family seems ageless (like the Simpsons) albeit the case took twenty years!

		<fullReview>ConvictionIf an older brother were ever convicted of murder, the only education that most siblings would ever undertake would be that of becoming a prison guard, just so they could torment him daily with the fire hose.The resolute sister in this drama, however, decided to train as a lawyer, so that her bad seed brother could get a fair trial.When Kenny Waters (Sam Rockwell) is convicted of murder and sentenced to life, his sister/single mother Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) puts her needs aside to prove his innocence.But before she can become a lawyer, she must first earn her GED.Meanwhile, famed lawyer Barry Scheck (Peter Gallagher) and his nonprofit organization work on Kenny's exoneration.Based on the true story, Conviction is a mishmash of fine performances and a nonlinear narrative that lacks pacing.Besides, wouldn't it be a lot easier to just become a corrupt judge?

		<fullReview>I would like to purchase the book about this film, but I cannot find it anywhere.Can someone out there tell me what the books original title was.I also searched under Betty Anne Waters, the writer of this story and found nothing.I would very much like to read the book before I see the movie.This looks to be like an amazing story.I will check back in a couple of days to see if anyone responds.I try to read the books before the movie actually comes out because I get a true sense of the movie before it comes out.Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may have seen this discussed a little on Film 2010 with Jonathan Ross, it wasn't really marketed highly which suggested it was independent, I cannot deny or confirm this, but the cast was certainly to me. Based on the true story, unemployed high school dropout and single mother Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) has spent the last sixteen-seventeen years trying to turn the conviction for her brother Kenny (Moon's Sam Rockwell) falsely accused of murder and robbery of a woman in Ayer, Massachusetts. All the facts and evidence seem to lead to the conclusion that he may indeed have committed the crime, but Betty Anne has been attending law school for all those years in order to become his representative and fight the system. After finally passing her law degree she can indeed focus on his case, delving into the DNA evidence rooms scanning the crime items and with the Innocence Project proving he is not guilty. Eventually after some questioning and help from Abra Rice (Minnie Driver), Nancy Taylor (The Fighter's Melissa Leo) and Roseanna Perry (Juliette Lewis), a written statement from key person Brenda Marsh (Coyote Ugly's Clea DuVall) and the DNA testing has completed, in the end Betty Anne indeed proves the innocence of brother Kenny, and he is freed from prison for the rest of his life, the real killer was never found. Also starring While You Were Sleeping's Peter Gallagher as Barry Scheck, Conor Donovan as Richard, Owen Campbell as Ben, Karen Young as Elizabeth Waters, Thomas D. Mahard as Law Professor and John Pyper-Ferguson as Aidan. Swank does well in the real life part of the fighting sister, Rockwell gets his time as the brother struggling with behind bars, and the supporting cast with Driver, Leo, Lewis and DeVall, I can see what the critics mean that this is a like TV movie or something, in its simplicity and not much boost, but it has a reasonable script, a near enough good biographical drama. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the better films of 2010! I knew this one was going to be a winner from the first time i saw the trailer for it. I am also a fan of academy award winner Hilary Swank's as well. Not only the trailer intrigued me but the based on true event story as well, I mean how can it not? Betty Anne Waters (Swank) a married mother of two's brother Kenny (Sam Rockwell) gets a sentence of life in prison for a murder of a local woman he never committed. In a personal will quite like i have never seen before she spends the next 18 years putting herself through law school and becomes a lawyer in an all out bid to free her brother. Jeapordizing her own life along the way. If this doesn't show a family bond nothing does. I quite like it when a trailer looks good but it actually doesn't even come close to how good the actual finished project is. Well this is yet another serious contender for the Oscar race, I see best picture, best story if they have that award and finally acting awards in both the actor and supporting actor categories. Sam Rockwell and Hilary Swank were brilliant in this. And Juliett Lewis has a short part in this, a short part that she played with a major punch. A major thanks to Tony Goldwyn for directing a film that kept me totally intrigued throughout.</fullReview>
