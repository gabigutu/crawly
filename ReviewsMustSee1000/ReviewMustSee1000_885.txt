		<shortDescription>The games people play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Polanski's first feature, on paper, sounds like nothing more than a run-of-the-mill claustrophobic thriller set on a boat - a couple takes a loner on board, you figure out the rest. 'Dead Calm', 'The Deep', etc etc etc.Instead, 'Knife In The Water' is an agonisingly tense look at male posturing &amp; ego, the husband &amp; hitch-hiker constantly challenging each other in every possible way - sailing prowess, games of fiddlesticks, knife throwing &amp; just generally strutting about. There's almost never a single moment where the two aren't trying to trump each other, &amp; one gets the impression that it's not even to impress the girl, so much as themselves. As the film progresses, the tension mounts &amp; tempers fray.In a Hollywood film, this would build up to a dramatic climax of violence &amp; catharsis, accompanied with thunder &amp; lightning. Polanski doesn't let us off the hook that easily - things get rough, but the games continue, right until the very end of the film.Shot in black &amp; white, with a cast of three, &amp; virtually one small location, 'Knife In The Water' puts bigger films to shame. No stars, no pyrotechnics, no special effects, probably very little budget, &amp; it's completely riveting from start to finish.It was nominated for the Best Foreign Film at the Oscars - the first feature of a young Polish film student - &amp; rightly so.A brilliant start to a brilliant career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski's film has artistic integrity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Polanski's feature debut, "Knife in the Water," strange power games were again to the fore, with ridiculous macho rivalries arising when a young looking man hitches a lift with a sportswriter and his attractive wife? Though the plot itself is slim, the film is distinguished by Polanski's precise visuals, which point the shifts in allegiance between the three characters through subtle groupings; impressively, although almost the whole film is situated on a small yacht, the effect is always cinematic rather than theatrical? Polanski's film is implicit, ingenious, mesmerizing, and has artistic integrity? It is filled with a very different sort of suspense? There is no violence? The suspense is hinted at, suggested, refined tautly, glimpsed, did-he-mean-what-I-think-he-meant? The rich man's confidence was in his possessions, among which was numbered his attractive wife, lying in bikini, teasing by arousing expectations between them on the deck? The student's confidence, casual, almost unaware, was in his very being... The husband resented the youth, the strength, the "cool," the easy virility of the student and worked out a compulsion to keep challenging them, to try to show his superiority? Polanski was fair ? each had his own strengths and skills; but the one obsessively resented the others?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing more thrilling than discovering a natural filmmaker for the first time. There are only so many, and you can only have menarche once. Its an introduction into another life.I first saw this in 1965 at the Orson Welles Cinema near Harvard Square. We were told it was made behind the backs of Iron Curtain thugs, only surviving because of international attention. (I wouldn't meet Tarkovsky or Kieslowski until later.) And that it was made by the fellow who had made the striking "Repulsion," which at that time was anticipated but yet unseen in the States.I've since learned some striking things: that both Polanski and his co-writer wanted to play the hitchhiker and indeed it is Polanski's voice. And that the mistress who seems only half alive was in fact played by a non-actress they found by looking at swimming pools. Also that the situation was suggested by a long planned and discussed Orson Welles project ("The Deep") that was started after this and never completed. The writing is good of course, especially the central image the title denotes, but the camera finds the perfect place always. It is like Altman's camera (after this) that discovers the action rather than, say Spielberg's where the action is obviously happening in such a way to be cleanly seen by the camera. And so much harder on a boat!But the interesting thing about such an introduction to a filmmaker is the relationship that follows: we know certain things about how he thinks and sees. We expect the conversation to continue and mature over the years. And what a rocky ride this man has taken us on, through perfectly created worlds (in which I include "Ninth Gate") but also through pure dreck and rank sentimentality (both of which tag "The Pianist").Sometimes he's internal to the narrative, even the charmed actor. Sometimes he is outside the narrative, pulling strings (as with this film) but sometimes it is clear he never got out of bed.As with Kubrick and so many others, you really must start at the beginning, which essentially means here.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Polanski created a landmark film with Knife in the Water. It perhaps even trumps his most famous film, Chinatown. A man and his wife (or is it his mistress?) pick up a hitchhiker. For reasons that are obscure for most of the film, the man asks the hitchhiker if he would like to come along on their sailing trip. They plan to sail until the next dawn. It feels like it'll be a run-of-the-mill thriller, but it's much smarter than that. Really, it's a tale about male posturing, and it may be the best film on that subject. The three actors are excellent. Polanski's direction is flawless. The jazz score is wonderful, as well. One of the best ever made. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the powerhouse debuts is a minimalist, existential suspense film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knife in the Water is the kind of film that works beautifully at making so much out of seemingly so little. A little tale of a couple who ask a hitch-hiker they pick up to come along with them for a sail on the lakes is all the story there is. But within that story are little bits that keep the story pumping, alive. There's also a style that lends itself to a kind of film-making that was just budding with the new-wave movements of the 60's. Roman Polanski, who co-wrote and directed the film (as well giving an entire voice-over to the hitch-hiker), is careful in reeling in the emotions out of little dialog, and is also granted two tremendous assets aside from the actors: 1) Jerzy Lipman's crisp, free-flowing, and usually tight (to get the tenseness of the three characters) b/w photography draws one in by it's deep focus and sometimes documentary feel. 2) Krzysztof Komeda's jazz soundtrack. Polanski uses the riffs of the soft, easy-going side of the weekend-out; the up-beat pacing when a humorous situation occurs when the hitch-hiker loses control of the boat; the variations that sometimes occur with the simple shots of a boat sailing fast and slow across the water. Komeda's score for the film is among one of the better ones I've ever heard, in regards to it being a great work on it's own, and to corresponding to the film (he would later provide the memorable theme to Polanski's Rosemary's Baby). The acting itself is interesting in what is not said between them, what has to be said by their expressions. The fact that the three have distinct personalities adds to the tenseness- it would've been more conventional if the hitch-hiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz) wanted to come on and stay, but Andzrej (Leon Miemczyk) is the more insistent one. Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka), meanwhile, never says more than the other two, but is perhaps smarter as well. One thing that definitely shows the film breaking away from the attitudes of the 50's in the emphasis on the sexual tension, and the actors convey that very well when called upon - adding to this, Umecka is a total, natural knock-out, if not entirely in performance (though the quiet, inward quality is when she's at her best). Simply, Knife in the Water is an observant, amusing, eye-widening experience, and it ranks as one of the premiere debuts of cinema. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this film may not appeal to the legions of folk who consider drivel like The Sixth Sense to be great drama/thriller material, but to those of us who adore movies and respect the great ones, this one is a gem.This great-granddad to later works like "Dead Calm" or even "The Talented Mr. Ripley" manages to deliver the goods on this wickedly smart little tale about a young middle class couple who pick up a hitchhiker who manages to turn their life around in the course of one day. What sets this film apart from others is it's place in movie history and it's polished (no pun intended) directorial style.This early hit by future great director Roman Polanski manages to make you believe in these three people without questioning the typically silly things that people do in thrillers. Of course most of us would not invite a strange hitchhiker onto their private boat for an evening, especially when the hitchhiker carries with them a huge hunting knife and an attitude. Just throw your disbelief to the wind, and sit back and enjoy this little gem. I loved the juxtaposition of the vast open air and beautiful water vistas with the claustrophobic atmosphere aboard the little "yacht". The terrific moment when the couple dares the young man to hang over the edge of the boat and he begins to "run" on water alongside. Even the inevitable seduction rings true due to the circumstances. I won't reveal anymore scenes. This film is to be enjoyed by all! The only complaint is while I saw this film at the normally wonderful Film Forum in NYC, the grossly outdated and shabby looking subtitles positively cry out for a restoration!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Polish film to be nominated for a Foreign Language Oscar, Roman Polanski's "Knife in the Water" is one of the most impressive director's debuts I've seen.The story is simple. A wealthy couple on its way to spend a weekend on their yacht picks up a young and attractive hitchhiker. The middle-aged husband, a successful and cynical sportswriter invites the young man on board, perhaps to show off his nice yacht, his seamanship, and eventually, his superiority. His young and sexy wife does not say much but as the yacht moves along and tension between two men rises, she seems to enjoy the presence of a passenger and the obvious competition between them for her attention.Made of the very simple material, the film is a brilliant psychological thriller that shows the young writer-director's extraordinary ability to create menace on the screen throughout the profound study of the characters' deep hidden emotions. Not as widely known as "Chinatown" and "Rosemary's Baby", "Knife in the Water" is the perfect introduction to the work of the director whose craft in creating disturbing studies of anger, humiliation, fear, and sexuality is truly remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, compelling debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knife in the Water (1962), Polanski's feature debut, made when he was twenty-nine, is a tense overnight sailing trip taken by a man with his pretty younger wife and a handsome young drifter they find hitchhiking on their drive to the boat. The action is claustrophobic and fraught with menace ? the two men are in conflict from the moment they first meet ? and a cool jazz score gives the film an edgy contemporary air. The young man carries a long knife of the switch-blade type. Does the old rule apply, that a weapon, once introduced in a story, has to be used? Polanski was to do many other things in his career, but his ability to create unease was all there in this first one. And the shooting on the water is as effective as that to be found in another remarkable film of about the same time, Rene Clement's Plein Soleil, with Alain Delon as Tom Ripley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly free of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Devastating and beautiful early film from talented director Roman Polanski...but 'beautiful' in a sad, melancholy sense. Rarely have I seen a picture which so vividly captures the wonder of weather (gray and drizzly skies and choppy sea water, illuminated suddenly by a burst of sun rays). Sure, the film is in black-and-white, however that foreboding sky actually becomes a character in the plot involving a couple out for a boating weekend who pick up a hitchhiker and invite him along on their trip. Not a whole lot of story (in the conventional sense), though both Jerzy Lipman's amazing cinematography and Krzysztof Komeda's jazzy score make the journey a worthy ride which builds in suspense and a creepy, muted kind of ambiance. Polanski's eye is unerring, but don't expect him to give into a big pay-off. The narrative is pretty much based in reality--it's grounded--and is without major outbursts, violence or melodrama. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This early work of Polanski's shows us that he has always had a great eye with the camera and he shows us that he's not afraid to use it. He frequently breaks way from the traditional film shots as he frames the shots in unique and interesting ways.The story is simple and yet he is able to brew some dark energy even with an amateurish cast. The psychological conflict that continues to grow until we have storm on the set and a storm in the film is somewhat simple in it's symbolism but unlike many director's today he is looking at the story on multiple levels.All in all this still has the feel of a really good student film. It reminds my somewhat of Scorese's "Whose That Knocking at My Door". I'd have to say that it's overrated in most aspects but I find it a tasty morsel of things to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astonishing directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film on its release in London (1962) I was only too ready to dismiss it as a pastiche of Ingmar Bergman. I am therefore more than glad to have seen it again on tv a couple of nights ago. How totally mistaken I was! It is an original film through and through, and the young Polanski had already his artistic stamp ready to forge on his first work (Three men and a wardrobe was not directed by him, I don't think). Forty years on, what is so astonishing is that the film and therefore the social, emotional and psychological problems examined in it, has not aged at all. Communist Poland? What does it matter? A young student hiking his way? So what? A young woman "married ???" to an older man? Entirely timeless and placeless. What remains as solid as ever is the primordial conflict between two men, one weaker the other stronger, but you cannot be so sure about that, in the presence of a woman who is both a sex object and a recipient of the seed of one of the two men. Why is the couple without child? How can a woman whose "husband" is dangerously swimming ashore to summon help, can be so relaxed as to have sex with the young man when he is going to vanish from their lives within a few hours?Louis Malle famously said that he prefers the filmgoers to leave the cinema with lots of questions in their heads, rather than answers to all the questions in the film. Polanski has never stopped doing that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WELL,you can defined this great film just by one particular scene: the old man is rich,have good social position and took the boy on board to play the role of his mentor.However the young man was dragging the beautiful knife,which was_as he claimed_ the most important thing in his life.The guy was always playing the knife between his fingers and the old man was jealous about that.So when the boy went inside the yacht leaving the knife,the old man took the knife and tried to do the same.Suddenly the young appear and saw this.The only way for the old man to get away with some honour was to allow the boy do the play:he played the knife between the old man's fingers,looking straight into his eyes.Well the lady at the same time was swimming using a funny rubber cocodrile.So, imagine this beautiful scene with the knife,all the tension and suddenly we hear the woman shouting:'Andrzej, Andrzej,the cocodrile is making the bubbles',huh,when I was in the cinema the whole audience burst laughting after hearing that!. The woman stays in the background, just think why? There's another great funny shot when the woman lays there for a sunbathe with her small bikinis,well, her breast dominates the scene!. is the waving movement of the yacht who creates the sensual scene!.Of course this scene was part of the longer plot ,the critics described this `knife scene' as the most famous and symbolic scene in all of Polanski films..Zygmunt Malanowicz,the actor who played the part of the young man said that he practice a lotnfor those scenes,polanski was afraid if he was prcticing long enough,finally everything was Ok.As Leon Niemczyc,the actor who played the mature role said" Malanowicz only gave me sligh scars'.The idea of the film was the strange competition between this two men.the jury and the prize was the woman.Polanski said he needed a actress that looked plain and normal in ordinary dress but intriguing in bikini!.Polanski was not only interested in this kind of personages,he likes the relantionship between' the master and the servant' The domineering and the repressed ,as we can see in his short film' The Fat and the Lean' (1961, B&amp;W, 15mins) or in features like Knife in the Water (1962); Cul-de-sac (1966);Dance of the Vampires(1967) etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece for a movie fan that understands sharp dialog and is interested in so called "mind" suspense. Characters in the movie are psychologically fully developed and the direction is superb; if you include Komeda's nervous jazz elements, the result is Perfection with big P. Polanski knows exactly what perfectionism is about - the devil is in the details, and the devil has no place in this great little classic. I recommend this movie to everyone that wants to get involved in film industry. Let it be the reminder why movies exist in the first place. It's the story that matters and it's the impact that dialog provides; if scenes or words stay with you long after you've seen the movie, you know that something BIG has hit you.

		<fullReview>After reading the first three pages of comments, I was struck that the average rating was probably over 9. I hate to say it, folks, but this film rates a 5 not a 9, unless one believes that movies by auteurs (particularly their early movies) have some sort of importance and inherent greatness. I did not rent this film expecting lots of violence or gore; my tastes certainly lean to the more subtle and I appreciate minimalism as much as the next cinephile. What I did expect was a taut psychological thriller. What I got was a dull film that excited me almost as much as sailing (ie not at all). The direction and acting were quite good, and the location was used to maximum effect. Part of my enjoyment was just the "gee whiz I can't believe they're filming on a boat." However, using the word "atmospheric" to describe this film I guess basically means plot-less and rudderless. The first 60+ minutes of the film lacked all tension--the conflict between the two men was totally uninteresting and underplayed to the point of near-invisibility. As I watched, I simply waited for something to happen. Not in an on-the-edge-of-my-seat way but in a god-when-will-this-movie-end way. I give it 5 stars (instead of, say, 2) because of the quality of the acting, the directing and the cinematography. Do yourself a favor and rent The Tenant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm going swimming against the tide on this one, since so many people consider it a brilliant work of art, but I found it pretty dull and pointless. The basic setup strikes me as ridiculously unlikely, and the movie feels very artificial. I found the petty power struggles between bland and uninteresting characters tedious. The movie picked up a little for the last third, finally giving a pay off of sorts to the wrangling beforehand, but while that last part is marginally interesting it hardly makes up for the preceding hour. The best thing was actually the deep focus cinematography, which was well done and showed more interesting ideas than anything in the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic study of the "Anything you can do, I can do better" attitude.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost legendary, as director Polanski's first full-length feature film, this moody, tense tale of one-upmanship remains impressive today, even more so when considering the circumstances of its genesis. Niemczyk plays a stubborn and cocky man who is travelling with his younger wife (Umecka) by car en route to their sailboat for a long day of sun and fun. When a young hitchhiker (Malanowicz) steps in front of his car, a tug of war begins in which Niemczyk and Malanowicz attempt, over and over, sometimes playfully and sometimes not, to out-do each other in practically everything they can think of. Niemczyk enjoys taunting the seemingly-assured Malanowicz, encouraging him to overextend himself at various tasks and trials while Umecka looks on, sometimes amused and sometimes annoyed. The tension builds throughout the day, relieved only occasionally by periods of camaraderie and placidness. Eventually, however, the men's attitudes and rivalry begin to boil into a serious level of competition, leading to fear, confusion and deception. Made under the Communist regime in Poland, Polanski's film was fraught with issues from the start and was, in fact, banned there for depicting upper middle class citizens enjoying the luxury of sailing on a private boat. Polanski, who suffered a skull fracture in a car accident during the filming, refused to rest up for fear that his film might not see fruition if he took time off for recovery! He achieves amazing results from the potentially disastrous raw materials at hand such as two young performers who had never been in a film before (!) and the specter of working in the confined locale of the sailboat on water (water, as a filming location, has defeated many a budget and many a director over the years.) Film buffs attracted to the movie for it's striking title and the director's reputation for blood and mayhem may be disappointed that the movie doesn't end with a lot of violence, but the mental game of chess is intriguing enough to hold one's attention (abetted by an almost endlessly growing feeling of tension.) Also, the young lady of the film is quite attractive in her bikini once she dumps her goofy cat's eye glasses and let's her hair down. The men are frequently stripped down to abbreviated swimwear as well, though their appeal will depend upon the taste of the individual viewer as they are not necessarily matinée idol in their appearance. This concept was reworked and amped up in the later film "Dead-Calm" starring Sam Neill, Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane. Fans of that film might find this one tame, but this one is the more atmospheric, not to mention realistic, of the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Knife in the water" has just three actors, is shot in essentially one location, and has a plot that can be told in half a sentence. And the result is a subtle, many layered masterpiece.A couple take a hitch-hiker out on their sailing boat. What follows is the subtle underplay of power, sexual tension and male posturing. The suspense -like in most of Polanski's movies- is psychological, and the conclusion ambiguous. The only thing constant is the beauty. It is one of those films that belong to the director. It is technically perfect, yet the 'technique', as in all good art, never takes center-stage. The acting is excellent, all the actors look tailor-made for their roles. Komeda's score is very good too. It is a film that requires close, possibly multiple watching. And the rewards are utterly fulfilling. Whether you are a Polanski fan, or just a lover of good cinema, "Knife in the Water" won't disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's first full length feature is a simple, minimalist piece filled with male posturing, dead end situations, claustrophobic environments and eerie calm. This is part of Polanski's art house beginnings, but many of its themes and much of its style would be carried through to his later, more accessible work.Like many a Polanski picture, Knife in the Water shows us men competing over a woman. Typically however this is to the end of making the men look ridiculous rather than objectifying the woman. Here the competition is the central theme, and the bulk of the film is basically a series of set pieces in which the middle-aged husband and the young hitchhiker attempt to outdo each other or show the other up. This drama is concentrated and focused by having only the three characters, and confining the action almost entirely to one location. This kind of minimalism is a safe, simple way to make a straightforward, uncluttered story ? a good strategy for an up and coming director ? but it's a lot harder to make a really great picture out of such simple elements, and the young Polanski does fall somewhat short here.What Polanski does have is his natural talent and feel for cinematic form. His sense of rhythm was evident from his earliest shorts, and by this point he had clearly settled upon a style of slow, even paces, letting scenes take as much time as they needed and never being afraid to hold a shot into so-called "dead time" if he felt it was necessary. Often, the stillness of Polanski's pictures could build up a greater feeling of dread or tension than speed and shocks. Here, the pace is leisurely, in tune with Komeda's breezy jazz score, a sound synonymous with early Polanski. It may be slow but Knife in the Water has great atmosphere.Another of Polanski's strengths was in his feel for space, particularly confined space. In Knife in the Water we have a kind of contradiction on this level, because a small boat in the middle of a lake is both a very wide open space and a small confined one. You kind of get half the effect of a later Polanski picture such as The Tenant ? you do get the sense that the characters and the camera itself are incredibly restricted in their environment, but of course you don't get that feeling of all the walls pressing in on you. Nevertheless, Polanski was a master at creating this sense, and he does tend to surround the camera with bits of boat or actor. There are numerous close-ups ? typical of the early Polanski although it's something he would drop later in his career ? which give a slightly surreal look to some of the shots. A particularly effective moment is the first shot of the boat drifting out across the lake with trees dotted in the background, which then cuts to a close-up of Krystyna, the wife, lying on her back filling the lower half of the frame, with the exact same background as the previous shot.Knife in the Water is a fairly good film with some good ideas. It suffers a bit from style over substance but is well acted and well directed and is not long enough to get overly tedious. Better things were to come from Polanski once he moved out of Poland and began his English-language film career.</fullReview>

When I saw the movie I had never seen such a perfect kiss, and there had probably never been one like it on American screens. I look at it now and it's no big deal, but then it affected me deeply. I saw it alone and a few days later had a date with girl who didn't really care for me. It all changed when I kissed her goodnight....and she asked me to stay a while. So for me, this is the movie that taught me how to kiss a woman. That was almost 40 years ago and the memory warms me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, seductive thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was almost put off by the opening 20 minutes. It seems a little clumsy - contrived and unlikely. I came to a hasty conclusion that it's an Art-house film, an allegorical tale in which the exposition isn't particularly important.By the end I'd taken that back, in part. It's a gripping film captured, almost entirely in medium or close shot, on a boat with no further backdrop. It is an allegory of sorts, strongly Oedipal. The two men, thrown together in a sudden opening exchange that is the very inversion of Rutger Hauer's first appearance in The Hitcher fight a none-too-disguised war of one-upmanship (there's a lot of 'cuckolding' talk). The stageyness of this that irked me at first irons itself by the second act in the wonderful equanimity of a sailing set piece. The bare inhumanity rippling the civility of the first act returns in the third to play out the implications of disaster.I didn't really get on with any of the actors at all, but it's not a problem. They're all Polanski's toys anyway. A remarkable part-feminist, part-New Wave modernist fable. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless, provocative classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Communist Poland, an established and successful 40 year old buff sports writer and his 27 year old barely gorgeous wife go for a routine overnight sail on his boat, like they have done so many times before. In that culture, they are comfortable and even complacent with each other, and each knows their place and their duty. They are ready for the incessant dull routine of sailing for 24 hours, their non-destructive get away.An unexpected disruption to the routine, the husband almost hits a pretty young man with the car. The couple offers the student a ride, and the husband and student start the exchange that continues throughout the movie. The husband sees something in the student and invites him to accompany them on their excursion. The student doesn't have anything better to do, and accepts. All are willing to accommodate the guest.Because the husband is successful and established, operating from the position that he knows how the world really works, he starts to mentor the student, using whatever tactics get the messages across.Operating from the position that he should be free to make his own decisions and mistakes, the student resents, or at least resists, the husband's mentoring, and sets adversarial to the husband.The wife is dutifully subservient and quiet, as usual. She knows her husband's position, opinions and history. She quietly works to ensure everyone has a calm, quiet time.As the continual conflict between the husband and the student wears on everyone's nerves in the closed setting, each character loses the firm footing of their established existence and becomes more dynamic as the environment becomes more turbulent and destructive. The husband starts to accept some ideas from the student, but senses the change in his relationship with his wife, while continuing with his predetermined agenda. The wife starts to open up to the others in the relationship, but starts to vocalize and think more independently, while trying to stay within the confines of her established role. The student starts to see some of the ideas being mentored, but still resents perceived abuses from the husband, while trying to not be an unpleasant guest.When they are parked for the night, the student and the wife start to be attracted to each other, singing and composing poetry because the husband is tuning into the boxing match on the radio and leaving them to entertain themselves. The husband finally suspects impropriety after lights are out. When he finds none, they pull up the anchor, lose the knife and sail to the climax.This is a story about the independence of youth versus the regimen of establishment, the evolutionary power struggle that changes all, regardless of whether they are on a side or not. The driving elements are all there. Resentment, jealousy, cruelty, stupidity, arrogance, shame, naivety and imprudence abound.The lack of gimmicks keep you focused on the characters. The subtitles drown out the soundtrack for slow readers and those who don't speak Polish. The black and white photography ensures all of the magnificent vistas are gray and subdued, whether stormy, sunny or night.Some camera shots are pointedly provocative, building our tension and focus on the characters. The performances were believable and realistic. Dialogue is appropriately limited, even sparse. The simplistic set is readily identifiable to the audience.This isn't psychological suspense. It's just life, readily identifiable to any culture. This movie is a timeless, provocative classic. I want it for my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this hailed as a masterpiece? I'd catch "Cul-de-sac" anytime instead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited decades to finally watch this hailed thriller about a married couple who takes on a young stranger aboard their sailboat vacation trip. As a big Polanski fan, my expectations were sky- high, and that could explain why this was basically a letdown for me. For starters, the triangle-drama-on-a-sailboat concept was no novelty to me, (having watched 'Dead calm') but it must've been unique upon its original release. But mainly, Polanski's trademarks are absent:1. The menacing, diabolical suspense. Reasons? There simply isn't enough conflict; the teenager is no threat to the couple (just a disturbance, like the mosquito he swats in a scene) because he's too vulnerable and weak. The choice of music score wrecks it, too. Cheery jazz? Here? Why? 2. The delicious dark humor, so enjoyable in the somewhat similar 'Cul-de-sac' is nowhere to be seen; it's just too plainly told to give it that extra vital dimension.And if the youngster is a symbolic indicator of the need for an overhaul in the couple's relationship, the script gives us no info about the characters, or dialog enough for this to work as a strong drama, either (nice final shot, though, suggesting the choice of crossroads the couple face). The title is also more promise than delivery - yes, there's a knife... and finally it ends up in the water, but the incident isn't followed through with a much-needed impact. Masterpiece and top-rating? Hell no, very average to be honest!But OK, on the plus-side: moody B&amp;W photography and the premise of the setting. I guess it was used here first, so a credit nod for that. 5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A preview of Polanski's potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's feature debut, "Knife in the Water," is a well-handled drama with fragments of suspense and tension that are (unfortunately) never fully realized. The plot has a curiously detached couple (Leon Niemczyk and Jolanta Umecka) en route to their boat when a hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz) stops them; the husband, Andrzej, reluctantly gives the boy a ride, and goes so far as to allow him to tag along on the boat. The remainder of the film is wrought with bizarre character motivations and developments that run contrary to the standard thriller mode (the boy, who would have been pegged as a psychopath in any other film, is a relative innocent here); while this is commendable, Polanski ultimately drops the ball in the last act--just when our throats should be firmly gripped by suspense, he lets go completely. I was literally thinking to myself, "Is that it? THAT'S our payoff?" That the characters retain a blasé demeanor throughout renders their supposed 'changes' with a minimum of dramatic impact, which is unfortunate, since a bit more charisma would have rendered the conclusion more ironic. As it stands, "Knife in the Water" is a beautifully-shot film; Polanski shows deft skill in composing his scenes, and (for a while, at least) keeps us engrossed in the story in spite of the limited setting. In the end, it's ultimately best viewed as a teaser precursor to the great works that would come from this gifted director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Polanski's first feature film is brilliant. An upper class couple (Niemczyk &amp; Umecka) decides to spend the weekend on their boat. On their way to the harbor they meet a young hitchhiker (Malanowicz) and they decide to take the young drifter- who is always seeking for adventure- with them. During the trip a power struggle occurs between the 2 men. When Andrzej looks at the young drifter he is reminded on how hard life was for him when he was younger and he starts to act like the boys mentor. The stubborn "i want to make it on my own esteem" boy however has another view of life and they come into conflict with each other. When it turns out that Krystyna is attracted to the young drifter it becomes even more complicated. This film was Polanksi's big break. It's international success allowed Polanski to move back to Paris where he would meet his co- writer Gerard Brach. Together they worked on Repulsion (Polanski's first English film) and they would make several high quality films in the years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Polanski's first feature. Hmmmmm..... This film is a study of macho rivalry, sexual tension and establishing who is the alpha male. I felt strangely unfulfilled after the film, I guess I was expecting something darker or more serious to happen, but it never did.Don't get me wrong there is some excellent acting by the Polish cast as well as some innovative camera work. The tension between the rich, older Andrzej and the exuberant, free spirited young man (you aren't told his name) is evident from the first time they meet. This carries over on to the boat where Andrzej takes every opportunity to play captain, ordering the young man around in an attempt to demean and humiliate him. Eventually things turn to hostility with the young attractive wife trying to placate the two.Not bad for a first feature, a good springboard for Polanski as we all know he went on to better things from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There isn't much here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knife in the Water is the debut feature film from Polish director Roman Polanski. It is a very minimalist film, shot in black and white, and spoken in Polish. It isn't much by you have to start somewhere. The film is about a rich writer and his young wife. They are going sailing for the day, but on the way to the docks they pick up a hitchhiking student whom we never learn the name of. They allow the student to accompany them on their day tour of the lake, a decision they will forever regret. Tensions start to slowly boil on the boat as relationships grow more and more heated. Almost the entire film takes place on the boat and these three are the only people in the whole movie. It is the definition of minimalist filmmaking in looks, as well as content.Knife in the Water is, for lack of a better word, dull. Not much happens and I never feel like this film is going anywhere. It is a mere 94 minutes, but the first 70 of those minutes seem to be useless and mundane. There are moments when you think it is going to pick up, but it never really does. It is a slow film that chronicles every little moment of this trip to sea and it eventually grows tiresome to just watch these characters rig up ropes, steer the boat, cook food, eat food, play games, etc. The film does start to pick up in about the last twenty minutes as events start shaking up the story so that it can come to a vague resolution. And yet the film still lacks any kind of "aha!" moment and is devoid of any real wow! factor.The film's central focus is on the relationship between the three characters on the book so most of the action is meant to develop the characters. The development is just as slow as everything else, however. We get to know these characters very well, but in the end we sort of regret it. There isn't much to know about these people and their stories lack any sort of intrigue. When I finally started to figure out these people I was hit with a faint breeze of anticlimactic. Then things begin to pick up, slow down again, become mildly interesting, then the film ends. And then as the screen fades to black I sort of just shrugged my shoulders and walked away.You could argue that there is a lot of subtext here with lots of things open to interpretation. The film is vague in location, time, and character background, so there is a certain amount of this film that you could interpret in all sorts of bizarre and far fetched ways. Personally, I don't see it. I realize where a lot of the deeper prying into the film comes from. People want to see a lot more in this film than what I believe is actually there. What I did feel was a certain amount of tension that was underlying the entire film in a very discreet and possibly non existent way. Again, I feel like I was expecting something more to this film than what was actually there, thus the tension and uneasiness was all fabricated in my mind. This is just a weird movie to wrap your head around, and it doesn't seem to amount to much in the end.Knife in the Water left me expecting a lot more. It just isn't an incredibly fascinating film. It isn't a bad film, but it isn't that great and I definitely wouldn't watch it again. I like Roman Polanski a lot and so I was really interested to see his very first feature film so it was pretty disappointing to see what little his first feature amounted to. If I had seen this in 1962 I probably wouldn't have thought much of Polanski, but of course I know how renowned he is in 2011, so Knife in the Water in no way hurts my opinion of the man's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was Polanski trying to invent a new genre: "film gris"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the basic plot elements of the week-ending couple and the hitchhiker have been well publicised, I will not dwell upon them. However, in the course of discussing the suspense elements, I will have to reveal the essential denouement, folks who haven't seen the film are advised to skip this comment until after they have.A great deal of praise has been showered on this first effort of Roman Polanski. It's overblown but not entirely off the mark. He is certainly clever with a slender plot and manages to keep you expecting the worst to happen. It never does, though, which may be very artistic, but is surely a let-down to many. Is it a deep psychological examination of complex people? I think it is better described as a "slice of life" story about people who don't know how to live and let live. For "slice of life" to succeed,it seems to me, you must have people who are out of the ordinary in some way beyond being merely inept at living. In the end, in this story, things just seem to "fizzle out". No doubt that is what Polanski intended, but can I be forgiven for asking "What is the point?". There is some mild excitement in the "drowning" scene, but if you look back over what you have seen, it is rather dull altogether. Dull, in fact, as the low contrast camera work. Was Polanski trying to invent a new genre: "film gris"? That aspect doesn't seem to have caught on.The three people who assist Polanski as cast members are certainly very competent, but the most interesting "cast member" is the 9 metre (about) Marconi rigged sloop "Christine" they are sailing about a seemingly deserted lake. Therein lies a bit of a puzzle. Here it is Sunday, there are other vessels moored in the marina, but only our folks are "enjoying" the holiday and the perks of having both a private car and a private yacht in a commusist state. Was this subtle propaganda of some sort on Polanski's part? There is no doubt he is a subtle director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was Roman Polanski's first, English-language feature and it didn't disappoint. With just three actors and a simple plot, Polanski, in usual fashion, creates an effective, intriguing picture. A couple, looking forward to a day of sailing, picks up a younger hitchhiker and decides to let him tag along on the boat trip too. Right from the start, the two men are at odds, continually having a battle of wits, experience, skill?and neither of them willing to back down. Of course, there's a female to "impress" as well. Knife in the Water is really a good study of human interaction, exploring such themes as power struggles, distrust, and relationships. Throughout all this, there is a wonderful underlying tension that never lets the viewer fully relax. And, of course, Polanski's direction is outstanding (even this early in his career) and his decision to use jazz for the soundtrack was a nice touch. Paving the way for his future work, Knife in the Water is definitely a worthwhile experience. The Criterion DVD, on the other hand, is somewhat of a disappointment. The rewind and fast-forward functions have been disabled and the subtitles, though adequate, do not seem to translate all the lines of dialogue. I believe these things were at Polanski's request, perhaps for some sort of artistic preservation, but frankly, I just found them annoying. However, the second DVD, containing eight of his short films, helps to make up for those faults. Anyway, in a word, recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb, understated debut...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is part of my 'Roman Polanski Collection', which also includes 'Cul-de-Sac' &amp; 'Repulsion'; all black &amp; white's and early in the then- genius Roman's formative career (before big bucks and Hollywood defocused him).Compositionally, it is essential to watch this in its almost square, original format, however much we are tempted to fill our modern TV widescreens with. This also helps squeeze the frame - and the slight claustrophobia that builds slowly from frame one, until the inevitable end. An orange filter (black &amp; white filmstock, remember) on the lens creates a darkened, brooding and high-contrast touch to the blue skies and semi-bare bodies.Close-up's, using wideangle lenses creates occasional discord along the sunny summer river banks, where the loudest thing to disturb the peace is a calling cuckoo. A jazz soundtrack hovers like a busy insect, the saxophone of Bernt Rosengren weaves and plays about with us, from original music written by Krzysztof T. Komeda.The often trite and menial conversation between the young hitcher and the boat owner and his wife helps mask this growing unease. The blonde youth carries a knife. This he shows them, openly, tantalising, as if to stamp his authority. On board the tiny boat, on the water, in the water, this triangle between the trio changes and bends, softens and hardens...And, oh, it's in the director's native Polish, but that's immaterial.Hollywood movies since have indirectly and no doubt inadvertently taken both this theme and directorial touches further and beyond - and into the mainstream. 1987's "Overboard" starring Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn being an obvious example and Phillip Noyce's "Dead Calm", with Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill even more so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who wouldn't like to debut in the film world with such a great picture like Knife in the Water? Even though it's Polanski's first feature, it can very easily compete with many of his subsequent films for the title of his greatest directorial achievement.Right from the start of this movie you are able to feel its strange and tense atmosphere, which is like a great power that gives this title a tremendously thrilling aura.Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are on their way to the port in order to spend one free day on their beautiful yacht. However, before they get there they take along a hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz), who suddenly appeared in front of the car and nearly caused a crash. Only after a brief exchange of words Andrzej offers the unnamed young boy a trip around the lake. That's when the tension starts to build at an enormously fast pace. You are actually able cut it with a knife, so thick it becomes. Andrzej starts exploiting the boy and bossing him around. He appears as the alpha male, who is superior in every way and thus is privileged to be the leader on board. As clumsy as he is, the youngster still wants to compete with him. Not only to prove that he isn't any worse than Andrzej, but also to catch Krystyna's attention. She is younger than Andrzej and that's what makes the young boy believe that she should actually choose him. It's like a subconscious game they play. Every small thing they do counts and every mistake can be a disaster for any one of them.This is a great take on the darker side of our human nature. It shows that people, similar to animals, love to command and be always one step ahead of the competition. Of course it involves cunningness at times.I just love the scene, where the two men race in such a trivial matter as pumping the mattress, accompanied by the voice of a sports commentator coming out of the radio. Then there is a game of pick-up sticks and knife throwing. It seems childish to the viewer, but their attitude shows that they are dead serious about all of it.Leon Niemczyk is simply marvelous. He perfectly portrays the successful and cynical writer, who wants to prove that even at his age he is still able to beat the handsome young boy. It's also worth noticing that both Jolanta Umecka and Zygmunt Malanowicz didn't have any previous acting experience in feature films. Beautiful jazz music by Krzysztof Komeda plays wonderfully with the storyline and puts a little bit of joy into this darkly solemn movie.Great use of various camera angles that allow presenting the perspective of all three characters at different moments. The most significant message comes near the end, as the young boys falls into the water. In a moment of desperation, anger and inability all of our deepest emotions come out. Every little thing that we hide from the world can erupt at this one single moment and change the way other will perceive us.Whether or not you are familiar with the amazing work of Roman Polanski, you should definitely watch Knife in the Water, as it is one of the most unusual psychological thrillers ever made. What's more, it's also one of the best achievements coming from the Polish school of cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 11/23/2001 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Roman Polanski):Hard to follow, yet interesting drama set on the waters in a sailboat for the most part. The story is basically about the relationship that occurs between a drifter and a well-to-do couple who own not only a car but a sailboat in times when not very many own anything in this culture. This is the basis for the conversations that follow. I kept wondering when something would really happen in the movie, but for the most part it was just about their relationships. I weird twist occurs near the end(which I won't give away) that just brings up more questions than answering any of your questions. I guess this is why I recommend this movie. It's aloofness toward a central idea or goal seems to be the intent of the filmmaker(Roman Polanski's first film) and this always at least entices me to figure out the whole experience. I would like to see what would happen with the next hitchhiker that this couple picks up(could this start a series - I don't think so, but it would be interesting - maybe).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time a couple of weeks ago on the BBC and I expected a heavy-handed, complex psychological thriller. What I got was a fairly mild, not-too-serious amusing little film. A couple going on a sailing-trip, pick up a young hitch-hiking college student. The man tries to impress his wife by constantly trying to ridicule the student because of his playful behaviour and lack of experience, but, ironically the woman is drawn to the boy for that exact same reason. The man is a groomed writer and the boy is, like said, a college student, but when trying to impress a woman, the behaviour of both is stupid and childish. I didn't think it was a groundbreaking masterpiece, but it's certainly good filmmaking and one of those rare films that never become dated. It also contains, in my opinion, one of the greatest kissing scenes of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's first feature film set the stage for a career marked by some of the most intense movies ever. And "Nó&#x17c; w wodzie" ("Knife in the Water" in English) is one such movie. I watched an interview with Roman Polanski and Jerzy Skolimowski, and they noted that a trick that the movie uses is that Krystyna looks dowdy at the beginning but becomes more attractive as the movie progresses. Meanwhile, the men engage in a battle of wits (or manliness?). The isolated setting and black-and-white cinematography serve to emphasize the intense plot.The jazz soundtrack and lack of socialist realism in the plot caused friction with Poland's Soviet-backed authorities, so Polanski left the country. His life since then has been a series of bad things (the murder of his wife, and then his rape of an underage girl). But even so, you can't deny that he has made some of the best movies ever. I highly recommend this one.I don't know whether or not Jolanta Umecka starred in anything after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a brilliant psychological thriller. It tells a story of limited space and intense circumstances. The story is simple cause there are only 3 people in the middle of the sea during the whole movie. But emotions and actions of characters are profound. Only three characters, confined on a boat together for most of the run time ? come from is felt throughout, most notably in the concept of materially. Upper-class, middle-aged Andrzej clings tightly to his yacht, his pride and joy and central symbol of bourgeois decadence and power, while the hitchhiker, although assembly hailing from a 'lower' social class. The obsession over materially and pride is a major part of what brings the characters to blows later on, and is of course fundamental to their aggressive instincts. This movie was examining the relationship between men and women in the primitive level. When a young hitchhiker joins a couple on a weekend yacht trip, psychological warfare breaks out as the two men compete for the woman's attention. "If two men are on board, one is the skipper." The struggle between the men in the movie, it's based upon this sentence. Both men were trying to prove themselves. It was like woman has to choose one of them in the end. For the reasons knife which is a primitive weapon was turning the power object. The knife not merely as a sign of virility, but also as a metaphor for psychological force in the duel between the two men for the attentions of the woman. Polanski creates a disturbing study of fear, humiliation, sexuality, and aggression with only there people. On the first point, the sexual 'contest' between Andrzej and the Hitchhiker over Christine is clearly the most significant source of aggression in the film. It is also one of the ideas that, as much time as the film spends exploring and depicting it, is hardest to nail down or explain in a reasoned, ordered fashion. Why does Andrzej need to feel so threatened by the Hitchhiker as to become outright aggressive? Of course ? the Hitchhiker's youth and virility, Andrzej's materialistic possessive behavior towards his wife, etc. ? but none of them completely summarize the issue. There is something highly emotional, and highly animistic, about Andrzej's feeling of sexual threat, and it is something I cannot completely understand One of the things that makes the film thriller film outside of the characters that the whole movie is in the middle of the sea. There is nowhere to escape, disconnected from the world around them. The characters are entirely isolated. It is only in this geographical isolation that Andrzej and the Hitchhiker allow their aggression to come out in full, and it is telling that once Andrzej returns to land, and becomes 'un-isolated,' he comes to his senses and feels moral shame for his aggressive actions. The movie try to understand the sources and contexts of aggression in intellectual, ordered ways, they are ultimately studies of the mysterious emotional state that is aggression itself, of the universal human struggles, senseless forms violence takes when stemming from such dense and complicated emotional issues. Knife which is one of the most important figures in the and which is the symbol of manhood movie drowned in the waters of the sea. And everyone's pride is bruised. The movie ends in an interesting way. At this point the woman has a confession to Andrzej. But Andrzej doesn't believe in it. Whether or not he has lost in both cases. I think the only winner of the film is young man. He continues to survive without considering any result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's well-acclaimed feature debut, is the only film he has made in his native country Poland. KNIFE IN THE WATER is an intelligent drama exclusively resolves around three people, Andrzej (Niemczyk), his wife Krystyna (Umecka) and an unnamed young man (Malanowicz) with minimal locations.Middle-aged Andrzej, driving with his much younger wife Krystyna on their way to a daily sailing, en route, Andrzej almost knocks off a reckless hitchhiker, outraged, he still agrees to take the stranger, and eventually invites him to join them together for the excursion, here, Polanski hints the motivation, since the young man claims he doesn't have the faintest about sailing and cannot swim at all, as a man twice of his age, Andrzej's intention to teach him some hard lessons and make himself look good (an ego boost is very much needed because things are not very smooth between him and Krystyna as well) is quite obvious.The journey starts in a predicted direction, Andrzej is the self-claimed captain, as if he were a seasoned seafarer, instructs the young man with basic nautical techniques, teases him for his clumsiness, and gets offended when his yarn turns out to be a bore to his guest. The tension between the two men (two generations) is tangible, but out of courtesy and etiquette, it has been buried underneath the surface, there is even a peaceful period when all of them hide inside the sailing boat and spend a night during an unexpected tempest. The next day, what triggers the falling-out is actually very understated, but a sensitive soul may sense Andrzej's jealousy when he wakes up and finds out both Krystyna and the young man have already been staying outside, there is no inappropriate behaviours between them (as far as what Polanski shows us), but the insecurity of his sexual competence (especially facing the competition of a young man's hormones) pesters him even subconsciously, and soon it evolves into a battle of egos.From the young man's angle, he is not a wide-eyed simpleton, before accepting the invitation, he already betrays his complacency by saying that "he knows Andrzej will ask him to go with them", what does it mean? He is astute enough to predict Andrzej's motivation and is willing to take the challenge, with the fringe benefit of experiencing the middle-class luxury. Considering the time of the Communist Poland, it is an invitation rather tempting for a homeless youngster, but his rebellious nature will not yield to Andrzej's overreaching dominion though, he has nothing to lose, and his knife becomes the symbol of the eminent danger. It is understandable Polanski at that age, decides to side with him to outsmart his rival in the end, thanks to a telling lie ("I can't swim").But the film is not just a duel between two men, Krystyna is the key balance, in the beginning, she is introduced as an unassuming wife with an unprepossessing wig and rather dark complexion. And she is extremely disinterested in the bonding-and-clashing process between the two men, maybe she has witnessed such happenings many too often from Andrzej, and being a dab hand in sailing, one assumes she must have undergone the same tutoring from him, thus she simply has lost any interest in participation. But when she gets close the young man, the undercurrent of sexual tension starts to surface, she sultry sex appeal also slowly unfolds, especially after their song-and- poetry exchange inside the boat, she seems to find a kindred spirit. When the accident occurs, her resentment towards Andrzej explodes, and canoodling with a young man becomes her revenge to their insipid marriage (why woman can only use her sexuality as the weapon to rebel? - that's my disagreement with the film). Then the coda, when the interloper disappears, facing the crossroad, she can triumphantly take the moral high ground and keep this incident as a trumping card without the fabrication of a lie, because the egocentric Andrzej will never believe her story, aka. the truth and admit he has been fooled by the young man, a superb ending with perfect ambiguity.KNIFE IN THE WATER is a bracingly competent debut, largely shuns the disadvantages (e.g. self- absorbed pretension or becoming visually dreary) of a 3-way cast and limited settings, also it contains the accomplishment of its Jazz-fused soundtrack. But if one expects it being a taut thriller, it is not at that tempo at all, a solemn character drama is the right categorisation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense work of minimalist filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often eclipsing Roman Polanski's early and remarkable films are his contemporary allegations, which we've all read about time and time again thanks to endless tabloid cycles that circumvent and reveal nothing new (same goes for Woody Allen), and circumstances as a young child, who saw his mother killed in Auschwitz and himself subsequently enduring many life-or-death situations in order to escape Nazi Germany. When Polanski left Germany in the early 1960's, he was a poor drifter with few belongings and fewer ideas about what he could do to maintain and forge a solid living. His angst and doubt - in addition to ideas of sexual tension and a bitter generational divide - are encapsulated in his debut film, Knife in the Water, a film with only three actors, no extras, an isolated setting, and a script bent on conversation with a venomous bite.The story begins with Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka), an older couple who are driving to a lake to spend time together on their yacht in Poland's Mansurian Lake District. On the way, Andrzej nearly hits a young drifter (Zygmunt Malanowicz) as he wanders onto the road, but makes it up for it by offering the young boy a ride. When the three eventually arrive at the lake, Andrzej, who has taken a liking to the boy's ideas and maturity, offers him to tag along on their yacht. The boy learns a variety of tips about survival and boating from Andrzej, as gestures slowly shift from kindness to hard lessons and two men vying for the attention of Krystyna.After brief sequences on land, Knife in the Water takes place entirely on water, simultaneously freeing its three subjects and confining them to the only kind of stability they know on rough currents - a boat where they cannot escape anyone else on board from a distance. During this time, no other boat or yacht is seen cruising along the water, nor are any extraneous parties referred to or scene throughout the course of this entire film. It's as if this film takes place entirely in a world only inhabited by three people, and the fact that Polanski tackles this kind of ambition through ways of small-scale filmmaking in terms of setting and characters is astonishingly bold for a debut.Knife in the Water is a film of dualities that occasionally conflict but otherwise function germane to one another. As stated, the environment these characters are in is simultaneously restrictive and mentally freeing, despite their choice to use it as a space that closes in on them ever-so slowly with their pervasive bickering. In addition, there's a delightful meshing of older, worn sentiments from a middle-aged man and a young opportunist who possesses drive but lacks willpower and experience to better himself. Finally, there's the titular object of the film, which is lost in the vast sea early on in the film. The phallic representation of the knife could mean many things, but it's ultimately a defining force in the constant battle for Krystyna in which both men engage. The simple is also justifiably representing the discernible sharp edge the three characters bear in their personalities throughout the whole thing, but how minimized and ineffective their stab is once placed in a greater setting (an enormous body of water, with the only other force to work alongside it being the open sky).Knife in the Water is as murky and questionable in its themes and ideas as a filthy body of water, but perhaps such is expected when you bring three troubled characters out on the pure waters of Poland. Polanski shows off a wonderful skill for making the large environment of the endless body of water slowly close in on its subjects as more particular, bitter words are exchanged and a wave of inferiority and inadequacy washes over the characters like a dip in less-than-clean-waters. This is a seriously commendable film in size and scope and an even more fascinating work as an examination of the many dualities and opposing forces, both physical and metaphorical, we see operate on a daily basis.Starring: Leon Niemczyk, Jolanta Umecka, and Zygmunt Malanowicz. Directed by: Roman Polanski.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski's debut is entertaining but not a truly mature effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1962, KNIFE IN THE WATER (Polish: Nóz w wodzie) was director Roman Polanski's full-length debut. Married couple Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are driving to the marina when they pick up a hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz). Though Andrzej is initially angry at the young man for standing the middle of the road, he invites him to come sailing. Once on the boat, tension arises between the two men because of Krystyna sexual appeal and the hitchhiker's poverty versus Andrzej's affluence. Not only is the title a metaphor for the boat as it moves through the lake, but it also refers to the intimidating knife that the young man carries with him.KNIFE IN THE WATER is entertaining enough. The cinematography on the lake and the low-key soundtrack by jazz legend Krzysztof Komeda are memorable. But personally I don't find this to be an especially great film. It feels derivative of Italian cinema of the time, without an original touch. The casting of the weathered, 32 year-old Malanowicz as a 19 year-old student undermines its credibility. I suspect that the film gained so much attention on release due to its risqué nature (especially novel in a film from the Eastern Bloc) instead of its intrinsic merit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bourgeois couple, a jaded sportswriter and his trophy wife, are off to spend a weekend on their yacht. After bickering about her driving, the husband picks up a brash, immature young hitchhiker to spite his wife. The young man joins them on the boat, and the two men knock heads, till the young man's knife ups the stakes, becoming a catalyst for events that will shake all three to their core. Godard says all you need is a girl and a gun for a movie, but Polanski shows a girl, knife and a boat will work just as well. The two males strut and pout their chests, climbing masts and diving in the water in primitive courtship displays. The woman watches and observes, and at the end we realise she has been judging all along. Experience is dismissive of youth, youth is judgmental of age. Polanski uses his actors as framing devices and the jutting angularity of it all matches the stiff sexual tension and suppressed testosterone. The jousting turns ugly at the end, causing the cracks in the marriage to become gaping chasms. The couple reach a point where whichever way they go, their marriage will never be the same again. Subtle, inventive and stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Violation of Chekhov's Principle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Chekhov, if you make people aware of a gun early on in a story, sooner or later someone in the story will have to shoot the gun. If the gun is not going to be fired, it should not be in the story. Now, knives are more common than guns, and are used for mundane purposes, such as cutting the meat on one's plate, so the rule that applies to guns cannot automatically be applied to knives. Unless, that is, it is a wicked-looking, gravity-propelled, telescoping knife with a four-inch, locking blade. When you put a knife like that in a story, then Chekhov's law applies to that weapon as well, and it is required that someone get cut with it.But no one does. Not only is this knife referred to in the title, but it is introduced early on and emphasized again and again. The tension is built up as the knife is used to play a dangerous game of stabbing between the fingers of a spread out hand. It is used again when it is several times thrown across the cabin and into the wall. And it is used to cut the halyard when the sailboat runs aground. This would be like having a gun in a movie, with people showing off their marksmanship or using it for some ordinary practical end. It would not satisfy our need to see the gun used for a more deadly purpose, just as these various employments of the knife do not satisfy our expectation that someone will be stabbed with it. But no one is.Finally, Andrzej takes the young man's knife and throws it in the water. The idea is that the young man was very fond of his knife, and Andrzej threw it in the water out of spite. But in that case, the object might just as well have been a harmonica that the young man was fond of. As it is, the fact that no one got stabbed after all the emphasis placed on the knife leaves us disappointed. Roman Polanski, who directed this movie, must have eventually figured this out, which is why Jack Nicholson got his nose sliced in "Chinatown."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie because of Martin Scorsese's promotion of Polish Cinema and I really didn't understand the hype around it and specially why it was nominated for Oscars. Actually the screenplay is pretty silly. A couple heading for a boating vacation ran into a stranger. For the silliest reason (which was no reason), the husband lets the stranger in the car to ride with them, then again for the silliest reason (which was no reason), he asks the stranger to go on the boat trip with them. In reality a couple go on such trip to have so privacy and intimacy and no one wants a third wheel around. The stranger acts pretty silly and they just tolerate him and the NO STORY goes on. The movie has no direction at all, it has no message. It is nothing. It has no value for a western filmmaker as it bears no inspiration. At best, it's worthy of a film student who takes a camera and makes a film with his friends with virtually no budget to prove that he/she can hold a camera and shoot. 1/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good debut for Roman Polanski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are a fighting couple. He picks up a hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz) in anger. They invite him on their yacht. The young man carries a large knife and flirts with Krystyna. He starts competing against the domineering Andrzej. He claims not to be able to swim. He likes to spread the fingers and play with the knife in between the fingers. Andrzej steals his knife and it falls overboard as Andrzej carelessly throws it to him. They fight and he falls overboard too.It's an impressive feature length directorial debut for Roman Polanski. The boat is pretty small which probably made filming very difficult. The movie has a good amount tension throughout. I would have liked for the movie to start more gently and climax with something more dramatically. Basically the movie starts off tense with the couple and stays at that level for most of the movie. A better build of tension would take this movie from good to great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're just like him, only half his age and twice as dumb."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary line was Krystyna's (Jolanta Umecka) description of the young hitchhiker stated directly to him. She could just as easily have told her husband Andrzej (Leon Niemczyck) the same thing, he being twice the age of the hitchhiker but just as dumb. Reading from the DVD cover of the movie, we're told that this film has 'gut-churning suspense in Polanski's seminal psychological thriller', and in it he revealed his delight in exploring sexual and class boundaries with ruthless precision.Well excuse me for missing all of this, but the main hang-up for me was just how big a jerk Andrzej was. Right from the outset, there was absolutely no reason for him to practically run the guy over with his car, only to wind up giving him a ride and then virtually begging him to board the boat with Andrzej and his wife for an overnight sail. None of what Andrzej subjected the young man to had any motivation behind it that was explained or stated, and it wouldn't have been a big chore to do so to help the viewer understand why Andrzej was acting the way he was. For his part, the actions of the hitchhiker were questionable as well. Why accept the offer for the boat ride when the only interaction between the two men had already had negative consequences? Having read a few of the other reviews presented on this board, it seems the predominant word used to describe the interaction of the two was that of posturing. Well that's all well and good, but in that case, the set up should have done a better job of creating that tension based on Krystyna's presence. Yes it's true she was there on the boat and managed to flaunt her physical attributes in a way to arouse her husband's jealousy, but I never got the impression that 'winning the female' was what the picture was about. The subtext with the knife was always a palpable threat for violence, but that never occurred either except in a marginal sort of way, and it was certainly less than gut-churning.Simply put, it seems that the critical accolades stem from the director's reputation and not on the merits of the picture itself. If there's anything to recommend here it would be the creative cinematography, but it comes with an endurance test of ninety four minutes of waiting for something to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Polanski's First Film Rides The New Wave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Debut for Director Roman Polanski is an Amateur Film made by a Professional. It is a Sometimes Remarkable and Precision Picture from a Perfectionist. Visually it is more Impressive than the Thinnest of Psychological Gamesmanship. It has one Note, the Male Competition among Males to Impress each other. Forget the Female.In this one She is really nothing more than Background or Eye Candy, but and Intelligent Sweetness it is. She doesn't say much but when She does it Cuts Like a Knife and then Retreats to Watch the Game at Hand.The Film Succeeds in Creating an Outdoor Claustrophobia. Polanski hardly uses any Wide Shots that include the Landscape. it is there as Background but is not a Player. That is left for the Boat and the Trio on Board. The Tension Builds and Builds, but is only Released in Trickles, and even the Ending is a bit of a Let Down. Especially after Returning to Land, the Wrap-Up is rather Vague and not very Satisfying.Recommended for Film-Historians and Cinema Lovers, but Casual Viewers may be Disappointed. It is Immensely Introspective and Sure of Hand, and was Compelling Enough for Polanski to be Recognized, Riding the New Wave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling for all the wrong reasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's debut film takes the psychological thriller and turns it on its head. The setting is an enormous lake, filling the frames with lonely shots of endless water and pitting the three characters against a background of eternal damnation. Juxtaposed with this atmosphere are claustrophobic shots of inside the boat when the three get closer in body but further in mind. Essentially, this is a story pitting man against man with woman watching. What makes is so fascinating is Polanski's ability to shift points of view on a dime to help us understand the entire situation all the way around. It was groundbreaking for its time in communist Poland and it continues to defy the way thrillers are made today. Jazz, water and three people make for a thriller that is thrilling for all the 'wrong' reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you will about Roman Polanski but boy, can he direct brilliant movies! This movie was not only Polanski's feature length directorial debut, it also was the first and only Polish movie he had ever done, that immediately earned an Oscar nomination as well.In all of its simplicity, this is a strangely haunting movie. There really is not all that much to its story, which actually only adds to the movie its atmosphere and constant tension. Because we know so very little about the 3 characters in this movie, we as the audience, also never fully know what we can expect from any of them. You could call this a slower movie but never a boring one. It's simply far too intriguing for that.But what also makes this movie great is its approach and visual style. It has some beautiful cinematography and some great compositions in it. Some of the scenes are build up extremely well, especially the ones that consists out of some very long shots. It's a movie made with lots of eye for detail and also with lots of love and passion for cinema. Normally these sort of movies tend to come across as incredibly pretentious but never a Polanski movie! He simply is an unique director, who doesn't need much story or dialog to tell a story, with multiple layers- and depth in it.I won't pretend like I love everything about this movie, it still has its flaws and weaknesses but overall this remains one real intriguing and exceptional movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterful debut from Polanski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knife in the Water is again one of the Polanski films I have set on seeing. It is his debut feature, and all of his talent is present here in this unpredictable, tense, and complex character-driven film.The film enters a sense of ambiguity. It's good not to read too much on it, as the characters themselves are always behind a curtain. We see what they do, and we notice glimpses In their faces that tell their story, yet the reasons for their actions a times aren't always clear. The film itself is completely magnificent. The ambiguity of the characters, along with a well-paced story of events unfolding, creates this intriguing sense of unpredictability and excitement in the story- telling. It takes in the tension of a regular thriller, yet it never is that. Not even as the film continues, and even in the big 'event' that involves the breaking of the triangle, the film continues to surprise up until the ending. Not once did I stop dangling at the edge of my seat.Ultimately, this is a masterpiece. Great direction filled with a brilliant screenplay, it is probably the best debut film I have ever seen, as well as the best foreign-language film ever. I am not overestimating that, just thinking about this film gives me goosebumps. There aren't many films with sort of ambiguities like this, filling up each of the characters and the events of their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Art, Weak Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man and his wife go sailing for the afternoon, taking a hitchhiker with them. As a storm approaches, they are forced to stay on the boat overnight. The threat of violence lurks.This film will be of interest to anyone who admires the work of Roman Polanski. Polanski was said to be only the second protégé of the Lodz Film School to achieve international success. The first was Andrzej Wajda, and we can safely assume that Polanski was far more successful and influential.This film in particular earned him an Oscar nomination for best foreign film, and catapulted him to fame by putting him on the cover of Time magazine in 1963. For me, I think the hype is too much: all I really learned from this picture is that Polanski likes wild jazz music and that in Poland people will steal your windshield wipers.Critic Michael Koresky has a much deeper view of the film, saying it expresses class warfare, class envy, eroticism, tension, isolation and carries an "atmosphere of recumbent terror". This is grossly overstating the facts. There is some tension, and being that the film takes place on boat, isolation naturally follows. But the rest is a bit of a stretch.The class envy or warfare aspect you can only see if told to look for it, which leads me to believe it is probably not there. One man is an author and another a hitchhiker, but any struggle they may have does not appear to arise from class. Eroticism is also a stretch, as I kept thinking the film would become erotic, but it borders on it a few times without crossing over. The closest to anything erotic in this film is a young man in tight shorts, and this is hardly sexually appealing. The atmosphere of recumbent terror is a beautiful phrase but would be better used on another film.The film is strong in the area of visuals. Polanski has made a striking film in contrasting black and white, his angles and use of zooms and wide shots is excellent. So, on a technical level, I cannot say anything bad about the film. But the plot is just not there. I spent the film waiting for something to break... the tension would rise and lower, but never reached a crescendo. I cannot call this one of my favorite Polanski films.</fullReview>

A claustrophobic work that juxtaposes its constraining atmosphere with the expanses of the elements, its setting also perfects an atmosphere to best draw out the essence of its characters. The Puerile competition between the older and younger man creates an almost taboo sense of sensual exuberance as each childishly seeks the attention of the girl. The acting was solid, the direction wonderful, and the camera work sublime. The score substantiated the overall sense of each scene perfectly. The psychological tension was always threatening to turn foul as the games played by all of our players ratcheted up in their subtle cruelties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Polanski for a long time. This is the first time I've seen his debut, and I have to say, he clearly hit the ground running. What a way to begin one's career. He has this ability to use the camera to lull us into a false sense of security, *then* something happens; that is evident here, as well, and in general, the cinematography and editing are the best of this, and subtlety is the name of the game. There is no real violence in this. The conflict is all in hints, what might happen, what you sense between the three well-written, credible and psychologically accurate characters, "trapped" on the water together, isolated. They're regular human beings, and the power struggle that goes on is entirely convincing. Roman makes it all feel real and authentic, as if it's truly happening, and frankly, most of it probably did. The editing is smooth, and there are long takes. This has gradual build-up over time. There are very few FX in this. The suspense and tension is underlying through most of it, and peaking near the end. Unfortunately, the subtitling for this did not get all the lines, but I guess the gist of it was intact. I'm not sure if the religious symbolism in this is intentional or not. There is a little disturbing content and brief female nudity in this. I recommend this to any fan of minimalist thrillers that are driven by normal(not insane) people in a situation you can relate to. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Polanski's First Movie Already Foreshadows A Great Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's first movie is an exercise in human relationships. The movie, quite humble in its resources, manages to make a story out of three people inside a boat. Some have called this movie a thriller, but for me this is a drama with some tense moments.Andrzej and Krystyna, a couple on the way to the marina, pick up a young hitchhiker and give him a ride. Once they arrive at the boat, Andrzej inexplicably invites him aboard. As the day progresses, the two men try to upstage each other: who's faster, stronger, smarter? This is what the movie is about: male competition, and perhaps that attitude we share with peacocks of trying to impress our women with pretty feathers - or in this case, physical challenges.Of all the three characters, Andrzej is the most developed, as he's portrayed as a patronising show off who needs to belittle those around him to feel superior. But the movie itself is strong for the way all characters interact. Polanski has always had a talent for creating unique, unpredictable human relationships - his characters don't behave the way we expect, like other movie characters. They're not necessarily more realistic, just different.As any Polanski movie, Knife In The Water is technically impressive. I've always admired the way he shoots in black and white, this type of cinema was made for people like Polanski, who know how to contrast light and shadow to great effects. And then of course there's the fact he managed to make a whole movie out of three actors and a boat.I don't want to spoil much about the movie, I'll just finish by saying that the ending has one of the most interesting moral choices a character has to make in any movie I've ever seen. There's nothing mysterious or ambiguous about the story - this won't leave anyone scratching their heads thinking what is real and isn't, what really happened; but the situations, simple as they may be, elevate the movie to a moral discussion that seldom exists in movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great first feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Polanski's first feature-length movie offers great black-and-white cinematography, superb directing and a wonderful score. As in many of his later films, Polanski gives a portrayal of only a small group of persons who are locked within a narrow space - there they will have to suffer, there they will have to fight. Quite macabre seems to be the circumstance that the artist was confronted with similar conditions in real life - his youth in the ghetto is just one example. In "Knife in the Water" two man and a woman are confronted with aggressions on what the main character calls a "yacht", in later films ("Repulsion", "Rosemary's Baby", "Frantic",...) terror and fright have their beginning and/or find their culminating peak in flats or hotel rooms. At the end of the 1960s, Polanski's wife Sharon Tate and several of her friends were murdered by some members of the Manson-gang at their new home..."Knife in the Water" is one of Polanski's masterpieces, it is one example of the high level of European cinema around 1960. Just a calm, clear, intelligent film. Just enjoyable!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple , Andrzej and Krystyna is on their way to go sailing.They pick up a young hitchhiker.They invite him to go sailing with them.There he has to learn all this stuff on how to sail.He finds the sexy wife attractive.The tension between Andrzej and the boy builds and eventually he taunts the hitchhiker with the boy's knife.Nóz w wodzie, Knife in the Water in English from 1962 is directed by Roman Polanski.This was his first and only feature film he made in Poland.After this he left to France, then to England and U.S.This is famous for being the first Polish film to show a woman stripping.Krystyna's part is played by Jolanta Umecka.Leon Niemczyk plays Andrzej.The young boy's part, that Polanski himself originally wanted to play went to Zygmunt Malanowicz.Polanski proves that you don't need more than three actors to make a good movie.It never gets boring, there is some tension between these characters.It may not be the best movie by Polanski, the man behind many masterpieces, but it is a good movie nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski's tense debut,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an ominous and provocative title like 'Knife in the Water (1962),' I suppose that I can be forgiven for entering the film expecting a shocking and suspenseful thriller. I spent the entire first half waiting patiently for the Young Boy (Zygmunt Malanowicz) to finally expose his sadistic and murderous tendencies, and to make economical use of his large switchblade knife by dispatching the arrogant husband. Had the film been made today, this is most certainly how the story would have panned out, predicable and uninspired; a film that nobody would be likely to remember in four decades' time. Nevertheless, I must admit that I remain just a bit disappointed with the climax to the film. For the entire running time, director Roman Polanski {with his debut feature-length film} slowly and surely draws together the subtle suspense, the gradually-building tension such that we know that the situation will inevitably explode into a spat of violence. The result is akin to a perfectly-played game of chess that ends in a stalemate.Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk), a rich and arrogant husband, and his beautiful wife Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka), drive to a lake in order to go sailing in their personal yacht. On the way, Andrzej nearly collides with a reckless young hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz), and invites him to ride with them in a sarcastic gesture towards his wife. Once they have reached their boat, Andrzej, more to show off his own wealth than anything else, invites the young man to sail with them for the day, and the offer is willingly accepted. From this point onwards, the general feeling of ill-ease slowly begins to mount, and we learn to treat the hitchhiker's every action with an air of caution, despite his seemingly-innocent, if somewhat juvenile, intentions. Neither of the characters openly acknowledge this antagonism between them, but it's always there, from a wary sideways glance to a casual frustrated uttering. There's also no denying the acute sexual intention between both men and Krystyna, and her casual readiness to display her body in a bikini only intensifies this.If you try to look at 'Knife in the Water' from a purely objective point-of-view, then there's certainly little wrong with the ending, and it's probably the most realistic and appropriate climax for the film to have had. However, I can't shake off the feeling that perhaps all that steadily-mounting apprehension has gone to waste, since the final confrontation between Andrzej and the young man is rather short and unsatisfying. Also, the scene in which, having returned from the dead, the young man manages to seduce the beautiful Krystyna appeared to be taking the sub-plot one step too far, an entirely unexpected and somewhat unlikely scenario; surely a self-respecting wife such as Krystyna could not be coerced into disloyalty so easily. Overall, Roman Polanski's debut film is a interesting beginning to a successful career {even if the comparisons to Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane (1942)' are a tad optimistic}, and there's certainly merit in the film's decision to introduce a large knife into the plot without it ever plunging into somebody's back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The amazing masterpiece of a young director:Roman Polanski in 1962,three years before Repulsion (1965)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In literary and narrative terms,Nóz w Wodzie (1962) is a novella:short,concise,simultaneously straight and enigmatic,a modernist masterpiece of behaviorist psychology.Only three characters;the set is a yacht.The action is unified.It is a thrilling and exciting movie,extraordinary paced and scored (a jazz score).A director has the chance of making such a jewel once in a lifetime.The aesthetic terms,the style are mainly expressionistic: vigor, expressive angles,shocking attitudes, powerful characterization.But this expressionism "sui-generis",this robust approach does not come from Welles,but rather from the Russian and East-European cinema of the epoch.The approach,the style are expressionistic and robust;the subject is that of a novella.The atmosphere results from stylization,expressionism,shocking concision and an Un-flawed pace;the film is also wonderfully scored. There is a gradation in depicting the aggressiveness,the Agonistic exchanges,the psychological aerobatics,the rivalry;one can not speak about jealousy, Nóz w Wodzie (1962) is a thing of rivalry.A trio on a yacht,a short period of time (a day),an impressive exercise,and much more than an exercise.Leon Niemczyk is a surly intellectual,as a matter of fact an idiot,serving his numerous fetishes:his "Morocco" game ,his military and bloke antics,his domineering rancor,picking a quarrel with the blond thug. Jolanta Umecka is an incredibly attractive and erotic woman,with big breasts,a vast behind and copious hips.A piquant beauty,she has charm,and her nude scene is the pinnacle of Nóz w Wodzie .Unfortunately,this woman did not make a career in cinema.Nóz w Wodzie is a masterpiece of expressionistic naturalism,a flawless study of aggressiveness and rivalry. Roman Polanski courageously explores a stratum of social behavior that tries to slip,to pass unnoticed,this violence that shapes numerous lives.In Romania, Nóz w Wodzie (1962) was screened ten years ago,and again this year;I liked it very much then,and I like it even more,and find it even better and impressing now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the film was quite interesting especially the title of the movie which means in English A knife in the Water since most of the movie was filmed while they were on the yacht.But i do have to agree on a comment made about the private yacht and private car in a communist sate. It just doesn't seem to add up. But all in all i think it was very different and some what a unique life of three very complex individuals. The director was definitely going for something out of the ordinary and i think he did a good job of setting us up for something big then letting us down, no director attempts to do that. I think everyone should watch this film and remember to look at it through not only from a democratic standpoint but also a communist, socialist standpoint as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made it 1962, for me this has withstood the test of time, indeedstill likely being ahead of its time. It does things powerfully, butquietly or without a lot of flash at least.A relationship wobbles, ethics are tested, two men vie for onewoman but not in exaggerated, cartoonish plot machinations. Thetension of the film, not just between the two men...but from sceneto scene is never so predictable. And thus it is even edgier...andmore honest.For me this was a fine window on sailing (I've gone out maybe 3times in my life, and never really having to tack or do anything ofconsequence). Time on the ship seemed to be a pretty insistentset of chore after chore after chore. This helped to describe thedetermination of the older male lead, and the structuredrelationship between he and his wife/mistress. Just the fact that the wife/mistress vibe was open, appeals to me. This is a very open film, down to the very last scene.This also an interesting window on another country at anothertime (stealing windshield wipers, that game of draws, I wonder ifwidespread fear and "cocoonification" has stopped hitchhiking inother countries as well.) I thought that was an excellent device toput people together who would not normally interact. And again itwas a deft, understated way to initiate the tension.Polanski's debut sure shows a fearlessness for pursuingtechnique. A modern art film along these lines, would be all tightshots and likely shot simply on a lot somewhere. Casting was sosuperb that the rather disconnected subtitles were never aproblem, I could read the story on the faces of the actors.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski's debut ,an unusual psychological drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as Andrzei,an indeterminate bureaucrat and his bespectacled sophisticated wife Krystyna pick up a hitchhiking student, the photoplay becomes a psychological and eventually a physical struggle between the protagonist and antagonist. Andrzei,much like a Polish Bogart,begins by subtly and then overtly putting the boy down at first by trying to scare him by speeding and then bossing him around until it becomes ultimately physical."Brains over brawn," he quips. For his own part the boy outmaneuvers Andrzei by shinning up the mast and shows latent violence in his habit of stabbing the woodwork with his knife. As with good fiction, there are changes in personalities in all the characters: Krystyna,at first condescending,warms to the vagrant,and Andrzei becomes concerned about him as well. Typical European film style: long takes, action in long and medium shots,few American CUs or "over-the-shoulder" takes,some unnecessary action and dialog,such as the shape of a cloud "like a sheep",altho' this may be symbolic of the boy's view of Andrzei,nice texturing,and some good serene photography of the lake and the motion of the yacht.A good scene is where Krystyna is rapping with the boy while Andrzei is listening to a broadcast boxing match. I have tried to avoid "spoilers".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Polanski directed his first feature film in a hale mood: we are sure of what's going on but the characters seem to be too anxious to reflect on their own behavior. The competition is based on a woman (Christine) and she lets the two men become more and more dangerous to each other. It's a subtle study on vanity. As we become more and more involved, the characters seem to become more vulnerable: they gain their own complexity never losing a truly human resemblance with each other. In Polish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a rather long movie for what it has to say, and I'm not sure what it has to say.A man and his wife (or girl friend) pick up a young hitch-hiker and for no discernible reason invite him to spend the day sailing on the driver's smallish schooner. The older man shows the younger how to handle a sail boat, acting a little pompous in the process. The young man becomes truculent. The two men punch each other and the hitch-hiker falls into the lake. He's claimed earlier than he can't swim although, in fact, he swims well. The older man dives overboard and searches. Unable to find the other guy, he becomes frazzled and swims to shore. The girl is left alone on the yacht.At this point the younger man swims up to the boat, climbs aboard while the girl watches him blankly from a distance. They make love. They finally take the boat in towards the marina and the young man leaps ashore and disappears before they reach it.The driver is waiting for her on the pier. He thinks that the young man has drowned and he feels responsible, talks about going to the police. Driving along in the car, she reveals that she and the younger man played doctor together. He doesn't believe her. He stops the car in front of a sign that read "Police, 5 Miles." The couple sit in silence. Fade Out.Now, this review must sound a little dull, I know, but it's an accurate image of the film itself which is full of irrelevant details, screwy scenes, and non sequiturs. The acting is passable, though the young man's and the girl's voices were dubbed later. The girl, Jolanta Umecka, is rather more than passable. At the opening, with her bound hair, harlequin glasses, and stiffly held neck, she looks like a nerd. When she sheds all those properties and dons a modest "bikini", she no longer looks like a nerd, and her sensuous features have a predatory cast. Wow.But this belongs to early Polanski, like "Cul de Sac." Beautiful babes in a will-of-the-wisp story. He went through a phase of near masterpieces later -- "Rosemary's Baby" and the superb "Chinatown." Lately he's been coming out with films of mixed quality, sometimes as puzzling as his first efforts.I'm leaving out "Two Men and a Wardrobe" because that's borrowed from theater of the absurd and doesn't fit the pattern. I haven't seen any of his earlier work other than those I've mentioned.Some have obviously gotten more out of this than I did. I thought it was okay, but not more than that. Too much pointless rambling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knife in the Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Polanski's "Nóz w wodzie" is a really solid opening debut for the great director. The actual premise seems simple enough on paper, but you have to figure it's a pain to film most of a movie on board a sailboat and somehow keep it from lagging a some point. The characters in this film keep to a certain level of subtlety not giving into physical conflict at least towards the end. A couple, Andrzej and Krystyna(Leon Niemczyk &amp; Jolanta Umecka, the latter dubbed by a professional actress), decide to take on a passenger/hitcher with no apparent name(Zygmunt Malanowicz, whose voice is dubbed by Polanski himself). The first obvious question was what made Andrezej desire to press the young man to come on board..he was about to leave when the man plugs him to go on board with he and his wife on the sailboard trip. We will learn as the trip goes just why he does.We watch as Andrzej and the young man play psychological games with each other. Little layers slowly unfold regarding each character. The hitcher can not swim(..or so he says)and has this knife in his possession that's precious to him. Andrzej is often provoking conflict with the young man showing his narcissistic bent. His knowledge of boating is a sort of authoritative flag he waves over the hitcher. Andrzej has a penchant for ordering the hitcher around telling him to do this and that in regards to keeping the sailing boat on course. If he could, the hitcher would've unboarded much sooner if given the chance because it becomes clear that there's a definite tension present. The age-gap is perhaps a used weapon by both. Andrzej uses his experience as a safety net in certain verbal jabs towards the hitcher, while the young man's energy, athleticism, and unbridled youth are his strengths. With Andrzej knowing that the hitcher can not swim, he plays around with him. It's all about mind-games and the gaining of the psychological edge. The intellectual grudge match culminates when Andrzej tosses the hitcher's knife in the water knowing how important it is to him and that if he wanted it back he'd have to dive in after it.There's also a developing rift that begins to show through in the marriage between Andrzej and Krystyna. The hitcher only aggravates that rift more with his mere presence on board because Andrzej can not help but needle at him. Having a edge over another seems to be an amusement that thrives in Andrzej, not only over the hitcher, but his wife. During the drive to the dock, we see shades of a slight rift forming as Andrzej disapproves of his wife's driving. On board the boat, we watch as he orders her around by giving her various duties claiming someone has to be the skipper of the boat and that would obviously be Andrzej. But, when it appears that the hitcher has drowned, the marriage's decline heightens. Andrzej will have to come to a decision about informing the police about the hitcher's possible death. But, what if the hitcher isn't dead, but is gaining his own psychological advantage? The film takes an interesting twist in regards to the "relationship" that grows between the young man and Krystyna which might spell out just how far the wife is willing to go in her own way towards getting a psychological advantage over her husband.I think the film succeeds best at being this tug-of-war which can come to the surface when certain individuals are together in a certain location too long. On board this boat, it's hard to get away from confrontation and we always see the two men trying to get under each other's skin. It's clear they both enjoy taking swipes at each other while the female quietly observes taking an advantage when she can.I really liked this movie because it is a quietly intense film. Wonderfully photographed and spontaneous. It's a given, this is a film that might alienate others expecting some sort of violent resolution as it appears either of the males will summon up enough anger to fire the crushing blow in a physical form. But, Polanski wishes to not make this film about landing physical blows, but mental ones. Getting under the skin by way of that perfect verbal insult is what really means a lot to the males(..and perhaps female). This sort of machismo, if you will, is fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics schmolitics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film raises the problem of how much the background information of the film should influence one's interpretation. Apparently, Polanski wanted to play the hitchhiker himself, hence it would seem that, of the three characters, the young man is his mouthpiece. Only after understanding this does the film as a politically controversial work make any sense. And we have a relatively weak critique of bourgeoisie society and the still existent privileged few all that jazz.But why do we feel compelled to do this? Why does everything need to be politicized? Those who are fixated on and impressed by this as a satire are missing out on the film as the carefully manipulated suspenseful ride it really seems to be. The film is also interesting as a stepping stone as the first example of a truly innovative and influential narrative, one steeped in manipulation but also in this intimate relationship he holds with the viewer. And the shorts on the Criterion DVD are marvelous and should be essential viewing for film students.It would be great if Welles' version of the story ever gets released in its unfinished form.3 out of 5 - Some interesting elements</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elemental and powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Knife in the Water" is one of the really great films. It is elemental and archetypal. Although he made it at only 29 on a shoestring budget (while in Poland), it is certainly Polansky's most unique and striking work, and perhaps his best. This is despite a substantial work of influential, powerful and complex major works, including e.g. Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, Repulsion, Tess, Frantic and Bitter Moon. It's power is spare and elemental, but very emotional. It is a visual tone poem, in black and white, with subtitles.After a brief initial car trip setup scene where an attractive married couple pick up an attractive 19 year old male student hitchhiker, and then the husband invites him to spend the weekend sailing with them, the entire film is set on a pocket cruiser sized sailboat, perhaps 26 ft. (9 m) long. It is just big enough to have a small cabin below where three or four people can sleep on air mattresses. Three people, one small overnight sleeping sailboat, and the surrounding scenery of the very large lake where they are all alone, is the setting for this intense interpersonal drama. Keep in mind however that this is in Communist Poland in 1962. Having a boat such as this is a mark of high status and privilege. The cocky mid to late 40's husband, and the beautiful and self assured mid 20's raven-haired wife as well, convey the same.And yet this is not at all a stagey, play-like move. Visuals are overwhelmingly what communicate to us here. There are long stretches with no dialog, and what there is is always poem like in its economy. Most interaction is conveyed by body language, including wonderful facial expressions, especially by the gorgeous and very sensual female lead, but also including all manner of other body motions, ballet like, while they harness the wind and respond to each other's challenges. As a sailor, who's first owned boat was only a bit larger than the one in this film, this is also my favorite sailing movie. And if I haven't seen them all, I've certainly seen a lot. The film is all about character revelation, layer after layer, as they deal with a gamut of fairly minor sailing challenges on a summer weekend, and as the husband's agenda of subtly dominating the vigorous young man becomes increasing clear to all. The college student becomes increasingly subtly resentful. Tension between them and especially within the student, while the young trophy wife sometimes dampens or diverts the tension, but mostly while she sits back and enjoys the contest with what we intuit and then learn is her own agenda, feels increasingly like a powerful spring ready to explode. An outright knifing of the husband seems foreshadowed by the increasing camera attention to the student's large retractable knife, and then their knife throwing competition. The young guy is a mystery. He looks caged, ready to explode. He could be a violent criminal, who the husband is taking far too many chances with. And then violence does explode -- but not in quite the way we have been expecting. This sets the stage for conflict and its resolution between the stunning young wife and her successful and handsome older husband. Much of what makes this film so interesting is that all three characters are so strong. They are three predatory leopards beneath a reasonably polite surface, circling each other, sniffing for weakness. This is most definitely true of the twenty something woman as well. We start to see this in her easy confidence and mastery of the sailing -- clearly something she has learned from him, but something she has made her own as well. As the contest between the two men develops she enjoys it, and does little to stop it -- she only seeks to set some channeling rules, which are violated. In fact, though she begins as principally a beautiful ornament, she becomes the most interesting character of the film. The final scene in their car as they are stopped at a literal and figurative crossroad, is especially thought provoking.In a revealing and fascinating moment after the feared drowned student has returned to the boat, and starts trashing the husband who has swum to shore to quell his wife's accusations that he as "murdered" the student, she stops him, and tells him that really her husband and he are a lot alike, only at different stages in life. He too will make it, she stays, if he stays focused on that, as her husband did. Her husband and her as well were up from the bottom like him she says -- and then relates a litany of tough conditions which she taunts he is about to wear proudly as his badge. Six to a room, etc., etc. This scene, and the fascinating final one in the car, are probably the only two which are carried principally by dialogue.Some earlier commentators have said that as the weekend progresses, we can see there is trouble under the surface in their marriage. Well, yes and no. Mostly no, I think. I think their relationship has more love and passion than most of any duration. At a guess they've been together about four or five years. We see her love and admiration for her husband in some of the looks she gives him when he's looking elsewhere. We also see moments of knowing bemusement. But there is something of a power imbalance. We know that it was he who raised her up from poverty, and that he reminds her of this from time to time. This is not the source of any intense resentment, but something that has begun to bother her under the surface. She is looking for opportunities to balance that -- and finds one over the weekend. The final scene, in their car again, subtly announces the new balance. It is clear that she will never let him know for sure what happened. Her matter of factly stating it, in a way that she knows he will initially discount, is perfect. She has thoroughly seized the high ground over the events of the weekend, which was not at all inevitable. It's a weekend none of them will ever forget. Nor will we.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Contains sarcasm! Having just seen Polanski's "Repulsion" a few days before, I was expecting at least a bit more depth in the drama, but I was sadly disappointed. The best thing I can say about the 94 minutes wasted is that it reveals in the second half that the woman is actually very good-looking and sexy. The second best thing is the nice cup of tea I had.Others have mentioned the "film gris" - B&amp;W with very little contrast. Students of film history might want to find out if it was intended or if the quality of the film-making equipment in Poland under communism simply meant that it was the best result that could be obtained. For the general public that is less interested in such fine points, a digital brush-up of this film could do wonders, but I can already hear the Polanski bigots howling. Besides, this would be throwing good money after bad: The plot wouldn't become a bit more interesting.Certainly, the film does build up some tension - will the hitch-hiker become violent and use the knife? Will he attempt to rape the woman? But no, nothing out of the ordinary happens. The woman is unfaithful, but that is one of humanity's oldest dramas, and it happens every day somewhere. But as others have said, what is the point making a whole movie just to show that a woman may want to have an affair? Unless you absolutely MUST see this film because it's Polanski's first, don't bother. The star in Halliwell's Film Guide must have been meant for some other movie. Contrary to wine, movies do not get better with age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I firstly saw Nóz w Wodzie sometime in the sixties. Throughout the years I forgot some details of the plot, while I kept the essential. I remained with the impression of one of the greatest movies ever. I watched many other of Polanski's works, none of them has succeeded to replace this one in my soul. Many of his movies are great, this one is unique. By the purity of his minimalism? Maybe. You see, his other works started from very generous stories, offering full potential to create great movies. This one has practically no story. A couple is driving their car toward a lake for two days of sailing, a hitch-hiker appears as of nowhere, they invite him to join, their stay on the boat is tensioned by obscure conflicting impulses, a fight takes place, the unknown guy leaves toward nowhere. Drowned (as the male believes)? Alive (as the female knows)? Or is it just the woman imagination? After many years I encountered the movies of Kim Ki-Duk. 3-Iron made Nóz w Wodzie come to my mind. It seemed to me that both movies were sailing on the same waters. I related 3-Iron to Nóz w Wodzie, and then I related all Kim Ki-Duk films to 3-Iron. They are exploring two universes: ours, where what matters is a good job, a good car, a good house, a good marriage (to be read a spectacular wife), and the other universe, where everything is just absurd (by our standards). The hitch-hiker in the movie of Polanski, the drifter in the movie of Kim Ki-Duk, are just visitors: our reaction is of open hostility (if we are the subjects in our world), sometimes of obscure attraction (if we are rather the objects, dreaming escapes). Hostile or attracted to them, it happens the same: they remain just visitors, we'll never know anything about them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good-looking Polish couple nearly run into a hitch-hiker. Five minutes later, depending on how good your subtitle translation is, they're justified in inviting him to go yachting with them.Young Polanski made some beautiful films in black and white, all influenced by Hitchcock. This one, his first feature-length, is well regarded, and has been given the full Criterion treatment, yet it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I can think of many interesting films centred on boat-rides. The African Queen, Apocalypse Now, Dead Calm. Most of them lack focus. I'm personally not a fan of most of them, but in this case I found this film picked up a sense of motion once the boat-ride started. The motives of the characters was unclear to me due to a poor subtitle translation with many untranslated passages (Australian release distributed by Umbrella, always a port of something else. Definitely not Criterion.) But despite allowing for gaps of dialogue, I can't imagine any justification that would make me accept why a man would invite a stranger onto his private boat along with his beautiful wife; and then not even seem bothered when she lies around in her bikini and begins looking longingly at the hitchhiker.Also, the jazz score feels inappropriate at times, being not composed specifically for the film, and suggesting a carefree mood, rather than a purpose-composed score which might have suggested something deeper or sinister going on underneath the placid surface of the film.CONCLUSION: surprised I was ambivalent, when I've loved all other early Polanski.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting experiment with a lot to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's 1962 debut feature is based on an ingenious concept- a thriller where nothing really happens, based simply on human interaction and human nature. Polanski's work here is certainly promising, in particular his use of off-screen space. The atmosphere is successfully claustrophobic and the film has a lot on its mind regarding Communism, social classes, and basic human and sexual nature. The jazzy score fits the film and was very good (although it caused my neighbors to enter my apartment thinking they would catch me watching porn). The film would have worked better as a thirty, forty minute short as the characters are not interesting enough to justify a 94-minute running time. The film may not have deserved the exuberant attention it received but it is an interesting piece of pure cinema, certainly worth seeing.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I don't believe that this is Polanski's masterpiece! It is his full-length debut, after all. It would sure be hell-of-a-lot better if he DID take the hitchhikers role himself(look at the trivia). I think my best Polanski films are those in which he stars, my best being THE TENANT.Anyway, this is chilling, with dark (maybe too dark at some points) cinematography, good acting and realistic. This is no sorry-a$$ 60's American psycho-thriller, this is no thriller actually. But it builds a thriller like atmosphere managing to confuse the viewer on the "where does he take it to" matter, which is a good thing by the way.I can't imagine how this would appeal 42 years from now, but even by today standards, it is original and far from the cheap thrill served by Hollywood. I understand why this is considered a classic, not only because it is of course Polanski's first feature, but also because it is a powerful film alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski's first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first movie of Polanski that was known internationally and it started the career of one of the most gifted and most controversial directors of our times. Realized in Poland at the start of the 60s it refuses completely to say anything political, to be enrolled in the system or to say anything against it. By doing this the film is not at all typical for East Europe cinema of the time. If it has anything political in it, it's rather the total refusal to say anything political, and focuses on the relation between the characters. There is nothing in the film that locates the story in a communist country, it could have happened as well in the US or Australia. If there is any message it is that human emotions are the same all over and transcend political systems.We can already see here the signs of a huge talent and the basic ingredients of future famous movies of Polanski. His skill in directing his actors, the gradual building of tension with minimal means, his fascination to beautiful women and hidden eroticism are all present. A few beautiful takes are really of anthology, especially the opening scene, and the picture taken from the mast, with the young boy looking like Jesus in medieval movies on the deck of the boat. The story may be a little disappointing for today's taste, with the game of power between the two men painfully built for much of the movie being solved in an outbreak of violence that is too diluted and looks not too credible but we are compensated with an open ending that avoids any rhetoric. It's a movie to see, and not only for historical reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Knife, it's a threat to a husband, and hope to his wife. This film is great because you can view two ways. First, at the start, man and woman changed their seats. I think it's the most important part. It must be the beginning. I call it some kind of a cinematic device, established by Antonioni, to make you look inside of you. You can simply enjoy what is happening on the silver screen, but some people who noticed that part makes them look inside. I think it's the great point. You can enjoy the touch and go situation, tension between 3 characters, thrilling story of an love affair, but other way, to think what was exactly that woman is afraid of? Thanks polanski to navigate us inside human, so we can look to something more interesting. This is called poem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, folks, but "Knife" just doesn't cut it for this kid. The plot -- what there is of it -- is too well known to harp on here.... I saw it for the first time last night on Turner Classic Movies (sans commercials). After decades of accolades, I was eager -- and wound up with 94 minutes of stupification. Even for Polanski, whose "Chinatown" and "Rosemary's Baby" I applaud wildly, "Knife" is pretentious -- and boring, too.... But then I'm also the guy who couldn't find a laugh in Kramer's "Mad, Mad, Mad World." Maybe it is just me. H'mmmm.... Try "Dead Calm" to see what the old three-people-and-a-boat setup can really do to grip and excite you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten Stars, Again, After 42 Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in 1962, and I saw it again this afternoon, 42 years later. It's still a stunner. The black-and-white cinematography, steeped in quiet naturalism, is just gorgeous. Polanski's dialogue is spare and slowly revealing, like good theater. And the plot is a classic: A powerful older man and his enticing young wife, bound for a day of sailing alone on the water, take onboard with them an inexperienced but sexually charged young man, and eventually the woman -- on whose curves the camera focuses relentlessly during the entire trip out -- mates with the mate.If the older man kills the younger man, you've got a tragedy. If the younger man kills the older man, you've got an Oedipal tragedy. If the drama ends with each of the characters back on land and very much alive but nevertheless trapped by contradictions in their natures that we now better understand, you've got plot development and ambiguity that stick with you after nearly half a century and that spell art with a capital A.Indeed, the older man is cruel and possessive, but not unreflective. The young man is unsophisticated, but not guileless. The woman is protective and a peacemaker, but she lives with a man who bores her and yet is only too ready to tell the other to shove off. As the psychodrama plays out, we learn that the boat owning couple are bound, on one level, by money and class, but on another level by the wife's interest in understanding an old incident between them, the parallel of which transpires on their day on the water -- an incident that might help to define the willingness of the older man to accept responsibility for the injuries his actions may be viewed as causing. The final scene, which shows his car stopped at a crossroads -- with home in one direction and the police station in the other -- serves as a metaphor for this moral ambiguity.Is Knife in the Water about the human condition or Eastern Europe during the Soviet regime? Is Chinatown about something inscrutable or the making of modern Los Angeles? Darned if I know, but they're both great movies by a great director.</fullReview>

The Criterion DVD quality is perfect, and comes loaded with an extra disc of Polanski's short films.

As the three of them go out to sea, their characters are revealed layer by layer and it soon becomes evident that all may not be well within the marriage. All three characters communicate differently, and a strangely open relationship grows between the wife and the hitchhiker. Director Roman Polanski does the best work of his distinguished career here--he lets the drama unfold realistically and although much appears to be the same at the end of the movie as it was in the beginning, as a viewer you get the unmistakable feeling that each character will carry the experience around with them for the rest of their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very creative and surprisingly interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film more than I thought I would. Perhaps this was because the last Polanski film I saw was REPULSION--a technically well-made but repulsive film (that few average people would ever want to see). It is a very simple story with only three characters but manages, somehow, not to bore the viewer or give in to what is expected. For example, when the couple met the hitchhiker, I expected the old cliché of the "psychotic drifter" who would ultimately terrorize and/or kill them. But, as the film unfolded, I kept waiting and waiting and waiting and he never dismembered or terrorized them at all. In fact, one of the OTHER main characters turned out to be the jerk! Now that's interesting.Why not an even higher score? Well, the ending of the movie just didn't make sense. The nasty husband jumped overboard to try and rescue the drifter but the husband appears to have drowned. BUT, when the wife and drifter take the sailboat back to shore, the nasty husband meets the boat!!! How could this have happened unless maybe there was a submarine in the lake that rescued him?! My daughter thinks maybe he could walk on water, but that's a pretty rare occurrence. This is a pretty big mistake, now that I think about it--and it's a shame since the rest of the movie is so good.ADDENDUM--I received a message on IMDb from Chris-Krzysztof indicating that this was NOT the way the film ended. His post is given below:"I guess you missed something in the subtitles or there was something "lost in translation". After having searched the boy for some time the couple thinks he had drowned, they have a fight and when the husband disappears, he's not searching the boy anymore, but he's swimming to the shore to a police station to confess what happened (mostly to prove his wife he's not a coward). In the morning, they meet at the shore (the husband of course didn't have enough courage to go the police, he's making excuses that it was in the night, he was almost naked, couldn't get into the car - the keys were on the yacht). When they leave the marina, he stops the car at the crossroads, where we can see a sign (not sure if it was translated) "Do posterunku MILICJI obywatelskiej, 10 km" (To the POLICE station, 10 km). And the car remains there, so we don't know which way he chooses ... "As I responded to him, in the version I saw, this is not how the ending was translated. Considering I think Chris speaks Polish, I am sure he is right. However, many older films exist in multiple versions and translations and I think the version I saw was mistranslated. As a result, I am adding this addendum to clarify things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this hadn't been a Criterion disk, I would have thought at first that it was a panned-and-scanned copy of a widescreen film, the use of off-screen space is so profound. And it feels, at first, like it should be widescreen -- the empty landscape, long straight road, the couple sitting far apart in the front seat of their car -- it must have been a shock to a lot of cinema-goers 45 years ago. This is Polish cinema? This looks like French or Italian cinema -- Antonioni, or Godard, or Truffaut perhaps. And though there are some superficial resemblances, finally, it's something quite different.The couple picks up a young hitchhiker and the older man invites him -- or perhaps coerces him -- along for a ride on their sailboat. All the elements are in place for a thriller, a murder perhaps or a sexual game play; the man's wife is much younger and quite attractive, and seems quite bored, though of him, of the sailing, or of life itself we cannot tell; she is a cypher through much of the film.Tension, tension, tension -- and little happens. And when it does, do we really care? We're concerned I suppose to see whether the status quo is broken, to see if the wife and husband come to verbal blows, or the young man and the increasingly sadistic husband enter a physical altercation. When finally there is an "event" that seems to forbode a major change, even a catastrophe in the situation, we wonder if it will even matter....I loved the photography, the beautiful tight, cramped and yet desolate compositions of boat, a human or three, and water and sky; the jazzy score; the acting, even of the much-maligned Jolanta Umecka who seemed to me to have the perfect blankness for such a role (she could have been wonderful for Antonioni); but I was unmoved at first. It really wasn't until a day later, thinking it over, that I grasped the greatness of it all, the showing of an event of profound internal significance -- possibly to all 3 characters -- but of no practical importance whatsoever. Is this the first "thriller where nothing happens"? I don't know, but it is certainly one of the more successful examples.Beautiful Criterion DVD (I didn't have time to watch the shorts alas).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobia even thicker than Hitchcock's "Lifeboat"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's first feature length film is a character-driven thriller about three characters that purposefully and pointedly strand themselves together on a boat. A rich husband and wife pick up a hitchhiker and, for seemingly no reason whatsoever, invite him to come sailing with them. A power-play develops between the husband and the youth, with several Freudian nods towards the woman, and after a while it becomes clear that though they seem to be simply showing off, they are immersed in something nearing a deadly struggle which always is within an inch of showing itself. Come an important action, and later the woman reveals her own fight for power in the small narrative.It's dialog is noteworthy, but even more interesting is the cinematography: the boat can't be much bigger than the set of Hitchcock's Lifeboat, but Polanski puts the camera wherever possible to create the most claustrophobic frames. Oftentimes a person in the foreground will block off half the frame while the two other characters will talk or do other things, the camera will end up in places almost impossible to fathom, or with a jolt you'll realize that the camera isn't even on the boat at all, and the boat detaches, showing the three cramped onto such a little platform to remind you how personal they're making this event.There are some interesting individual moments that speckle this film, as well. The first image of the couple driving, their faces hidden in shadow, reminds me strongly of Svankmajer's short, "The Hedge," and it's a very surreal image, already setting off an uncanny feeling of uneasiness. Also, one image of the youth lying on the mast, his head on a piece of coiled rope, makes him look like a Mesiah-image, his arms spread across the boat and his feet crossed like Christ on the crucifix, and the coiled rope making a halo. It's too precise to be unintentional, but I also don't see the youth as much of a Christian figure..."Knife in the Water" is definitely a skilled beginning that lead the way to a very stunning career. Any filmmaker should be proud to create such a tightly-wound debut.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski is at his best as a filmmaker when he focuses on the realist and small moments of horror in a human life. When he goes a bit overboard, and into the grotesque or surreal, such as in The Fearless Vampire Killers, or: Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Neck, Rosemary's Baby, or Chinatown, his films tend to lose their way, even if still good. When his focus remains tightly on the real, such as in Repulsion or The Pianist, his films are amongst the best on screen. His very first feature film, 1962's Knife In The Water (Nóz W Wodzie), is more in line with the latter films, and as such, is one of the best debut films in cinema history, and was even a nominee for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1963 Academy Awards, where it lost to Federico Fellini's 8?.Filmed in black and white, not long after Polanski finished film school, the 94 minute film features only three characters- not a single other actor, not even an extra, and is a taut psychological exploration of masculinity and testosterone. Yet, despite that, it's a stretch to term the film a 'thriller,' as many critics have. There is very little action in the film, at least in a material sense. The real crux of the film revolves about the mental games that the two male characters play with each other, to impress the lone female in their group. In a sense, the film has much in common with many of the American television dramas of the 1950s, even though it was filmed on a real lake.The film opens with a married couple driving in the countryside, early one Sunday morning. They are headed to their boat on the lake. He is a fortysomething, dark-haired sportswriter and avid sailor, named Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk), while his brunet wife, Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka), is a bit younger, nearing thirty, and at first seems a bit chunky and nebbishy, as she wears cat-like granny glasses. As the film progresses, she will appear more and more svelte and sexy, and it is this subtle evolution which seems to kick the two males into overdrive. The third character is a blond hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz), in his early twenties, whose name is never revealed throughout the film. Andrzej nearly runs him down on the road, then offers him a ride, seemingly to show off his prowess in front of his wife. He rides with them to the deserted marina, and is about to take off, when Andrzej offers to let him come on the trip on their sailboat, the Christine. After first declining, the young man accepts, stating he knew Andrzej would ask. This is his first upping of the ante, as he lets it be known that he is no na?f. Krystyna merely watches the two men tangle, early on?. Another thing that sets the film apart from lesser works is that it was very cogent in its critiques of Soviet dominated Poland, yet it still works today at a more personal level. As example, in its day, there was a direct stab at the supposed classlessness of a Communist society, for the married couple are obviously well off Party apparatchiks- replete with a fancy car, yacht and apartment, who worry if their windshield wipers will be stolen, if they leave their car for a day. They are stolen, at film's end, but even such a worry says much for the dire state of things in the Soviet bloc. The young hitchhiker is the common man, the young idealistic sort that totalitarian states despise, and a good deal of the tension between the men has to do not only with testosterone, but with class differences. But, it is the testosteronic tension that still resonates and carries the film today. Also, there is a Twilight Zone-like otherworldliness to this film that also resonates. After all, it's a Sunday morning, there are many other boats docked in the marina, but only the three characters in the film are boating, as if they are occupying some usually unseen portion of an Apocalyptic film's world.Knife In The Water is a quiet film, unlike showier Hollywood knockoffs, thus why it still works, and has not dated. It could be set in any part of the world over the last hundred or so years, for the setup is timeless, even if Polanski's denouement is unique. If Andrzej wins, and the youth is really dead, there is the classic might makes right motif. If the youth dispatches Andrzej, then there is the classic father/son conflict, but if the film ends with all three surviving, and with the woman holding the upper hand in a conflicted state between the three, then the narrative has taken a turn toward realism and depth with strong claims to being great art. Polanski makes all the right choices in this film. That all the 'action' takes place in about a twenty-four hour period only heightens the intensity of the subtle gamesmanship on all three parties' parts, and allows the narrative to be both naturalistic, yet also classically dramatic. When one can get 'the best of both worlds,' to such a degree, one is accomplishing a lot, and Roman Polanski's Knife In The Water does that and much more. Would more art supply the 'much more' it often promises, works like this film would not surprise and delight the viewer to such a satisfying degree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Communism and Feminism in Knife in the Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knife in the Water may not be a very remarkable film if taken literally, but I believe it primarily functions as social criticism and it does so in a way that's quite remarkable.Knife in the Water is an allegory of Communism in which the older man (Andre) represents the bourgeois (he is clearly wealthy, he owns a car and a boat when few own either) and the younger man represents the proletariat (he's clearly very poor).At one point the woman compares the young man to Andre; she says they aren't really different- he was a poor student just like the younger man once. He managed to put aside his impoverished past- one might even say he's forgotten it. This is similar to the way student protest leaders became the leaders of government after they overthrew the old guard. The older man's disrespect for what is essentially a younger version of himself is symbolic of the attitudes of the Communist leaders who found themselves unable to identify with the powerless once they were no longer powerless themselves.So far in this analysis I may have made it seem as if I believe the wife's only function in the film is as a neutral observer. That's essentially correct, but the reason for that is quite relevant. While Communists such as the Bolsheviks were ostensibly working for the rights of the "most" oppressed people (i.e. the working class) they tended to ignore the rights of a more thoroughly oppressed group-women. For each of the men in the film, she is nothing more than a prize to be competed over. We know the older generation oppresses people, but the sad truth is that the group symbolized by the boy start off as oppressors themselves. Even those men who view themselves as the oppressed take comfort in knowing they at least have power over another group.In spite of her lack of real power, the woman is able to have vengeance on her most powerful oppressor-her husband-by cheating on him with the boy. By identifying herself with her husband's enemy she finds a way to have power over him. Her husband is so used to her weakness that he finds the idea of this power remarkable; he takes if for a jest when she informs him of her defiant act in as straightforward a way as possible.Knife in the Water is a strong social critique of the country and time period in which it was made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe "Knife in the Water" is the most perfect film I've seen. Roman Polanski has done with film what Mozart did with musical notes: created a flawless gem.Throughout "Knife in the Water," the theme of skill recurs. Sailing looks simple but it isn't unless you've mastered the considerable skills required; knife play looks easy but requires a "delicate touch"; the game of jackstraws (pick-up sticks) seems absurdly simple till you play it for the first time. I couldn't help thinking the same applies to film: Polanski tells a simple story using seemingly simple means, but how maddeningly difficult this film must have been to make, physically!This engrossing psychological study is set in the midst of langorously bleak and beautiful Polish countryside and marshland, and never have I been more grateful for the gift of black-and-white photography. Color would have spoiled the mood and effect.If I could have rated this film higher than ten, I would have. It's another of those I was long overdue to see, and having seen it, I will now recommend it to all my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Polanski Masterpiece - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski creates a masterpiece by suspending three people in a stark grey world unto themselves. Two men, one older and the other a young college student. The older man is certainly more jaded but no more mature. Still out to prove his manhood/ superiority by trying to dominate and make a fool of the younger one. The younger man attempts to mock the older one's bourgeois world as his means of attack. (Interesting how the men's names in this film are not once mentioned, perhaps a metaphor for their lack of really wanting to know or understand each other) The younger wife of the older man looks as if she's resigned herself to this kind of behavior in men and seems to expect it. There's an attraction/repulsion between these two men that is intriguing to watch and subtly humorous. Like the way the older man couldn't quite let the younger one go off on his way as he was preparing the boat for sail, and the younger one half waiting around to be asked to join them. They seem to want to like each other but can't quite let go of their contempt for each other and perhaps for themselves. What transpires on film over the course of their day together is pure cinematic genius. It baffles me how some other commentators on this film find it difficult to perceive a point or find something of the profound in the course of events. It seems to abound here as the tension ebbs and flows and comes to a sort of oblique climax. The tension mostly stays just below the surface but is always ready to erupt. I love the scene where the boy is quietly relaxing staring at the sky and suddenly says "sheep" and the older man sitting within ear shot with his wife shouts out "who?". Then the younger one says "that cloud, it looks like a sheep" and then again the tension recedes below as the older man looks at the sky to try and see the sheep in the cloud as it drifts apart. The destructiveness and self defeating effects of man's ego driven competitive nature is laid bare here. The woman doesn't really seem to be taken with young student until while under cover inside the boat, during the rain, he demonstrates a introspective poetic quality while making up an impromptu poem, you can see on her face she's enjoying it. While the husband mostly tries to ignore it with his radio broadcast of a boxing match stuck in his ear. The husband only seems interested in playing more games to demonstrate his superior skills at anything the younger man might try, including throwing the knife into a cutting board on the wall after he see's the younger one do it.The ending is perfect, the older man left sitting uncertain at the crossroads in his car, his wife knowing and having spoken the truth smugly seems half amused at his dilemma. The man too closed to what his wife might be able to offer him in his confusion, stuck in his self image of superiority. Classic film not to be missed.</fullReview>

The obvious ones come to mind("Chinatown", "Rosemary's Baby") and I actually like some of the not so obvious ones ("The Tenant"), and so I had wanted to see this film for years after hearing all of the wonderful things critics have said aboutit. Well, after having seen it, I'm surprised that Roman Polanski ever managed to get work in Hollywood. It's a pretentious and boring tale of a man and his wife who almost run over some idiot standing in the middle of the road and then ask him to come along with them as they make their way to the marina to go sailing(HUH?). Later the so called hitchhiker pulls out a knife and starts acting like a mental patient and instead of ditching the guy they act as if it's no big deal, as if most people carry a knife big enough to gut a crocodile. We would have all been better off if the hitchhiker had killed them inthe first twenty minutes so we would be spared the agony of having to sit through this mess. I'm sure some people will disagree with me but think twice before you waist your time.</fullReview>
