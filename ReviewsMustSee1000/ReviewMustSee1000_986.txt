		<shortDescription>Excellent performances by Stewart and Moaadi, moving storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moving and emotionally charged performances by both Stewart and Moaadi from beginning to end. I was completely surprised by the subject matter of Gitmo, expecting a political message as the underlying theme, but it turned out to be a study of humanity and relationships within extreme circumstances. Impressive directorial debut of Sattler. Stewart plays guard Amy Cole, a young marine from a small town who joined the military to escape her life. The movie centers around the conflict of her growing relationship with a prisoner, Moaadi, who has been in Gitmo for eight years. Both actors do justice to the storyline and these complex characters without building caricatures of military and extremist personalities. I'm not one for heavy military story lines, but I was pleasantly surprised by this film's twist to the Gitmo plot with a narrow lens on the people, not the politics. It's not all heavy subject matter....Moaadi adds some appreciated humor. Bottom line: worth my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Camp X-Ray is one of those films that doesn't quite leave you after the credits roll. It wasn't what I was expecting and I was surprised the film didn't revolve around politics. The cinematography, the soundtrack, including the constant hum in the background all formed a very real atmosphere. Visually, Camp X-Ray is impressive, but the real essence of the film does lie in the characters. The acting is some of the best I've seen. 80% of the film takes place on opposite sides of a cell door. We catch a small glimpse through a small glass window, and yet this is enough to feel the chemistry between Peyman Moaadi and Kristen Stewart. I can't even begin to imagine the difficulty at capturing what they did through a window, but it appears effortless. The characters are incredibly fleshed out and there are some small hints of this, such as a glimpse of Cole wearing socks with sandals. A personality statement in itself. It's all about the small things!I do think a big part of why this film affected me so much is because of my age. I saw parts of Cole in myself.She wants to make a difference, she's seeking a way to push herself and the army is a straight forward way of doing that. It pushes your limits, it goes against what women should really do, and by doing that you're trying to prove something within yourself. You're tougher and braver than you appear. Yet put in this situation, things aren't so straight forward or 'black and white' as she expresses. Life is so much more complicated, relationships develop, experiences happen that throw you off course.Then there's the added uncertainty of everything, the frustration of not knowing, wondering whether this is right? Whether this is what you want to do? Whether it's okay to speak to this guy? Questioning what you have always been taught is right and wrong.I do feel that a lot of films tend to portray women as tough, fearless and almost masculine, but underneath the tough front, I think we all really are vulnerable. There's no escaping that. It's easy to act like things are okay, to put on a tough front, to hide, but there's still always going to be that vulnerability...maybe it goes as you get older, I don't know.In the end she discovers her way own way of making a difference, in a way that at the beginning of the film would have been unimaginable, and it just shows how much can change, how little we know, and how important it is to keep an open mind.Overall, I was surprised. It wasn't the film I expected, but much, much more. You'll feel every emotion imaginable. It's the kind of film that takes everything you know, or think you know, stirs it all up and throws it back at you to figure out.Everything about this film is commendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kristen Stewart and Peyman Moaadi shine in Peter Sattler's debut...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The directorial debut of Peter Sattler is infused with a strong moral ambiguity that will make you question your own beliefs. Anchored by two magnificent performances by Kristen Stewart and Peyman Moaadi, "Camp X-Ray" is a flawed yet very affecting portrait of a relationship that develops in the most unlikeliest of places. "Camp X-Ray" tells the story of a soldier named by Amy Cole, who is assigned to watch detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Her whole outlook on the military and life are changed when she befriends one of the detainees named Ali Amir.From an honest filmmaking standpoint, writer/director Sattler hits many of his cinematic cues that you'd expect in a movie like this. It's full of emotion, tension, and moral questions that keep you thinking. However, the questions and emotional high-points are few and far between. At times, the film can feel awfully bloated, with fluff, and seemingly unimportant subplots that do nothing for the overall theme. There was a unique opportunity to explore queries regarding war, prison, and other things regarding politics that can be very frustrating when watching, especially since it has 117 minute run time. With all that said, when Sattler does it right, he nails it. I would be remiss if I didn't say, I'm not looking forward to see what he has up his sleeve next.The cinematic world tends to forget that Kristen Stewart showed such immense promise pre-"Twilight" days. A complete standout in Sean Penn's "Into the Wild" in 2007, for which she was nominated alongside the cast at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Even in between the vampire franchise, she subtly delivered in "Adventureland," "The Runaways," and "On the Road." Stewart revives her glory days as Private Amy Cole, and makes us believe in a brighter future for the tween icon. Sattler knows her limitations, strengths, and puts them both to stunning use. Emotionally charged, Stewart may have delivered her finest performance yet, even one of the best by an actress this year.As Asghar Farhadi enthusiasts will remember the talented Peyman Moaadi from the Oscar-winning "A Separation," the rest of the world that hasn't had the pleasure yet will start becoming well acquainted. Moaadi ignites a fire throughout the film, balancing his inquisitive and charismatic demeanor against a deep-rooted anger that will explode at any moment. I implore all writer and directors to utilize him over the next few years/decades.Overall, "Camp X-Ray" has many things to offer an audience member. Some of which will make you curious, some of which that will undoubtedly disappoint you. Consequently, the film will get a dialogue going between those who have seen the film. I'm excited to see how Sattler's experience will be interpreted by the viewing public. At bare minimum, you can relish in the bravura turns of Kristen Stewart and Peyman Moaadi, two actors that are well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuine Good Watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Worth watching experience, after a long time came across a genuine movie describing how life is there in world's most hatted prison, the movie explains how abnormal life becomes and also uncovers the panic situation when you live in a prison where rules are set by other's as clearly and effectively said by Peyman Moadi "It is there life not our's, You want us to follow your rules".There is no violence in the movie yet it explains a lot about the life in prison and how disturbing it is, and I believe this is the beauty of this movie...well done to Producer and Directors.Note: I do not support Al-Qaeda, ISIS or any other such organization but I am aware of the fact that there are many people out there who are imprisoned for life, yet they are innocent and world's so called peace loving countries are not willing to free them in fact have ambitions to pile up more and more such cases. Dr. Afia Siddique is one of such example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the detractors of Kristen Stewart re: the Twilight saga, it's fair to say that they can now eat her shorts. Camp X ray highlights the fact that sometimes, people are wrongfully imprisoned or detained, that what may be deemed as a threat to national security by the policy makers and the flow on effect of orders in that respect, can possibly be askew.Connecting with another person on any level, in any scenario, as a result of any reason or no reason at all, is what life is about. Although this film is the work of multiple talented entertainment artists, and the story, they're interpretation of what life may be like at Guantanamo Bay for it's detainees, there's a powerful message, a range of kindness and emotion, uplifting and educating to the end.Kristen Stewart, simply amazing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film affected me very deeply in a way I was not expecting.Kristen Stewart and Peyman Moaadi deliver stunning performances which take your breathe away. You really feel for this guy and Stewart has never been more convincing. I thought it would be a stretch to imagine her as a tough soldier and it is kind of surreal yet she manages to create a credible person out of the role. Her emotional distress as the contradictions of her job as camp guard begin to overwhelm her, is very powerful and a pleasure to watch.This film totally changed my mind about Gitmo. Just because it makes you realize the awful possibility that totally innocent people may be stuck there, and that unlike any other prison in the USA, there is no way for them to appeal or for anybody to appeal on their behalf.There must be some way to allow mistakes to be corrected. It's not right.It's amazing to me that I never saw it that way. I just assumed that they were all hard core bad guys. But what if they aren't.That would be a terrible fate, and this film really punches home how terrible it would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stewart and Maadi are fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Sattler's directorial debut, "Camp X-Ray," is a masterfully shot film that inhabits two stellar performances by Kristen Stewart and Payman Maadi. Stewart plays PFC Amy Cole from small town Florida who is socially awkward and equally earnest. Meanwhile, Maadi's character of Ali Amir is a charismatic detainee whom is engulfed in his impotent anger and ceaseless boredom. The film itself is quietly drawn and slow paced to convey the monotony of being a guard at Guantanamo Bay. "Camp X-Ray" is a two-hander for the majority of the film and it rests entirely upon the interactions of PFC Cole and Detainee 471 (Ali). Personally, I liked that the dynamic between the two is purely platonic and develops from the honest human requirement of connection. The tag line of the film "Connection takes courage" is entirely apt.The supporting cast of Lane Garrison and John Carroll Lynch as Cpl. "Randy" Ransdell and Col. James Drummond do solid work in their roles as Cole's superiors at Camp Delta.Sattler kept a film about Gitmo as apolitical as probably possible, but some will dislike the lack of a solid stance. The film does not offer any answers to the quagmire of Guantanamo Bay, but rather raises questions and displays the conflicting emotions one might feel while serving or detained there.Overall, I really liked this little Sundance indie. The attention to detail is impressive and the performances are more than worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Camp X-Ray is a great Sundance drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Sattler did good with "Camp X-Ray." Sattler utilized a bipartisan script that is brought to life with two amazing performances from Kristen Stewart and Payman Maadi.Pfc. Amy Cole and Ali Amir are two completely different characters with completely opposite backgrounds, yet they reach an understanding. Cole develops a better understanding of the humanity behind the detainees and Ali gains perspective of an MP guarding him. There are lingering questions over Ali's innocence or guilt or whether he is manipulating a vulnerable soldier.The tenuous friendship is so intriguing because it should not exist and it's not quite a friendship. "Camp X-Ray" is a slow-paced drama that builds up to an incredibly tense third act. The acting is tremendous and the attention to set design is impressive. I've seen documentaries of life at Camp Delta and it looks very similar. Stewart and Maadi have a great on screen dynamic that the director wisely captures with close ups. Lane Garrison as Cpl. Ransdell is solid as the main antagonist of the film.I recommend "Camp X-Ray" to anyone. It's a good film that doesn't preach right or wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Camp X-Ray" (2014) is nothing very superb or original, but it's a nice drama. Set in kinda unique place, it lets the very simple story of a friendship. Story about friendship would be simple, except that it occurs between two people from different universes, but at the end they get attached by a simple humanity. This a well acted, directed and written drama, which won't going to win any Oscars, but it will do just fine for one evening. Overall, "Camp X-Ray" is nicely done drama, set in a unique location and features old as the movies itself plot about friendship between two different people, who wins each others respect and friendship due to common acts on decency.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie itself was quite good and I think that it lives up to a 7.5 star rating. Now, as said before I enjoyed the film but do understand that for many (Including myself) it can be seen as a little to slow...Until arriving to the climax, which is absolutely great! The thing is, that we need to understand what this movie is really trying to portray. Its showing us the crude reality of how heartless and dehumanizing humanity can be through the eyes of Cole (Kristen Stewart) who starts to see how harsh things are and as said in the movie "it's not all so black and white". Kristen Stewart's acting was good but nothing out of the ordinary... I have to say that Maddi's performance was very good and really interprets the character by truly reflecting what Ali was feeling and displaying his desperation of having been in Guantanamo Bay for 8 years. To sum it up, the movie is good and quite the worthwhile. Be patient at the beginning cause it gets better and better as it progresses.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching "American Sniper" I swerved I would never again watch anything from USA related to their most recent military campaigns, cause I couldn't stand another buying false facts and fiction as a truth. But boy, this movie blew me away.It does carry a strong message, it has to go a great lengths, it cant be too direct, but it delivers when it really matters.Kristen in her recent works shows that she can act and that shes willing to do more artistically challenging titles now that shes done with that teen garbage.But real star is Peyman Moaadi, heart-aching performance. Just brilliant.Im still wondering how this movie happened, I truly believed that "American Sniper" defined what USA market want to see, judging by it Oscar nominations and positive reviews based only on patriotism.Camp X-Ray is not at all apolitical as some of reviewers say - nah, it is political statement, cleverly submerged under story about human species, friendship and love.Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a person who is living in a country and a community (right now in Tel Aviv) this movie really touched me. its somehow explains the human nature when it crosses the lines of separations and barriers such as Ethicity, Religion, Language Nationality and many other things. As in a former review i have red this film doesn't end on the credits but has a continuous effect on the mind thinking about life. about people who are living in places and situations that we haven't tried or even imagined. Kristen Stewart played her role very well and reached the hearts and the minds, she really succeeded delivering the message, i could understand it and feel it and think about it. Moaddi also played the role of the Educated Innocent prisoner very well, he spoke for those who still detained in this person having no rights, we could understand the Unjust in his tone when he speaks, but yet, despite his crazy moments he held hope, and he held love. Maybe the torture in reality is much more strong than in the movie, and thats a weakness in the direction,although its a very good movie touches hearts and minds and grow a plant of humanity on those who don't have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are all just ordinary people wrapped in extraordinary circumstances. Sometimes we are at war, sometimes we are in parallel worlds.This is the movie that I approached somehow unprepared. And it sinks in quite heavily as time lapses. I was just expecting a delivery of a quite important issue in digestible form, planning to nod my head shortly after "yeah, I've got it," and to make amendments to never be a bad "guy" bullying the ones I possibly could. And then? all this sh.i.t (sic) was all over my face. I feel that it talked to me, to all of us about? all of us. About conformism, ignorance, love, kindness, and love again. Only love is selfless enough to let us see another person, any person, first and the foremost as an equal, as a human being, as ourselves. Regardless of heated argument, or war, or anger, or spitting at each other's face ? we only have a human mirror being hold in front of us and we only respond to our own contorted face in it.Minimalism of footage and strength of message left me thinking. At the final credits I was staring at the darkening screen amazed by simplicity of universal language of love traits - selfless, accepting, and unconditional. The love not needing a reason and not asking for a return. An honest awareness about cohesive substance of all humanity makes us capable to deliver all acts of kindness to people standing vulnerably before our eyes. We are fully responsible and accountable for a privileged position of knowledge. Ignorance is not bliss but, all too often, becomes a silent cause of tragedies, especially after discovering the truth.I am sorry for the arrogance of power-holders.I am sorry for the unprotected from unfair conditions in the name of higher purpose.I am sorry for the conformists closing their eyes and being OK with a non-OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty much works in spite of itself. It's a good thing that it manages to be pretty restrained, but the storyline isn't particularly all that original, and it has several rough patches along the way. Still, despite how much of a "cliche" it is, the chemistry between Moaadi and Stewart is palpable and they make it emotionally affecting. Both are good, especially Moaadi. I've never thought Stewart was a bad actress (never seen any Twilight film), I've just seen her do the same thing in pretty much all of her performances (On The Road was probably the only time she left her comfort zone). It's not that she's particularly bad at what she does, it just comes off as a limitation. This is her doing the same thing. She's good at it, I'm not sure if the character really needed all that much more, but maybe a better actress still would've brought more to it? She's just not stretching herself here, which maybe isn't a problem. But it's nowhere near a great performance, and Moaadi ultimately fares better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I never agreed to follow your rules. If I follow your rules it means that I'm agreeing that you have the rights to give me rules, but you don't."Peter Sattler has just made a name for himself after this pretty impressive debut as a writer-director. His screenplay never feels manipulative and he simply tells a minimalist story without being political about it. The film hit home for me because there has been a lot of political discussion in Uruguay as to whether or not the President should've accepted the transfer of six Guantanamo Bay prisoners to our country. These prisoners had been discharged in 2010, but no country was willing to receive them. After watching this film, I think we made the right humanitarian decision. Sattler never intends to portray these detainees as either guilty or innocent. We aren't informed about the detainees' past, but it rather focuses on a unique relationship between one of the prisoners and a guard. It would have been easier to turn this into a political film, but not everything is black and white and Sattler intelligently turns this into a humanitarian story about two people with different backgrounds who find a connection while at the prison camp. There are several parallel scenes where we see the detainee locked in his cell and the guard in her small room kind of like reflecting the fact that they are both prisoners and victims of their circumstance. This isn't a political film nor a military bashing one as some people claim; it is an authentic character driven drama that will make you question certain issues. In order for a film like this to succeed you need to have engaging performances from your cast, and this was the case for Camp X-Ray. I've never doubted Kristen Stewart's ability as an actress. She's given solid performances throughout her career, but unfortunately when given a poor script there is nothing she can do to improve it. She proved she has more than one facial expression in this year's Still Alice, and here she gets more screen time to prove her talent. She is convincing as the guard, and her chemistry with the prisoner is the most engaging element of this film. The film also has a subplot revolving on how she is abused by some of the men in power, but the documentary The Invisible War handles this issue in a much better way. Having seen the documentary, I identified with how poorly she was treated, but for audiences who haven't been exposed to the documentary they may not make much sense out of this subplot. But it is clearly an important issue with women in the military and how many times their complaints are met with hatred and often ignored. Kristen Stewart's performance was solid, but the film entirely belongs to Peyman Moaadi who delivers a great performance as the detainee Ali. I knew his face was familiar, but only when I looked him up in the IMDb did I realize he was the actor from A Separation. He is outstanding in this film and his character is the most engaging of the film. It works thanks to the fantastic chemistry the two have together because the rest of the characters are completely ignored. We don't get much depth from the rest of detainees nor the other military officials, with the exception of Lane Garrison who is solid as one of the officials who often abuses his position of power. Overall, this is a solid film that centers on a unique relationship between two people who aren't as different as one would expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kristen Stewart plays Cole ? she is a young woman who joins the army to make a difference and escape the mundanity of small town life. Then she gets assigned to Guantanamo Bay to guard 'detainees' of 'The War on Terror'. Not what she had hoped for. On arrival she enters a World of machismo and casual violence.Then she meets Ali who has been detained for years in a small cell. He loves Harry Potter and misses his old life but detention without trial means he has no rights not even the basic ones established under The Geneva Convention. He is visibly lonely and hanging onto sanity and life by a thread but he is attracted to this new guard and slowly he breaks down her reserve and they connect on a very human level. This though is verboten and soon she has to work out who really is her enemy.Now this is a very well made film, it avoids over sentimentality and crass judgements and instead focuses on the ordinary and by doing so shows how extra ordinary it can be. Upstanding performances are found across the board here but Peyman Moaadi ('A Separation' and 'About Elly')as Ali is particularly noteworthy. This is a film about conflict but also about removing the barriers that cause it; it is thoughtful and manages to hold your attention throughout- a rather excellent watch and so recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CAMP X-RAY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Military drama flick, set at the temporary Guantanamo Bay detention facility; known as Camp X-Ray. It stars Kristen Stewart, as a rookie soldier who befriends a detainee; who had been imprisoned at the camp for eight years. He's played by Peyman Moaadi (of 'A SEPARATION' fame). It was written and directed by Peter Sattler, in his feature filmmaking debut. The movie was made on a budget of just $1 million and has received mostly positive reviews from critics (especially for it's two lead performances). I found the film to be a brilliant and moving character study, as well as an insightful examination on how we treat those that differ from us.Amy Cole (Stewart) joined the military in order to escape an unhappy life, living in a very small town. She quickly learns that she's not going to Iraq, like she had hoped, but is instead stationed, as a guard, at Guantanamo Bay (specifically Camp X-Ray). Her unhappiness doesn't improve; as she's abused by most of her male superiors and given a boring, and somewhat disturbing, job. She reluctantly forms an unusual friendship with one of the detainees there though, named Ali (Moaadi). Ali has been imprisoned at Gitmo for eight years and is very talkative, unlike Private Cole, and well educated. He instead gives Amy the life lessons she was looking for, by joining the military.The movie is beautifully shot, in a somewhat stylistic way (especially for such a low budget); it very much reminds me of a classic war flick, from the 70s or 80s. It's a truly moving and involving character study and it also has a lot to say about war and the unethical way we treat those we fear; for being different from us. What's most impressive about the film is the two lead performances though, and the relationship their characters' form. Stewart is especially good in the movie and she gives, quite possibly, the best performance of her career! She was in desperate need of a starring role like this though (right now), to really shine in. I'm glad Sattler, and the film, gave her that opportunity.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/0zeoVbvkuAA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really liked "Camp X-Ray" for it's performances, visual style and the underrated music and sound design</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The least interesting movies usually make things black and white. This is our protagonist and here is the antagonist, we hope that protagonist will conquer the adversities and win over the antagonist who is painted as a bad evil doer. The things get interesting when director chooses to make us empathize with the antagonist which creates in a viewer an inner conflict. On one hand we want to support our protagonist, but when the circumstances create the environment where it is hard to not empathize with our antagonist thats when we feel torn apart by an obligation and a duty. This is exactly how must have felt the protagonist of the "Camp X-ray" written and directed by Peter Sattler in his directorial debut."A young woman (Kristen Stewart) joins the military to be part of something bigger than herself and her small-town roots. Instead, she ends up as a new guard at Guantanamo Bay, where her mission is far from black and white. Surrounded by hostile jihadists and aggressive squadmates, she strikes up an unusual friendship with one of the detainees (Peyman Moaadi). As two people on opposite sides of a war, they struggle to find their way through the ethical quagmire of Guantanamo Bay. In the process, they form an unlikely bond that changes them both." The strength of "Camp X-Ray" lays in it's simplicity. Often the repetitive notion of narration creates in the audience sense of monotony which is precisely the emotion that both the guards and detainees must feel in "Guantanamo Bay". It is explained in the first minutes of the movie that prisoners are called there detainees to avoid breaking the rules of the Geneva Convention about the prisoners rights no matter what they are accused of doing. In "Guantanamo Bay" the detainees have very little rights and as the story evolves just like our protagonist we start to feel sense of empathy towards them. This contrast creates interesting dynamic and is a driving force behind this powerful drama. In a visual sense director Peter Sattler mirrors the cell in which detainee is held to the living quarters of the Kristen Stewart character symbolically creating a bond between them of two people on opposite sides feeling the same emotions. Kristen Stewart's character Amy Cole was originally written for a male role but thankfully by making her a female Sattler added an additional layer of sexuality and sensuality in the dynamic between the lead characters. Where the movie truly excels is in the performances. I must say I have never been a huge fan of "Twilight" movies as well as the lover of Kristen Stewart acting talent. In many ways she has always been overrated as an actor, however any actor with amount of quality work on A level projects can eventually improve and this is precisely what happen to Stewart. In "Camp X-Ray" she delivers arguably her best performance finding something very truthful and soulful behind her choices. There is a deep inner dialog whenever she does not speak and when she delivers her lines they are backed up by some deep truthful emotions that audience can feel. Peyman Moaadi performance also deserves a praise as detainee without a hope who starts to feel something for a woman on the other side of door. Their relationship is a driving force of this drama and creates an interesting combination of romance and friendship in least expected place. In someway they both help each other survive the monotony as well as alienation from the groups they belong to. The stigma of who is good or bad is lifted and whats left is two people hungry for connection and intimacy. I really liked "Camp X-Ray" for it's performances, visual style and the underrated music and sound design that carries sense of mediative peace that audience of less action based, more of an intellectual taste will like.For more of my movie reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Camp X Ray is the story of the unlikely friendship between an inmate at Guantanamo Bay Prison and one of its guards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Camp X Ray is not a political film, despite being set in a location that is synonymous with controversy. It is a story about human connection under the most unlikely circumstances.The central character is Private Amy Cole, an uncertain, socially awkward young woman who joined the army hoping to distinguish herself, expand her horizons, and, as she says, do some good. Kristen Stewart completely inhabits the character in a precise and subtle performance that shows Cole's vulnerability beneath her facade of toughness.Guantanamo Bay prison is introduced first. We find out, during Cole's and the other new recruits' orientation, that the inmates are not guarded to keep them from escaping, but to keep them from dying, their situation being almost guaranteed to bring on suicide attempts. They are watched constantly to prevent any of them from killing or injuring himself. They are "detainees," the soldiers are told, never to be called prisoners. Why? Because, Cole blandly explains, prisoners are protected to some extent by the Geneva Conventions, while detainees are not. Those two facts set a sinister tone for the unfolding story. The actual mistreatment of the detainees, such as sleep deprivation, is handled nonchalantly by the soldiers, and treated almost as minor background details. There's no political commentary here; both terrorism and torture are just background scenery, making their point very subtly. Even the question of Ali's apparent innocence of terrorist crimes is not focused on, just mentioned in passing; it's irrelevant to the fact that he'll remain in prison, no matter what.Peyman Moaadi, who was excellent in A Separation, is equally good here as Ali, a long-term detainee. This is a much more over the top performance, but that may have been necessary just to get the character across when he was mostly limited to speaking through a tiny barred window in the door of his cell. His portrayal of a man trying to ward off insanity and hopelessness was often incredibly moving. I enjoyed watching him and Stewart bounce off each other, her low-key performance and his more intense one working perfectly together.An interesting choice is the way the character of Ali was first introduced, when Cole is assigned to bringing the prison library cart around to the cells. The theatre audience laughed in surprise when he started complaining about the last Harry Potter book not being available. It really was incongruous: an accused terrorist, looking the stereotypical part with his grim expression, dark beard and Middle Eastern accent, peering through his cell door and demanding his guard's opinion of Professor Snape. Right away, preconceptions were rather obviously being scattered, as when Cole remarks that a certain movie probably was banned where Ali was from, and he responds, "What, in Germany?" I think critics were right to say that the detainees were a bit stereotyped, all scowling, angry, Arabic speaking men, except for Ali, who speaks fluent English, is open to Western literature, and unlike his fellow inmates, seems to have no problem relating to women. But they all come across as desperate, lonely, miserable people, who may respond to their situation in different ways. Ali does begin with a hostile act toward Cole, but in general is just seeking some kind of human contact. Other detainees are, as the case may be, suicidal, violent, or withdrawn in reaction to their confinement; but only Ali is actually given a real personality.The slow pace of the rest of the movie seems to be deliberate. We get a feeling for how slowly the time passes here, with endless hours of pacing the prison hallways, monitoring the detainees, the monotony only broken by occasional acts of violence or rebellion. It's draining on the soldiers themselves, more so for the detainees. Also, time is taken to let Cole and Ali's friendship gradually develop, as Cole is very reserved and careful when talking to him at first, as her position requires her to be. Her own social isolation parallels Ali's, and this is one reason they connect. She doesn't really fit in with her fellow soldiers, who are mostly not inclined to think too deeply about the significance of what they are doing in the prison or why. I should add that it's pretty clear the critics who describe Cole's and Ali's relationship as romantic in any sense are completely wrong. There's absolutely no indication of that, beyond a little snide innuendo from one of the soldiers. Cole and Ali connect platonically, as one human being to another.Some critics have said the soldiers were all interchangeable "tough guy" stereotypes. I don't think that's really the case; they are individuals, but from Cole's perspective, none of them can offer her real friendship. The closest thing to a friend she has is a fellow private named Rico, who is friendly to Cole but easily accepts the party line, and can't relate to her growing ambivalence about her duties at the camp. Cole once makes a tentative move toward a sexual relationship with another soldier, but this ends badly when she refuses him and he retaliates. In spite of their differences, Ali ends up being the person she can relate to most easily.The movie's climax, which is unfortunately a little clumsy, culminates in an important breakthrough in trust between the characters which is very moving.As a story about the capacity for humans to connect against all odds, this movie was a great success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable and touching in parts! 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I really enjoyed this movie because of the emotional content, and the fact that it shows the different sides to war but I can't see it going down well with Americans or anyone who is victims of terrorism. I think that audiences would have had more sympathy for Ali (Payman Maadi), if they knew if he was guilty or not, and I was surprised that he was able to have them in depth conversations with Cole (Kristen Stewart), with so many inmates close by. Anyway, the performances were great, especially from Payman Maadi, and the unique storyline did touch an emotional cord. Because of the political status about Guantanamo Bay and the fact that the world has mixed reviews about it, I'm not surprised that this film was kept under the radar. The director really did push the barriers by making a film about a relationship between an inmate and a guard but I liked the way that he showed an human side to a soldier, who could have easily felt remorse towards Ali after he covered her in poop. For a film that is mainly about 2 people, I really did enjoy it, and I have to commend Kristen Stewart for taking on a project that is completely out of her comfort zone. Enjoyable!&nbsp;Round-Up: Kristen Stewart, 26, first hit the big screen in 2002, in Panic room, playing Jodie Fosters daughter and then she went on to star in Cold Creek Manor, Zahara, Into The Wild and What Just Happened but she is mostly known for her role as Bella in the Twilight franchise. Since then, she has become an household name but I personally think that she acts the same in all of her movies, even though she has covered many genres. Anyway, this is the first film written and directed by Peter Sandler, who made this small film, interesting throughout. Kristen Stewart wouldn't have been my first choice to play a soldier but she completely transformed herself, which, surprisingly, worked.&nbsp;Budget: $1million Worldwide Gross: $61,000 (Terrible)I recommend this movie to people who are into their war/drama movies starring Kristen Stewart, Peyman Moaadi, Lane Garrison, Tara Holt, John Carroll Lynch and Anoop Simon. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Private Cole (Kristen Stewart) has escaped her desperately boring small town life, and is stationed as a guard in Camp X-Ray, the notorious detention centre where suspected terrorists are held. Encountering particular hostility as a woman, among the predominantly Arabic detainees, she is forced to tough it out, until she crosses paths with Ali (Peyman Moaadi), a fluent and articulate prisoner who won't be quiet, and pesters her with queries. Eventually, after much hardship, the pair begin to establish a report that challenges each of them as people.With what strikes you from the beginning as a particularly low budget (and pretty minimal publicity) feature length debut director Peter Sattler has delivered this challenging and probing drama, that perhaps more fittingly keeps a small scale tone, and delivers a much bigger impact as a result. Playing like a less mind bending version of The Silence of the Lambs (which doesn't go unreferenced), it takes a subject torn from today's headlines, and uses it as a template to create some fine human drama.Playing as a character study of two diametrically opposed individuals, operating on different sides of an ideological war, in the lead role it zooms in primarily on Stewart's role as the headstrong young recruit who is forced to somehow find the strength to find common ground with a man who chucks sh!t all over her, whilst Moaadi's Ali is a complex, irrepressible character, whose behaviour and motivations always keep you guessing what is driving him.Independent cinema seems to be the only outlet for more intelligent, considered material like this to flourish in this climate, but really it's more of a blessing than a curse. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Female guard at Guantanamo befriends a detainee and complicates their lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about a young , low level female soldier from a small town. She is assigned to Guantanamo as a guard, and against rules, begins talking to and developing a friendship with a detainee. The set up has every reason to result in a really bad, cliché American film. I give great praise to the filmmakers for not falling into the predictable trap. You know the one "The girl guard rises above sexist insults to become the best of all the soldiers, kicking one of the bad guys in the testicles along the way". Instead, they actually made a good movie. Instead of pandering, they showed the woman as a flawed human being, a nice gal , but a victim of some of her own poor choices. For example , she invites an obvious jerk into the john with her at a party, and he ends up getting too rough. They are not implying she deserved it, but that she should have known better. Stewart does a good job as the hard working guard , who just "sucks it up" when she hits unfairness. They also allow her to make mistakes , like talking to a prisoners at all. The tension builds toward the end where one of the guard /detainee pair is going to do something drastic, and the other tries to help. It unfolds in an original way. I appreciate a movie where the male is not pure evil and the female is not pure good; people, and life are more complicated than that.</fullReview>

But I Guess that's not such a big deal.This movie also gets you thinking about how easily we put a stamp on someone and put them into a certain box. For me Ali was and never will be a bad guy.

		<shortDescription>While the film is a bit difficult to believe, the acting and originality of the plot make this one work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Camp X-Ray is a difficult sort of film for a production company to sell to the public. After all, setting a film at the Guantanimo detention facility makes it difficult to attract viewers and there is lots of division as to what folks think about this place. It is definitely a polarizing topic--so making a film that will appeal to a wider audience set here is quite an obstacle--one that the film is able to somehow overcome. Now I am not saying it's a great film, but it is worth seeing--especially since the film was somehow made for only about $1,000,000--a pittance by modern standards.When the movie begins, Private Cole (Kristen Stewart) has just arrived at the detention facility to work and she is obviously ill-at-ease with the environment. After all, many of the prisoners are quite violent and she soon gets punched in the face by one of the inmates. This, combined with the screaming, insults, feces flinging and uncooperative nature of the detainees, make this a formidable assignment. One of the most difficult of these people is Ali (Peyman Moaadi)--a guy who has gained a reputation as one of the more difficult cases. Oddly, however, as the film progresses, Cole finds herself feeling sorry for Ali and soon the pair create a strange sort of comradeship--one which clearly is in violation of her orders to remain aloof and tight-lipped with these men.The film's greatest strengths are the acting and originality of the script, as I strongly doubt you've seen anything like this. Stewart shows that she's more than just a vampire's girlfriend with her performance and Moaadi is particularly effective as a manipulative but somehow likable detainee. My only problem with the film is that the story seems awfully difficult to believe when you really think about it--though it LOOKS very realistic throughout. After all, if you think about it, the facility is one of the most secure on the planet and there are cameras everywhere. Her superiors are also beginning to suspect that she's not a team player--so how could she possibly spend so much time just chatting with a man who is seen as a super- dangerous terrorist--especially when the troops have been ordered NOT to fraternize with the prisoners? You would think someone would notice! Also, Cole's change of attitude and bonding with Ali seems to occur amazingly fast--too fast to be readily accepted by all the viewers since he does NOT do a lot to endear himself to her when they first meet (I'll say no more-- you just need to see this for yourself). Despite these weaknesses, the film is thought-provoking and extremely unusual. What's especially unusual is that the film will most likely appeal to folks on all sides of the political spectrum--allowing the viewer to make their own interpretation and draw their own conclusions about the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and well done. Stewart and Maadi exceed expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some would say this film is very simplistic in nature. We get it, the "detainees" are there for being terrorists. But is that so? Or is this film about humanity and our ties to all persons, regardless of ethnic or religious background, and the ever-existing dilemma of Guantanamo Bay? Kristen Stewart certainly does not disappoint, nor does Maadi. Their characters are well developed and explore much beyond the cells and fences that confine them both, in a sense. This film has so much to offer the viewer who takes the time to focus. We are privileged to even enter such a horrible world. The writer, producers and directors of this film knew absolutely how to pull us in, although they need not have tried very hard. As we are left in ambiguity, one question remains for me: Why has Guantanamo Bay not been shut down?Excellent film in every way and excellent actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Camp X-Ray (2014) is an amazing film which captures how they're some good humans left in the world even when forced to hate others for no reasons at all. This film shares the many sides of humanity, how people of power make everyone love or hate each other based on what they want you to believe, it also shows that some people can see right through the bullshit and show compassion for others no matter the circumstances. I have many feelings on this story type in which is better left unsaid as humanity with power whether it be over any country or any club has proved themselves to be nothing but filth controlling others for their own financial goals. Aside from my feeling on the realism shown in this film and many others like it, this film is amazing. The acting is by far of the highest caliber and the script was perfect. At times I felt the adrenaline to want to knock out the Corporal as if I were in those shoes, it would've happen. Sadly events like this take place and this film hit the nail on the head perfectly. Great film.</fullReview>

I was expecting a good guy/bad guy political statement on Guantanamo, but instead got the rarely told story that is hidden in conflict &amp; war of the unspoken common humanity shared by many of the those affected. The uniqueness of the film is exemplified by three books central to the story: Bible, Qur'an, Harry Potter. The Potter series is actually quite popular at Guantanamo. As a side note the Bible and Potter are the #1 and #3 most read books in the world, but strangely the Qur'an is not in the top ten (a variety of reasonings as to why).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who knew that Kristen Stewart could act?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Camp X-Ray is a limited release film about life in Guantanamo Bay, (before it closed obviously) and more specifically, a new guard who befriends a detainee there. I'll get this out of the way, it does have some bias, but overall it does not really carry a heavy political message. It does have a very realistic message through most of it though, which may look like some bias, but is also a reason Guantanamo Bay is empty, so I can't say it wasn't true.-The independent film is actually pretty good. It is well written and engaging, as well as caries a great story, tone, and pace with it.-The acting is very good. It stars Kristen Stewart as the guard, Cole, who- Oh my gosh! She can actually act!!! I was very impressed. It also stars Peymn Moaadi as the detainee Ali, and he's great! Both actors are solid.-The music is good. Very deep and thoughtful.-And that's about it. The content of the film is not too bad either. Like many this year, Camp X-Ray is rated-R for language, but has a lighter about of language for an R-Film, which finally feels appropriate for a film with the military in it!! -So Camp X-Ray is well done, well-acted, and overall pretty good. There's not a lot of action and if you don't like movies that show both sides in a war, you won't be interested. However, if you are, it is totally worth seeing! I think I would give it a high 7.5/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Minor But Successful Project Highlighting Kristen Stewart's Subtle Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kristen Stewart is growing up. Not by posing for "Playboy" like a tired '90s sitcom dolly, not by undergoing a nail biting scandal, but by taking on film roles that at once amplify her talents and provide yet another reason to forget about the sh-t-stained days of "Twilight". Popular opinion suggests that we should tease her for her lip-biting habit, her emotional flamboyance as obnoxious as ? ahem ? Keanu Reeves; but I've always thought of her as a next-big-thing in the making. She's a sort of Hollywood rebel, drawing us in with her naturalistic acting style and then managing to punch us in the gut with her ability to undermine comfortability. Since the incredibly bad vampire franchise ended in 2012, Stewart's been on a mission; not wanting to end up a forgotten figure of teen mag past, she's lined up movies that stretch her ability and head in the opposite direction of Hollywood phoniness. She began with the unevenly received "On the Road" (2012), then continued with "Camp X-Ray" and "Still Alice", finally hitting her stride with 2015's stellar "Clouds of Sils Maria", which won her the French Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Having been enormously impressed with her characterization in the latter, I sought out "Camp X-Ray" in a sort of daze, thirsty for more risk taking from the under-appreciated actress. Though hardly as much of a success as her other game-changing films, "Camp X-Ray" is a well-acted character study that gives her a role that, once again, places her directly out of her comfort zone and results in another excellent performance.She plays Amy Cole, a recent Army recruit stationed in Guantanamo Bay as a detainee guard. Originally, Cole joined the service in hopes to make herself into something more than the other nobodies of her small town; but as she gets used to her new line of work, she begins to realize that not all things about the military are as black-and-white as she once figured them to be. Through her monotonous duties, Cole unexpectedly strikes up a friendship with one of the detainees, the charismatic Ali (a memorable Peyman Moaadi), who hails from Germany and doesn't seem to be the sort of bad guy she had once imagined to be locked up in such an infamous prison. Her fellow guards have no time harboring cruelty to the men they so furiously monitor ? but Cole, more sensitive than she ever thought, begins to realize that her unwanted sympathies may end up hindering what's expected of her.The writing/directorial debut of Peter Sattler, "Camp X-Ray" is a humanistic drama snug in all the right places, stirring the pot of military ethics and questioning just how far the government has gone to ensure the safety of the United States. Sattler, though, doesn't dwell on controversy, instead touching upon red-button topics with soft grace; subtly bringing up xenophobia, sexism, and homophobia, he allows the viewer to see the situation through Cole's eyes (which happen to be lined with affinity and dubiousness). For the most part, his minimalist screenplay hits all the right notes, save for the last ten minutes, which make for a rather disappointing ending; his directorial style, unaffected and observant, exquisitely suits the material. Stewart's skillful solemness complements his quirks."Camp X-Ray" finds its faults in the staginess of it all; though it would be a strong play if stage-bound, it doesn't have quite enough fire to capture our interest for nearly two-hours. But what it has to say along the way, supplemented by the compelling forces of Stewart and Moaadi, is enough to make it solid. I just wish Sattler wouldn't have chosen the easy way out during the final act and had instead taken a route less traveled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic and beautifully produced political drama with not much to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Camp X-Ray" is well made, nicely photographed and convincingly acted, with lots of subtle and obvious symbolism. It's a weird sort of chick flick set at GTMO. Kristen Stewart plays a small-town girl who joins the Army to see the world and instead finds herself guarding detainees who are not allowed to see the world with obvious suggestions that she too is a sort of prisoner. Early on, she is told her job is not to prevent the prisoners from escaping, but to prevent them from killing themselves. Naturally, this becomes a challenge at the climax, as she must decide how literally to interpret her orders while acting in a film that criticizes the government for stretching its interpretation of presidential authority. The film shows an interesting view of the physical facilities at GTMO, but procedures often seem distorted for the convenience of the plot. There's a notion that everybody is watching everybody else, but nobody seems to be watching Stewart as she bends the rules. After viewing the film, I read Matt Zoller Seitz's review in which he praised Stewart's performance, saying, "She mines a narrow emotional range with precision." I couldn't help but feel that if it were a film starring Clint Eastwood or Jason Statham, the performance would have been simply labeled expressionless. But Stewart earns more money than Meryl Streep, so her performance must be multilayered. It couldn't just be the Kuleshov effect. The ending seems disappointing. Perhaps, like the detainees, the film had nowhere to go. Questions are raised about the duty of soldiers to follow procedures and answers are promised, but never given. We learn that one of the detainees is highly intelligent, fluent in English and well read. It shouldn't be any surprise that a terrorist who convinces others to ignore 99% of Islamic teachings and sacrifice their lives for a dubious interpretation of the remaining 1% is charismatic, persuasive and manipulative. Considering that many films with strong political themes are heavy-handed, it is refreshing to view a film that is much more subtle with its message, relying on a somewhat contrived plot, camera angles, subtext and symbolism to convey its message. The film deserves a ten for production values, but the relatively weak plot and the loose ends made it a less satisfying experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A female soldier Cole is transferred to Camp Xray "Gitmo" base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. where the US government "detains" terror suspects, mainly from Arab countries. One day, detainee 471 Ali, who has been there eight years, tries to start a talk with Cole but her colleague denies him the time. The next time Cole gets 'suicide watch' duty on 471's block B, again he talks to her. She keeps avoiding those talks due to the commander's advice to limit their interaction and that the guards shouldn't let the detainees get into their head. Ali tricks her into opening his cell's mailbox door and then he slams feces on her. 471 gets the 'frequent flier' treatment as a punishment where the guards move him cell to cell every two hours, depriving him of sleep. Meanwhile, Cpl. Ransdell approaches Cole for an intimate relationship, but she denies him. On their next meet, after another argument, 471 apologizes to Cole for asking to much from her, and she tells him that the last Harry Potter book he's looking for isn't in the library. Eight months later, Ransdell assigns her to showers duty due to the other male soldiers are engaged on an incident in block D. It is very humiliating to 471 and forbidden in Islamic law. Later that night Cole's friends tell her there was no incident in block D that day. Cole emails their captain about it. The captain dismisses Cole's objection stating that Ransdell is her superior and that she must execute his commands. Soon Randell confronts her. Cole than retreats to being passive after she realizes that no one is supporting her. She gets reassigned to night shift. After some talk, 471 is kind of upset at Cole. Suddenly he reveals a hidden blade and threatens to kill himself as Cole finds out about it and tries to radio for back up. She opens up to him, as her means of keeping him from suicide. As she tells him her childhood memory of going to the zoo, she realizes that she instead has to let Ali choose. She then deliberately continue her watch, providing a window for Ali to commit suicide unchecked. She comes back and finds Ali sobbing and refrained from suicide. At last Cole's re-transfer time comes and she moves from the base. As a new male guard comes and offers books to Ali, Ali notices a big yellow book on the cart. He asks for it and finds that it's the last Harry Potter book with a message from Cole.The movie very nicely captures the human aspects of an ultra max security black site prison. Compared to the similar themes in Zero Dark Thirty (2011) and Unthinkable (2010), which only emphasize on the harsh yet effective information extraction methods, this movie focuses more on the long term connections between the detainees and their guards. Moreover, for me the effect of the 'long term painless' methods is just as severe to those of the 'short-term painful' ones. The detainees, particularly those of faint hearts, can break down, or even go crazy, in a matter of months.I really like how the screenplay manages the scene sequences that it can offer a very quick turnaround from a relatively hospitable mood to a hostile one. This is not only true on the scene sequences, such as the second talk between Ali and Cole, but also on the subject of the talk in the dialog, like how Ali can change the dialog subject from Harry Potter to holy books. The very nice reference on the Harry Potter books is very entertaining, that Cole misinterpret Azkaban is ridiculously funny. One thing that's missing is that the dramatization of conflict between Cole and Ransdell is somewhat lacking in general. As one of the triggering cause of the major conflict, the build p on the Ransdell-Cole side feels rather empty and lacks focus. It's just there like it doesn't have any other value to the movie.The acting overall is a nice one in my opinion. Kristen Stewart's acting here for me is by far her best performance. Though I think that it's not entirely up yo her. Rather the basic condition of the story which has more of a subtle yet restless mood is best suited to her usual performance. The only other time I saw Payman Maadi was in the Iranian movie A Separation (2011) which presents great depiction of family drama under the circumstances of Islamic laws. Compared to that, his performance here is just as strong. He managed to lead the viewers to move away from questioning his innocence to focus on his humane needs.Overall Camp X-ray (2014) was a drama worthy of a solid 7 out of score for me. A recommendation is a yes from me. Besides being a good entertainment , this movie can also depict nicely the conditions of such detention centers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kristen Stewart has some very bad history in terms of acting. Especially in the Twilight saga where she's most known from, but also that dreadful Snow White film. I was skeptical when I first heard that Kristen had one of the main roles, but I gotta say, she does an outstanding performance and she's improved a lot since the Twilight saga. Her acting seems more convincing and the way she expresses her feelings in this film is really a big turn for Kristen Stewart. She's actually becoming a pretty decent actor. Well, enough talk about Kristen for a moment. How is the film? I was pretty worried that the film would be some American propaganda, like most films involving prisons and war are today(American Sniper, Lone Warrior etc) but it turns out it isn't. This movie has nothing to do with propaganda, it resolves more around the relationship between a detainee and a female guard. This is NOT a love story, it is a story of a friendship between one misunderstood detainee and a guard who's empathy grows stronger. The direction is amazing, the film itself looks great and the actors (especially Kristen) did a great job on this one! I can't stress enough how the performance of Kristen struck me. Camp X Ray is a truly original story, with emotional scenes that'll make you cry like a baby. Yes, I cried. It's painful to watch though - but it's worth it. It's an unique film and a lot of the better scenes are actually the dialogues between the detainee Ali and the guard Cole. Both actors give us the emotions, it feels so true and I can only say that Kristen has improved a lot. A lot of Kristen Stewart haters rate this film a one star rating before even watching it, because, it's kristen stewart. i'm telling you right now, she's not what she used to be. This is an amazing film and do not let the haters make you miss out on this one! If you want emotions - you are given them in this film! Nuff said.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kristen Stewart's Careers Best Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's it i am to have few things before i give a review first of all this Kristen Stewart hate wagon have to stop seems like everyone hates her for no reason she can act unlike fake actresses like Jennifer Lawrence &amp; Jessica Chastian people &amp; critics love films like zero dark thirty or lone survivor but hate good underrated films like this one if you have a similar taste then camp x ray 2014 is not for you.I will be honest here this film is not anti USA at all it was about what a person goes through while working both mental &amp; physical wise in a area seems like out of this world.The Plot:Cole is a solider from USA who is just transfered to Guantanamo bay a place very far from her home country where dangerous terrorists are kept in tight security Cole soon meets Ali a detainee in camp-x ray area who is there for about 8 years Cole soon become friendly with him.The ending of the film will leave you with many questions i wont reveal here but here are few things i can tell like the conversation between the characters are written so well in the start Ali throws stuff on Cole &amp; misbehaves with her Cole gets angry &amp; wants to get things over soon but as days past both Ali &amp; Cole try to understand each other &amp; come close.This film is now controversial thanks to some haters who failed to understand a subject this film is a piece of entertainment so enjoy it for what it is don't think too much there are some funny moments here too despite being a very serious project.Keep in mind this is not a action film its a dialog oriented film with deep messages weather Ali was a terrorist or innocent,religious loud talker etc it does not matter people will argue that Cole was a weak soldier because she was a woman hell no the point this film raises is at the end of the day they were both humans Ali cried at the end &amp; wanted to kill himself because he is been there for 8 years he likes harry potter books there is a scene where Cole says to Ali that cut that Hannibal Lector thing &amp; stop talking too much but at the very end of the film Cole eyes are filled with pain as a viewer i felt that effect the whole film makes sense.How many regular people have actually seen Guantanamo bay or what happens there with prisoners aka detainees do they get abused or not if you are intending to watch this film think of something like that your missing the great acting display &amp; character study then it is absolutely no need to discuss that its all out on the internet look it up.The Cast:Kristen Stewart has become a good actress i must say after watching this from sweet Bella to method acting mode wow &amp; second actor is Peyman Moaadi he just nailed the role one of the best performance of this year so far.This is a directorial debut of Peter Sattler &amp; its excellent he did a fantastic job the cinematography is breathtaking even the background score is used where its required Katherine Bigelow should learn something from him this is how you make a film i loved every bit of it.Overall Camp X-Ray 2014 is not a film for everyone but if your are a Kristen Stewart fan or like great films then this is a great treat for you my rating is 8/10.Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kristen Stewart like you have never seen her before!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the events of 911, many Muslims considered 'terror threats' were unwillingly pulled out from where they live and taken to the Guantanamo Bay. A political hell-hole, maximum security prison. Kristen Stewart's lead character, Amy Cole, is a newly assigned solider stationed there.Warned of the strict rules and told to not let them get in your head, her job is to oversee the detainees. Since escape is impossible, their aim is to just keep them from not dying. Reminded that this too is a war-zone, them against her, she is smitten of any emotion and throws herself in the deep end. Worn down by persistence, she befriends Ali (Peyman Mooadi), a 'detainee' who has been imprisoned there for eight years.Acting much like Hannibal Lector behind bars, Peyman's performance is moving, whilst providing needed (subtle) humour. Although there is a heavy steel security door between them for the duration of the film, the chemistry balance between Kirsten and Peyman is gripping. Kristen Stewart in fact is outstanding in the unconventional role and like you have never seen her before.Brutally regimented, Camp X-Ray at times feels tedious, perhaps to give a sense of the time lapse, or perhaps the lack of soundtrack just exaggerates it. Either way, it is superb direction by first- time writer, director Peter Sattler. With authentic representation in mind, and no underlying political themes reflected, Camp X-Ray instead focuses on being character driven excellence.Full Review and Director Peter Sattler Q+A on our website - http://gonewiththemovies.com/reviews/camp-xray-review.php</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched the movie, there is an surge of such cheap emotional movies in India as well. People try to give a assumed and non-existent humane side of terrorist. The woman was emotionally unstable and environment was artificially created to make American soldiers look brutal...These movie makers do a lot of dis-service by making these kind of movies... powerful acting and powerful direction but only to spread wrong propaganda...The latest unrest against the police you guys see in America has a lot to do with how the police is shown in the movies and this kind of movies would result in people starting to doubt the defense forces also. Few months back i would have loved the movie, but we got movies like "haider" made in India recently and they were very well made movies but having seen the brutalities of the terrorist with our own eyes and having the people who suffered tell their tales, today i can safely say this movie is step in the wrong direction... The director need to know that al baghdadi running ISIS was released from American prison, so the guys who do not get released are clearly considered more dangerous than him... That scares me with the idea of making movies to show them as humans... This woman if she was caught in Syria would either be sex slave or beheaded... still getting emotional about a terrorist given a clean room and food on time is shameful...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay but apathetic picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a hard time understanding why the two main characters develop such a strong connection. It's not like their dialogue is so keen or even abundant, think Hannibal Lecter/Clarice Starling, that you'll notice an unlikely chemistry unfolding. Neither is there an awful lot we know about them, which is unpleasantly surprising given the film's length, but which admittedly does add to the glaring emptiness that is life in Camp X-Ray.And while there's a somewhat exciting sense of dread looming over the first half of the film, including fecal cocktails, shrink files, and literal references to Lecter indeed, it all gets really tame the further you get into the movie. A part of you is hoping for a violent confrontation, or at least a narrative resolution of Stewart's character's flagrant but excusable gullible nature. Yet here Hannibal Lecter turns out to be really just a loving, sensitive, and innocent man.Oh well.Regardless, the leading players remain fine actors, and the many closeups of Stewart's facial antics in particular elevate Camp X-Ray to an aesthetically attractive watch. There's a whole array of expressions this woman can display in a matter of seconds, even when none are required, and it's a good thing the director let her have her way. But as far as the story goes, this film sadly thrives on her and Moaadi's inspired interpretations only.</fullReview>

Even during the beginning which seems to go one way, you know what the stance of the movie is going to be in the end. And while it does have some arguments going for it, our main character does swing too early and too fast to the "other side".Kristen Stewarts "bored" face does suit the themes and what her character is going through to a level that is almost genius. As the story unfolds and we learn a character (we knew this was coming too), this won't leave us without emotions.

		<fullReview>It was a one sided narration, that is really a very bad for this kind of sensitive theme. But the prime intention was to bring the Guantanamo Bay detention camp's atrocity on the detainees by the US military. Well, it actually avoids those strong cruelties, and focuses the unusual relationship between a detainee and a woman guard.Limited cast, shot mostly in a single location with the budget of just one million USD, and an ordinary opening, but ended strong. I assumed a lot of things likely to happen while I was watching. Like Amy Cole (Kristen Stewart) was in undercover, to make detainees talk and collect the information. Because she was the only woman around, but as usual like most of the time I was wrong. It was so plain and filled with human emotions.I was strong and confident that they were just torturing the terrorists who deserved it. If you see it from the human perspective that was slightly a over-limit, only if you exclude their crimes. I just felt it was a propaganda to show US in a bad light. That is the reason it will not show terror strikes in the movie that committed by any of the detainee characters, but only the consequences they face.A Hollywood movie specially made to make feel good for the terrorists and those who support it. Okay, I agree, some were innocents. While fishing, a few other marine animals also gets trapped in the net as well, for that I feel sorry what happened to them. But 95% of them were heartless monsters. Everyone will have their own opinion on this film based on their religion, nationality or sympathetic for simply being a human, and everything are fair.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Directorial Debut. Completely wrong 'R' rating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this is his directorial debut I am expecting big things to come from Mr Saddler in the future. This film is thought provoking, and as a previous reviewer says, it stays with you for a while. You are not left comfortable at all, which is a good thing. The thought of being on the wrong side of that cell door (shudder). However, Mr Saddler does not ram any particular view he may have down your throat at all. He is not drawn into making the plot overly political (if at all) or sentimental. The film just plays out the story, very well with well above average performances from the two leads. It is a very thin tightrope well traversed. Let the story do the talking and good for him for playing it out in that fashion.I have to say I don't quite rate Miss Stewart as an particular draw to any film I see, I don't think she has a good 'range', but she is really stepping up her acting performances with the likes of Adventureland, Still Alice and this. She is obviously trying and I applaud that. She could have quite easily played puff pieces for years after Twilight and taken the money. I really don't think she does the above projects for $$$. If she is taking the 'one for the bank, one for me' approach then good for her.Back to the film. I am stunned at the R rating it has over in the US. Why? I have seen FAR worse films with a lesser rating that I wouldn't want sub 17 year olds seeing, but this....I would want every 14+ year old to see. Get their little grey cells thinking. I must have a short memory as I can neither remember any overt nudity or 'excessive' swearing. If there were lots of bad words it is a credit to the film that I didn't notice and it must have instead added to the characters portrayal. It is a shame as I would have imagined the R rating would have put off many seeing it at the Cinema.A very odd decision.So, this has been on my list for a while and I am glad I ticked it off. A Summer blockbuster it isn't. But it will have me keeping an eye out for future projects by both the Director and Miss Twilight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You are here to prevent them from dying." Cole (Stewart) is a soldier who has just been assigned to Guantanamo Bay guarding detainees. She is told the rules and follows them to the letter. When she begins to talk with Ali (Moaadi), a detainee her view on her position begins to change. This is a movie that is good but will make you mad. I am not sure how accurate the events portrayed in this film are, but if even half of what is shown is true things are very messed up in the system. The movie itself is good and worth seeing, but it is also very close to the movie Boys of Abu Ghraib that came out about a year ago. Both deal with soldiers guarding detainees at a base and the horrific events that go on there, on both sides of the bars. I did like this movie and think it is worth seeing, but on the other hand I thought the Boys of Abu Ghraib was a little better. Overall, a movie that is well worth your time and will make you a little mad. That is a good thing. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thought-provoking, moving, raw, tear-inducing, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I particularly liked the moments of much-needed levity mixed with the very serious backdrop of Guantanamo Bay. I watched this because I was going through a list of Kristen Stewart movies and I'm so glad I did. She portrayed young soldier Amy Cole magnificently. Her unlikely friendship/bond with Ali, a "detainee" felt so real, their acting spot-on. And I don't want to give any spoilers, so I will just say that the last half of the movie had me crying like a baby. Seriously, this movie is a must-see! BUT, if you're looking for an action, war, typical soldier flick- this is not it. The movie moves pretty slow and is VERY character/emotion focused. Which is why it made it so great IMO, but it probably isn't for anyone. Nevertheless, the story is worth the watch- I won't be forgetting this one anytime soon.</fullReview>

No complications. I'm left with the thought that the maker of the movie might want to send us a message. Perhaps that not all of those kept at 'Gitmo' are in fact terrorists. With USA's paranoia I think it's safe to say that the terrorist card sometimes is handed out a bit too easy. Especially since the inmates of 'gitmo' are put there without a trial.Conclusion: It's absolutely watchable, no wow factors but I would recommend it. 7/10</fullReview>

Most of the countries have these kind of rules like in India we have TADA and PORTA , these rules are good for the security of a country but the torture that detainees got in these rules is very brutal and is the violation of Human rights. We must appreciate these rules being a responsible native of a country but we must appreciate the true execution of these rules being a Human Being. So now this is the time when we have to understand that about 75% of detainees are not terrorist and they deprived of their rights being a detainee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is so many things wrong with this movie and I only watched the first 15 minutes. This is the first movie in years that I have turned off before I finished watching it.Don't get me wrong, I watch a lot of movies, so there is plenty of opportunity to see movies as bad as this and it just hasn't happened in years. As someone who spent some time in the USAF, I hope I can assure you a tiny little lady who has just been briefed (not in full and in a group for some reason) on her arrival and by an E-2 (for some reason) is not going to be thrown into a dangerous situation (which wasn't dangerous until they went into the detainee's room) that she clearly isn't trained to handle.Then they go over her tactical responsibility and the guy who goes in front of her takes her responsibility (which flip flops as the scene progresses) and she stands there doing nothing before going in the catch an elbow in the face-mask which somehow busts her lip. Then she doesn't stay in the room but abandons her team instead... So lame. The pointless banter afterward on the bus was the final straw. Save yourself some time you won't get back and don't watch this garbage. Kristen Stewart is as bad in this as every other movie I have seen her in. While her shy teenager face worked in the Twilight series, it is extremely out of place in this film.Unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Camp X-ray: A war drama - beyond the combat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Camp X-Ray is a war drama, however I would argue that this film really is not about war at all, perhaps revolving around war but placing it into the war genre is a bit of a stretch, especially because it is so unlike other films that fit more snugly into the genre. I would say it is more so about relationships between 'protectors' and 'predators' as a result of war-related conflict. I say this because I can imagine people like me, who generally do not enjoy war films, being deterred by such generalisation. It would be much better described as a war drama - beyond the combat. Viewers that aren't drawn to such graphic violence that is present in most war films will find this film much easier to enjoy, similarly those who find lengthy action scenes boring will also find this film much more engaging.Camp X-Ray is masterfully created by first-time director, Peter Sattler - who made some very wise decisions in the making of this film. Despite the role of Amy Cole being originally intended for a male character, Sattler decided to change it to a female lead which really made things more interesting and allowed the film to widen the spectrum of the issues that it explored. For example, the film questions the validity of the ideal that is people who assume masculine traits are more suited to situations where emotions are not 'appropriate'. However the film suggests that sometimes these are the situations where an emotive response is most needed. So there is quite an interesting, underlying gender equality theme present in the film. Camp X-Ray is a very unique film. I feel like the relationship between soldier and detainee, cop and robber, good and questionably bad and others of the like, has never really been explored in this way before.Although I could not be less politically informed on the subject, the film does also explore the ignorance and stubbornness of pre-conceived opinions that some particular soldiers have towards the detainees in the film. (The context of Camp X-Ray is that of the fictional happenings at Guantanamo Bay after 9/11.) The conflict, division (or lack thereof) between doing what is right and humane and doing what is professional and required of you is also an interesting one that is discussed in the film.The casting is essentially perfect, written with Kristen Stewart in mind, Sattler himself said that Stewart was the 'dream cast for the part'. Her often critiqued although highly questionable 'cold and emotionless' approach to acting that people claim she has, was very much appropriate and worked well for this part. Peymen Moaddi/Payman Maadi was also a good choice for a 'good guy'. Both presented impressive performances. For what it is, Camp X-Ray is also a very visually interesting film and captures the uneasy, tense atmosphere almost uncomfortably well. The pace of the film did feel slow at times but it was engaging enough to not feel too boring. However, the ending was really what did it, most likely where the climax of enjoyment (and emotion) took place during the film. What I think is special about this film is that it can provoke an extremely emotional response despite the subject of the film being so detached and unrelatable to most of its audience.The story of Camp X-Ray really pulled through and has proved to establish Sattler as a director rather well. Shout out to the trailer because that was excellent too. The name of the film is also cutely metaphoric which I like. I very much enjoyed this film. 8.2/10, do you have any thoughts?

		<shortDescription>Typical Kristen Stewart face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The face of the main actress mainly shows one emotion throughout the whole movie. Therefore it is very difficult to figure out whether she is feeling okay or is (very) sad, only a tear at the end indicates a change in an otherwise emotionless face of the actress Kristen Stewart (who is already widely known for her emotionless face from the Twilight). The story is very interesting but the depiction is utterly confusing because of the lack of emotions (one can never know what Amy Cole feels).The plot of the movie is interesting. However, some more action should be expected from a "war" movie instead of walking in silence. The development of the story is unexpected so you cannot know what to expect, unless if this was achieved by hiring an actress who isn't capable of showing any emotions with her face at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exactly as expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Private Annie Cole (Kristen Stewart) from a small Florida town is a new guard at Guantanamo Bay. Her inexperience gets her hit with feces by Ali Amir. Ali is desperate for the last Harry Potter book. He never stops talking and they eventually strike up a hesitant relationship.The main problem for this film is that it ends exactly where one expects a movie like this would end up. At first, I think Stewart is possibly the worst guard ever. Then I figure she could actually be a good interrogator if she got some training. Ali couldn't stop talking to her and that's half the battle. However, her naivety is really grating. The last act is problematic and the destination is exactly where one expects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will most likely have the plot laid out in your head 5 minutes into the film. I thought "there's no way it follow such a worn out, unrealistic, unoriginal formula", boy was I wrong. One of those films where you're laughing at performances, laughing as friends just turn it into a game of guessing the next lazy, typical, unimaginative direction the story will take, and laughing at how the writers are obviously trust fund babies who haven't left Manhattan in their lives. I've never seen any of the Twilight films, but I now understand why people criticize Kristen Stewart, she brought nothing to her character. She did manage to add to the struggle female soldiers encounter in trying to be viewed as equals. Spend the 2 hours volunteering at Vet's hospital, don't patronize garbage like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Sattler needs more to discover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it was not storyline which take spectators to sit on the edge of their seat to watch whole of film, but undoubtedly the brilliant play of both Kristen Stewart and Peyman Moaadi together which was one of the strong point of that. The film keep you wait to see what will happen in the relationship between a detainee and its guard, a relationship,based on standard, should have never occurred. people from America seems to be more interested about the film , not because they are looking for a Drama to watch, maybe they prefer other in this genre, but it's director Peter Sattler's research about what probably would be happen to Guantanamo and American troops there and his attempt to picture it. Americans sons, friends, army are in war in all over the world and this is what people want to touch troops lifetime from distance. Places seems to be peaceful, clean and sometimes intimate(library, sport, food,..) and not as dark as what we thought about Americans prisons in Guantanamo, but lack of variety of locations and persist to film at only 2 or 3 places during characters dialogue, made viewers somehow limit, those who wished to see much more scenes from there. Meaning of hurriedness to finish filming comes in audiences mind first. The number of "8" seems bold and mystery, 8 years later, 8 month later, hit the ball for 8 times but sounds too long to catch 48, and so on that perhaps should be asked from director about his insisting on number 8 in this film. Generally for those who used to see American star Kristen Stewart in Twilight, this provide a new face for her fans, also the same goes for Peyman Moaadi which Iranian can see him in new character with a foreign language and in strange locations, beside American stars who have millions of followers in Iran.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Fonda would like this crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rated Camp X-ray a 4/10 because the acting was good. But take away the solid performances from Peyman Moaadi and the supporting cast and all your left with is just another Hollywood liberal fantasy smear campaign. And don't let all the positive reviews for Kristen Stewart fool you. It's the exact same Kristen Stewart that did the vampire movies, it's just this time she is in a movie that the liberal Hollywood critics love. Watch the movie if you think Kristen Stewart is cute. Watch it because of Peyman Moaadi's good performance. But if Hollywood's liberal political agenda sickens you like it does me, give this one a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only a Sick F would Make such a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but there is NO moral equivalence between our guards at Gitmo and the Islamic terrorists who are housed there. These people were not sheep herders who were randomly picked up and thrown in prison, they were hardened Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders and soldiers. What's worse, the producers and directors KNOW this and still make a movie where the Islamic terrorist is the good guy and the American soldiers are either evil or dumb. I just don't like Stewart but she plays her part well here. Of course none of the US soldiers at Gitmo are to her taste but a prisoner is. Why? Because he reads books. Well gee, Hitler loved dogs. Given the opportunity, every prisoner held at Gitmo would gladly chop off the heads of Stewart and as many Americans as he can get his hands on. Yet this one particular terrorist reads books and plays soccer so that makes him lovable to our heroine. The subject matter and Stewart make this movie worth seeing, but hold your nose at the end because it is a stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets be real, they are terrorists, not people. What a terrible movie. My friends and I have bled fighting these sh*tbags and you want to "connect" with them? This movie tries to play on the concept that the detainees at GITMO haven't actually done anything wrong. They are there because the are a threat to America. They are not there because we simply don't like muslims. It is a stupid movie and it makes me sick. It falls in line with Barry's agenda. Kristen Stuart plays the same role as every other movie, a weak female who doesn't have the stomach to do anything important. Lets see a movie that shows some patriotism and American pride. Make a better movie you liberal piece of garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Long Con?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been 4 years since i watched "Essential Killing". Movies with 'sympathetic' terrorists are very rare and they're always interesting to talk about. Camp X-Ray is a story of a man, whose life ended the day he was captured by the Americans. He was tortured and although he appeared to be innocent, he was thrown into a cell for the rest of his life, so that the story about his torture would never come to light.Finally after many years of suffering and mistreatment, a sensitive female soldier with problems of her own, started to treat him as a regular human being... blah, blah, blah!Are you kidding me? Did i watch a different movie than anyone else?Spoilers:- Why did Ali have these sudden changes of behavior during these years? Maybe because the only way to escape for a prison like this, or at least get a message out, is to shuffle the cards.- How much information did Cole involuntary give him?- Did Ali's drawings and sudokus contain cryptographic messages for Al Qaeda?-Did Ali manipulate Cole into going on vacation at Germany and ask questions about him (so that she gets under Al Qaedas's radar)? Or did he recruited her and he convinced her to deliver the book to Al Qaeda?Kudos to Peter Sattler for the excellent writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had crappy detective work. First of all, Army personal DO NOT say " Attention On Deck". As a veteran, I can't stand people trying to do a military movie and screw it in simple ways as this. I bet 90% of vets who watched this crap didn't like it because of the inconsistencies of Military regulations.Its upsetting to watch war movies when directors and writers are too lazy to learn military code. I had to turn it off and stop watching when she said that. The rest of the movie I couldn't watch because I knew it was going to be a non factual movie. Shame on the writers and directors for not doing their jobs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie because my friend was afraid to watch Poker Night thriller movie , so we booked two tickets for camp x-rayI didn't know anything about the story of the movie before i went to the theater and i find that makes my judgment fair.I. Story line:I read a lot about Gtmo camp (I'm an Arab , in case you didn't notice). This movie is making Guantanamo like 5 stars detention hotel. The camera just making a glimpse on the human rights violations , just a glimpse. I don't see starvation, beating, sex slaving.II. Picture:Well, not because the movie is talking about a prison that you lock us up. I don't know the director did that on purpose or he just did it like that, but i felt the most uncomfortable feeling in the most comfortable place to me (the cinema). 80% of the scenes were shot in the corridor between the cells with annoying colors. the robotic motion of the guards checking on the detainees, so annoying , and i don't think it is real.III. Acting:Kristin Stewart was very good in this character, finally she found what might fit her!! Payman Maadi, i see an excellent actor locked up in a cell of a bad made movie.Summary : I need my money back!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And lets just give our enemy terrorists jobs to cure all their troubles, pain and misfortune. While understanding their tragic life and upbringing. Why was this movie even considered to be written, financed and produced is beyond me, just a very unbelievable scenario. Its not a surprise to see this movie bombed miserably (pun intended) at the box office. And I don't understand how these Directors are so diluted with this Liberal Ideology to think compassion and love will win over evil? I doubt Kristen Stewart will travel to ISIS and say I'm so sorry for not understanding you troubles in life and just want us to be friends so please end your Holy War of Jihad and murder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guantanamo Bay Resorts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Ray is a compelling story how to survive between a few white walls. While watching this movie you might let it slip your memory that none of the living rooms have a ocean view. Cole (Kristen Stewart) is taking the lead in this breathtaking story, she is a young well minded American woman from a very tiny almost invisible village. Knowing such little from the world while gifted with an academic degree Cole wants more in life and escaping her present life. Seeking for adventure Cole soon landed in Guantanamo Bay to serve and protect and above all giving life some more context.When Cole starts her first round in Guantanamo prison bay she gets overwhelmed by the white unstained walls she finds in every single block.These spotless walls form such distraction that the focus on her main objective "prevent the detainees from suicide" almost fades away. investigating one of this empty cell blocks with her fellow soldier they couldn't notice any substandard. Standing there with nothing to say they could only remark that the space felt narrow. After visiting the deserted cell Cole felt an emptiness inside of her and desired a some temptation. Her idea to fill this gap is to delay her staying in the wash-up until someone opens the door. When some average looking with bad attitude and a little desperate (for army standards) officer finally came in, Cole soon found out that this wasn't love at first sight. After throwing her self to this officer, the officer himself couldn't refuse this gesture and decided to give Cole some proper treatment when she wanted to leave the event. Here it becomes clear that female cadets always reach out to their male companion and abuse is something that doesn't exist. Getting abused is just a fairytale that a woman makes up to get attention while being in the army. If you reading the story this way how even is it possible to blame the officer.When the end is near for Cole's favorite detainee and he gives a show that he wants to end his life Cole tries to hassle him out of it. But being a woman even with an academic degree she won't understand why any inmate in Guantanamo Bay wants to end his life. Even the inmate knows that she will never understand the feeling why someone would suicide between these white walls when your have nothing left to live for and feel humiliated more by the second. The reasoning about she doesn't understanding being an American being a woman or coming from a small village stays a cliffhanger and doesn't get revealed in the actual movie. Lets hope for a extended edition with the director's comments and not a sequel. In this science fiction based story you find out that: Harry Potter can save lives Prisoners of the Guantanamo Bay Resort are all guests Females in the army always start the sexual harassment by themselves A woman/American/US army/? can't understand why some living being in Guantanamo Bay loses all hope of surviving The movie seems to be funded by the military government of the USA and feels a bit like propaganda. A warning here is a place that this movie shouldn't be seeing without knowledgeable supervisors.IMDb rating: **** stars for the resort and * star for the fairy tale.If you are looking for a good science fiction you better skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sympathetic at all for the detainees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kristen Stewart plays Private Cole, a U.S. Soldier sent to Guantanamo Bay, who forms what can only be described as a "friendship" with a detainee named Ali.Judging as a film, Stewart does not render a great performance, the photography is actually quite good but the characters are cartoons designed to make Americans look bad and cruel.I felt this movie was nothing but an Anti-US propaganda movie from start to finish, as if the intentions of the filmmakers were for the audience to feel bad about the detainees at Guantanamo Bay.I felt no sympathy at all for the detainees, not one bit, no emotional connection with the characters.As a viewer you are bound to feel sympathetic for the struggles Private Cole goes through but she's a cartoon character, she's a horrible depiction of a female soldier as weak, and that depiction in itself is pathetic, shameful and untrue.This movie has moved back the clock few centuries in its depiction of a female soldier, and should be called an embarrassment to women and the US Army.Jessica Chastain's depiction of a determined, strong and persistent soldier in Zero Dark thirty was amazing, Stewart's was not by along shot, a very long shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Then I saw the movie with the girl from that popular vampire movie who had an affair with the director of a movie she was in, cheating on her boyfriend. One scene with her acting that was really off to me, was the one where she had that pained look in her eyes while she was talking with the detainee "47!". Men, what was that look for? That she wanted him so badly she didn't understand why or could not help it? Why do these people abuse the opportunity and power they have? You don't just make a movie because one idea comes to you. A movie is a cocktail of infinite ingredients which must not only be put in, but done so at the right time and, in the right amounts. The so-called "Camp X" is a travesty and a crime against all true lovers of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love Al Qaeda and ISIS or at least believe "we are the same" by all means see this movie. It always amazes me how much dislike for western culture or values exists in Hollywood, a place that would never exist in its current form in Iran, Syria or the new Islamic "Caliphate". If you thought Kristen Stewart could not act ... well you are right. I wonder how well one of these actors or writers would fare under Sharia law. Yes, we all know the US Armed Forces is the evil in the world ... so the message goes ... because it prosecutes innocent terrorists. And we really need Kristen Stewart to set us straight about this terrible evil. If a resurrection of 'Tokyo Rose' is your cup of tea, see this movie by all means. If you know someone in the military or respect what they are really doing for us, then avoid this poorly written movie by all means.</fullReview>
