		<fullReview>Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story may be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama. A must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to display true works of visual art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 for it's amazing visual display.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cell: whoa... eww... whoa...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I reviewed a film helmed by a music video director, I was very angry at what I'd seen (`Mystery Men'), but Tarsem Singh spares us the fish-eye lenses and commercial overindulgences and decides to concentrate on presenting an astonishing visual and audible journey into the mind of a serial killer in `The Cell'.Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) kills women by drowning them in glass cells, all the while videotaping the event. Afterwards, he disfigures the bodies to resemble dolls and then tosses the finished `products' off highways into ditches and streams. Nice guy. He also likes to suspend himself on chains attached to hooks inserted directly into his back. Lovely.Meanwhile, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is hot on the killer's trail, and although Carl's started to get sloppy, he's just kidnapped another girl and she has 40 hours before her cell fills with water. Carl is soon apprehended, but only because he enters into a schizophrenic seizure and falls into a coma on his kitchen floor. A coma? But how are they going to find out where the last victim is? Oh, if only they could TRAVEL INSIDE HIS MIND. Hey, what a coincidence! Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a child psychologist involved in an experimental project that allows her to TRAVEL INSIDE THE MIND of coma victims.And so begins a strange array of visuals and sounds, blended together so unusually that you honestly feel like you're experiencing a dream? a not so pleasant dream. Not only is Carl's mind slightly twisted, it's violent, disturbingly sexual, and very graphic. But, it's also like a train wreck; you can't help but look. Oddly enough, Mr. Singh clearly had the resources to make his special effects scream out at you with bright color and absurd lavishness, but he chose instead to simplify, placing the terror in the scale and content of the visuals. I can't even use an example. All I can say is think about a dream you've had that you couldn't describe to someone, and that's what watching this movie is like. The photography is so stunning that it virtually eliminates the need for dialogue (only about half the film has discourse), and coupled with the horrifically spooky and scathing soundtrack, the film literally takes on a life of its own.My only objection is that when all is said and done, the only character we really understand is the serial killer. Several clues about the other characters' pasts led me to believe that their lives would come into play and that their own memories would be tested and confronted. To me, this would have taken this story to yet another psychological level, but perhaps it would have been too much for viewers.Despite this shortcoming, `The Cell' stills provides a myriad of images that will make you want to watch a lot of cute cartoons before turning in for the night. Still, I don't know what was more disturbing: the movie, or the parents in the next row over who brought their two small kids to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've said before that some films are like `nothing you have ever seen before'. Well, The Cell takes that saying and burns it down, blows it up and drowns it. This movie is something you could and can be only imagined. And if you then told someone about it they'd have you locked up for a very long time. It could be categorized as a Sci-fi thriller and then as a serial killer film. Like Seven and Silence of the Lambs this is not the ordinary serial killer film. It stands on it's own as a new kind of thriller.Jennifer Lopez stars as Catherine Deane, the best psychotherapist in the business. She works for a company who has developed the latest technology in therapy. She has the ability to go inside the mind of anyone and find out the reasoning to his or her distress. Enter Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn), a FBI agent tracking down a very sick serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), who drowns his victims then dresses them up like dolls. On a FBI raid of his home Stargher goes into a coma and the whereabouts of his next victim are unknown. So Deane takes the job of going into his mind to find out where the victim is being held. And that's when this film gets intense, seriously intense.The director Tarsem Singh, known for the award winning R.E.M. video `Losing my Religion', blows away everything you could have imagined. The dream sequences are beautifully shot with many camera tricks, creepy color distribution, graphic images, and a tense score. They are extremely trippy and surreal. They actually have a dream feel because anything goes and there are no rules. Lopez performance is as good as she looks. She nails the psychotherapist dead on and does a great job in showing the different aspects of her character. Vince is Vince, very cool, very low key, and very real. D'Onofrio will scare you. His Carl Stargher would make even Hannibal Lecter scream for mommy. This guy is more disturbed than ever imagined. He has to be seen to believe it.Tarsem, with this film, has become one of my favorite directors and I will go see any film with his name on it. The Cell can only be described as a Sci-fi serial killer thriller that's visually disturbing, creepy, and one of the wildest films ever. It runs along the line with Seven for a good serial killer film and Event Horizon for a graphically sick and twisted film. This is best summer movie and the best film I've seen all year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every once in a while a film comes along that stands apart from all others made in years. The Matrix did it last year, and The Cell has done it in 2000.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was In Dreams. In that movie, you didn't see insanity, you were THERE. Now The Cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying. The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating, most of this stuff has never been seen in film before.The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. In fact, it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim, while in The Cell, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim. However, despite the unfortunately weak story, The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. None that have ever been made even come close to it. Also, the film had good direction and was extremely well acted. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances (he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of Psycho), and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career (the other being the great Out of Sight). Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit, it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history. The Cell is an incredibly well-made film, and it deserves to be recognized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientist including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe that this method might work. Catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the dumped body, Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl just went into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. In a way this part of the story is pretty standard.Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short: Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of Carl. A tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure Catherine will try to get the location out of Carl's mind.It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who did music videos before this, in a way goes back to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style felt completely new, the way 'Three Kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you like a film, 'The Cell' will not disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open minded, of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still, a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make "The Cell" a memorable and above average movie."The Cell" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. Yes, it's real eye candy to watch all. The movie has some perfectly 'dreamy' sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This movie is a perfect mix of an art-house type of movie and a typical Hollywood-thriller, that is accessible to both fans of the genre.The story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense. Because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like I mentioned before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. I'm not particularly happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie. Her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. He didn't fit the role well enough and no, I'm not saying that because I'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days. The rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.The musical score by Howard Shore was also surprising good and was sort of "Se7en" like at times. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere.It's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still "The Cell" is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most beautiful horror films ever made. It is a dream to watch and a nightmare to consider. Jennifer Lopez is stunning in her role and is never out of character. She manages to be both strong and vulnerable at the same time. I just bought it on DVD, and the deleted scenes and the director's commentary are included. This is an artistic masterpiece and terrifying thriller, too. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Style over substance. But what a style it is. "The Cell" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim. Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production. Each dream sequence is like a nightmare-ish painting in motion, from the landscapes to the costumes. But the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about. Without him, you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only, which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary. Lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway, though she's as gorgeous as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he overacts to boot. He tried too hard to become his character and it showed. Stick to comedy, Vince! Even so, this movie is so visually frightening, I still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. "The Cell" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the "genre" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But "The Cell" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. "The Cell" wants to let you "see" what it's all about and not "how" it's all about, and I guess that's what some people don't like. True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought "The Cell" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as "weird" or "crazy". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say "Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs." If so, I want what he was smoking.**** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes watching and reviewing films a pleasure is when every once in a while when you least expect it a film like The Cell comes along and knocks your socks off!. This movie is a superb horror that has everything a you could want when you want to be scared out of your witts. Without going into the story all i will say is that it has a great beginning ,middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being transfixed with the amazing special affects. The acting is good without being outstanding but that does not matter because the subject matter and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies i have seen for a long while. It is one of those films that you imagine started as a novel but saying the credits it does not look like an adaptation , so a lot of credit must go to Mark Protosovich the writer. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Striking And Disturbing Virtual Reality Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A serial killer , Carl Stargher , has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell . He is apprehended by the FBI , but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water Take a look at the above premise and you'll see that there's a very much seen it all before look to it . The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting . If I mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of Stargher then sets up a different film entirely This wouldn;'t be enough to make THE CELL a different class of thriller but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller . The cinematography by Paul Laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but Singh doesn't let it end there , things like costume design where Stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller What stops THE CELL becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative . We see a third character , a FBI man enter Stargher's domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing momentsIt should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable , then involving . One scene where a FBI agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button . You'll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually striking but thematically empty serial killer thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell starts as serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) kidnaps Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff) who he intends to be his next victim, Stargher takes Julia to an isolated underground bunker &amp; imprisons her in a large glass tank which will start to fill with water &amp; eventually drown her. However FBI agents lead by agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) are close to catching Stargher &amp; raid his house only to find Stargher comatose on the floor after having some sort of seizure. The doctors say Stargher will never regain consciousness &amp; that his latest victim Julia is doomed to die. Then they decide to use an new technology that allows one person to enter the mind of another using computers, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is given the job of entering the mind of a serial killer &amp; finding out where he has hidden Julia in order to save her life. It isn't pretty inside Stargher's mind &amp; with time running out the pressure is on to find the answers...This American German co-production was the feature film directorial debut of Tarsem Singh &amp; while one cannot deny The Cell is a striking visual experience it's less impressive on other counts. If we forget about the lush &amp; extravagant visuals for a moment there's not that much of a film here to be honest, the serial killer angle is laid bare within the opening sequence &amp; as such there are no twists or surprises in that regard. We know Stargher is the killer from the get-go &amp; the film plays to expectations in this aspect. The character's are fairly poor, the ever awful Jennifer Lopez's character in particular has no sort of story at all, we never find anything out about her &amp; apart from walking around some fancy sets wearing some bizarre clothes she doesn't really have anything to do. Other character are similarly short changed in the development stakes. At about 100 odd minutes the pace is alright but I did like the film better while it was a straight serial killer thriller &amp; I sort of lost interest once Lopez went into Stargher's mind with some surreal &amp; bizarre moments that aren't exactly bad but I didn't really know what to make of them. The actually process in which Lopez enters Stargher's mind is never really explained &amp; it looks more like virtual reality than a computer programme with those suits that they wear. I didn't hate The Cell but I didn't love it either, it looks fantastic but it's also rather shallow &amp; somewhat empty on the inside.As already mentioned by just about everyone else who has ever seen The Cell some of the visuals are stunning from the sets to the special effects &amp; the costumes which are lavish, extravagant &amp; a joy to see. The Cell is a great looking, very arty &amp; frankly gorgeously photographed film. The camera is free flowing, it travels everywhere from high shots to wide shots to tracking shots there's always something to look at &amp; appreciate in The Cell but is that enough? Not really. There's a bit of nastiness with D'Onofrio hanging himself from the ceiling by metal hooks &amp; masturbating over his dead victim &amp; there's also an unpleasant scene in which someones guts are pulled out of their body on a spit roast thing. While it looks great &amp; it's inspiration lies in surreal paintings &amp; other works it's not scary &amp; there's surprisingly little tension as it's fairly predictable with no real twists or surprises.With a supposed budget of about $33,000,000 The Cell looks great &amp; has lavish production values &amp; decent CGI effects, filmed in California &amp; Namibia. The acting is OK, I personally hate Jennifer Lopez as I don't think she can act, I don't think shes that good looking &amp; she definitely can't sing so whats the point of her existence?The Cell is a visually striking serial killer thriller that is very easy on the eye &amp; features some truly memorable imagery but it doesn't really cut the mustard on any other count. Followed by a DTV sequel The Cell 2 (2009) which by all accounts is awful.</fullReview>

I was not mistaken ;-)A lot of the imagery stems from Tarkovsky films directly; especially from 'Stalker', 'Nostalghia', 'The Mirror' and last but not least: 'The Sacrifice'('Offret')So it's Tarkovsky badly misinterpreted with Singh delivering us such fine bonus, totally misplaced, christian moralities as 'salvation through cleansing of the soul' bla bla 'baptism', 'god-me-son triangularity', purgatory scenes, heaven and hell as ying and yang, 'Saint Catherine The Pure', bla bla, o lord.....The Cell attempts to run deep, but it's just very very shallow.Vision, dear Mr. Sing, not just images !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Weak script. Bad acting (except for D'Onofrio, who has done memorable work). Even big Latin butts don't do it for me. (Watch Musetta Vander as Mrs Baines who outclasses Lopez. )Science fiction with absolutely no science. Every plot device is stolen.What is interesting is the art -- I suppose it is a matter of taste how effective it is. I really like this sort of thing when done well. Done poorly is `What Dreams May Come.' Done well is `Prospero's Books.'In between are all manner of mixes of brilliant imagination and pretense. I'm willing to tolerate a lot of pretense, because I think the world needs lots of risktaking so far as cinematic vision. `Titus' failed to hit a home run with me, but I celebrate the attempt. Not so sure here.The problem I have is a matter of coherent vision. Some scenes impress. Some effects work. But it is all a jumble as if many people generated many different notions, using whatever was available. If an attempt had some power, it was kept regardless of whether it fit an overall concept. So what we have is a dozen different 3 minute episodes that use roughly the same characters. Some are effective, most not. Few are original.Ridley Scott and Peter Greenaway have the ability to build a vision that is sustained through a film, that because it sustains, can be elaborated and enfold depth. Their visions can serve as a structure into which other components fit. With less novelty, all good directors do. DePalma comes to mind. Others.The difference between what can be done and what is here is vast.Why do filmmakers subconsciously relate suspense of a film to suspending people in that film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically yet ANOTHER predictable, boring, slow paced "Silence of the Lambs" rip-off.The Cell is extremely dumbed down for its audience -- they seem to think that we're as inane as our public educations would suggest. There might as well have been huge yellow arrows pointing at D'Onofrio with "crazy bad guy" spelt out nearby, or at that albino dog with "pseudo-exotic symbol for crazy bad guy's soul."Lopez (magnanimous as always) is some sort of sugarsweet Mary Poppins character that magically makes everything better for everyone. A hateless, unhated curly-topped Curly Sue. The Saint of all Saints? (How un-sacrilegious of our dear Catholic conceptor and this, his psychological daystallion/nightmare.) Vaughn, on the other hand, is nasty. This man couldn't act himself out of bed in the morning. I'm glad somebody finally disemboweled him. (I was having an urge to do something similar...)Albeit all that, final remark: I actually recommend at least one sit through. Simple reason is that the sequences where you FINALLY enter D'Onofrio's brain are beyond words. Incredible cinematography that hasn't been seen before [aftertaste not of Liquid Television quality, but still interesting]. These vignettes are obviously the only talent of our director -- they are greatly different in style than the surrounding lameness of the "crime investigation." Glossied up, perfected, liquefied visual compositions, that although sometimes too conveniently obvious [great, why don't you just give EVERYONE those stupid white contacts...oh wait a minute, you did], they're quite impressive, PhotoShopped, bubbling apple cores and apple skins of the pre-assumed subconscious of our D'Onofrio.

The rest of it (the inexcusable, pathetically boring stale bread surrounding the delectable delicatessen choice meats) is completely avoidable and too predictable to be taken seriously.

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Lopez a psychotherapist? Yeah, and I'm the fifth member of The Beatles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do the powers that be continue to cast Jennifer Lopez in unbelievable roles? She was excellent in Selena, and pretty good in Money Train, which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself. However, roles like this just draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for that unremarkable performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break!Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues. When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.Lopez's acting here is typically below average. I can't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has. She's no Julia Roberts, but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field. Well, she's not even in the same stadium. Sure, she is a very sexy lady; however, that isn't going to carry a film, and it certainly doesn't carry this one. With anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent, especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.Having said all that, this film is visually stunning. The colors are fabulous, and the story line isn't half bad in a B-movie kind of way. The audio here is superb as well. This movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline, and major points for how it looks and sounds. Unfortunately, the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notches.My Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Open head, insert garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we walked out of ?The Cell', my friend Bryan said, "Open head, insert garbage." You can't argue with that. ?The Cell' is a sci-fi thriller set in a vaguely futuristic world in which psychologists like Jennifer Lopez can put on a body-suit made out of Twizzlers, drape a cyber-hankie over a patient's face, and transport themselves into the patient's dreams. As luck would have it, it turns out that our dreams are filled with the backdrops from Obsession commercials, and costumed by Ming the Merciless.The dream sequences are supposedly the trippy and fun parts of the movie, as Lopez tries to get at the core of murderer Vincent D'Onofrio's psychosis, chasing him through the landscape of his minddddddd YYYYyyyyyyyyy hch wha? Oh, sorry? drifted off to sleep just thinking about it. Anyway, the dream sequences aren't too good.This is a serial-killer movie so jaded that even the most horrific crimes elicit little more than a knitted brow from the main characters. At one point our heroes carry on a conversation while a TV in the same room plays video of a woman being murdered. Really, that woman in the video should be quiet? she's interrupting their conversation with all that screaming and begging.The posters for ?The Cell' tease us with the line: "This summer, enter the mind of a killer." What a concept! You'd think we'd never seen ?Silence of the Lambs' or ?Manhunter' or ?Dreamscape'. And if you haven't seen those movies, go rent them? they understand how to be a thriller better than ?The Cell' does.Jennifer Lopez, however, makes this movie bearable. Despite the strange wardrobe and makeup (even when not in somebody's dream), she's genuinely committed-and after all those tabloid headlines about whether or not she's having her booty surgically removed, it's gratifying to see it on the big screen in all its glory. The always-welcome Vince Vaughn plays the cop who comes to Lopez for help, but Vince doesn't get to do much more than run and yell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quay brothers should sue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Originality" was not an item on the agenda when this film was put together out of old worn-out cliches and stolen visual imagery. I fell for Roger Ebert's hype and went to see it. The serial killer plotline pushed the film over into exploitation movie territory; I think by now I've seen enough movies where the passive female victim waits to be rescued, and the periodic cuts to her in her "cell" failed to generate any suspense or sympathy and just served to underline the exploitation. The plot, as if not dumb enough already, was dumbed down with the help of a stupidly expository script (J. Lopez's voiceovers of "I'm already in", "His victims", and the overemphasised "Aha!" moment with the engraved metal plate), and the allegedly "original" visual imagery was pretty much without exception stolen from somewhere, especially the sequence which followed the Quay brothers' "Street of Crocodiles" (a great short film, by the way) almost shot-for-shot. Tarsem even steals from himself, with the backdrop of the "Losing my religion" video (itself cribbed from Tarkovsky's "The Sacrifice" and the still photography of Jan Saudek, amongst other places) making an appearance in one sequence. (The film makes an excuse for this "homaging" via the conceit that an individual's mental imagery is constructed from that individual's sensory and aesthetic worlds, with a statue of a horse forming the basis for an early scene, and a painting of medieval torture forming the framework of another. ) To sum up: I found the suspense boring, the plot predictable, and the eye candy irritating. A matter of taste, I suppose; you may like it. Just don't fall for the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say that this movie doesn't suck, and you should go see it. Because despite its flaws, it entertains, and that's what's important.The visual effects are stunning to the core and Jennifer Lopez's ass actually doesn't star in this movie. She's proven that she actually CAN act (even if in extremely forced dramatic moments), and she does add a lot to the movie.The script itself is rather thin and is more like a placemat for which the plate of CG goodness is set upon. The visuals are really remarkable, and if the core of the movie didn't stink, it might have been so good.The movie doesn't really have a good story to tell. It has scenes that will shock you, will disturb you, and will make you laugh (if unintentionally). But for the most part, you're gonna see it for the visuals.The much talked about nun scene is, quite honestly, dumb, forced, and tacky. Vince Vaughn, who I've worshipped since Swingers, doesn't really get his groove on until well into the movie - clunky dialogue and a bad haircut basically ruin any chance of us seeing him act professionally. He has his moments, but he really sucks in this movie.So, to summarize: ? Marginal acting ? Forced dialogue ? Workable plot ? Incredible visual effects ...and most importantly, everyone else said that this movie was very self-important. In retrospect, I have to agree. Here's a movie that takes itself too seriously for its own good. A director like Sam Raimi could've turned this into something good, but Tarsem Singh was either trying too hard or was too arrogant about his vision.Go see it, because it IS entertaining. But it's weighted down from being the memorable cult classic it could be by a series of wretched flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool visuals with almost nothing of substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing "The Cell" it's like seeing a very long Nine Inch Nails/ Marilyn Manson music video with a shoehorned serial killer story : While I have to admit that some of the images displayed in this movie are actually impressive or fascinating to look at (Some scenes depicting the mental world of the serial killer are both beautiful and disturbing) the truth is that the main plot of the film is not interesting at all, being mostly shallow and filled with many clichés and stereotypes that have been done too many times before. In fact, almost all the events that take place in "The Cell" seem just "excuses" in order to show lots of weird imagery, combined with some forced symbolism that actually doesn't have very much to do with the plot in order to give this a "deep" appearance.Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn are pretty unconvincing in their respective roles, being the main reason of why I have hard time trying to care about their characters. Only Vincent D'Onofrio makes a decent effort in order to portray in a convincing his twisted character, despite all the amount of clichés concerning to the personality of the serial killer.And that's the main reason of why "The Cell" doesn't work. If a movie doesn't have a good story and the characters are uninteresting, not even the best visuals can save it. The overall weakness of the plot ruins all the effect that the impressive images have, making this a shallow experience, despite all the violence and disturbing content. Unfortunately, the excessive focus in the style rather than in the substance seems to be a common characteristic of the movies directed by Tarsem Singh, were the splendid visuals are overshadowed by the extremely weak scripts. At least in "The Fall", I was able to care about the main characters, and the plot wasn't as boring and pretentious as in this movie.Even with all the nightmarish content that it had "The Cell" was a forgettable experience for me.</fullReview>

After the police track down serial killer Carl Stargher, they find he has fell into a coma, this is bad news as his last victim is holed up in a cell that fills with water at frequent intervals, she's still alive but only Stargher knows where she is......The Cell to me was working just fine as a standard serial killer maniac on the loose film, we are introduced to the maniac early on {Vincent D'Onofrio on disturbed form}, and we get repulsed to the point that we are in no doubt that this is a troubled mind. The film then shifts from basic formula to one of pure fantasy, and as beautiful as some of the sequences and images are, the film goes dangerously over the top to create style over substance.It's an above average multi genre piece, but the acting is less than great, which in truth evens the films novelty value out. It's certainly worth that once only viewing, but thinking hard about it afterwards will only frustrate you because you realise they got carried away with the gimmick, 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually astounding film that works on most levels that it attempts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cell" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, "a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. And there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona. The movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. While I feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience, I find it to be completely fascinating.Right from the opening credits, with Lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treat. Every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her "patients", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. The camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. The characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. If you don't enjoy anything else about "The Cell", you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes.The casting is top notch also. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, utilizing her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom-com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is fairly convincing as an FBI agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio that has the biggest impression here. It's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted at his actions, yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful within his realm, yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. It's a great performance from an underrated actor.While "The Cell" doesn't work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts (some of the actions of the characters are not believable) and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere in "The Cell" among the cut-and-paste MTV visuals, the cure-for-insomnia storyline, and the wooden acting from the leads there are some disturbing, offensive and just plain dumb ideas.Did you know, for instance, that if the water is REALLY cold, a drowned woman's nipples will remain rosy and erect for days? We also learn that schizophrenia is a viral infection. (Ah-choo! Oops, sorry, you're mad.) Or is it some strange, water-activated brain lesion, a kind of dehydrated Alzheimers?Deranged science aside, though, this film stands but mainly falls on its visuals. The director and designer are trapped in the MTV groove, in the sad belief that saturated colour and an unhealthy obsession with cloaks and cleavage make a feature film look as interesting as, say, the average Mariah Carey video. Someone on the production team obviously saw the Matrix then spent a few fevered hours over a hot copy of Photoshop cranking out the huge-scale post-industrial backdrops. The dully unprovocative bondage gear, piercing and chains are a tired combination of Victoria's Secret photo-shoot and second-hand Hellraiser. The late entry of some vaguely Catholic iconography looks like a cynical attempt to offend.What's truly disturbing is the idiotically sentimental "final solution" handed out in the climax, as if assisted suicide is a preferred or natural choice for someone with this kind of mental illness. More depressing and sad is the intelligent story arc which threatened to develop, contrasting victims of abuse who become abusers and others who find the strength to live normal lives, just before they all put scarves over their faces and beamed up into a Spice Girls video.Save your money, win back two hours of your life, just watch the Spice Girls video instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film might be one of the best of the year for me (if not, better films of the year which is 10-20 on my list) by showcasing some astounding visuals, a exceptional story and well thought out characters. Directed by Tarsem Singh (of R.E.M. music video Losing my Religion fame), he brings great visual and original quality to this picture that nowadays are being seen by quite a few music video/comercial directors turned film (Spike Jonze's Being John Malkvoich, David Fichner's Fight Club, David O. Russel's Three Kings, etc.). And I think that shows that people who have experience directing off screen and then come into film, disrupt the film industry, in a good way.Tarsem has Jennifer Lopez back on the screen after a year absence (she was musical last year) playing a psychologist of the mind, who is hired by FBI to go inside the mind of a killer (Vincent D'Onofrio is a terrifying performance) who is the only one who knows where his last victim might be. One might compare the visuals to 2001, which are similar. And another might compare the story to Silence of the Lambs, which has many similarities. One being that this time, D'Onofrio's mind gives the clues the Lopez like how in Lambs Hopkins gave the clues to Foster. One key thing also is that this film has fantastic visuals and a exceptional story to back it up. That is how The Matrix last year got to be so good, and how Hollow Man (which had a horrible story) 2 weeks ago was a waste. Definately a good film, but expect violence and gore more terrifying than the whole third act of Dawn of the Dead. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catherine Deane is a psychotherapist who has become involved in an innovative project to treat a catatonic boy who has not responded to normal treatment. The technique involves entering the boy's mind space and working with his subconscious to treat him. Progress has been slow though and the project is close to being wrapped up. Meanwhile, the FBI are close to catching a serial killer who drowns women as a form of torture before making them look like dolls and dumping their bodies. Clues lead them to find Carl but only as he falls into a coma of his own. With a girl still missing and no clue as to where she is slowly being drowned, the FBI turn to Deane and her team to go inside Carl's mind and try and find out where the girl is, before it is too late.I'm not sure if the plot is harder to swallow than Lopez's casting but certainly both these things take a certain amount of swallowing to get into this film. The plot takes elements from other films including all manner of serial killer movies to produce a setup that is hardly that inspiring a narrative on paper. However it works reasonably well enough as a frame for imaginative visual development. Naturally filling a film with style risks the substance falling down but here the former just about covers up for the weaknesses in the latter. Of course it never gets above the level of derivative serial killer movie and a load of obvious psychoanalysis stop it becoming very dark but in this area music video director Singh comes into his own.His visions are impressive and he directs really well with his expensive range of effects. True the material limits the meaning within the visual but it is hard to find the scenes dull! The cast are more part of these visuals than characters. Lopez is unconvincing and just simpers her way across the film, unable to really get any depth out of the story. Vaughn makes for a solid if unspectacular leading man while D'Onofrio hams it up the main villain. Support from Weber, Jean-Baptiste and a few others add a bit of interest and credit to Subkoff who produces a convincing turn despite being isolated from the majority of the story.Overall this is an average serial killer movie that is only really worth seeing because of the visuals. The story could have been much stronger but it works as a frame for the visual effects ? which is pretty much the same for the cast, who are just part of the look of the film rather than well developed characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Retrospective: Ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's just get this out of the way: I absolutely loved The Cell. I loved it in my first viewing and have continued to love it in subsequent viewings. Why? Well, visually speaking, it was ahead of its time, and by today's standards, its imagery has remained unmatched. A film like this would have never been able to get made today, one in which a studio would put millions of dollars into an R rated film that could turn the audience off due to its perverse visuals. Only Tarsem Singh could have created such beauty and disturbing imagery in a directorial debut. But what about the story, you might ask. Yes, I have to admit the story may be secondary, reminding one of The Silence of the Lambs, but remember, this film did dream heists before Inception did.With all this talk about the film's visual execution, some may say that The Cell is merely style over substance. However, I'd argue the style *is* the substance. The film is like an empty canvas where we can witness Tarsem's crazy and absolutely beautiful imagination. Still 15 years later, the visuals hold up incredibly well, provided without some dated CGI, but those are easily forgiven with the many things the film gets right with visual storytelling. Even scenes that take place outside the dream world are shot meticulously, every frame a painting (thanks Tony Zhou for the phrase). The film's cinematographer, Paul Laufer, should be given some recognition as well, providing some of the film's unconventional camera movements. It's a surprise to learn Laufer hasn't shot a film since The Cell, only working on music videos. Sadly, he's a talent untapped by Hollywood.The soundtrack by Howard Shore nicely complements the look of the film, providing a necessary momentum that slowly builds towards an explosive finale that is emotionally compelling as much as it is visually stunning. Despite the flack she gets, Jennifer Lopez is quite good in the film, who gives her character enough layers to be engaging. A young Vince Vaughn is also very good in his role as the FBI agent with an intriguing past the film doesn't delve too deep into. Lastly, Vincent D'Onofrio is outstanding as the film's complex antagonist, effectively playing the different facets of what could have been a forgettable, two dimensional villain. Overall, The Cell is an incredible film, unforgettable in its visual execution. Although the story is familiar, it is nonetheless involving with good performances from the actors who carry it. One wonders whether the film would work better today due to the vast progress of technology, but for now, The Cell is irreplaceable, with no other films that can rival it. At least, visually speaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarsem Singh is certainly a photographer at heart and the surreal imagery of this movie is definitely gallery worthy.This is a suspense/ thriller that delves into the mind of a serial killer that seemingly euthanized his victims not out of spite, but out of pity. This is illustrated when as a child, he drowns a small bird before his abusive father can defile it. It was more humane to kill the bird than to let it live in such an ugly world filled with pain, and this was emphasized with Carl (the killer) even at a young age.Much of the movie is shot from the perspective of Carl as a child, no doubt to gain sympathy from the viewer while he sets in an animated reversion of sorts while communicating synaptically with Lopez's psychotherapist character. It was interesting to see him speaking of his first messy inexperienced endeavor with misty reminiscence, and also to view the symbolism of the white dog, or of how he hung himself from the chains. Better than the story, though, was the cinematography. It was stunning.I was taken back to this film when I viewed the "Bodies" display at the Tropicana, which I believe is now showing at the Luxor in Las Vegas. (For those of you haven't been, these are actual humans preserved in silicone on display actively posed for easy viewing of vascularization, musculature, organ systems, etc?) In the film it was a horse with transverse cross sections between plated glass. The attention to detail with regard to the succinct slices showing the yet operational organs made my twisted little heart soar.It's interesting to me that Singh hasn't released much since "The Cell," but he does have "Immortals" and "The Brothers Grim: Snow White" in the works. If you haven't seen this movie, see it, especially if you dug "Se7en" or "Red Dragon". It has a similar "cop hot on the trail" feel to it, and much like the others, the villain is a shining enigma with a troubled past and a demented message of sorts. While "Se7en" gets kudos for creativity and "Red Dragon" has Fiennes, "The Cell" still has the unmatched scenery that makes me consider it to be ever so slightly better than the aforementioned.If you love gore, such as an excruciating spooling of Vince Vaughn's intestines slowly onto a wheel, and you want to be visually dazzled, this is your flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J Lo's first movie outing following the start of her music career and subsequent elevation to global sex symbol is actually not much of a film. It's basically a two hour music video full of interesting ideas that achieve nothing in particular.The Cell has a reasonably promising premise: Jennifer Lopez using a scientific device that allows her to enter the head of Vincent d'Onofrio's serial killer while Vince Vaughan sits around looking like Vince Vaughan usually looks in a film. Cue some nightmarish imagery and some craziness and you could be onto a winner.But it quickly becomes obvious no serious character study is going on here. Sure we're getting some creative visuals, but what they're telling us is actually pretty shallow. With a better script or more skillful director, we could have had a really interesting psychological thriller bought to life by quality actors in Lopez and D'Onofrio. Instead all we have is a lot of kind of arty looking stuff, some disturbing imagery, and talented actors struggling to bring life to characters straight from the cookie cutter.We are left with a film that despite having an interesting premise, good actors and stunning visuals, has nothing of value to say. A real wasted opportunity for what should have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually, The Cell is a very impressive movie, creating interesting and imaginative dreamscapes. The explorations into the unconscious are standard Hollywood dreams - weird and creepy or peaceful and beautiful, but with more internal logic than really dreams - and when the movie is in this alternate reality, it's pretty good.Unfortunately, the movie spends a lot of time in the real world, where it's an unpleasant and unoriginal serial killer flick. The worst scenes are the fetishistically detailed portrayals of the killer torturing and killing his victims before toying with their bodies. These scenes are incredibly creepy and disturbing, which might be a plus for some people, but made the movie very difficult for me to watch.Remove the horrific and the dreamy, and you've got a pretty conventional find-the-serial-killer-before-it's-too-late movie that adds nothing to the genre. The movie's only twist is its dream-technology, and you can't build a movie out of a little cool imagery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully made with some truly stunning scenes, particularly during the 'dream' sequences. Decent performances all round; particularly from Jennifer Lopez as Catherine Deane, I thought she played quite a tricky part very well and Vincent D'Onofrio as the serial killer, Carl Stargher. Also worthy of note were; Vince Vaughn in a rare dramatic role as Peter Novak, Jake Weber as Gordon Ramsey, Dylan Baker as Henry West, Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Dr. Miriam Kent and a special mention for Jake Thomas as the young Carl Stargher.I have rarely seen a film that has the scope of this one; it really tests the little grey cells to the maximum. Some scenes are truly off the wall but at the same time totally beautifully conceived and enthralling. It's a shame that the real-world story couldn't quite match the 'dream' world created by the director and his team. Even so, hats off to them for creating some truly stunning (and entirely bonkers) work! I'll admit some of the performances could have been better, but all the same that didn't mar my enjoyment.

		<shortDescription>Together in dreams...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this sci-fi thriller a child psychiatrist is experimenting with a new technology that allows for one person to enter another's mind. Meanwhile, the FBI catches a serial killer who has fallen into a coma. The psychiatrist is tasked with entering his mind in order to find the whereabouts of a girl he has captured and left in a deadly torture cell.This is essentially a serial killer film with a very original angle. The science fiction element is really there purely as a means to allow us to enter the subconscious dream world of the killer. It's here where the movie departs from other films of the same genre. It's also here where The Cell truly marks itself out as a memorable movie. The story isn't all that strong but the look and feel of the dream-world is where this one scores. Visually, it's extremely good, with an especially well-used widescreen frame, and beautiful use of colour. The subconscious worlds are by turns surreal, beautiful and creepy. It is without a doubt the fantastic cinematography, set-design, costumes and lighting that are the strengths of this film.As a means of trying to discover the whereabouts of the trapped girl, the psychiatrist tries to make a connection with the killer. In doing so she realises that he has a good and bad side. The good being his younger self before he became twisted as a result of abuse. It's an unusual angle to attempt to empathise with a serial murderer. Usually audiences are never asked to and I suppose it's an interesting difference. However, it's not an idea that 100% works though as no matter the childhood traumas it's quite difficult sympathising with a man who abducts, tortures and kills young women. This aside though, The Cell remains a highly stylish thriller, whose visual brilliance alone is enough reason for it to be considered a triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably not awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is a weird, quickly-forgotten movie from the post-Matrix wave of trippy science fiction starring Jennifer Loepz and (a remarkably skinny) Vince Vaughn of all people. In essence, it's CSI by way of Paprika, with Lopez's character entering the dreamscape of a criminal to try and find his latest victim.It's in these dream sequences that the film really signs. An assortment of horrific images, adapted surrealist art, and jumbled-up psychoanalysis produces a number of segments that are genuinely creepy and creative. It raises the same questions about dream and reality as any number of other films, but what makes The Cell remarkable is the lack of clear answers it gives. In the end we never have a single explanation for why our killer does what he does -- we get some hints at a biological deformity, an abusive childhood, and a strange religious belief system, but none of them are established as a clear answer. The meaning of the dream sequences are similar -- they're cinema that begs for explication, and I always love that.The dream sequences alone make the film worth watching, which is good because other than that there isn't much there. The plot outside of the science-fictional element is a serviceable but generic cop thriller that spends way too much time getting to the point. Vaughn and Lopez are also woefully miscast, which is too bad as their characters really needed good actors to flesh out the hazy writing. There are plenty of cheesy moments and flaws, but I find myself liking the movie despite myself. Maybe I wouldn't hate all of these contemporary blockbusters if they shoehorned in a surrealist sequence or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how to "cell" an idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sort of expanding on "The Silence of the Lambs", "The Cell" portrays a woman (Jennifer Lopez) entering a comatose killer's (Vincent D'Onofrio) mind so that he can help her find his latest victim. I guess that this movie is really all about the visuals as she drifts through his subconscious. If the movie has any problem, it's the casting of Jennifer Lopez. She actually does a good job here, but given that she's only starred in idiotic movies since, it's almost hard to take her seriously (and at times, it seems like they're just trying to show off her underwear). Fortunately, D'Onofrio makes a really creepy killer, and Vince Vaughn is also passable as Lopez's cohort.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie above all others. It's more of a way to pass time. Still, it is a pretty original idea with some impressive scenes. Also starring Marianne Jean-Baptiste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why this movie fails the way it does..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, uninteresting stuff first: serial dement killer kidnaps and murders young women, goes comatose after being arrested by FBI and his last victim is trapped somewhere where she's doomed to die within hours. Scientist finds way to enter his mind through a device in order to find the victim.First of all I really enjoyed this movie, but I understand that it is not a good movie. This happens many times, but most of us must place the movies we LIKE in the category of the movies that we thing are GOOD. There are of course movies that fit both categories and I understand that there are good movies that I don't like.ACTINGWe'll never agree when it comes to acting, (I've heard some people say that Brando sucked as Vito Corleone in The Godfather, whatever dudes). Anyways, my point is that no matter how many people believe that one particular performance was good, you will always find someone who thinks it was bad, and the other around.Lopez: I think that given the ridiculous material about the plot of the movie, Lopez managed to do a fair job, and I support this by saying that at times I forgot that Lopez was a singer and I could truly see her as a scientist, but only at times. She does look good in this sinister movie, which kinda helps swallow some of the images!Vaughn: He doesn't have as much screen time as Lopez, so his performance is not that important, he plays the FBI agent in an elegant way, certainly not giving his best performance. He doesn't add anything to the movie, but it is nice to have him around.D'Onofrio: I don't like his characters, he might be a good actor, but his characters are so creepy that I don't sympathize with him (in particular in this movie and in Full Metal Jacket). Here, he's creepy and scary as he should be.CINEMATOGRAPHYIn order to write about the dreams of sick killer, you have to be kinda sick. This cinematography is fully computer generated, and it is sinister, dark, cruel and bizarre. Sometimes it becomes so obscene that you feel like grinning at the stupidity of what is happening. However if you have watched the whole movie it's because there is a bit of voyeurism, there is a macabre feeling that makes you want to know how a sick mind works. The images are eye candy, they're rich in colors, the angles and shots are horrible (from a music video director!), but then minus by minus is plus, so it works!SCRIPTNothing special at all, sometimes actors spit their lines without too much enthusiam, it really is not worth any attention.OVERVIEWI liked it because I like to be shocked. But it fails (or does a poor job) in several aspects, that's why it's not a good movie. The main theme is taken from "The Silence of the Lambs", but the idea is interesting, even if copied. If it had done in a more perfectionist way, it could have been a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is not half as good as it thinks it is. Though the basic premise of the movie is quite good, I just couldn't relate to any of the characters. They are all bland and cold, we don't know a thing about them, and frankly we don't care (at least I didn't). Also the visuals aren't really that good. The trip when Vaugn goes to save Lopez was a complete rip off from the one in '2001' and most of the other set-pieces were just boring. They always reminded me of the video for 'Firestarter' by The Prodigy, and I really hate that song. The Cell will probably get a cult following, but it will never be a match for 'Silence of the Lambs' or 'Se7en'Most Memorable Movie Moment: J-LO showing us why it's a bad idea to get nipple piercings.Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mundane film disguised with a lot of CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "The Cell" wasn't a bad movie, it wasn't a good movie, either. Without the CGI visuals and interior design it wouldn't be anything more than another boring Hollywood serial killer movie. Most have likened this film to "The Silence of the Lambs" in that the plot involves rescuing a kidnapped girl with so little time. Only here, they catch the kidnapper/killer (played by Vincent D'Onofrio), he goes into a coma from a psychotic disorder, and they must find where he keeps his water-tank torture chamber, where the last victim is locked in. To "ask" him where she is, a psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) undergoes this virtual reality system to observe what is in his mind and she doesn't see much except the killer as a small child and how he eventually became what he is (through abuse, what else?). And then there's the interior design and overbloated CGI graphics. The ending is very predictable, however they could have done some touch ups along the way. Character development. It seemed everyone in the movie was the same character. (They talked slow, had the same vocabulary, etc.) At least in Silence of the Lambs, you had a complex psychological plot and complex characters. Anthony Hopkins is the deranged manipulator who assists a vulnerable federal agent with a dramatic past (Jodie Foster) in a manhunt. I wasn't expecting another SOTL, just a film which had an interesting, complex, psychological, character-driven plot."The Cell" was certainly the opposite. I can't say it's worth seeing, unless you don't mind paying $3.50 for Computer Generated Imagery and nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very simple story, mind-bending effects are the reason to see this film, well-done indeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAUTION - REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS --I'm still not certain where the title of "The Cell" comes from. I initially thought it might refer to the human cell, but now I think it refers to the places the serial killer put his victims where they were automatically held then drowned after 40 hours. The story is very simple - a serial killer is caught and they must find his latest victim before she dies. The catch is, he is in a coma.Jennifer Lopez does a fine job as a psychologist who has been involved in experiments which allows her mind to enter a patient's mind through a technique that looks like a virtual reality game, the participants hanging by wires from the ceiling. She volunteers to go into the comatose mind of the killer. What a journey! This redefines "wierd" in film. I especially liked the horse that gets "sectioned" by the glass plates, and you can see inside the horse via the various slices. She gets trapped, and FBI agent played by Vince Vaughn, must also go in, and there he finds a clue to where the victim may be. As he goes back to reality to find the captured girl, and saves her at the last moment, of course, Lopez tries a different approach.She "reverses" the mental process so that the serial killer is brought into her mental world, which looks a lot nicer than his, bright beautiful colors, cherry blossoms, flowing colorful gowns. She encounters the young version of the killer, who had been abused by his father, had been terrified by his "baptism" which almost drowned him, which presumably explains his m.o. of drowning his victims. The last scenes cut back and forth so we see her holding the dying boy as the comatose liller dies, and the last victim is freed.The DVD colors and sound are first-rate. Some of the low bass "mood" rumbles actually caused the sofa to vibrate, adding to the experience. The scenes inside the killer's mind were truly terrifying, and if you have a strong constitution make this film worth seeing.The DVD extras include deleted scenes, and watching them with the director's commentary explains a lot. Unfortunately, the "making of" featurette is mostly the actors, director, and producers congratulating themselves on pushing the boundaries of wierdness. The first couple of comments were interesting, but after too much of this I skipped over the rest. However, the sections where they take you inside the film-making to show how they developed various scenes is very interesting.I rate it "7" of 10 overall, very simple story, but mind-bending special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the basic plot of the cell may sound familiar. "Race against time to find a killer's victim", the way in which the film is put together if just plain astonishing. The director does not go for well know camera angles and styles here. This world is his and his alone. The cinematography, costume design, and makeup are all brilliant. This is the best looking film since Dark City. Vince Vaugn and Jennifer Lopez are good, but Vincent D'onofrio is excellent. While he doesn't have that much screen time, he gives us one of the most memorable and creepy villains ever to hit the screen. I recommend this to anyone with a strong stomach and a true love for originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Very Impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although The Cell was moderately engaging in its visual effects, there was a good deal missing in the development of the characters and the progression of the story. Although Catherine was supposed to have had outstanding empathetic abilities, there is little support of it in the character presentation. Her character lacked dimension and color. Also, Novak's supposed turmoil seemed artificial and unconvincing. Clues are given as to some of Catherine and Novak's seemingly tumultuous past experiences but we never really learn much more about these past events. A re-visiting or re-living of these poignant experiences during the empathic journeys might have enhanced the film's plot. Overall, the character portrayals lacked depth.It also seems that, while the story started off at a good pace, toward the middle of the film, the progression sped up with insufficient development and the events became very Hollywood-predictable. I also feel that the psychotic condition was trivialized and over-simplified, again, in a very Hollywood manner. Much more could have been done to include the Freudian concepts of Id, Ego, and Superego in a more impacting and provocative manner. The audience received a very simplistic explanation of Stargher's schizophrenic actions. The origin of homicidal psychosis is rarely that easily identified and explained. I realize that there are limitations to any film but, in this case, a little development would have improved the film immensely.Finally, throughout what could and should have been the most visually enthralling segments of the film, there was simply too much focus on Jennifer Lopez's looks. Far more shocking and terrifying images could have been explored and embodied in the character of Catherine if it weren't for the consistent emphasis on making Catherine appear innocently seductive or downright sexy hot in every single scene. Although it was probably shrewd to capitalize on Jennifer Lopez's sex appeal for the marketing of the film, the consistent emphasis throughout detracted from the film's plot and also made Catherine's character less believable. Overall, I rate the film fair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found watching The Cell to be a passable way to spend two hours, but there was nothing remarkable about the cliched plot, the two-dimensional characters, or the frankly dull special effects.This is a movie one could watch perhaps once, if one is bored and has nothing else to do. Money that could have been used to hire an actual writer was wasted upon special effects that were obviously intended to be awesome and mind-blowing but were tired and passe long before they were even a gleam in the director's eye. It was next to impossible to bond with any of the characters because of the lack of depth and meaningful character interaction.The only thing remarkable about this film is that it takes a potentially interesting, if not new, idea and drags it down to dullness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Mark Protosevich's The Cell despite it's bad reviews and was surprised to find it was a delight from beginning to end. Actually "delight" is probably the wrong word, the movie being about a serial killer and all, but you know what I mean.This was the first time I saw a movie based on the director's music video reputation and I was expecting nothing more than flashy cool visuals. However this film has some depth to it too. It doesn't present a clichéd villain but instead the screenwriter has the courage to say it's not as simple as that. Is it possible to condemn the crime but have sympathy for the killer? Can you get rid of the evil side of someone and nurture the inner child?While that is going on Protosevich sets a traditional clock ticking as the FBI agent tries to save the last victim in time.Jennifer Lopez's character is only sketched but there is enough detail there to know where she is coming from. She hasn't got a reflecting character - someone to talk to about her feelings and where she's coming from - so you have to learn about her mostly by her lifestyle.The Cell is not exactly feel good entertainment but it is still an exceptional piece of movie-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning visuals AND a plot...a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is one of the best movies of 2000. It is creative, suspenseful, and stunning. It is about a child psychologist, played surprisingly well by Jennifer Lopez, who enters the mind of a serial killer. He keeps his victims in a tank that slowly fills with water until the woman drowns. He has been caught, but not before he could capture one last victim and place her in the tank. Lopez must find where this tank is and save the girl. The mind sequences are fascinating, your eyes are glued to the screen while you sit in awe. Yes, the movie is violent, but it's nothing you haven't seen before, the movie gets its reputation from the disturbing images. Some of the images may be something you'd rather not look at, you won't look away, you may want to, but you don't. It's an intense movie that keeps you interested, and doesn't rely on the visuals, those come as sweet extras. The story that goes along with the visuals seems like a totally separate movie from the mind sequences, you want to watch both. Unlike the recent stinker "Hollow Man", you get a movie you are affected by, and know you aren't just really looking at a computer screen. Put this on your "Must See" list, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a music video without the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1991, Jonathan Demme took us into the mind of a serial killer with `The Silence of the Lambs.' In 1995, David Fincher showed the world that made a serial killer do what he does with `Se7en.' In 1998, Gus Van Sant remade `Psycho' giving him the evil eye from audiences everywhere. In the new thriller `The Cell' first-time director Tarsem Singh literally takes us on a tour of the surreal world that is a serial killer's psyche. Jennifer Lopez stars as Dr. Catherine Dean, a psychotherapist who has a difficult task set before her by the FBI. Using her state-of-the-art system that allows her to literally enter someone else's mind, she must travel through the mind of a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is in a coma and discover the location of his latest kidnapped victim. As time grows shorter and shorter for the kidnapped girl, Dr. Dean begins to not only search for her, she tries to save the life of the serial killer himself who is also trapped with the demons of his own mind.Much like a music video without the music (Which is what `The Cell' ultimately becomes) this film is all visual and little substance. The twisted visuals that Singh creates of the world in the murderer's head are absolutely breathtaking. However, these visuals are so much the foreground of the film that when Dr. Dean is not inside the killer's mind, the story lags so much that we cannot wait for her to go back in. And, as much as these visuals spark the imagination, they never actually hit that peak of apprehension that I feel Singh intended, that sense of angst that you felt every time Clarice Starling was in Dr. Hannibal Lecter's presence in `The Silence of the Lambs.' It is almost as if Singh is toying with the audience, giving us a fleeting indication of how horrifying this world that Dr. Dean has put herself into can really be and then quickly pulling us away from it. I am sure it looked good on paper, but the transfer to screen leaves nothing much to be desired and almost everything to the imagination. Singh also backs off when it comes to a subplot involving a small boy in a coma that Dr. Dean is trying to reach. This boy talks of a `boogie man' that Singh hints at as being the same demon that plagues the mind of the serial killer, that this same evil spirit lurks somewhere inside everyone's 90% of the brain they do not use, yet nothing concrete ever comes of it. We are only left to speculate at how disturbingly mind-blowing this film's meaning could have been.For what it is worth, the images seen in `The Cell' are some of the finest uses of camera work and set design in recent years. However, once you have seen the first set of these visuals, the mystery behind them has already worn off, and one must look at the story. Where films such as `The Matrix' and `Dark City' pick up their storyline after the incredible visuals have been established, `The Cell' slacks off making the capability of the film found only in what we see. Though that is a very important aspect of a motion picture, it is something that can easily be found watching it on video with the mute button firmly pressed. This is something that I am sure I will do if I decide to watch `The Cell' again.Grade: C &gt;</fullReview>

The effects would have been good years ago, but in an age of "The Matrix" and "Phantom Menace," this was about the quality of a low budget video. Tarsem Singh got his start in music videos, and it shows. The plot was typical "serial killer" fair. Honestly, with the exception of one scene (the cow), the previews show the best effects. The acting was good, especially Lopez, Vaughn, and D'Onofrio. I also liked the few un-Hollywood twists (I'm not going to spoil it, however). I would say wait for video, then rent it.

		<fullReview>The Cell is pretty dammed bizarre to be sure, but it is one of the most challenging films I've seen in quite a while. The detective scenes are as smartly done as those in Se7en, and the dream scape inside the killers' mind scenes are as strange and beautiful as a well-directed NIN or Marilyn Manson video. After watching it for the second time (it's that type of movie), I was struck by how seriously it took its subject matter. There really aren't any light moments in it, but I wasn't bothered by its tone, and I wouldn't call it pretentious, I was simply fascinated by its energy and endless imagination. I hope that the unusual visuals and slightly bent storyline doesn't scare audiences away. It's a wonderful film and it deserves to be seen, just try not spend the whole movie trying to decipher its images. The bare bones of the plot is easy to follow, but you can go mad while trying to figure out the significance of certain scenes. Save that for the second viewing.Jennifer Lopez is a star, and she really shines in this one. She's naturally so stunningly beautiful that when you see her in her idealized self inside the mind, it is quite a sight. She's a hottie, I just wish she'd give up the singing and get back to making movies on a regular basis. It's good to see Vince Vaughn in a good movie again (Psycho still leaving a bad taste in my mouth). This guy has a lot of potential, he just needs to be in the right projects. Vincent D'Onofrio is an interesting actor, and he seems to make a habit of playing very strange and unusual characters. The guy he plays in this one is creepy even by serial killer standards. He's the kind of killer that gives Dahmer and Manson the creeps. I've seen serial killers portrayed better in other films, but Vincent does well. We're so used to seeing Hannibal Lector, insane genius types in films that his turn as a more simple beast is a little different. He's very methodical, but you don't get any real sense of genius in him, which probably makes him more realistic, just not as fun to watch as Spacey in Se7en or Tom Noonan in Manhunter. The big surprise is Tarsem Singh, former commercial and music video director's (I really need to find out which ones) big screen debut. The world of music videos is turning out some of the most interesting directors in film today (David Fincher immediately comes to mind). He's going to have a hard time finding a project after this that lets him be so free to create whole new worlds of unreality to play in, but I eagerly await his next offering. This movie deserves a 10/10 stars just for being so fresh. I wish more movies showed this kind of imagination. G'night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is for those who like to think. It's futuristic so the concept is all you can consider. Imagine being able to get into someone's mind, see what they see, hear what they hear, and feel what they feel. While this concept could open up a world of knowledge as well as mental healing, it's very dangerous.If you can forget about Jennifer Lopez and her terrific body, this movie has something to say and something to think about. The special effects and costumes are also great. A must see movie if you can sit through and absorb actions of the mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted and grotesque, The Cell proves to be most entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While no Silence of the Lambs or even Manhunter; this is the best serial killer film since those two recent classics. With the gimmick of actually exploring the killer's mind, it actually adds new depths to the serial killer genre instead of rehashing it like more recent entries into the genre have done (e.g. The Bone Collector, Kiss the Girls, etc.). Jennifer Lopez shows once again that she should stick to acting instead of furthering a singing career, and Vincent D'onofrio gives his best performance since Full Metal Jacket. Vince Vaughn could have tried to display some emotion; dark and brooding he is not, but overall, this one is near perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Star Wars Trap"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have film-makers forgotten that the most important element of a film is the story? I think we've entered a scary age of entertainment. An age where 15 sec. scenes are the norm. It's like a box of candy, each scene being an individual piece, we start eating the next piece of candy before we're done with the last. That's how I felt watching this film. Of course the director did music videos before this, it's obvious because I would blink and it would be another scene.But it's not just the lack of commitment to a scene, it's also to bland characters(I don't deny that they were colorful, and nicely costumed) but boring, superficial, card board cut outs. The audience didn't care who died, why, or anything.Finally, the "The Star Wars Trap" now that we can do "anything" with film, that seems to be the who objective of film-makers. "What can we do with this cool CGI workstation?" So, you get movies like Star Wars Episode I where there were just special effects for the sake of special effects. Instead of using special effects(and in fact creating new ones) to perpetuate a story (i.e. The Matrix). "The Cell" tries to use this visual eye candy as a substitute for story, plot, character, intrigue, and interest, and fails miserably on all counts.I'd give it 1 star for the only one real star in it; "Vincent D'Onofrio"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surrealistic Film That Cannot Be Ignored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cell": A gory tale about a deranged serial killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) who suffers from the harsh memories of his childhood. His schizophrenic mood swings get worse as life goes on, and sadly, he turns to a life of crime. When he kidnapps Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff), he hides her where no one can find her, leaving the FBI in a chaos. Soon, FBI agent, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn), and the FBI turn to psychotherapist Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who (with brand new and interesting technology) goes into Carl's twisted mind to see where he is hiding Julia. There, she sees a much softer side to Carl, but not to mention - his vulgar, dark imagination.For me personally, "The Cell" was a blessing, because this year, I've seen A LOT of really sh*tty movies ("Scary Movie" has been branded the number one worse movie I ever seen). Even when I saw the commercials, I KNEW that I would enjoy this movie. I didn't expect a few parts yet that's what movies offer unless the plot is pointless or one of those films that you say, "Seen it before...*yawn*!"Watching this film was like looking at a painting of pure surrealism. The images of Carl's "dolls" were battered with bruises, cuts, blood, needles, and pins that symbolize torture, anger, and pain. When Catharine is in Carl's mind, you notice the heartache he's suffered from when he was a little boy. He sees himself as a ruler of a monarch of fear and pain. Some of the images reminded me of the Nine Inch Nails video, "Closer", and a painting by Salvadore Dali called "I Dream of an Evening Dress" (or something like that!).I couldn't take my eyes off of any of the scenes, because I was captured by the shear brilliance of this film. It was NOTHING like I've seen in a film ever before! Perhaps it's the best film in the new millenium! :)Just a minor warning: Some of the bloody parts in this movie maybe too hot to handle for some viewers!!! On the other hand, if you do have high tolerence for scenes such as that - ENJOY!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard Ebert's quote "The Matrix and Silence of the Lambs rolled into one". The Matrix happens to be one of my favorite movies. Silence of the Lambs, as well as it's prequel and sequel, is currently up there on my top reading list. I sat down with my popcorn and soda, and immediately, this movie became an all-time favorite. The plot sucked me in, and, for the first time in a long time, I left the theater somewhat shaken. Lopez is amazing in her role, although wouldn't smoking marijuana affect her judgement as a psychiatrist?All of the other actors played their role perfectly. The special effects were amazing, as were the costumes, cinematics, script, and near everything else for this film.I have a $10 bet with a friend (who, as of right now, hasn't seen the movie) saying that The Cell will be nominated for at least one of the 5 big Oscars (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Picture, or Screenplay). I have a feeling it won't disappoint me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Wild Movie, One Creative Movie, One Scary Movie... One Of The Best Movies Of The Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't take the saying "Best Movie Of The Year" lightly, at all. Therefore I know I rate each movie fairly, and YOU as a viewer of all these comments can trust my opinion as to being more true than most others that defer. Anyway, setting aside all the stupidity from uncreative people commenting about this movie you will read on here, This is one of the best movies of the year, period. It acts with a nightmarish theme, which causes most of the people to miss the whole point that it is not just the typical scary movies that have been coming out recently, rather the reality parts in the film and the dream sequences each being as scary as the other. It goes to show you truth, and how some peoples morbid minds can attract as much hell as an nightmare could induce. This film is much better than "Silence Of The Lambs", where as it goes beyond just plain killings and actually into the killers mind, like a sort of playland. The story was written with such creativity, kind of like what harsh message a poet would want to put across the screen, and the film is shot with such wild camera angles that it reminds you of Hitchcock. Oh, yeah and the acting is good too (incase you were wondering, Lopez is exCELLent as well). It is good to see movies with a more broader theme making their way into our generation, it goes to show you we may be allowed to view things a little bit deeper and a little bit further if we allow ourselves, wither it be nice or grim. It's just sad some people have to ruin it, by automatically knowing they aren't going to like such a movie before they go see it and then come babble on here about how they basically... just couldn't take such an eye-filling, wild, imaginative... hmmmm Masterpiece, should sum it up real nicely! By all means Don't Miss This One!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a magnificent, amazing, startling movie. It could change your life. It's that heavy, and that true and that powerful. So if you dare to go, be prepared to not come home the same person-- and I mean that in the best possible sense. It is grand, great, spectacular! You'll have read all the plot points elsewhere by now-- so let me just add my view on the overall theme. It is definitely NOT for the weak hearted or timid. As a trained psychotherapist, I can say that the basic premise and setup of the psychodelia was very accurate, and entirely plausible. Really. I cannot say enough about this movie, except to add: Of all the movies I have EVER seen in my life, this was the only time I ever had the feeling that the director's vision was fully actualized on the screen. And that is saying a lot. Think about it.Also-- whoever wrote this thing obviously has spent a lot of time in consciousness expanding activities, and "healing spaces." The story line and script were so subtle, so nuanced and so deep-- it was like filigree of Being.Wonderful! The entire cast was great-- very believable. Jennifer Lopez not only is hot, but she carries the angelic persona well. James Gammon has a smallish role-- he is a marvelous character actor that we just don't get to see in enough movies. Every single aspect of this movie was top notch. Notice how I didn't mention the special effects until now? That's because they were so absolutely amazingly done that they didn't appear as "effects" at all-- they simply blew your mind without fanfare. Each scene perfectly unfolded from the previous scene, and each image was more dazzling than the last. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time-- I couldn't believe my eyes, and yet every single instant of this movie rang true.I gave this a 10 out of 10, and would have made it an eleven if I could have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did we really expect anything deep out of this? If you have high expectations for this film, two words for ya- Jennifer Lopez. I knew this well in advance and went to see this with one hope: eye candy. All in all, I got what I asked for. Does the movie make you squirm in your seat? Hopefully, or perhaps we should be worried about you. But it is not anything worth raving about. I recently heard a description of this movie as being a blend of "The Matrix" and "Silence of the Lambs". A fair statement, but I would suggest that this be expanded a bit. 1. Expect good special effects. Maybe not quite "The Matrix" quality, but worthwhile nonetheless (notice "good" and not "great"). 2. Expect Silence of the Lambs in a twisted concept-but just remember the actors who you are dealing with. Anthony Hopkins versus...who? Jennifer Lopez versus Jody Foster...Think of it this way: what do you get when you take "The Matrix" and get rid of Keannu? Answer: A great movie.</fullReview>

"The Cell" is one of those movies like "Se7en","Fight Club"and "Hellbound: Hellraiser 2",people are either going to love this movie or hate it with a passion. If you can suspend disbelief and enjoy a movie for what it is..a M-O-V-I-E.then you will like this flick.

		<fullReview>When this movie ended, my friend immediately turned to me and, not without a tinge of sarcasm, asked, "So, was that all meaningful symbolism or just empty images?" Does it really matter? Artists mustn't necessarily abide by a universally understood and unspoken contract promising that all of their works have deep semantic reasoning behind them, despite popular belief. The truth is this is a classic film, even if only for how good it looks. As for the plot, I found it compelling enough; I'm no crime/thriller connoisseur, but I had the same general reaction to this story as I had to "The Silence of the Lambs'." In the summer of "Hollow Man," it's miraculous to see an art film produced by a large studio (similar precedents include "Dark City" and "Being John Malkovich"); sometimes they slip through the cracks, and you just have to have to be able to discern them from the rest of the hollywood hogwash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell is the movie I have been waiting for, for a long time. The reviews from antitcool.com were bad but after seeing it for myself I have to say it's without a doubt in my mind the greatest looking movie I've ever seen. The plot is also top notch (Tarsem Singh &amp; Mark Protosevich are two people i'll keep my eye on) from opening seen to closing credits i was absorbed by this movie. The acting was kinda...not really bad...but kinda off at the beginning but EVERYONE found their groove as the movie progressed. This movie should be seen by EVERY horror fan out there. The Cell is also not style over substance like I feared it would be, the characters' motivations are believable and the characters themselves are truely more than one dimensional cardboard pawns just to get us from one stunning scene to the next. The costumes, sets, makeup, and visual effects are all Oscar worthy but the writer and director are way to smart to just let the movie be all flash and no substance. The movie also has some truely harrowing scenes of when Stargher was abused by his father but those scenes needed to be harrowing to further explain and flesh out the character. All together this is the best movie i've seen since Fight Club and by far The Cell is in my opinion the best serial killer movie ever (yep to me it's a million times better than Silance of the Lambs...but then again so is Se7en). Great direction, writing, production design, costumes, makeup (including the effects makeup like a great intestines pulling scene), and a great Howard Shore score. THIS MOVIE IS TRUELY A CLASSIC IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate going to a movie that I have really hyped up in mymind for a few weeks. I have a tendency to expect too much, especially in the case of this first time film forTarsem Singh. He had directed losing my religion, so Iknew he had an eye for the visually stunning, but I wantedthe story to be quality as well, which it most certainly was.Underneath the fantastic sensory experience that is thisfilm were some very real and raw expressions of developed character and plot. So seldom does a story jump out at us and present itself in full light in a film likethis. Usually it hides itself, darting in and out of specialeffects when a new device is necessary. Here, a masterfuldirector and a superb screenwriter have managed to expose many facets of a complex idea and complex characters. This film walks a thin line between angel feathers dripping from heaven and the dark slithery thingsthat hide in the somewhere else, always aware of it's ownpurpose. The Cell is never cheap or contrived, and it presents the director's cultural heritage without dumbing itdown for a western audience. The imagery is intense because of its honesty. I was most definately not dissapointed by any portion of this picture. Such FilmsEndure. C.A. Childers (8/18/00)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn, and Vincent D'Onofrio 107 minutes long. Rated R for bizarre violence and sexual images, nudity and language.Catherine Deane(Jennifer Lopez), is a child therapist who with the help of a very special machine, can enter the minds of comatose children. This device comes especially handy when Carl Stargher(Vincent D'onofrio), a dangerous and very disturbed serial killer slips into a coma. Think it's over, it's not. It turns out that Stargher has kidnapped a young woman and has placed her The Cell, a torture device that he uses to drown his victims in. He then takes his victims to his house, dips their bodies in bleach and then masturbates (yes he does do it and it is disgusting) over the bodies with hooks inserted directly into his back and ditches the bodies so the FBI can find them. Now the FBI have asked Catherine if she can go into his mind and try to find out where the missing girl is. When she does go inside, she sees Carl as a young boy, sweet and innocent. She also sees the darkside of Carl's mind, in which he has become what Catherine calls, "An idealized version of himself." Now let me say that this movie is very beautiful, dark, and very twisted. Now it has also come to my attention that a lot of movies released during the summer of 2000 have received a wide range of reviews that range from incredibly good to incredibly bad. Examples are Mission: Impossible 2, Hollow Man, and this film. A lot of people have dissed this film for as far as I can see, no reason. This movie is good and it should be a classic.*****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are times during this movie, that I almost cry. Not because of some lame love story. Not because I dislike JLo so much (although I really do). I almost cry because this film is so beautiful. That's right.. so beautiful.Fincher, Jonze and Tarsem Singh all come from music videos. Fincher and Jonze might make the better movies as far as the storylines go, but The Cell is an undeniable proof that Singh has the best visual sense (and by this I'm in no way trashing Fincher's film's visuals). This film is a perfect collaboration between the director and everyone working beneath him. I mean the production design, the photography and especially the score (screw LOTR, this is clearly Howard Shore's best and most beautiful work to date).Sure the story is old and has been done to death, but what makes The Cell special is that it manages to be original anyway. The headtrips are UNBELIEVABLE. And even in the scenes that take place "in the real world", the film doesn't implode. The acting and the photography are too good for that.The Cell is a masterpiece, because there's just nothing as special around. Visually.***** / *****</fullReview>

Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in. The acting is actually pretty decent.

It was good enough to hold my attention and get me to wince a little, but that was only due to the special effects. The story was O.K., it reminded me a lot of Dreamscape. Catherine Dean (Jennifer Lopez) is the main character. She plays a psychiatrist that is able to enter the mind of her patients via some secret drug and electronics. Things start getting hectic when she enters the mind of a psychotic killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'onofrio) in order to find out where he has hidden his latest victim.There were plenty of interesting scenes from a cinematic perspective, but the dialogue and story itself did little to make this movie very good. The idea of going into another realm to accomplish something in reality is nothing new even if it is going into someone's mind. When you strip back all of the visual stimuli, you are left with sophomoric psychology and a weaker version of Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Visuals But Very Sordid, Unpleasant Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some of the wildest visuals I'd seen up to the time of my first viewing of this in April of 2001. The visuals were easily the highlight of the film. It isn't the story because that's too much on the sordid side. Sometimes, it's just plain too uncomfortable.It's another demented serial killer story, this one as sick an individual as I've seen, although, thankfully, there are not a lot of scenes with him. The switch is that he is captured early on but is in a catatonic-like state and unable to talk. His latest victim must be found quickly or she will die as the others did. The only way to find where this woman is stashed is by going inside his brain and try to solve the puzzle. That's Jennifer Lopez's role here as "Catherine Deane." When she enters, the visuals are perhaps like someone on LSD, and they are very interesting, along with good sound effects. It's a bizarre story that keeps your attention, although gruesome at times. I haven't seen this film since 2002 and since then became a fan of Vincent D'Onofrio's detective character in Law and Order: Criminal Intent. I'm not sure I want to go back and see him as this sick killer now that I am used to seeing him as a "good guy." However, I am curious about that.The bad points of the film, to me, were (1) a definite anti-Christian cheap shot in which it is shown that the killer was first "tortured" when he was baptized through immersion and held too long under water by his sadistic father. In addition to the obvious bias, it also shows you how theologically ignorant Hollywood is, thinking the parent does the baptizing. Wrong. Anway, in conjunction with that, the killer is shown ore as a young boy than any other period and then is seen to be a sympathetic figure! Only with Liberals, is there sympathy for the sadistic killer more than his victims!! At least there is one cop in here who states that a horrible childhood doesn't have to turn someone into a sick killer.So th question for me wound up being: are the visuals worth putting up with the unpleasant story. The answer wound up being "no."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful film. I had to make a review about this to address an argument a lot of people are making: that it lacks substance and it's all about the atmosphere. Words are not the only way in which you can learn about a character. This film is deep. It requires you to sit back and think about it for quite a long time. The answers are there; it was just made by artists who have different methods at storytelling. So yes, it is a visual experience over an oral one. "The Cell" seems like a bunch of artists worked together with psychoanalysts. They try to illustrate madness and emotions. What's more, they try to explain the madness. Be prepared for mass symbolism.This is a new favorite film. I gave it 10 points not just for creativity, but also because I knew it must have taken a lot of work to play the mental aspect into the film, as well. Definitely underrated.Similar films? I kept thinking of "What Dreams May Come". It also reminded me of the books, "When Rabbit Howls" and "The Yellow Wallpaper."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film on DVD on my laptop - how I wish I saw it on the big screen! - and it just blew me away. There was not a single second when I turned my eyes away from the screen. Right from the opening scene, with Jennifer Lopez - looking quite a vision in white! - riding a black horse in a desert, with a very catchy, Indian/Middle-Eastern music playing in the background, to the beginning of the end credits (with the same haunting Indian/Middle- Eastern music playing), this film is quite something!I wonder how did they ever think of such a plot? I mean, OK, they thought of going inside someone else's mind--but to actually show it with such visuals, that's what needs all the appreciation. The entire film is a vision, like a dream, like an exquisite artwork. And the best thing is that the director doesn't waste any time in establishing the plot and his surreal - and a bit disturbing - visions. It's like snap snap snap!--and a scene is done, and I was like: What did I just see now? The locations, the sets, the costumes, the looks of the three main characters when they enter their subconscious zones--the visuals will attract you like a magnet. Take my word for this.Beautiful, beautiful movie! This was released in 2000. Today, in 2016, this might have been made - I am sure - in 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot and overall character developments (and twists) are few and little. I would classify this as a visually stunning, slow paced horror, which tries to be somewhat psychological. In that aspect, I think it's very successful! Even more so then "Red Dragon" which I found dull and boring, but that's just my opinion.I would classify this movie as eye-candy and a must for anyone aspiring to direct, script or do overall screenplay. Entertaining for the trained eye, but not really something you would want to watch with your kids(or your average girl). Expect slow paced shivers, maybe a few goosebumps moments, but a background story that is not all that interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell (2000) is definitely a very well made and smart movie. The costume design and the visuals are both so stunning and they are so meticulously done so that the audience really gets the full effect of the atmosphere. Jennifer Lopez really outdid herself here, her role in many movies is mostly comedic and light, but her role went through some really disturbing traumatic stuff in The Cell, and she pulled it off wonderfully. Vince Vaughn was pretty good in his part, he certainly looked the part. The rest of the cast did well too, no one actor really gave a bad performance in the film. The dialogue was well written in my opinion. The plot was well constructed and developed I might add. The execution of the material was strong throughout the film. This movies atmosphere is really awesome! It's incredibly suiting for the movie. And that Academy Award nomination for Best Makeup was oh so well deserved, the makeup was amazing here, especially oh JLo's part. 8/10 overall, entertaining well made film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a weird movie. The best thing you can say about it is that it's fairly original, especially the scenes taking place inside dream landscapes. Such moments in film are hard to capture but I found them well realised here, and pretty believable. The structure of the film is rather predictable, and there's a gritty vibe running through it the same as in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Detectives, including a surprisingly decent Vince Vaughn, are on the trail of a supremely sick serial killer, played to the hilt by a highly disturbing Vincent D'Onofrio. This guy has a fetish for kidnapping and trapping women in glass tanks that slowly fill with water, drowning them.Eventually, the guy is caught, only to go into a coma. Thanks to a sci-fi element, scientists are able to enter the man's consciousness and now they need to find out where a girl is hidden?and the film runs with that premise. For a start, the imagination here is way out. The serial killer's mind is full of sickening imagery, and there's a central torture sequence that turned my stomach. Strong sauce indeed. Then there's a cast who actually do the material justice ? including Dylan Baker's twitchy scientist, Jake Weber's serious fed and best of all Jennifer Lopez, as the smart, sassy and fearless heroine.The film is suspenseful and twisted, as thrillers should be, and it kept me gripped until the very end. Looking back, I see it as one of the most atypical Hollywood films out there ? and it benefits from this status. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell (2000): Dir: Tarsem Singn / Cast: Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dylan Baker, Jake Weber: Intriguing view of the depths of a disturbed mind symbolizing brain cells with a prison. Jennifer Lopez hooks to cables and put to sleep where she will interlock within the mind of her subject. When a murderer is found unconscious in his home Lopez must interlock with his mind to find an abducted woman. There is a number of disgusting images but it is a triumph in art direction and visual effects. Interesting plot that borrows from The Silence of the Lambs, The Matrix and The Thirteenth Floor yet it still maintains an interesting analysis of who we are within our own thoughts. Inventive directing by Tarsem Singn with Lopez is strong as the heroine who puts herself on the line for the sake of this mindless project of the brain. Vince Vaughn is the typical cop whose purpose is to be a potential romantic fling to Lopez. Best performance is from Vincent D'Onofrio as the derange villain who treats his victims like dolls. Once his body is found it is up to Lopez to unlock his mind and find answers. Other roles are cardboard and no where near as interesting as the premise deserves. A visual feast to the eyes with a theme regarding self destructing people who are slaves to dire circumstances that plague their past thus imprisoning their future. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the plot of this movie is, for the most part, just another crime drama about a serial killer. d'nofrio is excellent in submerging himself in his role. Vaughn is also great and should be in more dramatic roles. that being said, the best part of this film is that it is an assault on your senses. visually, it takes you on a journey to some of the places that you would rather not be without a return ticket. it is some of the best imagery ever set to such a disturbing topic, whether it be the transformation of the victims from human to doll to the self image of the killer himself. for those of you who may have a background in behavioral science/psychology such as myself, there are places in the film that you know are very possibly held within the deepest, darkest parts of the human heart and soul. in any case, watch the film for what it is and take a trip into a wonderfully terrifying world that is filled with suspense and mind blowing scenes. btw, lopez isn't too bad in it and I am not really a fan of hers in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylistically inventive at the expense of a substantive story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarsem Singh has basically made his career on films that emphasize style over substance. Prior to this, I only saw a couple of his more recent efforts: MIRROR MIRROR, which I liked well enough, and IMMORTALS, which felt like Zack Snyder-lite and was a bit boring. I wasn't really expecting anything deep when I got this, and my expectations were met. Is it great? No, not really, but the potent cocktail of Tarsem's visual style combined with some (pop) psychological drama was enough to keep my interest throughout. The premise is that there is this technology which allows someone to enter the mind of another person. Jennifer Lopez plays a social worker who enters the mind of comatose patients to see if she can bring them back to consciousness. Vince Vaughn plays an FBI agent/profiler who is after a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) who likes to do some pretty twisted things to his victims. Fortunately, he's captured, but in a comatose state, therefore he has to team up with Jennifer Lopez to enter the killer's mind and try to find the location of the latest woman before she dies. The film actually takes its time getting started, establishing (however lightly), the principal characters. However, once the plot is set in motion it rarely stops. Anyone looking for extensive character development and logical plot might as well give up because you won't find it here. What you will find is an intriguing debut film from a distinctive visual stylist. If I had to describe the fantasy sequences, it would be like Jodorowsky and Del Toro mixed together in the style of a Marilyn Manson or Nine Inch Nails music video. Put simply, those particular sequences were very dreamlike and surreal, with echo-chamber dialogue, jerky cuts/editing, and semi-heavy color saturation. By far, this was the most interesting part of the film. However, the performances weren't bad by any means. Jennifer Lopez acquits herself nicely, and Vince Vaughn shows some range. Vincent D'Onofrio as the villain doesn't get as much dialogue, but a lot comes through in the physical aspect of his performance. On a side note, his hairdo in this film made him look like Philip Seymour Hoffman in BOOGIE NIGHTS. Of additional interest is the score by Howard Shore. Given that this is a thriller, there is, to some degree, a reliance on bombastic music cues that match the action but are still a little over-the-top. The parts I liked best were the quieter moments that featured native Indian instruments (Tarsem Singh is from India). The weakest aspect of the film is undoubtedly the script, which has an overly simple story, thin characters, logical errors, and clichés. There's also a last-act choice that had little motivation other than that it was referenced early on, so they might as well have followed through with it. For what it's worth I was never bored because Tarsem conjured up plenty of cool imagery to take my mind off of the relatively unimportant plot. And for style over substance, THE CELL isn't half bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Cell" is a Ferociously Original Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is unlike a movie I've ever seen before. It's a mix of bizarre special effects, serial murders and fantasy that is far too uncommon in mainstream cinema. There's also the fact that this is a film with Jennifer Lopez that is actually good. The Cell is a sci-fi thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh with Jennifer Lopez in the lead. A social worker, Catherine Deane, is called to enter the mind of a serial killer who has fallen into a coma in order to find his next victim before she's killed. This guy can make Hannibal Lecter seem like small- time; he traps his female victims inside a cell that will slowly fill with water until it drowns them, then bleaches their skin after their dead so that they can be his own personal dolls. After entering the killer's mind, Catherine finds herself lost in his psyche and must find her way out, or else the killer will find her. The Cell has a lot of haunting imagery since it has to build an entire world inside someone's mind. Tarsem builds this world incredibly well and makes the viewer feel like they're trapped with Catherine in there. The serial killer plot itself is a little thin because a majority of the film takes place within the killer's mind, but the way the story is told is so original that most of the film's faults can be forgiven. If you want your average serial killer thriller told in an incredibly original and memorable way, The Cell will give you that and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly unique, surreal, beautiful nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarsem Singh's The Cell is the kind of revelatory, mind blowing, breathtaking, once in a decade kind of fantasy film that is utterly unique, truly memorable and pure artistic creation. Singh utilizes so many visual elements and ideas that you get the notion that you are truly immersed in a human being's subconscious inner realm, and not merely watching a film. It's transcendent. Jennifer Lopez, in a performance of great empathy and serious emotional depth, plays a child psychologist who uses futuristic technology to literally enter the dreams of comatose patients and attempt to heal them. When a seriously disturbed killer (the monumentally talented Vincent D'Onofrio) enters a coma before the FBI can find his latest victim, she is hired to enter his mind to find out the location. A scary setup indeed. The first plunge into his mind is set up with a dread inducing soundtrack cue, and a sudden, Topsy turvy whirlwind of surreal images, sounds and stimuli which are truly eerie and intangible. The art direction, special effects and design of the spirit realm she ventures into are just something you don't see in many films, because most people are afraid to think about that kind of raw, uninhibited subconscious content. Not Singh. He willingly explores the dark, mysterious side of the human mind and soul, with a complexity and understanding that is all to rare. For folks who find that too much surreal imagery and soul disturbing content makes them uneasy (hell, I'M one of those folks) those aspects are balanced out by the clean cut, very grounded in earth time plot line of Vaughn's team helping him out from 'earthside', a standard cops vs. killer mentality to even out the strangeness. They even have a guy from CSI playing one of the cops. Vince Vaughn feels slightly miscast as the head fed, but James Gammon, Dean Norris, Dylan Baker, Marianne Jean Baptiste, Patrick Bachau and Musetta Vander all give stellar support. If you have a strong stomach (this film gets pretty brutal in ways you can't imagine), and a wandering, artistically abstract mind for all things surreal and dreamy, definitely check this out.</fullReview>

What Makes the Film Special is the Way it's Framed with an Artsy, Beautiful Template that Completely Goes Against the Aforementioned. It is Contrast Taken to a Level of Disassociation.It's a Disturbing and Haunting Film. The Images on Screen Could be the Most Artistic and Gut-Wrenching of Any Modern Horror Movie. The Combination of Police Procedure, Psychological Interface, and Outrageous Criminal Behavior was Something New in the Year 2000. But, it Might Remind One of a Movie Made More than 80 Years Previously. "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" (1917).Jennifer Lopez is Perfect in the Role of a Medical Sensitive and Vince Vaughn Delivers a Thankfully Restrained Detective. Vincent D'Onofrio is Outlandishly Outstanding as the Antagonist.Overall, it is a Strange Film that is Definitely Not for Everyone. But will Most Likely be Embraced by Art Film and Horror Movie Fans. It has Images that are Likely to Linger and Although Some are Stunning in Their Surreal Beauty, Others are a Blood-Bath Not So Easy to Forget, Unsettling and Psychically Intrusive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catherine Deane" (Jennifer Lopez) is a social worker who has chosen to pursue a unique method of therapy in which she is psychically transported into the mind of a patient while they are dreaming. In one particular case she has volunteered to help a young boy by the name of "Edward Baines" (Colton James) who has entered into a coma due to a traumatic experience of some kind and her intention is to get him to talk about it to her in order to help facilitate the healing process. It's at this time that she is apprised of a situation involving a serial killer named "Carl Stargher" (Vincent D'Onofrio) who, prior to slipping into a coma, has kidnapped a woman who will certainly die if the authorities cannot find her in time. Realizing that time is of the essence she agrees to go into his mind fully aware that the risks involved in this procedure are seriously elevated due to the mental state of the subject. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that the film itself had some good things going for it. The overall plot was interesting and the special effects were quite good. On the other hand the acting was slightly uneven at times and some of the scenes towards the end could have used some improvement. But in general this was an entertaining movie for the most part and I rate it as slightly above average.</fullReview>

On rewatch it reminds me of lots of influences, especially in the visuals in the dream scenes. Opening sequence is really striking and left me wondering if the pyramids in Egypt were modelled on the sand dunes. Anyhow, there's plenty of Gilliam in there, some Beckett, and other reviewers have referenced several artists, eg. Hirst for the horse slicing. And the plot has dollops of Silence and se7en.Well worth looking at, but sadly forgettable. It's big production, big stars, so there's no sense that things might not work out. The psychology of the victim is ignored. And the morality is pure Hollywood, where means justifies the end - no thought given to the ethics and legality of killing someone to save another, especially when the kill comes after they've found the badly hidden crucial clue.Plus there's no sex - guys, you're messing with the subconscious. Marian symbols don't cut it.Overall it looks great but only engages through tension.</fullReview>

So there are two worlds in this picture one is a real world we are all living in and the other one is the world of dreams that can be nice and wonderful, but also can be a darkest nightmare. It has some awkward moments that will make all sensitive and sentimental people close their eyes or turn their heads out of the screen. One of the lessons in this film is that if a child has a difficult childhood he can become a maniac in his adulthood. Afterall this film has a happy-end and I felt sympathy for Catherine because she stood her promise and helped Carl to break out from his past and become alright. A fair film that has it's ups and downs but after watching it you'll probably will remember it for long. Though it's not for everyone.</fullReview>

Sadly, it also passes up a chance for one of the greatest visuals of all. It's quite disappointing when there's not even a glimpse of Jennifer Lopez's famous butt. Why hire JLo and then not have her turn around even once? What a waste. Anyway, "The Cell" bombed big-time, both critically and box-office-wise, but it's an exquisitely made film that really delivers in all departments.

		<shortDescription>The Cell Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is all style and no substance, a movie that is visually impressive even by today's standards but with a cast you don't care for, weak dialogue/script including a hollow story that raises many questions about the technology used throughout the film. Additionally, it is a movie that has been done better before, think Silence of the Lambs or the influx of sci fi movies that came out around the same time including (but not limited to); Dark City (1998), The Matrix (1999), The Thirteenth Floor (1999).Although the movie has a relatively short runtime of 1 hour 30minutes it spends too long trying to build suspense and tension. The latest victim of a serial killer, is trapped with only 40 hours to live, unless the FBI find her before she drowns. Building suspense and tension meant it wasn't until half way through the movie where the movie's main 'attraction' or selling point happened with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) entering the mind of Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) who at times appears to channel Norman Bates (quiet, weird, loner type).The films strongest aspect is the wildly vivid imagery and thankfully it still stands up 14 years later. It is clear while watching inside Stargher's mind scenes, that director Tarsem Singh, has taken heavy inspiration from works of art by the likes of; Hirst, Nedrum and Giger. It's as if the director needed an excuse for the plot to show such uniquely disturbing images, that varied in styles including the recurring theme of water, and misogyny which normally in a movie wouldn't blend together. The director came up with the idea of going into the mind of a disturbed schizophrenic, using some kind of newly created experimental technology, which then made it possible to incorporate his eerie dream like sequences. Never once was it explained what this experimental technology was, how it worked, or any detail about the device, the machine was also rather reminiscent of the virtual world used in The Matrix released the previous year and worked in a relatively similar fashion.Other than the vivid imagery, the movies only other saving grace is Vincent D'Onofrio, who excels at what little he has been given to work with. Vincent D'Onofrio is the standout of an otherwise mediocre cast, a cast many people may be scratching their head over. The leads are a singer (Lopez) and a comedian (Vaughn). Having a poor cast is one thing then to go and have no character depth, weak script/writing and clichéd lines these hamper the film even further.The only reason anyone should watch The Cell is for the creative visuals, costumes, set pieces displayed and Vincent D'Onofrio's strong acting, which shows how truly underrated he is as an actor. This has people questioning why he doesn't get much work.Those looking for a good sci fi, horror, thriller should look elsewhere, as this story is forgetful, with no surprises or twists. Its predictable and has a clichéd Hollywood style ending.Further viewing; Silence of the Lambs, Dark City, The Matrix, The Thirteenth Floor.</fullReview>

I was much more enthusiastic about 'The Cell' when it first came out; now it remains a film that I love to watch for its artwork, and I shudder at its horrors, but the lack of depth (in characters and story lines) makes the whole thing rather unsatisfactory.But again: it's really quite something just to look at, so: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cases of serial killers can be sick as it is, but trying to analyze what could be going on in a killer's head can be a frightening and harrowing look into the face of evil itself. The Cell is a film that traps its characters, and the audience, in the mind of such a killer. Half of the film plays out like a pretty standard crime-thriller mystery, on a similar level to Silence of the Lambs. The rest of The Cell, however, is a truly unique odyssey.It can take a while to establish the initial plot points and concepts, but once the plot complications set in, the film dives into some very interesting and nightmarish territory. With the premise of characters literally exploring the subconscious of a killer's mind, the film progresses through a number of unforgettable sequences that are vividly weird, surreal, and extravagant. Some of the scenes are grungy and dark. Others are flowery and artistic. Most are freaky as hell. All of it is something worth seeing and remembering.The actual story is pretty simple, but it manages to cram in as much as it can, thanks largely to the association of imagery and symbols. Characters aren't the high point necessarily, but the main villain shows a lot of psychological depth that makes him stand out the most, for better or for worse.This film uses very stylish and awesome photography and editing, including a lot of unique camera angles and unusual movements. Acting is okay: it can be a bit hard to take Vince Vaughn or Jennifer Lopez seriously, but I think Vincent D'Onofrio was the best of the lot. Writing is generally okay. This production uses some extremely extravagant and imaginative sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Howard Shore's score is noisy and weird, for better or for worse.The Cell is a trippy experience. It has a cool plot that predates Inception, but it's probably most memorable for its far-out images and its freaky exploration of a psychopath's subconscious. If you think you can handle it, it's certainly recommended.4.5/5 (Experience: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Plot) An FBI agent manages to convince an emotional social worker, who is adept with experimental technology, to enter the mind of a notorious serial killer who happens to be comatose, in order to learn where he has taken his latest female victim.The abundance of potential this film had really makes me sad. The storyline should have been really riveting, but it was so pedestrian with the way they went along with it. The serial killer himself (Vincent D'Onofrio) is rather scary, and we do get some very striking visuals, but I just got bored with it after a while. It's all style and very little substance in my opinion. I also had trouble with the pacing. It flagged quite a bit in the middle, and my interest only perked up for the interaction between Vince Vaugh &amp; Jennifer Lopez. It doesn't have that much suspense, when it should have a plethora of it. You have a really unique plot here, TAKE ADVANTAGE! It's watchable, but not very entertaining when all is said and done. Jennifer Lopez is adequate here, but also slightly inconsistent. I thought she was too blasé when it came to certain situations and I would have liked her to amp up her intensity. She's certainly easy on the eyes, and she nailed her scenes with Vaughn, but I thought she was off and on. Vince Vaughn has been middling with lame comedies for so many years now, I honestly forgot how good of a serious actor he can be. I enjoyed his intense show here, and he was the main reason that kept me watching, and I'm no Vince Vaughn fan. I don't care for the guy at all, but he has the ability to be a good actor when he wants to. Vincent D'Onofrio is one creepy dude and gave a solid show as the killer. He'll keep your attention, that's for sure. The acting (aside from Lopez's inconsistencies) isn't the problem hereFinal Thoughts: It was alright. I found it to be a rather muddled affair which was watchable, but not terribly exciting. It's worth a watch, but I was just frustrated with this one. Pretty average stuff, unfortunately5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell starts out beautifully and immediately caught my attention. It's a fantastic opening scene that grazes the surface of the boundless possibilities of the human psyche. It left me more than intrigued. We're than introduced to a rather run of the mill psychopath who likes to torture his victims etc, etc...tedium ensues. Interspersed throughout this bland Law &amp; Order murder mystery are several journeys through the psyche of this schizophrenic madman. Now, this is what I came here to see. Some of these sequences are beautiful, haunting and grotesque and will stick with you for quite some time. Others are visually and symbolically obtuse. The Cell is one of the most unique thrillers out there and I admire the film for it's intriguing premise and unique visuals.6/10</fullReview>

Once we enter the mind of the killer, the film really takes a turn for the better, and becomes very unnerving.Singh knows how to use colours to a psychedelic effect, and the use of shadow and light would make Caligari envious.Lopez is okay in her role, but beauty outweighs her performance as she whispers all her lines for no reason. Vaughn is good, but the film belongs to D'onofrio, he is fantastic as the killer and really makes the whole thing work.The film loses it's pace a little at the end, but it would have been really hard to live up to the second act.well worth seeing, even if you don't like the serial killer sub-genre, it's beautiful to look at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell is a science fiction psychological thriller film starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio. The supporting cast includes Catherine Sutherland, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Dylan Baker, and Pruitt Taylor Vince.It was directed by Tarsem Singh.Child psychiatrist Catherine Deane has developed a technique that allows her to travel through the minds of her patients. When Stargher, a multiple murderer who methodically drowns his victims and performs bizarre rituals with their bodies, falls into a coma, FBI agent Peter Novak asks Deane to enter the killer's psyche, in the hope of finding a missing girl whom Stargher has kidnapped.If she's not soon found, in all likelihood she'll die in his torture cell. However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter.If you're looking for emotional depth, substantial plot, and artistic coherence, this movie is sure to disappoint.It offers a disturbing, stunning eye candy, but it is undermined by a weak and shallow plot line that offers nothing new.It does not hold a candle to the same movie mind-trips genres such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Altered States and What Dreams May Come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can accept some people will be shocked by this film and if you don't want to look inside the mind of a madman or be curious enough to wonder why serial killers become serial killers then avoid this movie at all costs as it is disturbing.Many seem to compare this movie to imaginary worlds like "Flatliners" and "The Matrix" and in some ways I can see the similarities.To keep it simple the story is about Jennifer Lopez who is a Child Physiologist Social Worker who is using a new technology of going into children's dreams to try and break them out of the troubles they are in.A Serial killer who is in a comatose before his last potential victims is found and the police a fighting time before she dies and they ask Jennifer Lopez Character to go into his dreams to hopefully save her.You get to see the inside of many serial killers mind and reasons why they become an anti-social psychopath and this lends to the artistic imaginations of the director which in some ways scares many and as in other reviews shocks many. I personally believe it was well done but in other ways it was contrived and with more with the character development less visual effect's it could have been a winner, remember this is a horror/suspense thriller and if you are shocked then the directors goal was achieved.So if you are into visual effects and horror genre with a fascination into a serial killers mind and a point of view based on many case studies and it shows that all madmen are made by society's failures to protect children not born!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silence of the Lambs meets Flatliners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After you have seen enough movies, there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies. Nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film. I had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later. Like "Silence of the Lambs" it features the search for a serial killer who has abducted someone and has confined her to his chamber of horrors, Like "Flatliners" the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure. The surrealism of the dream sequences is what makes this film, as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen. And beyond this continuity and "making sense" are not necessary, which makes it a film-maker's dream too.The only thing that seems a bit off is the fact that in the end one hopes for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. You actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but clearly the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from horrible deeds of the man. The focus swings as it must from saving the man to saving his victim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging serial killer drama with sci-fi twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Lopez stars in this futuristic thriller, a visually dynamic, inventive spin on "The Silence of the Lambs". Lopez is top child therapist Catherine Deane, whose sessions are held inside the client's brain using new technology. While helping her latest client, a young boy named Edward, has proved difficult, Catherine gets a new challenge when she's hired by the FBI to go into the mind of a schizophrenic serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio, twice as creepy as he was in "Full Metal Jacket") to find out where he's hiding his latest victim. Vince Vaughn plays the hardened prosecutor-turned-FBI agent assigned to the case, Peter. The characters aren't fully developed, and some intriguing questions the film asks aren't properly addressed. We learn at the beginning of the film that Catherine has been having trouble sleeping and has nightmares, but nothing further in the story explains why this could be so. After her first trip inside his mind, Catherine learns that D'Onofrio's killer was physically and sexually abused as a child, and she and Peter discuss whether a childhood of abuse is an excuse for, or always leads to, abusing others in adulthood. "The Cell" brings up this question but doesn't sufficiently examine it. Beyond her strong compassion for others, we learn little about Catherine, and Peter, who ditched his career in the D.A.'s office after a dangerous child molester was allowed to walk, even less. While Peter's story is obviously an indictment of the U.S. judicial system, the film's themes of childhood abuse and trauma and its effects as well as schizophrenia could be more developed for a stronger film. Overall, dazzling imagery and a creative story help turn this ordinary procedural into an entertaining ride that is as enjoyable as it is creep-tastic.</fullReview>

This was a very well done movie but it just didn't work for me, it was high budget Hollywood doing a scary movie forgetting to put the scary elements in, instead using lots of expensive eye candy so we wouldn't notice. Horror movies are a very strict genre item, with strict rules, if you are going to make horror understand the rules, this is a very good horror movie for NON horror movie fans, and maybe thats the audience they want. Jennifer Lopez I think can act but this was a little over the top, The reality is the star of any horror movie is the villain, without them there is nothing, she should understand the relationship between her role as the heroin and the villain is intertwined but we came to see him not her, well maybe her too but thats another review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie disturbed me enough to write an IMDb comment, which is probably an indication of above-average qualities.Negatives: - Jennifer Lopez character (and to a certain extent acting) did not seem properly developed, and some crucial info may have been lost in the editing. Despite radiating warmth and compassion she remains a puzzle, and not a terrbily intriguing one. - Ditto for Vince Vaughn, though I think he did a better job in terms of acting. - The computer graphics at the beginning of Vaughn's trip weren't bad, but far from the visual imagination of the other trip scenes, and mostly yet another extension of the old "2001" stargate.Positives: - Extraordinary visuals in terms of sets, colors and photography for the trip scenes, excellent on every level. The focus on reduction, instead of overkill, is especially impressive. - Awesome costumes and makeup. - Vincent D'Onofrio displays his extraordinary range as an actor once more. - The sense of closure at the end was unusually rewarding for this type of movie, as Lopez' resolution of the serial killer's internal torture is multilayered and ambiguous.The other aspects of the movie, such as the race against time, the Fed investigation etc, were neither particularly good nor particularly bad. The commercial considerations reduce the full power of "The Cell" somewhat, but then what else is new?I liked and was partially very impressed with this movie, though it was unpleasant watching - I mean, REALLY unpleasant - at times.</fullReview>

One scene that sticks out in my mind focuses on a Turtle in a field and then pans out to a road as a car goes by. At least I'm pretty sure thats what happens but whatever the point is that scene sticks out in my mind as being quite pretty. Also scenes in the desert in the beginning and end and the costumes add to this films aesthetic pleasure. I'm not sure what else this director has done, I think an REM video and not much else, but something tells me that he was an art major or something like that, some of the images that beautiful.

The dream/reality transitions are just amazing and the world inside Stargher's head is just as fascinating (if a little strange)like watching a surreal painting. The basic underlying story isn't that great though, it's typical "MUST FIND SERIAL KILLER QUICK!" fare, a little like "Silence Of The Lambs" or "Seven" but not really, IMO this film is about visuals first.I went so far as buying this AND it's soundtrack (Howard Shore) even though I hate J-Lo I'm not ashamed to say I like this film a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen where people have totally trashed this movie in reviews. No offence to them, of course, as this movie isn't for everyone. There's some rather disturbing violence, much blood, and the subject matter isn't for the family. Here's the rub, though: it's a psychological thriller. Think a lesser version of "Silence of the Lambs," for example.That's right. It's a crime movie. Carl Stargher (D'Onofrio)'s got a history of kidnapping, raping and bleaching women, and Catherine Deane (Lopez) must get into his mind and find out where his latest victim is.This is where all of the disturbing scenery is, that you read about: inside his mind. In fact, the most disturbing of it all happens to FBI man, Peter Novak (Vaughn). But does it really happen to him? No. It's all inside Stargher's head.This is a trip through the mind of a schizophrenic. Well worth the watch, but take care to put the kids to bed first.I didn't reveal the climax, but I'm sure that you will watch if you're intrigued. Keep an eye out for the albino wolfdog! He's Stargher's pet, and partner-in-crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audacious shocker with stunning visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE CELL Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSA female psychotherapist (Jennifer Lopez) uses new technology to enter the subconscious mind of a comatose serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) in a desperate attempt to uncover the whereabouts of his latest kidnap victim.Tarsem Singh's audacious film crosses FANTASTIC VOYAGE with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS to stunning visual effect, and while the concept is too outrageous to be entirely believable, the execution is often breathtaking. Lopez is a little too glamorous in the central role, though she acquits herself well enough amongst the excesses of Singh's 'mindscape' set-pieces, which alternate between the bizarre, the beautiful and the obscene, often within a single sequence. Culture vultures will have a ball spotting the wealth of pop references (eg. the punchline of the notorious 'horse' sequence was clearly inspired by the works of Damien Hirst), and while the plot doesn't really amount to much, the film derives most of its impact from the twisted grotesqueries conjured by Mark Protosevich's clever screenplay. In the process, Singh generates more than a little sympathy for D'Onofrio's serial killer, whose monstrous pathology was shaped in childhood at the hands of his abusive father, though Singh is careful to balance this compassionate approach with the pain and suffering inflicted on D'Onofrio's traumatized victims. Too grim for some tastes, the movie scores points for trying a new approach to old material. Also starring Vince Vaughn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Dylan Baker, with a brief cameo from Patrick Bauchau.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think all the hurrah for The Cell was really because of fantastic digital special effects. Granted, I'll give the filmmakers credit for that. The story on the other hand was not really something I enjoyed. I felt like it was something where you were being forced to believe something, forced to concentrate on something, without giving a whole lot of reason why. One of those stories that take forever to get off the ground and try to build up way too much to justify itself that in the end, the whole complex mess finishes in a completely confusing or disastrous ending.Not to mention it stars a cast that I just can't take seriously. Plus, I didn't appreciate them stealing much of the storyline (and even some of the sequences) from the 1984 sci-fi adventure, 'Dreamscape,' (starring Dennis Quaid and Christopher Plummer). Since about a billion people have commented on this movie already, I just have a brief plot synopsis: a profiler/scientist goes inside the mind of a killer to find out where his last victim is.

Where this film deserves credit, outweighing all these problems, is in its scenes of spine-tingling power and strangeness such as the sliced horse, Stargher descending from his throne trailing vast purple wings of cloth, and the decadent smile on Catherine's face in the 'naughty worm' scene. It's an awesome and believable portrayal of the internal landscape of a disturbed person's mind. Memories of childhood trauma, sexual fantasies, power fantasies, images from the real world (such as the Poussin's 'Martyrdom of St Erasmus') incorporated into fantasy, the sense of vast importance combined with vast vulnerability; the director has done his research.</fullReview>

The first half hour is decent and I enjoyed the serial killers twisted ways, hanging himself on hooks ouch. The idea of going into a serial killers messed up mind was very original and some of the stuff was just plain disturbing (the big guy with the cloak, the horned guy, the guy with the horrible teeth). The acting all round was very good, J-Lo was much better than I thought she was capable of being. Vincent D'Onofrio was great as the serial killer, brought some much needed intensity to the film. Vince Vaughn didn't seem his usual self in the movie and felt like he was phoning his performance in which was a bit of a let down as I like Vaughn.Overall it was a very unique idea executed very well, I recommend it and recommend people not to be put off by it having J-Lo in.Final Rating: 7/10Entry onto Movie List: 197th of 344 (Better than Bridget Jones Diary, Worse than Scary Movie)Entry onto 2000 Year List: 16th (Better than Scream 3, Worse than Scary Movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this on video a month ago after having seen the last hour of it when it first came out (dont ask).The Cell shows the complete opposites of life - the police and victims in dull, mundane, daily processes, where everyone is doing a job without real satisfaction, and then Ms Lopez' character, and that of the killer, both having the ability to have gone and done what they wanted in an alternative existence of colour,and uniqueness.The plot and portrayal of this in the film are not the best, as it seems two hours is never enough to bring out the full impact of a novel, however what has been achieved to cracking the mental state of the killer using a method of mind melting in the time given is something very close to ideal.The effort that was put into the special effects really make the movie, to fascinate those with an open mind (sic), and to shock the rest that would rather not have seen it. The closest I have seen a film do this is Altered States, tapping into the inner mind process, though there were a couple of similar films in the early nineties, delving into the idea of swapping bodies (Freejack) and minds (cannot remember the name of it)Worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rings on the villain's back must be for a willing suspension of disbelief. The plot and dialog are contrived, intrusive, absurd. We are told that the villain's "schizophrenia" is due to the adult manifestation of symptoms of a childhood cerebral viral infection, yet we are shown the story of a compulsive reenactment, with role reversals, of childhood abuse -- perhaps another example of the popular confusion between schizophrenia and "split personality." Even the directing and editing have their problems: the good guys are very leisurly in real-time considering that every minute counts to save the victim.Turn off the sound, fast forward through the psycho-babble, and watch the visuals. As with "Elizabeth" with Cate Blanchett, the visual drama of this film is wonderful ("Elizabeth" was also directed by a South Asian, Shekhar Kapoor, and Tarsem Singh's "Cell" is more obviously influenced by Mughlai miniatures, decoration, and Bollywood).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hesitated in my decision to see this film because it had Jennifer Lopez. I never really liked her as an actress because she always seemed to try too hard. Touted as the best film of the summer in 2000, "The Cell" is nothing more than special effects and visually stunning set designs gone wrong. There was nothing in this film that was appealing. With each setting, it seemed like the designers got better at creating the backdrop for where the story took place; however, the settings don't make the movie. Vince Vaughn, Vincent D'Onorfio join Lopez to do their best in making "The Cell" the best movie of the year. The biggest reason for its failure was the complexity of the plot. I couldn't understand what the writer was trying to bring across from scene to scene. It seemed liked it dragged on longer than it had to. Besides the drawn out and complex plot, the ending to "The Cell" was so tedious it was laughable. "The Cell" did serve one purpose: it can now be distributed to film schools for students who want to become directors as a lesson in filmmaking on what not to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil minds dream the most striking images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is mostly about visual style. Much of it is a jumble of Jungian symbols and Freudian nightmares through which Jennifer Lopez floats around in search of the ego. All beautifully photographed, yet the story is needlessly disturbing.I think it's revealing that when a modern film studies the inner workings of the mind, whether in the form of drama or science fiction, we are almost always presented with the severely dysfunctional mind. Never a stable, well-balanced mind. Films never analyze the mind of a happy used-car salesman in Ohio, or a contented librarian in Peoria, or a spiritually serene farmer in Kansas. Artists are much more interested in the nature of evil minds, demented psyches, broken people. Evil is a much more interesting subject that Good.The mind through which Lopez travels - using a machine that lets her mind-meld with comatose patients in the hope of curing them - is the mind of a cruel, demented serial-killer. We are shown the inner psyche of someone that most of us would rather not see. Why do we need to see the images of sexual dysfunction in a person who thrives on death and destruction?I really don't care why some people choose to engage in gratuitous cruelty. I know these kinds of people exist, but why dwell on the outer fringes of evil behavior? I realize that evil acts stem from complex sources, but does dwelling on such questions really do anything other than promote voyeurism?The film tries to argue that all evil acts are basically reactions to some trauma early in life. Yet one of the characters replies that, at some point, a moral choice is made by everyone, and these kinds of people should not be objects of too much sympathy. Evil is real, and not just a moral term for a medical condition over which the patient has zero control.So, see the film for the visuals. This director comes from a background of music videos, which shows. But you'll need to watch or do something light-hearted after the film, to cleanse yourself from the experience of swimming through a psychological sewer, regardless of its stunning visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "The Cell" in the theaters when it was released and was impressed with the beauty. So impressed that I had to buy it when it came out on DVD. It also didn't help that my wife wanted it because of Vince Vaughn either. I was certainly glad to see that the transfer to DVD was done so that all the colors that I saw on the big screen showed up very well on the smaller screen. The Cell is about a psychiatrist who has to help the police locate a missing girl by going "into the mind" of the kidnapper who is in a coma. The idea that was used to enter his mind was done wonderfully and is sometime tough to figure out was is really happening but I love it when that happens. Vincent D'Onofrio is stupendous as the psycho killer/kidnapper and Jennifer Lopez is not bad as the psychiatrist. This movie is also at times very creepy.The only downside to the DVD is the audio commentary. I tried listening to it and about fell asleep. The director is very boring and most of the time it is hard to understand him. All in all I give this 7-10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so maybe the plot leaves a lot to be desired, although it ain't half bad, but you have to agree that visually this film is absolutely astounding. Everything looks gorgeous: the locations, the set, the set dressing, the light, the shadowing, the special effects, the CG, the everything. And the superbly mixed soundtrack only adds to the beauty.For instance, just look at when Catherine enters Carl's mind for the first time and we are witness to his baptism; that scene is visually mindboggling.So, you may not like the story and how it is told, but you gotta admit that it is a feast to the eyes. That's why I give it 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Makers of This Movie Should Be Thrown in a Cell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Dark Times (The Eighties), there came a movie that shone light across the lands for a brief few seconds before Laserblast came out and sent the world back into darkness. That movie was Dreamscape, a interesting movie about a man who could enter people's dreams. A great movie in fact.Flash forward ten years. A movie arrives that is similar to Dreamscape in several ways. Well, one way. Once again we have a character that is capable of entering dreams. And that's pretty much the only connection it has with Dreamscape. I'm sorry for even bringing up a good movie in this review.But I digress. The Cell stars Jennifer Lopez, which is critical because it proves my theory which I have put into a simple and easy to understand equation:singer+movie=bad movieNow there may be the occasional movie starring a singer that's good, but these are the exceptions. Back to The Cell. Jennifer Lopez plays a psychologist who tries to help her patients by goin' into their heads, and analyzing them from the inside out. Eventually she is called upon to get inside a killer's skull and take a look see.This is one of the most offensive disgusting movies I have ever had the occasion to meet. Women, kids, and the occasional animal are killed and tortured. The movie is needlessly twisted and one should bathe using powerful cleaning agents after watching this film.This movie had an interesting idea and then killed it through it's pointless cruelty. Watch Laserblast before you even consider watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell is one of the hyped up movies that look interesting, but don't really go anywhere. I must say that I had high expectations for this, and I was sorely disappointed. First off the movie starts off slow, and then when it begins to pick up speed, it falls apart towards the end, with no real accomplishment of what they originally set out to do. I found this movie very tedious, since they used special effects and bright colors to distract everyone from the lack of a sound storyline, and to top it all off they couldn't even come up with a decent ending.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally enjoyed this film. The idea was interesting and unique. I will admit that some of the acting was lame and some things were rather overdone but it was still a good watch. The sets were amazing (SPOILERS?)especially when we were in Carl's mind. Talk about creepy. I can't tell you how much I was affected by some of what I saw. The 'Gallery of Dolls' (as I call it)and the scene with the purple cloth were some of my favorites. (SPOILERS OVER) I have to say though, that the main reason I got this film was Vincent D'Onofrio. He's an amazing actor and even though the movie wasn't the best, his performance certainly was.(CAUTION, *SPOILERS*) In fact, I think that the best scene was the one at the bathtub when Carl talks about his first kill, the baptism thing and his father. It was a very disturbing scene. I loved the spare gloomy set, the odd intercutting, and above all, Vincent's acting. (END OF SPOILERS)All in all, it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen but it's well worth watching if you're into movies like "The Silence of the Lambs".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' for the 21st Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 7.6 (out of 10)Film is a visual medium. I will probably be dragged to my death saying those words. So it's fitting that I start by saying that The Cell is a cinematic visual masterpiece. At one time I found myself wondering how it might look if Hollywood were to remake "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" with modern visual effects. The Cell is as close as we have ever come to that. It's fresh, creative and gloriously twisted imagery comes out of the mind of Indian director Tarsem Singh (or just the not-so-catchy "Tarsem", depending on where he's credited). My knee-jerk Hollywood-movie-trained response is to say that the plot is used as a clothesline to hang some eye-popping, special effects bits; but that isn't quite true. The story, while not the most original thing, is quite involved. An assemblage of techno alternate reality movies, psycho-killer movies and crowd-pleasing comic book action flicks, the plot concerns an FBI agent (Vince Vaughn) and a child psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) who team up to use an experimental sensory deprivation technology to get into the mind of a catatonic psycho killer. Throw on top of that terrific race-against-the-clock element: our psycho has kidnaped a women and is holding her in a cell that will kill her in (I forget how many) hours. The thinking is that somewhere in his mind they will find the location of the women. It's a complex and promising set-up that needs all of it's different elements working together to pull it off. Our heroes contend with the sick memories and psychotic multiple personalities of psychotic Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) and it's in those scenes where the movie is at a high that is often brilliant and purely entertaining. However, when the movie steps into the "real" world is when it gets pedestrian. Despite such a promising set-up the execution plays out like "Silence of the Lambs" and a thousand other typical genera flicks. Tarsem does his best and keeps this stuff crisp and exciting, but it only glosses over the fact that Mark Protosevich's script is like a James Patterson novel. The movie is ultimately not very memorable because of that mediocre writing. The characters are hollow and cliche. And it doesn't help that Jennifer Lopez can't act her way out of a paper bag (Now I think she is better suited for dumb romantic comedies then to ruin something as promising as this). That's a monumental shame because Vincent D'Onofrio gives a tremendous performance as not only our villain but his multiple subconscious personalities. Now that's an actor. Give Tarsem a great script and he will make a classic. The Cell gets so close, but continually loses it's footing alternating between moments of genius and moments of B-movie stupidity. It is entertaining and fun enough on a crowd-pleasing level- particularly in an exciting and imaginative finale - to keep the audience glued to their seats. But you might feel ashamed of yourself the next morning.</fullReview>

Looking back on the situation with the keen and mature outlook I have now, I truly wonder if perhaps Bobby would have behaved in the same way had there been someone like J-Lo to talk to him.

		<shortDescription>Haunting and dreamlike, this film is like a series of paintings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a dream last night of the sequence in this film where Catherine Deane (Lopez) falls upward from a box in Stargher's world, then frees herself from the tether and falls down through a hole and into the Roman Pantheon. I absolutely am in love with the shot of her slowly falling into the Roman house of the Gods. It's beautiful. The whole film is beautiful.Too many people do not understand that dementedness and derangement can in a way be just as beautiful as anything else. Everything in life has beauty simply by being. But we're taught through morals and ethics to think that things are "ugly" and "not beautiful". And while I'm not saying that being a serial killer is by any means beautiful, what I am saying is that "The Cell" takes a beautiful and artistic look into the sadistic and complex, highly splintered mind of a killer. Everyone's psyche is a treasure trove of their past, their present, and their future, their thoughts, ideals, feelings, desires, repressions, EVERYTHING. It's ALL stored in there. So like director Tarsem says, it's an open canvas. Anything goes. So right off the bat we know this film can and does go anywhere. By its nature it would. That's why I don't understand all these people who like to cut the film down because of its leading visuals. Yes, it's about a serial killer. But everything has been done by now, so it's all how you do it. Has there been another film where a psychologist literally goes into the killer's mind and explores his psyche to locate his latest victim? And since when can there only be ONE serial killer movie? Is there just one war movie? Lord knows there are more than enough of those kind, but you don't hear people complaining about that. Or ghost films. You can never make enough of those. There are subjects that are eternally open for exploration and expansion. And the subject of serial killers is one of those. We're fascinated by the dark side of human nature that resorts to taking other's lives. That's a fertile subject to deal with in film, and "The Cell" takes it to a whole new level, visually, psychologically, and cinematically. There is no other film like it. Some of my favorite films are those that do actually get into my head and seep into my dreams. As of this morning I can say "The Cell" has become one of those films. I loved the dream I had last night. And it just goes to serve my point further: this film is about the psyche and all the richness therein. And it's gotten into mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie absolutley spell-binding. The visual trip it takes you on is only matched by the depth of the story and the characters. As a writer and an artist, I have a very strange and dream-like imagination of my own. I really connected with the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters; it was very well executed. D'Onofrio's performance was especially compelling. I found myself in tears more than once over the suffering that had created the monster; and at times found myself strangely drawn to the dark character. Now that's acting. To be able to make such a sick, derranged character be at times not only approachable and human, but also magnetic and charismatic is a display of absolute talent.Jennifer Lopez was believable and lovely. She did a great job of connecting with her subjects (as the character) and also connecting with the audience.Vince's performance was great as well, but did not move me to feel extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've had the unfortunate experience of being exposed to this contrived, wannabe twisted psychiatrists journey into a madman. Obviously the presence of Jennifer Lopez as someone who could offer her expertise on anything meaningful makes this somewhat of a joke. It seems everything she attempts is marked by superficiality and arrogance; first she started in these acting roles due to her coveted looks, but now tries to be in everything else...including the type of American Idol trends that predominates the music industry these days. The movie just seems to be as orginal as her. Wow, lets ventrue into the mind of someone who has kidnapped some poor blond lady. There is a lot of wannabe artsy/trippy camera work that is probably the best part of the movie, since the substance and interest lacks in the plot. It's fairly banal though, since it seems like a combination of the visual imagery one would find in Silence of Lambs, Seven, and some 80's fantasy movies. I usually like twisted movies that involve subjects of psychology, but this movie is just stale and weak, although I do often enjoy the other actors in the movie, D'noffrio and Vaughn. It's just the idea of Jennifer Lopez as a caring, daring, and powerful psychologist that makes this movie so boring and worthless. Her acting is so flat, ineffective, and narcissistic. So if you like Jennifer Lopez and dig cheesy sci-fi about psychology and horror than you'll love this movie. But if you care for good acting and orginality, then you might as well turn it off and watch something that doesn't seem so forced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An FBI Agent (Vince Vaughn) has been tracking down a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio, in a great performance) who kidnaps women and drowns them in a cell in the basement of an abandoned farmhouse he was paid to dismantle. But when the feds find him, he has gone into a coma. But technology that allows social workers to enter patients minds may be the key to finding out where his latest victim is before the cell drowns her. Enter a gifted psychologist (Jennifer Lopez, the film's lead) who mainly works with traumatized children. Her initial job is to go in, discover where the victim is, and get out. But when she discovers that the killer has a tortured inner child, she tries to get emotionally involved, an act which could destroy her mentally. This is, however, Tarsem's film. If India has more directors like this, then it's a shame we don't see more films from that country. There is some CGI, but this is mostly makeup and set work; computers are kept to a minimum. Tarsem shows us a startling portrayal of a killer's mind, which seems very believable. Mark Protosevich wrote a so-so script, which isn't a bad thing; it just means that when you see this movie, there's three things you should be paying attention to. The first is Tarsem's visuals. The second is how the characters interact with the environment. The third, one of my favorite's, is the performance by Vincent D'Onofrio. I swear, this man is a genius, even though he is overshadowed by Tarsem's work. This is so different from his role on Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent, it's just amazing how he can move from role to role. On another note, did anyone notice the similarity between the two Vince's? I mean, they're both tall, 300 pound gorillas with bad posture. If you saw one of them from behind, you probably couldn't tell who it is. Overall, worth renting. And the DVD is much better than the edited version.</fullReview>

The story is extremely well thought through, and the locations of other peoples minds provides for some dazzling backdrops and costumes. The suspense of the slow execution of the serial killers final victim provides a healthy amount of tension, and the film doesn't get lost in the fantasy element, enough of the story is focused on the real world. It can be quite violent, and isn't scared to explore some of the gorier side of the serial killers' mind. It also leaves you with enough of a doubtful mind to wonder a bit longer than the titles.

Jennifer Lopez played Catherine as a very boring, wimpy female character, but ya know if she sang it as part of a music video promotion, it would have worked.Who CARES who else was in this film, it was the director's film 100%. You could have put Jimmy Hoffa in it and no one would have realized it.

The directors and producers did a good job at portraying his angry father, and it made the audience dislike him. When they had the kid get all crazy in the desert i liked that and even when they had the women in the crop field when Vince Vaughn went in. I didn't like the fact though that everything had a foundation because if you went into my head, half of everything you wouldn't even understand. Although, they had a couple of intro's into his head that were pretty good but they should have kept on doing that about every couple of minutes or so to understand how different from reality all that is.

The monsters are us, and the dreamworld they inhabit stands in stark contrast to the representation of the "real world".

		<fullReview>-[spoiler included!]- (modified)Brilliant movie. I don't like Hollywood movies much, and was sceptical about the film my GF wanted - no, needed - me to see, knowing not much more about it than that it had big stars and was quite successful and some kind of thriller-thing - and that she wanted, no, needed me to see it. I understand why now.From almost the moment it started I was sitting on the edge of my seat, in one of the most anxious and intense movie experiences I've had. The visual brilliance helped, of course. But The Matrix - that other movie she really wanted me to see - was also visually stunning while stretching your suspension of disbelief - but only scratched at surfaces where this movie just pulled you to it and dragged you right down, to the murkiest depths.I thought it was believable (I already saw that most other reviewers didn't) - not the "possibility of dying in somebody else's dream" bit, but the story so inventively told through the gimmick, that of the terrified boy within the sick man, one daring out for help while the other snaps out in anger. 'The serial killers sickness as a prolonged cry of pain' is not exactly a novel idea for a story line, but The Cell tells it in a way that grips you, and it does so through the technical-visual brilliance of its bizarre angle. This guy is so sick that no regular 'playing out' of the traumatised-kid-within story would have been credible - only in the very depths of his mind can that kid be found and that the director thus decided - OK - that's where we'll literally go in the movie, then - is pretty impressive. That they stayed an uncomprimising course, going beyond the thriller suspense but not giving in to the temptation to have her succeed in 'rescuing' him in some happy end either, is, too. The film never gets sappy about the tragedy hidden inside the serial killers head. He is truly and irredeemably rotten, to the core - his violence is beyond the hysteric violence of anger and frustration, it is the studious obsessed violence of a person who's been corrupted, corrupted by terror. The film shows where the terror stems from, adds the why and how come, but without ever excusing him. It's the nightmare of every victim - that his/her assailant will succeed in corrupting him/her to the point where s/he isn't fit for life anymore. Spoilt goods. The films' serial killer is. The film stays consistent in this, refusing the viewer an easy exit into mercy or condemnation. She goes to her limits to where she understands him - but he still has to die.The cruelty of The Cell is no freak show. Nothing gratuitous about it, it's real enough - all over the place, in minds and lives transformed by pain. Some other reviewer lamented that, unlike The Matrix e.a., the film had nothing "to say about the resilience and optimism of humanity". Well no, and if you go to the movies for your prescription of hope &amp; belief, this is the wrong one to go see - it has something to say about damage, and how the inner world of terrorized kids turn into nightmare landscapes. Instead of telling that story, this film decided to just show those landscapes. Succeeded. Very disconcerting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film definitely dropped the ball in the story/writing department. The way things started out it could really have gotten dark, creepy, and interesting. Unfortunately, pretty shortly into the film I realized that wasn't going to happen.HOWEVER - the film is a visual treat that is matched by few films (Titus, Sleepy Hollow) of recent years. And really that makes it worthwhile for me.I am always a strong proponent of viewing films in their original widescreen format. With this film, though, I would say that you should only watch the film if you can see it in widescreen.Listening to the audio commentary by the director on the DVD, one gets a better insight into what he was trying to do with this film - the visuals were deliberately emphasized, realizing that was the focus. Singh mentions some of his favorite director's and films (he saw David Cronenberg's eXistenZ 7 times in the theater) and I found his comments overall helpful in enjoying the film for what it is. It could have been a true classic if the writing had been better - but that is frequently the case with many films. Great writing is just hard to come by, especially in genre films, and even moreso in films with big budgets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know how it is when you're having a great time at a party and somebody starts telling you in elaborate detail all about this weird dream he had last night? There might be some people -- latent Freudians and the like -- who find other people's dreams fascinating. But I suspect that for most people, having to listen to somebody else's dream is a real bringer-downer. See, dreams aren't real. Despite the latent Freudians, in fact, most dreams are totally meaningless and irrelevant, and for that reason terminally boring to everyone but the dreamer himself. That's why dream sequences in movies tend to be so dull. You can't wait for them to be over.The dream sequences in The Cell aren't dreams, exactly, but they're close enough to make me awfully impatient for it all to be over. It's the talkative bore at the party. The sad thing is that the party in this case is the magnificent Jennifer Lopez, all dolled out in some of the strangest and most extravagant outfits ever. I would've been happy to sit through a couple of hours of a plotless fashion show starring Ms. Lopez showing off gowns and negligees and body suits, the more and wilder the better. I hope some daring director makes that movie some day. Heck, I'd look at her face in different kinds of makeup for two hours. (J-Lo's face is her fortune, not anything else you might think.) But keep the lame fantasy plot, please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Cell" was a visual feast. The story was inventive, a typical serial killer thriller with a twist. Jennifer Lopez was OK in her role but was a visual treat. Her role consisted mostly of reacting to the surrealistic setting she was placed in and by being a clothes horse. She is a babe but, at least in this movie, her acting skills weren't the draw. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was good in her small role. I wish she would be given a role with more substance. She was wonderful in "Secrets and Lies". Vincent D'Onofrio was good as the killer and Vince Vaughn was effective as the FBI guy. The real treat was the inventive sets and the special effects. The story holds the movie together well and the effects dazzle the eye. Worth seeing for the effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell is the film that ruined going to the movies for me. I have not returned to a Cineplex since I watched this atrocity. Not only was I surrounded by people carrying cell-phones (ooh! the irony), but I also sat next to a woman who brought her three elementary school-aged children to the film. What was this woman thinking? As soon as Jennifer Lopez encountered her first nightmarish creature, the three girls shrieked with horror and huddled around their mother. She must have seen the commercials and thought, `Hey, Jennifer Lopez! Kids love her!', failing to notice that the film is rated R for scenes of extreme violence and sexuality. Her ignorance made me sick to my stomach. They fled the theater when the serial killer began to suspend himself from the ceiling with meathooks. Mother of the Year.That woman's ignorance, and the thoughts of the nightmares her poor kids would endure for the next few weeks, put me in a bad mood; the film's bleak, hopeless outlook on humanity did not help. I left the theater with a foul taste in my mouth that no amount of Bugs Bunny cartoons could cleanse. I was surprised to read Roger Ebert's overwhelmingly positive review. Usually, the more visually innovative films he embraces have something to say about the resilience and optimism of humanity; dig under the dark neo-Gothic trappings of Dark City or The Matrix, and you still come up with a feeling that humanity is worth fighting for. But despite The Cell's ludicrous Hallmark-card ending, no character in the movie is worth saving.The director ties together an endless string of unpleasant, unrelated, surreal images in an effort to - uh - I don't know why he does it, actually. Because it looks cool, I guess. For weeks afterwards, my stomach hurt every time I recalled the extraneous, agonizingly drawn-out torture scene. I do not mind films that push the limits of good taste, if there is a reason for doing so. The Cell is brutal for brutality's sake. It's a film that rolls around in its own waste; the cinematic equivalent of a pretentious artist who splatters a canvas with feces and then expects you to embrace it as art.Instead of challenging the audience with compelling characters, an original storyline, or visuals that try to represent the subconscious without resorting to MTV clichés, The Cell proves its utter cynicism by giving us scenes directly lifted from an REM video, an avalanche of gore, and a Jennifer Lopez thong-shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bizarre costumes and great graphic violence made this movie worth its while. The best outfit was the one Jennifer Lopez wears as she kisses the FBI agent. Her hair style was great too. The setting was good and the plot was great. It was about time that a director and a great writer would take the chance on making a movie on what it would look like inside someones mind. But the twist is. Is that you enter a serial killer's mind. The first time I saw this movie on VHS. I was kind of scared and excited to see what was in store in this movie. At the end I loved it. The costumes and decoration inside the mind was just mind boggoling. This movie does contain graphic violence/Gore, but it's with it. If this isn't your thing don't rent or watch it. I give it 9 out of 10 stars because I wish the movie was much longer and a little more graphic and goes into further depth into the mind. But still a great movie.</fullReview>

Did anyone else nearly puke when Vince Vaughn had his little adventure in hell? That makes the Reservoir Dogs scene look like it belongs in a Disney movie. Bucket please!Overall, its hard to score this flick. DON'T watch it with the family. DON'T watch it if you're squeamish. DON'T watch it if you are emotionally unstable. DO watch it if you want to see something unique, although far from perfect, and you don't mind bizarre and graphic violence.Ok, I need to go vomit now. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take the plot of Silence of the Lambs (female psychiatrist tries to get information from a psycho killer in order to find a kidnapped girl) and mix it with the visuals of the Hellraiser series (lots of piercing and chains and subjective metaphors) and you can get the idea of what this movie is about. While the visuals are impressive, there is almost no story, and you get a collection of unconnected scenes, like a long long videoclip, so you may get tired quite fast. Besides, you must like that visuals, which may be quite disturbing (I actually do). The idea behind this film is good, but it fails to get the right balance between visuals and plot. Even so, it may appeal you if you like bizarre images (or if watching Jennifer Lopez is enough for you).</fullReview>

Jennifer Lopez stars in this psychological thriller which will twist your mind to the max. Jennifer plays a psycologist called Catherine who must delve into the mind of a serial killer to find out where he has hidden a kidnapped woman. The film starts off quite slow, but when the real story begins is when the film became one of my favourtes. If you want a psychological, sometimes frightening rollercoaster then i suggest watching this film right away. If you prefer your Disney classics such as Snow White and Bambi, then stay clear of this. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't consider myself to be squeamish or easily shocked (Silence of the Lambs, which I felt this movie in some ways tried to emulate, is one of my favourite films) but I found The Cell far too disturbing for my tastes. I don't understand how anyone could enjoy watching it, as I certainly didn't.The plot revolves around a schizophrenic serial killer, Edward, who's latest victim is trapped in a tank that is slowly filling with water. The only problem is, the killer is in a coma and the FBI have no idea where his victim is. This is where Jennifer Lopez's character, a pyschologist, comes in. With the aid of a high-tech machine she can go inside the minds of her patients, and so she decides to go inside Edward's mind with the hope of discovering where his victim is so she can be rescued before she drowns.While this might all sound very exciting and tense, I actually found it to be anything but. Some of the imagery was very original and striking, but on the whole I found it to be disturbing. Jennifer Lopez's performance wasn't particularly good at all, in fact I found her character to dull and one-dimensional. The rest of the cast are adequate in their roles, but there's no real stand out performances. As for the movie itself, I found it a rather unpleasant affair, and not one I would recommend to anyone, not even die-hard horror or sci-fi buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell: The bad news...a serial killer has just captured his latest victim. He's imprisoned her in his holding cell and if the FBI don't get her in a certain time frame she will be drown. The good news? The FBI have just caught the killer. The bad news? He's in a coma and they don't know where the woman is being held. The good news? A Psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) is part of a team which has developed a means to send a doctor inside the brain of comotose patients to assist in their regaining consciousness. The bad news? She's never been inside the brain of a killer before. It is an interesting concept, though it strikes heavily the memories of Dream Scape from the early 80s. Unfortunately they don't build any tension or interest in the characters. Instead the director relies heavily on the computer and ends up making a twisted art film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Hollywood movie is known in this country more for the director of Indian origin. The curiosity value increases further with this being his debut. The movie is about entering the mind of a psychopath to rescue one of his potential victims, using a VR-like sci-fi method. The story itself is uncomplicated, but what sets it apart are the stunning visuals.Art direction, cinematography, special effects and editing shed their boundaries and merge to provide something not really viewed before. In the twisted mind of a schizophrenic, everything cannot be pleasant though. The background score is suitably haunting. The acting is just fine. Singh seems to have fully understood the power of the medium and takes over the proceedings. Another notable aspect is the absolute dearth of Hollywood formulae. When the movie ends, one gets the feeling of leaving an alternate world and it also sets off a thought process.</fullReview>

It's what a Lawn Mower Man meets Silence Of The Lambs movie would have looked like if it was directed by David Lynch. The dream/inner world sequences will either do it for you or strike you as totally pretentious.Jennifer Lopez plays a psychiatrist a short time into the future, who specializes in entering comatose subject's minds through a body suit linked up to a computer. This is pretty cool, and the basis for the inner world dream and nightmare sequences. Meanwhile on planet earth, a _very_ sadistic serial killer with a tendency to go into convulsions drowns girls slowly in a waterproof glass cell. The perversions here have to be seen to be believed. Pretty awesome, with hints of the Hindu festival where people hang themselves from large metal hooks.Ten years from now, people will look at this movie and say "wow". There is lots of fetish clothing, sadism, Freudian and Jungian imagery, etc. In fact, think of the Smashing Pumpkins video for "thirty three" with better lighting, and you get a feel of what this movie looks and feels like.

		<fullReview>Another movie that surprised me. I knew little about the content prior to actually sitting down and watching. I did have a vague idea of the subject matter, and it may have been that which drew me to it.Potential Spoiler coming.Jennifer Lopez plays a psychiatrist who works in a facility that enables them to enter the minds of others. Reason being, to get through to them if they are in a coma, primarily. A serial killer is apprehended and has fallen into a coma and someone needs to get into his head to find out where he has hidden his last victim, who they are sure is alive, if his past exploits are anything to go by. True enough, she is alive but not for long. Her life is on a timer and they need to get to her fast. This makes for a fascinating peek into the director's version of the mind of a serial killer. This proves to be a very entertaining and uncomfortable picture, capturing the mind of our killer quite beautifully, in all its captivating and miserable honesty. Like watching an accident from a passing car, it is not possible to tear your eyes away from some of the horrors. Not nightmarish in a circus/barnpot type way, but disturbing in a forbidding and threatening fashion. You don't feel Lopez is in any real danger physically, but you fear she may lose her mind, which would appear to be far scarier. I loved the picture. It's use of lighting and sets were exemplary and Lopez seems to enjoy her role, judging by her believable portayal. Not enjoyable but doing everything it can very well to disturb the viewer. Well made and portayed, more than received, I expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awful peice of fake 'art'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I will admit, there are about 10 minutes or so of special effects in this film that would have made a great Nine Inch Nails video. Unfortunately, they are wedged into a movie that would have to be a whole lot smarter to even be worth picking apart. I don't know, maybe I'm old fashioned, but I like strong writing and an interesting story to go with my special effects, or, failing that, at least an interesting character. Here, the characters are all functional cardboard figures and the writing ranges from mere plot advancement to laughable psychobabble. The worst part of it, though, is that the story is merely a set of ridiculous and baldly implausible contrivances to justify the eye popping visuals. Admittedly, this makes it technically no worse than, say, Mission Impossible 2. But I doubt many people involved in that production thought that they were creating revolutionary art. Perhaps this is the way that film is destined to progress in the future. Maybe the filmic audience can no longer tell the difference between bizarre visuals and transcendent art. No doubt this will become a cult film in the future among college aged pot smokers and will gain a reputuation that it simply does not deserve. For my money, though, its simply another piece of Hollywood garbage, and should be treated as such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the occasion to view The Cell a little while ago and I must say it was probably one of the more interesting films I have been to. I left the theatre feeling a little sick to my stomach simply because the plot was so disturbing in its conception. The Cell, a mix between a psychological thriller and a full-blown horror film is bound to pique your interests one way or the other. It truly has a wealth of lavish and intensely creative visual effects that draw the patron into the film.mind, body, and spirit. The plot is relatively mundane in its entirety. It focuses on Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a charismatic social worker who does not happen to be on the local county payroll. She is happy making a living by hooking herself up to a machine, which in all honesty is capable of probing the symbolic and often surreal minds of unsuspecting subjects. I found that the notion of mind probing pretty far fetched, but once the movie starts, you are too captivated by the visuals to worry about the scientific probability of such a machine actually working. Catherine Deane literally infiltrates the mind of a comatose serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) and becomes a puppet in his sick and often very disturbing mind. From the moment she enters the mind of the killer it is as if she has been plopped right into the middle of a terrifying nightmare. The mind of the killer (the setting) is creepy and disturbing, but all the while it is truly enticing and beautiful. They creators of this movie had a keen ability to bring to life the eerie preoccupations of a sexual abuse victim gone serial killer and they were able to translate his inner suffering through gorgeous costumes, bizarre and lavish settings, and truly ingenious computer aided graphic design. Overall, the script is shoddy at best and lacks any life whatsoever. The tacky interaction between characters rivals the interactions between the two Disney chipmunks, but I suppose Jennifer Lopez makes it up with her aesthetically pleasing body. However, if you can get through the dialog, or the lack there of, you will be fine. The visual effects give this movie its true power. Otherwise, it would be a pathetic attempt at renewing an already exhausted genre of serial killer movies like Copycat or Seven. I would recommend this movie to everyone, even if you are turned off by the `psy-horror' films. It is certainly worth the outrageous price of $6.75; all the same, if you are low on cash, it would be just as good as a renter.just not as terrifyingly real as it was in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before renting this movie last month, I had no respect whatsoever for Jennifer Lopez as an actress. Now I can confidently say I do, she is wonderful with stirring emotions that seem realistic on-screen. Though a singer more so full-time than an actress, I almost wish she'd focus on getting roles. Vince Vaughn was incredible in this movie, simply because I had never heard of nor seen him before, made watching him even more enjoyable. He's also very flexible when it comes to being someone you're not.The story line was a bit unstable, I almost knew what was going to happen, but aside from that, it was a great movie and I recommend it to anyone that can appreciate the bold and bizarre visuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaah, this took me back to the seventies... trippy visuals, psychedelic landscapes, style over substance, sadly also rather wooden acting, unconvincing dialogue and emotionless direction.This was actually very enjoyable; there's a solid serial killer plot, beautiful art direction, and a very good performance by Vincent D'Onofrio in various guises. It's well put together, reasonably gripping, and even made me squirm.There is nothing original here - the standard theme of finding the victim before suffocation has appeared in various films and TV episodes, usually involving coercion of the kidnaper. Go back to 1971 and Dirty Harry for an example. Entering someone's dreams has also been done, although admittedly rarely as well as this (Dreamscape, Freddy Krueger series).Although very pretty, the movie does ultimately come across as a pop video. Great visuals, good enough for a second viewing, with lovely set pieces. However, it doesn't haunt you. The concepts don't stay with you as they did with "Videodrome" or "Altered States", and while suspension of disbelief is important in cinema, a little effort to explain HOW J-Lo was getting into the imagination of another character would have helped. Telepathy? Drugs? Virtual reality? Good but not great. Still, its an fun combination of modern serial killer thriller and hallucinatory cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) who is desperately urged by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. What Novak wants in return from Deane is whereabouts of Stargher's latest victim is and if she's alive. Once Deane gets into Stargher's mind, which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of David Lynch's "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and Wes Craven's "A Nightmare on Elm Street", the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from Carl as a youngster (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the razor claws. I don't want to give away the ending, but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances, Howard Shore's creepy musical score and directing (by Tarsem, who shows here that he can direct).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell is weak on plot, filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well. but none of this matters, for, director tarsem singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer, bringing the audience some shocking, pleasing, breath-taking and mind blowing images.the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come. this movie is a perfect case for the "suspension of disbelief" theory. forget the silly plot, just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images. and J.Lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. the cinematography is harrowing, the music haunting &amp; the costumes just stunning. the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art. its just that the medium is not canvas anymore, it is the big-screen and celluloid. one of the most refreshing movies of this decade. The Cell is a must watch. A bold new step in movie making.an enthralling 8!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most visually stimulating movies ever made. **** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)"Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."--Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "The Cell" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons some people dislike this production. With a story that combines disturbing serial killers with mind-probing, "The Cell" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the year's most engrossing films.Making his feature film screenwriting debut, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich, colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers take advantage of every shot. Protosevich conceived ideas for "The Cell" in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his major interests, mind-probing and serial killers. He was reportedly influenced by such directors as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such an imagination.The film combines two major narratives, one about scientific exploration of the human mind, and the other about a psychopath who murders young women for his own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a child therapist, is part of a neurological study at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of her empathetic personality, scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preteen in hopes to revive his brain into waking.A sick, demented serial killer roams the streets. Within an abandoned rural farmhouse, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time they draw near, until now. A violent seizure renders him comatose. The FBI captures his forever unconscious body. Unfortunately, he already prepared the cell with his latest victim. In forty hours, the cell will fill with water, and Stargher is the only man who knows the location of his victim.The FBI takes this situation to Campbell Center, where Catherine enters the mind of Stargher, hoping to discover the location of his latest victim before the cell fills with water, sending the woman to a watery grave.The science fiction portions of the story relied on both real science and theoretical fiction in the creation of the Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System. The premise takes a long time to develop, but it is worth the wait. It is far fetched, but that doesn't matter. The film makes us believe. Even if you don't suspend disbelief, however, the visual enticement provides an engaging setting to enjoy.According to the film's production notes, Mark Protosevich was thrilled to work with the director, named Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, stunning art direction, and highly developed abilities to tell a story. "When I wrote 'The Cell'," explains Protosevich, "I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of painter's paintings or photographs while I was working. So I'm thinking visually, and Tarsem is a highly visual director. Tarsem has a similar frame of visual references which made for a very smooth collaboration."Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a backbone, and no actor could have accomplished his character any better. He delivers a mysterious, disturbing, and engaging performance. "I think that my character is, in a way, trapped in himself," D'Onofrio ponders. He also researched the psychology of serial killers to help get him beneath the surface of the character. His in-depth performance preparation pays off beautifully.While the actors, writer, and director do wonders with their material, the real honor goes to the film's behind-the-scenes talent. The director of photography Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of "The Cell" to life. It's is an extraordinary world worthy of several viewings. Some movies you watch, others you experience. "The Cell" falls into the later category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I would say it's an excellent movie, but it's not. At times I was amazed by what I was seeing, but at times I was tempted to fast-forward it a bit. The acting was uneven, Vincent D'Onofrio was amazing, (I hate to say this, but..) Jennifer Lopez was good, the only guy I have a problem with is Vince Vaughn. He's not as bad as Keanu Reeves, but he gave off the same vibe to me. The only scene he got down okay was the explaining why he's an FBI agent. But I don't know if it was the lighting or what, but his upper lip looked weird during that whole scene, I half expected to see GOT MILK? superimposed on the picture. But this movie basically about two things - showing you what's inside a killer's mind, and showing you why he does what he does (only a part of the reason though). I have to say I felt for the killer's childhood version, and yet I hated what he really was. This film makes me doubt, and think, and that's good. But, as I said, the fast-forward was sometimes needed. Jennifer Lopez's character didn't really need to be showcased that much, the movie takes too long to get into gear. But when it does get into gear, you'll be blown away. The grotesqueness of the images is incredible sometimes, or sometimes just so surreal I felt like I was inside a Dali painting. Which swiftly turned into a Giger one, and something jumped out from the woodwork. One thing that I didn't like - the first FX sequence, when the catatonic kid's face morphs into a gremlin... and later the freak-seal thing. I can't stand directors jumping at me with things that are going to make me jump. That's a cheap-ish trick. But it succeeded in keeping me on the edge of my seat, turning down the volume at places for fear of jumping again. But to make up for it, there's wonderful shots as well... The best waking world/dream world transition ever, creases in a blanket turning into sand dunes; the purple cape sequence; the camera doing an impossible-seeming 180 degree vertical pan over a baptizing scene, the horse scene; etc. All in all, I would recommend this film. But it's not for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie for the first time I was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant vibrance of the story. It is a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting, not to mention a very excellent job in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez has pulled herself out of past roles that dug into her career with this movie, portraying a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to enter the minds of comatose patients to treat them. Vincent D'onofrio played amazingly well. His portrayal of a sadist serial killer was perfect to a T. The sheer emotion conveyed by his performance is astounding. Vince Vaughn isn't my favorite, but still performed exceptionally well. The symbolism and artistry was intriguing and titillating, sometimes surprising, and other times shocking. Overall, I say this is a wonderful movie, with excellent acting and beautiful artwork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched. The film's script can be clunky at times, as can the acting, but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life. The Oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful, while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed. Tarsem Singh who has also directed music videos, goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well. He has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. Overall, The Cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great, pleasurable watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which I think is - for a big budget movie - quite exceptional and daring.I just wanted to remark that I am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children. In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time. But, of course, it is likely that there are much more different cuts.The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes which sounds quite complete).Later on DVD and Video, the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable director's cut (in Germany, there is already such a version around, running approx. 110 minutes).It would be nice, if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavourable rating, so that I as a viewer don't have to feel cheated and am taken seriously, not only as a resource of money.</fullReview>

This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.' Definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape. It won't be half as good on tape.This movie is not for the easily freaked out. It will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget.

Bunuels "Un chien andalou" comes to my mind- a film without story, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is at first a Hollywood-Movie, and only second a piece of art. I'm very interested in Tarsem's next project. Hamlet on Indian could be very interesting, especially when it has the same looks as THE CELL.For film music enthusiasts: Howard Shore's score for THE CELL is absolutely marvelous, but a hard listening experience, because of its very modernistic style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good attempt at surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a number of the people making comments here, even positive comments, weren't paying close attention. Jennifer Lopez's character, for instance, was not a child psychologist -- she was a social worker. The scientists were the others on the team, but it was made pretty clear that she was something with a particular gift and no advanced degrees.That being said, it also appears that some people have pretty specific expectations before they even watch a film. "Not scary" "Not even character development" Well, doh. The film has a decent enough plot, with the single twist that the sadistic villain is caught quickly and definitely, and it's only the fate of his final victim that is at issue. It seemed to me that the point of the film was an opportunity to explore surrealism and I think the director and crew did a fine job. Lopez isn't much of an actress, but she does have an iconic beauty that works very well as another part of the imagery. A lot of the visuals are highly creative and transitions within the psycho's brain are really well done.No, it wasn't Silence of the Lambs, but it wasn't intended to be. Let the film stand on its own, which I think it does very well.--Jeff Frane</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell is a good phychological thriller. Yeah the script isn't the greatest and the story isn't that good, but it's original, fasinating, and visually stunning. It balances showing dark images in the killers mind, with terrible scenes of the killer's past. This movie certainly doesn't excuse murder, but it gives us more of an understanding of a killer's evil ways. The best part of this movie is it's visually stunning and original scenes inside the mind of a cerial killer. I wish there was less of everything outside the killer's mind and more inside in this movie, but what it has definetly in my mind serves up a decent flick.This movie is not for everyone. Some people will be turned off but some of it's suprisingly disturbing scenes, others won't like it because they have a lack of apreciation for originality as I noticed in many of the reviews. I recomend it though and give it a solid 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

I usually like Vince Vaughn and could tolerate Lopez who while attractive, in my opinion just doesn't belong in movies.

		<shortDescription>Astonishing cinema; may be too far ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, has quite handily established himself with his first feature, which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinema.The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a film. As a thriller, it rises above most of its peers, with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere. However, it is ultimately Tarsem's skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the film's jolting sense of terror.As with several recent films, I have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively about The Cell; in defence of the film, I will address a few of these issues. The plot appears to be the main concern, and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from The Silence of the Lambs, it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film; the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision--simultaneously horrifying and wondrous--is presented to the audience, much in the same way that the plot of The Silence of the Lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters, Lecter and Starling. While The Silence of the Lambs is clearly the superior film, it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of The Cell, and in the same breath, praise that of The Silence of the Lambs.My final concern is the mention of "MTV style" directing. It pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques. A camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events; angles, pans, colour adjustment, and so forth, are all used to their full extent in The Cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dream-like state that could not have been otherwise achieved. This is essential to the film, as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killer's subconscious. If you simply want a series of static shots, stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether.That being said, The Cell is thoroughly entertaining, terrifying, and breathtaking in both its pacing and design. Anyone who is able to look past the--perhaps uninspired, yet never dull--screenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bizarre is the only word that can describe this movie. That isn't to say that it was bad. The point, I'm sure, is that descending into the mind of a serial killer would be expected to be bizarre. So, in that respect because the movie is bizarre, it's to be admired as a success.The action is set in the context of a race against time. The killer (played by Vince D'Onofrio) had kidnapped one last victim, but then due to illness was found lapsed into a coma. The police have to find the victim before she dies in a contraption set up to drown her in 40 hours (just as an aside, I have to confess that this kind of reminded me of the old "Batman" TV series; I always used to wonder why the Joker didn't just shoot Batman instead of trying to turn him into a giant milkshake or whatever. But I digress.) Their only hope is to use a device that would allow a psychologist (psychiatrist? social worker? just plain cutie that we can feel protective of? I was never entirely sure on that) to enter the killer's mind and establish communication with him. This role is played by Jennifer Lopez in what has to be one of the more bizarre - there's that word again - casting decisions ever made. There's nothing about Lopez that I can take seriously in this role. My wife said it best: "does that look like how a professional engaged in serious work would dress?" (and this was a "real-life scene", and not while she was in the killer's mind!)I say it all again: this is BIZARRE! But at the same time, if you can get past Lopez's non-performance, it's good fun, while at the same time totally unbelievable. I can give it a 6/10, and it probably would have been a bit higher if they had found someone more credible than Lopez to play the starring role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J-Lo Should Have Stayed "On the Six"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of "The Cell" held a lot of promise. A journey inside the mind of a serial killer to find out in time where he has hidden a kidnaped girl who is in imminent danger of death. What we get is a thinly disguised plot similar to that of "Silence of the Lambs" (1991) mixed in with a dose of "The Fantastic Voyage" (1966).  Jennifer Lopez, in her first film in two years, plays the psychologist who enters the mind of serial killer Vincent D'Onofino while FBI agent Vince Vaughn looks on. Lopez, who I assume chose this role in an attempt to play against type, looks sleepy and lost in the part of the psychologist. Vaughn is wooden as the FBI agent and D'Onofino was not at all frightening as the killer. The special effects and costumes though dazzling, would be better suited to one of Director Tarsen Singh's rock videos. And let's face it, Jennifer Lopez is no Jodie Foster (Silence of the Lambs) as an actress, though she does compare favorably with Raquel Welch (The Fantastic Voyage).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I heard, but not very good either -- spoilers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The advance word on this movie was that you could hear the giant sucking sound for miles, and so I skipped this one in the theaters. Too bad -- and I should really know better -- because it would have been nice to see some of the visual effects done on a large screen.That was the best part of the film; the visual presentation, the vivid colors, the disturbing montages. The director has an eye for the art of filmmaking, and you can expect to see more from him in the future. However, I would encourage him on his next venture to find a better script and spend some time getting actors who can make us believe.The story, as has been commented previously, "borrows" heavily from Silence of the Lambs and somewhat less so from The Matrix. In science fiction, you have to be prepared to accept at least one improbable construct. In this film, that would be the mind-meld machine that Jennifer Lopez uses to connect to comatose patients. However, we're also supposed to accept that Vincent D'Onofrio's psychopath can afford to engineer, build, and maintain a drowning cell, bleach bath, permanent hooks all over his body and the automated hoist that they use to suspend him, etc etc etc. The super-villain is a plausible concept if you establish the particulars: fabulously wealthy, incredibly intelligent, something along those lines. D'Onofrio's character has none of those resources to call on.D'Onofrio, by the way, gives the best performance of the film, but it's that kind of role. Lopez and Vaughan seem to be sleepwalking (pun intended) through theirs. Especially Lopez; she's about as convincing as Madonna, or slightly better than Sofia Coppola in Godfather 3. The script doesn't help; there's precious little character development for anyone except D'Onofrio, and Vaughan alludes to some abuse in his background, which you expect to be revealed when he injects himself into the mind-meld process, but it is never mentioned again. His haunted look is way over the top (I kept wishing someone would give him a Tylenol 3 and a cot). There's a quick mention of Lopez having a brother who died in a coma, but it's buried under music and even with headphones I couldn't understand what exactly was said.--spoiler--And while the dream sequences were visually stunning, they didn't seem to make much sense. Why are all dreams made out to be Salvador Dali-esque flights of fancy? I could understand that when we were in the killer's twisted mind, but why is there no difference between there and Lopez's mind, or the comatose child in the beginning? Also, the religious imagery (Lopez as the Madonna -- is that real-life wish-fulfillment for her musical career?) towards the end is just silly. It gets patently objectionable when she finishes off child-Carl. Not to mention that we are once again given the all-too familiar powerless, trapped victim, not once but twice (through video replay), who can do nothing much but simper and scream. Ugh.It's worth a look, just for the artwork and the grandeur of the first couple of scenes within Carl's mind. I would hesitate to expect much more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cell is a film that brings to the screen fantastical portrayals of its characters' subconscious minds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell initially focuses on child psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) whose work with Dr. Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and scientist Henry West (Dylan Baker) involves using a brain-mapping device and a psychotropic drug, which allow her to enter the mind of another person and experience his or her thoughts and fantasies. Catherine uses this revolutionary method to enter a comatose child's mind in an attempt to bring him back to conscious life. Unfortunately, the therapy is not free of risk: wandering through another's subconscious worlds may alter the visitor's own perception of what is real and what is fantasy and consequently, jeopardize his or her sanity. When FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn: Psycho) tracks down serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio: Men in Black, Full Metal Jacket), who is found in his home in an unconscious state, Peter convinces Catherine to use the risky therapy on Carl and try to extract key information that would lead to Carl's last victim, a young woman who is still alive but trapped inside The Cell.The Cell tries to create a suspenseful story around a cop's efforts to capture the murderer and to save the next victim, and establishes the psychologist's interest in understanding the criminal's motives and in forgiving his actions. (In one scene that depicts a fantasy world, Catherine is portrayed in a way that resembles a Virgin Mary, reaching out to forgive/save Carl-the-child.) In spite of this intriguing premise, The Cell benefits most from the magnificent visualizations of Carl's subconscious fantasy world. When Catherine enters Carl's mind, she witnesses the freakish nature of his obsession to dehumanize his victims (which he turns into dolls), as well as the extravagant and depraved kingdom that he has built around his corrupted ego. Also, The Cell includes a series of tableaux that depict captivating surrealist landscapes and spectacular imagery depicting the fantasy worlds. These visualizations reflect the work of renowned production designer Tom Foden (famous for Janet and Michael Jackson's "Scream" and Madonna's "Bedtime Stories" music videos.) Furthermore, the impressive costume designs of Eiko Ishioka (Bram Stoker's Dracula) accurately complement the settings.Unfortunately, in spite of the film's ambition to take the horror genre into unexplored venues, The Cell fails to fully integrate the visual representations of the antagonist's monstrous mind with the main narrative line. Thus, in spite of their own magnificence, the bold visualizations alienate rather than seduce the viewer. All in all, The Cell seems to squander its rich, visual artistry along the barren paths of its plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general I avoid really violent movies. But this one looked so visually interesting from the previews that I thought I would try it. I told my partner that I would start it with him, and most likely walk out soon and go to the bookstore where he could find me when it was over.But I stayed through the whole thing. And I liked it a lot. The grossness and violence did not affect me like I expected. Maybe that was a bad thing??? It was dream violence, in parts it was almost "cartoon" violence (Ren and Stimpy style - the intestine thing). The movie was so stylized and surreal that I enjoyed just looking at everything and going for the ride, even though the plot sucked, the characters were shallow, and the acting was mostly sub-par.Actually, maybe it was because the acting was so bad and the characters so under-developed that the violence didn't bother me. I didn't really care. Overall, another movie for those of us who enjoy the sensual (I do not mean beautiful) over the mental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I was looking forward to seeing The Cell. It had an intriguing premise and the trailer looked promising. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. The Cell has great visuals and little else. While its premise is original, the plot itself is by the book. The script lends little depth to the characters, so the actors cannot really be blamed if they do not give their best performances. Over all, I would say that one should only see The Cell if one is really into photography and great images. If you want a good movie, go elsewhere.</fullReview>

People can't say that you should stick to roles you're good at and then criticize you for choosing "teeny-bopper" roles. How is an actress going to progress without trying new things? I thought she did a wonderful job in this role. The younger actor also did a great job and I can't say enough about Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.

		<shortDescription>A different experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly one of the most different movies I´ve seen this year, well during the whole new millennium actually! Musicvideo-director Tarsem Singh brings us a film which isn´t like anything else, although I wish they had given him a better script to work with.Psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) have discovered a way to enter a persons mind with the help of supermodern technology. She does this to be able to help a little boy who´s in coma. This technique is soon shown to be very helpful for the FBI, led by the serial killer expert Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn). They have managed to catch one of the worst killers ever, Carl Stargher (Vincent D´Onofrio, in a terrific performance!) Unfortunately, Stargher is in a coma and soon his latest victim will meet a terrible death if the FBI doesn´t find her in time. So Catherine has to enter the killer´s mind, to discover his secrets. It will not be a safe trip, though. Tarsem Singh´s debut looks fantastic, I haven´t seen a movie looking this good in a long time. But even if the script allows him to create as strange and stylish environments as possible, the weak script is also The Cell´s downfall. It is simply not interesting enough to follow the FBI:s search for the girl back in the real world, because it feels like you are watching a simple TV-thriller or something. And in the end, Catherine´s journey just becomes too much. But the actors do fine performances, Jennifer Lopez proves that she can act and that she´s not just a pretty face, and Vincent D´Onofrio is very scary as one of the creepiest villains in moviehistory. It is just Vince Vaughn who seems a bit miscast, but he´s OK. Despite the sometimes confusing script, this is still pretty enjoyable, if you can handle all the violence and gore, that is. The movie has some interesting references, for example when Vaughn´s agent says that he believes that a kid who´s been sexually abused and such still can grow up and be a normal person, and not a psycho. It made me think a bit. It´s also fascinating to see, in the end, that many of the events hang together and actually makes sense. * * * ? out of * * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like to watch movies because they are pretty, you should be okay with this one. If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie, skip it. At the end of the movie i still didn't know why Stargher killed the women the way he did. When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the best, but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn's character but didn't explain, didn't really say why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem, etc. If the rest of the story is compelling, I don't care about details like how Stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the FBI wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work, but I do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. This is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-Century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body. The inside-the-mind sequences are well realised and often pretty stunning, all the leads perform adequately, the gruesomeness is to the max if you like that kind of thing, but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me, as I had expected something completely new and unlike anything ever done before, not this fairly successful blending of serial-killer and special-effect-horror genre staples. Sometimes horrifying, often pretty, a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people, but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been marketed as.</fullReview>

Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious. The baptizing of the child Carl was a psychologically too underlined way to embark the motive which Carl 'worked' under. And so on..Anyway, the movie had great way of showing where Singh comes from.

As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.

		<shortDescription>Stunning surrealist art in a film, and a story too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film 8/10 overall. Visually, a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning: an art director's dream mix of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe--and a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form. Beautiful use of color, form, imagery, environment--and fabulous set decoration, combine with state-of-the-art computer graphics. So, 10/10 for that! Wow!The plot line is, well, more predictable. You know they'll save the girl and get the killer in the end, but the story is still interesting and pacy enough to pull you in and keep you there. 6/10 for that.Squirm factor...I won't give this a rating, but the film certainly made me squirm, and I was watching it on video on a tv screen. It would, of course, have a great deal more impact on a big screen. Graphic violence of a twisted, erotic nature in a surreal landscape--even if beautiful--is highly unpredictable. The world inside the killer's head is not--thank goodness!--my world. Because I watched this film on video, I was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when I wasn't so nervous about where the scene might be going, and I suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time, just for the "visual art".General suggestion: don't take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one, but if you're keen on the visual look of films, like surrealist art, don't mind a bit of kinky gore, and just want to take a bit of a "mind trip", this one's a winner. Oh, and if you're keen on babes, Jennifer Lopez is pretty hot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Ebert sometimes says about flops: "I don't want to review it. I want to flunk it." That's what I thought of after watching "The Cell", a wretched attempt at science fiction that fails miserably.Jennifer Lopez turns in yet another awful performance as a psychotherapist (if you believe her as that, then I've got a bridge I want to sell you)who journeys into people's minds to figure out what makes them tick. She is then assigned a serial killer in order to find his next victim.The movie's highly touted special effects amount to nothing more than a freakshow. They don't advance the story; they just drag it out to horrible lengths. And they just don't look very good. When they stink, there goes your movie.This film was directed by Tarsem, an MTV music video director. God, how I am sick of these people thinking they can make films. Between McG (who helmed the god-awful Charlie's Angels) and Demian Lichtenstein (who helmed the even worse "Thirty Miles to Graceland"), there seems to be a pile up of awful films and proves that what you can create in 3 minutes cannot translate to 2 hours.

		<fullReview>The Cell(2000) is another by the numbers generic Hollywood serial killer flick with excellent visual and little else. The visuals alone makes the film at least average. Style over substance in a extremely bland and disinteresting way. When Dario Argento or Mario Bava used style over substance it was done with creative and soul searching imagination. They were good at creating style that was unique, colorful, and severely flamboyant.Jennifer Lopez is beautiful to look at but unfortunately for the film does not provide a character that is spilling with human depth. Another knockoff of Silence of the Lambs(1991) which doesn't have a clue about what made that film interesting to see. The Cell rips off the basic premise from a much better film in Dreamscape(1983). The scenes of violence are brutal but boring. Vincent D'Onofrio overplays his role as the tormented serial killer.Many of the so called disturbing sequences are bland to the point where they would put the Marquis de Sade to sleep if he were alive. Besides ripping off Dreamscape(1983), The Cell(2000) also rips off A Nightmare on Elm Street(1984), Hellraiser 2(1988), and Silence of the Lambs(1991). The direction by tarsem Singh is lifeless and dull. Every serial killer movie is the same plot with the lone cop playing a game of cat and mouse with a brilliant but crazed killer. The best serial killer film is Henry:Portait of a Serial Killer(1986) because that film does not sugar coat the actions the murderer nor does it involve an FBI agent or Police Officer who is searching for the Serial killer.</fullReview>

However, I was pleasantly surprised that there was in fact more substance to this story than other reviewers have led me to believe. There _is_ an interesting premise in this film and even though there is no real depth here, The Cell is certainly no worse in the "substance-department" than other American serial killer thrillers. The story isn't exactly brilliant, but it was more than enough to keep me interested in the characters and the plot through the whole film.The visuals are, of course, dazzling in this movie. It's impressing to say the least. Some scenes look more like paintings than scenes in a movie. This also makes the film very fascinating.The acting... Well, Jennifer Lopez is in it and she's not a very talented actress. She's okay, I guess, but I would have wanted another actress to play Catherine. Vince Vaughn is okay, but Vincent D'Onofrio once again delivers a great performance. He was brilliant in films like Full Metal Jacket and The Whole Wide World and he is brilliant in this film as well. (7/10)</fullReview>

What really bugs me are all of the people paying it out, complaining about the "bad acting" and how stupid we (being the general 'uneducated' public) all are for making movies like this successful at the box office...Get over it! As with every movie, some are going to find this to their liking and others are not. If you're like me, an 'every-movie' person who just wants to be entertained for an hour or so and don't require actors putting in Oscar-worthy performances in all of your movies, you will probably enjoy it...that's not to say that the acting in this movie bites, either.The photography is amazing (very similar to the popular music video-clip style), as are the Spesh-FX and costume design..it's all very stylistic (which I like). Someone pointed out that the movie sort of crawls for the first 45 minutes before getting to the interesting (read: eye candy) stuff, and I find myself agreeing...but it's worth the ride. The story itself is quite interesting and managed to keep me hooked for most of it.The movie does contain some disturbing material but I have seen worse..as such The Cell is not one for the kiddies. Remember! Not every movie is gonna be Oscar-nomination material and that's not necessarily a bad thing...The Cell is worth a rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually arresting, but that's about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rented the DVD last night. The film is visually arresting in the "psyche" sequences. Underneath all of the sensory impact however is the implied message that evil is created by circumstances in one's past. Controversial stuff for the society we live in today. Unfortunately, most of the acting talent is wasted because character development is nil. Wonderful actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste ("Secrets &amp; Lies") is especially under-used as Doctor #2---of it she #3???As an aside, I couldn't help thinking about "Psycho": how it was so revolutionary, how it spawned a whole genre of movies (including the Cell), and how it affected such horror with so little gore. Have we come to the decadence of the genre when a movie like "The Cell" is merely a montage of images designed to shock-- no matter how beautifully contrived it is or no matter how little plot there really exists within it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mental in a awesome Special FX kinda-way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Lopez sizzles in this awesome sci-fi thriller about a child psychologist that must enter the mind of a serial killer in order to find his latest dying victim.Lopez is great in this very strange flick about dreams, and Vincent D'Onofrio is also really good (a tad freakish-looking, but that's his character, so we can overlook that) and the scenery and sets are amazing.If you don't know already, Jennifer Lopez plays Catherine, a child psychologist who can enter their minds and appear in their dreams. But now she must enter the mind of a psycho, who's latest victim's life is hanging in the balance.However, Catherine gets lost in his mind, and can't figure out what's real and what's not, while time closes in on the girl.This movie, I found was quite a bit like 'The Silence of the Lambs', - and that's okay by me, it has thriller, horror and spine-tingling special FX elements that mesh well together to create a surreal motion picture that'll leave you breathless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>* Huge Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest disappointments of the year: what promised to be a fiercely imaginative thriller is a tepid serial killer yarn that badly imitates the mechanics of every other serial killer film and tries to spice it up with eye-popping graphics. Jennifer Lopez plays the child psychologist who has been engineering a new technology that allows her to enter the mind of comatose children to understand their illness. She has to enter the mind of a comatose serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) when he is apprehended without revealing the whereabouts of his latest victim. True, the graphics are impressive and Eiko Ishioka's costume designs are fantastic, but all the head trip scenes are rooted in so little that they are rendered completely useless, plus the forty-five minutes of waiting for the money shots to start are excruciatingly boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell is heavy on eye-candy and sorely lacking on plot or character development of any kind. If you can believe this, I didn't even pick up on the names of the three main characters by the end of the movie. The serial killer plot line is a sad aping of The Silence of the Lambs, and Jennifer Lopez is highly UNconvincing as a therapist. As she spouts info about different neurological conditions, her underlying Bronx accent brought the suspension-of-disbelief factor down to zero. Vince Vaughn was fairly awful as well, although there was nothing achingly good or bad about his performance. Most of the actors just went through the motions, and it shows, if you know anything about truly good acting.It's obvious that the "plot" was thrown together by a random Hollywood hack in a sorry attempt to support the director's true focus; displaying his twisted and ugly visual art. Scarred bodies with broken doll faces, disembowled ponies, and a bizarre universe not unlike Wonderland. A twisted and evil Wonderland. The visual effects are first rate, but they should add to the movie, rather than be the only worthwhile part of it.It's sad that now-a-days, when a movie doesn't make any sense, it is considered deep, and when there are a lot of flashy visual effects, people are lulled into thinking they are watching an "artistic" film. I suppose if you are a fan of movies with bad acting and zero plot, you will love this as Roger Ebert did. It's obvious why he has the least credibility of any critic around today..Also: If you get dizzy easily, I recommend you skip this one. The director seems to have thought it was necessary to spend many scenes gyrating around the action, going upside down, all around, etc. I experienced some unpleasant motion sickness.</fullReview>

Vince Vaughn is ok...but nothing special. The little boy from 'Lizzie McGure'...I think his name is Jake Thomas...did a pretty good job. Even though he only got about 3 or 4 words throughout the whole movie. The emotion on his face replaced the words.Even though some of the actors are decent, the movie is seriously lacking. Nothing in the movie came together to make sense. There was also no character development. The only character that we really got to know was the serial killer. And I have to say that special effects do not qualify as acting. And in this movie the star was the F/X.</fullReview>

The instinct to help the children, the victim and her courage to fight the demon, very brave. She is well directed and performed impressively. Each acts in this movie are done with details. We can see the sadism in a real world and the sadism in a dream one. Both are performed with a different taste but same theme, sadistic.

The premise is that they have to find out were the killers last victim is, and while it´s not a bad idea, it´s a bit too simplistic and does not hold up on its own, it just doesn´t have enough mystery, and it could have been complemented with some other, deeper enigma.

		<shortDescription>The most underrated movie of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend Michael has a nickname for this: "Silence of the Matrix."I, of course, disagree with him. "The Cell" is a visionary masterpiece in every sense of the word. I have always had a special fetish with movies about the mentally disturbed, but rather than rip off from Travis Bickle or Hannibal Lecter, Protosevich (the writer) has created a unique and, oddly, sympathetic monster out of this. Carl Stargher is an animal and a slave to his impulses, but also to his past.Through a series of very strange journeys into Stargher's bizarre, sadomasochistic personality, we see the abuse he went through as a child and we empathize with him. He hates the purity of the women around him and seeks to take it away, but at the same time cannot seem to so much as touch it, so he takes their lives instead. His entire attitude towards the world is based around the frustration of being unable to change what mocks him by being perfect while he sees himself as despicably flawed. Freud would have a field day with this.The other characters aren't as well-defined, but they're adequate. Vince Vaughn gives a credible performance, at least. Jennifer Lopez is, I'm afraid (to quote DigitalBits) a "blank page." She, along with Bruce Willis in "Unbreakable," gave the most hilariously underracted performance in a good movie of 2000. Her emotional range runs the gamut from "I'm very concerned about what's going on," to "I'm extra-worried about this," with the occasional "Huh?" expression plastered on her refined, admittedly beautiful features. It isn't painful, though; just not up to par with the film.I shouldn't complain too much about her, because this is Tarsem's movie. Unlike other major offerings from former music video directors (such as Dominic Sena's hideous "Gone in 60 Seconds"), the visual style of the jaw-dropping effects and sets, combined with a score that compliments each new scene almost to perfection gives it a very satisfying feel. Is it style over substance? Yes, and that style is absolutely incredible.8 out of 10 for "The Cell," one of 2000's lost treasures. It's no "Almost Famous" or "American Psycho" for sure, but it will forever remain a welcome addition to my DVD library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Cell" - The subject matter is controversial and challenging. You can say it's a sci-fi techno crime plus psychoanalysis movie. That's quite ambitious already.Yes, it's scary, has its share of guts and blood, but it has more substance. A tight plotline, dramatic tension, cinematically challenging. It's a successful bold debut from director Tarsem Singh.A stylized piece it is. Visually stunning, creatively bold, imaginative imageries abound. If you appreciate theatrical art, graphical presentations, and studies of the mind and psyche, and not afraid to tread unknown territories, the dream sequences are definitely for you.It's beyond your regular Hollywood crime suspense thriller, nor does it pretend to be a glamorous sci-fi techno movie. Tarsem Singh has given us more than our money's worth. He was able to amass all the ambitious elements and integrally presented to us "The Cell."Visionary exploration of mind-control therapy was demonstrated. It's exciting being led to such frontiers of medical science of what's seemingly possible, immediate future or not. The subject of child abuse was alluded to, certainly not superficially. Music application is also unconventionally bold: Middle Eastern sounds and instruments complement and enhance the film's exciting energy.Jennifer Lopez in her dream sequence costumes is simply too beautiful to behold. The brilliant Japanese woman designer Aiko Ishioka has a hand in this is indisputable.Vincent D'Onofrio, once again, demonstrated he's not afraid to take on out-of-the-ordinary roles, both psychologically and physically challenging. (If you'd like to take a break from all this, try "The Whole Wide World" 1996, directed by Dan Ireland; D'Onofrio with Renee Zellweger in a heartwarming film based on a true life story of a timeless friendship.)Vince Vaughn is the central FBI agent on the case encountering help from Lopez, along with Dylan Baker, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Pruitt Taylor-Vince in supportive roles. (If you'd like to see more of Vince Vaughn, he has a substantial role in "Return to Paradise" 1998, directed by Joseph Reuben. It's a thought provoking "hard medicine" film due to the moral dilemma prompted by the story; Joaquin Phoenix and Anne Heche also gave worthwhile performances.)"The Cell" is truly an ambitious project. Singh also has to work with a child actor in this film for the dream sequences. He is undaunted, and what a quality result he delivered. Applause to Tarsem Singh and the production effort of this film! Thank you New Line Cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first: yes, I enjoyed The Cell immensely. Every element worked well and you will definitely be riveted to the screen for the entire length of the film. HOWEVER, here's where I need to try to get you guys (like Ebert) who thought this was the most original thing they've seen in ages.The plot? Basically a cross between Manhunter and Silence Of The Lambs. The visuals? Basically an extended version of Madonna's music video "Bedtime Stories." Also, any Terry Gilliam film has done this, and the visions of Hell in What Dreams May Come came pretty close too. And the bodies hanging by wires, say, remember a film from 1978 called Coma? The idea of going into a person's mind was done on one of those sindicated sci-fi series too... Now I'll admit you combine these elements of other films and with The Cell you have a good film in itself. It is a film to recommend, and be a part of your collection. Just remember that this film is an homage to other films and not exceptionally original on its own standing.So, with that in mind, ENJOY! I did, and was satisfied after it was over and left with a smile on my face. I think of it as a tribute film in a way, taking nods to other great endeavors and to make a very good film from others and pull it off is some task indeed. Good work to those involved in this project. I must admit I was so happy they didn't have Ms. Lopez sing a theme song!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** out of ****I approached The Cell with high expectations. The concept is intriguing, with the exploration of the human mind, more specifically a serial killer's, is a fascinating idea that would most definitely make an interesting film. However, despite some inspired moments and stunning, raw visual imagery, The Cell often remains mostly detained.Catherine Deaner (Jennifer Lopez) is a psychotherapist trying to bring a boy named Edward out of a comatose state in the form of a new procedure. What she does is actually enter his mind and is gradually trying to cure him. Unfortunately, because progress is slow, the boy's father, a billionaire, believes the procedure is useless and wishes for the experiments to come to a halt.At the same time, a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) who drowns his victims, young and attractive women, to death by trapping them inside an enclosed room as the water pours down slowly has just killed his seventh victim. The clues around the body eventually lead the FBI, led by Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) to the killer, a man named Carl Stagher. But when they arrive at his house, they discover him in a catatonic state after a seizure, and there is no sign of the last woman he has kidnapped.Thus, they must resort to using the procedure, and with Catherine's help, must enter his mind and discover where the woman is located and save her before it's too late. However, entering the mind of a serial killer is more than Catherine ever expected, which leads to a twisted and distorted world that she may never escape.For visual imagery, The Cell is at times a masterful film. The sight of a horse being sliced into separate segments is truly a shocking, yet strangely compelling sight. Tarsem Singh shows a lot of promise as a director, and his work here is at times superb. Unfortunately, he's not as successful in creating suspense. At times, I felt detached from the situation on hand. Maybe it's the fact that Lopez's character actually makes 3 trips into D'Onofrio's mind, thus losing the momentum from the previous trip. The film as a whole is hardly seat-squirming boredom, but it's hardly ever heart-pounding.The script is more at fault. The basic storyline is intriguing, but the serial killer story is too reminiscent of Seven and The Silence of the Lambs. Scriptwise, there's hardly anything new here. Even the concept of entering a person's mind has been done before (though, to be fair, it's still done better here than in Being John Malkovich). The dialogue, while not anything bad in a cringing sort of manner, is sometimes uninteresting, which often results in a lack of interest to the events on screen.I can say for sure the lead performances are quite good. Jennifer Lopez is superb as the psychotherapist who wishes to only to help. Vince Vaughn is convincing as the determined FBI agent, and Vincent D'Onofrio is positively chilling. His serial killer Stagher is frightening. It's only unfortunate the character isn't fleshed out in a better movie.This film probably incited more controversy than any other film of 2000, probably even more so than American Psycho. There's an audience that will find The Cell to their tastes, and some who will even find it brilliant, but for me it remains a lukewarm film with sporadic moments of genuinely inspired imagery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Production Design Meets Over-simplified Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a mystery, The Cell fails pretty dismally. As a psychological study, well, it fails pretty dismally. As a study of any of its character, The Cell is embarrassingly simplistic. As a triumph of production design, though, much of what would be unforgivable in another film becomes at least worth watching. As films driven only by art design go, The Cell is miles ahead of What Dreams May Come and miles behind Dark City.In terms of its underlying ideology, The Cell has a "Look Mom, I just read Freud" look about it. Mark Protosevich's script is conceptually interesting, but rarely intelligent. It jumps only to the easiest conclusions and breaks down the psyche with all the skill of a freshman in Psychology 101. Abusive parents, religious trauma, and sexual insecurity are trotted out as backstories for the film's killer as if they add anything new to the genre. What the script does best is present the concept and then avoid overanalyzing it.Catharine Dean (Jennifer Lopez) is a former social worker and child psychologist working on a multimillion dollar project to try to bring a billionaire's son out of a coma. A team of scientists have found a way to put Dean into the deepest recesses of the kid's mind through an unexplained system that seems to involve computers, wires, biosuits, and a lava lamp. Meanwhile a team of FBI agents led by Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is tracking down a killer who turns his victims into dolls using bleach and other yucky stuff. Through the kind of investigative work done only in movies. Two clues lead to a single suspect and in less than ten minutes they're prepare to arrest Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), who the audience already knows is both the killer and a total nutjob. When the feds arrive at his house, though, Stargher's mind has basically imploded, leaving him in a coma, with his most recent victim still unaccounted for. Naturally they take the body to Dean's research team. And naturally with no training involving killers, they send her into his mind to look answers. Why? Apparently because she's the one who fits in the suit. But when she gets too deep in the killer's mind, well, you can be sure they've got a suit in Vince Vaughn's size.Everything that follows is stirred by coincidence and luck, rather than anything within the plot. This happens presumably because none of the characters are developed enough for resolutions to occur organically. Every once in a while there are hints about the main characters, but they're few and far between. Lopez conveys warmth and some determination, but that's her only character. Vaughn has some determination and a limited amount of vulnerability. But neither one is actually a human. As the killer, D'Onofrio gets to wear a variety a super outfits and some odd makeup, but despite all of the explanations for what's wrong with him, his performance is limited by obvious instructions to just look scary. That'll be satisfying for some people. I wanted more.The Cell looks like a fabulous music video. When judging the quality of the film's art direction it's worth noting that no matter whose mind we're in, it never appears to be anything more than elaborate set. Nothing is more than surface (like the plot and characters, actually). Everything is, however, extremely original. From the dream costumes which seem to mix bondage gear with flowing colorful fabrics, to the use of water to make everything glisten, The Cell creates something unique. The fact that this film will be ignored for technical notice at the Academy Awards (just a gut feeling) is something of a crime in a year when films showed a general lack visual of creativity.Still, the film left me completely unsatisfied as is to be somewhat expected when your main villain is in a coma the whole time. For all of the gore and disturbing images, the film has a severe lack of conflict to drive it along. I understand that for some people this film will be a major headtrip, of the best kind. But for me it fell flat. 5/10 flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first real "scary thing" after "The 6th sense".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to see how low this movie was rated. I think people nowdays are just not attracted to artistic film making. I admit that the story-line of the movie is a common place, however, that is not the point. This is an original horror movie, one that I have been missing for years (even though I do not like horrors in general). This movie follows the tradition founded by the greatest horror makers, like Hitchcock or Stephen King. And the photography is just extraordinary! It is like watching a Dali painting. Strange colors and scary figures, theatrical noises, everything is very expressive.Do NOT watch the movie if you think you are smart when you "understand" a movie - but you HAVE TO see it if you usually just "like" movies. You will probably like this if you have liked The 6th Sense or Alien or Fight Club, but do not go see it if you think Independence Day is not the lamest and stupidest movie of all times.I really liked this movie because of the strange, sick dream-world it showed us. But there is one thing you have to know: there isn't anything in this movie (message, story, etc.) except for this. It reminded me of "Bringing Out the Dead". I am very much a visual type of guy, and because of this I enjoyed each minute of The Cell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay ! So it has some style but very little substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not help thinking of the the film Titus-starring Anthony Hopkins, while watching The Cell. Both movies rely heavily on the cinematography, on the visual and special effects, in essence; on betting on the "style" so as to convey their message across. Both convey what many would call absurdist imagery. Both actually show pretty much gore and violence. However it all seems to gel in Shakespear's adaptation of Titus Andronicus, while in the Cell it just seems like to want to shock you forcibly more than anything else. The Cell is in IMHO a decidedly failed attempt. With regard to it's actors they are completely overrun by all the dreamy imagery conveyed. It seems that their performances too, are somewhere out their, lost in dreamland. The plot has little substance and it's really just another cliché ridden serial killer movie. Incidentally in relation to plot, didn't Neil Jordan &amp; Annette Bening do something similar in the film called In Dreams ? According to the DVD extras the director Tarsem Singh is best known for his commercials and I have since also found out, that he also directed the REM videoclip-Losing my Religion, which I am actually particularly fond of. Having said that, I think he should really think about not quitting his day job !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despicable Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read and relied on IMDB reviews in the past and yet this is my very first film where I felt like I should put up a post. Up to now, I have not had anything to add that has not been said by others. But I feel that I must say something about this one.The Cell is the most repulsive thing I have ever seen on the screen. I can't emphasize strongly enough how chock full this picture is with some of the most irresponsibly violent and realistic imagery I have ever seen. Even now, I can't believe I sat through the whole thing. I had a friend over for a movie night in my home theater, and unfortunately that had a lot to do with why I sat through it. It was only after it was over and we were talking about how appalled we felt that we discovered our mutual feelings. We BOTH wanted it to be over long before it ended and we both thought the other somehow wanted to finish it and so we did not say anything. I'll never ignore my gut reaction to films like this again.Parents especially - this is NOT a film for any young person. It's actually not a film for anyone (in my opinion), and is especially dangerous since there will certainly be some people out there in the masses with sick, dangerous personal agendas who will get off in some manner on the pain and slow suffering of pretty, everyday women. The kind who could be our sisters, co workers, lovers or just our friends. The depiction of the torture and slow drowning of the innocent women, no matter how this is framed in some made up story, is unbelievably repulsive and totally unnecessary. I guess there are those who see this as a natural progression from the horror of 'Silence of the Lambs', but I see it as a gross debacle and another shining example of how stupid the rating system is. This film was rated 'R' and most certainly should have been rated NC-17. This director (Tarsem Singh) should go back to making music videos and Jack Valenti should have to sit through this movie over and over until he comes to his senses and goes to Washington to DEMAND that movies like this be branded for what they are, TOTAL SMUT. It's like a snuff film for the MTV generation.I read someone else commenting on the IMDB that everyone who had anything to do with this film should be ashamed and I heartily second that emotion. I can even anticipate the glee in the minds of those of you out there who liked this film. How pleased you are that people like me hated the movie, because it proves that it was somehow good because it pushed my buttons or provoked some extreme emotions. I don't have a problem with extreme emotion. I like to be scared sometimes, to be worried what's going to happen next to someone in a film. But I do have a problem with people who purport to be human beings who could possibly stomach making this imagery and who work so hard to present it so realistically without telling us anything useful in the process. I honestly can't tell you what this film is supposed to tell or teach us. It just existed for it's own sake, to shock and repel any rational human being.The real slap in the face is how this film is marketed. Like some new genre refinement, a cross between 'The Matrix' and 'Silence of the Lambs' with a little Crime Thriller mixed in. Perhaps it could have been if the creators had the decency to move the painful to watch violence to be offscreen instead of right in your face. We know how horribly these women died, can we get on with what else you have to say ? Oh wait - you DON'T have anything else to say! So most of the movie forces you to witness the pain and suffering of innocent people for no good reason.One can only hope that nobody ever takes this 'genre' a step further. Do yourself a favor - go find a DVD of any Alfred Hitchcock film you have not yet seen. You will find yourself feeling infinitely better about the human race when it is over and still get your fix of suspense and thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another studio exec-lowest common denominator film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented the DVD and watched the whole thing and then listened to the Director's track to see what his excuses were. After listening to the Director (Tarsem Singh) and what he had in mind, I wouldn't mind seeing the film he wanted to make (even though he had the lamest script in history to start with). It is apparent to me that this is one of those studio executive directed flicks. My speculation is they picked a first time director and a MTV Goddess (Jennifer Lopez) so that they would have no problems pushing them around - to make that lowest common denominator movie they seem to love. Who can argue, they sucked in at least $70 million plus rentals for a $33 million dollar budget. But with the accumulated talent of this cast and special effects gurus they could have made a *much* better film than this piece of crap.As for those who complain about folks trashing this film - hey, get over it. You are apparently the Studio's target audience, so you will get plenty more where this came from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Has It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is the first great movie of its genre since Se7en. By genre, I mean the serial killer genre, since that is the primary plot line. It would be ignorant to say that this is just a serial killer film however. It is a police drama with detective work and man hunts used to find the killer. It is a suspense film due to its race against time to save a girls life. The Cell's special effects and its futuristic premise are right out of science fiction. Finally, the troubled heroes with dark pasts are elements lifted straight from film noir. The Cell's true success is not in the special effects, acting, or direction, all though these by themselves are brilliant. The Cell's true success is in its combination of several genres to create a movie totally unlike any movie made before it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>multi-faced genre-defying debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loaded with potential, The Cell is an ambitious project by first time director Tarsem Singh that falls a bit short. Jennifer Lopez plays a roamin' around aimlessly in her apartment smokin' pot child psychologist ( in a needlessly gratuitous scene, but hey I'm a guy and it is Jennifer Lopez's ass so I'm not gonna exactly complain per se) involved in an advanced brudgeoning science experiment in which a bunch of electrodes and doowads are connected to two participants, one of which can actually enter the mind of the other. Lopez's experimental techniques are currently the subject of a comatose son of a famed multimillionaire tycoon. The project is still in its early phases and making any sort of psychological process in understanding the child's subconscious (who also suffers from autism) is a painstaking process. Suddenly, Lopez's work is cut short for a day by an FBI unit (headed by Vince Vaughn) in dire need of locating a seemingly doomed victim of a serial killer, who has recently been rendered unconscious himself.The film then divides into two parts at this sequence, the dream world and the real world. Unfortunately, the real world sequence with Agent Vaughn hot on the pursuit is tame, predictable serial killer fodder. The real hidden gem of this movie lies in the tactful, surreal subconscious cinematography of Lopez's journey into the disturbed brain map of the killer (played by Full Metal Jacket's Gomer Pyle; Vincent D'Onfrio- who makes the most of the script he's given.) Taking cues from music video, Singh crafts cinemascapes of horrific splendor and imagination that separate this film from your run of the mill suspense/slasher flick. A great deal of effort was put into making obscene, diseased, and often forgivably nonsensical sensory experience. He has a knack for the twisted and perverted (much like Mark Romanek's reconstructions of Joel Peter-Witkins photography for Nine Inch Nails' `Closer' video.) and has created a Hollywood movie that defies tradition by trying exploring the seldom explored subconscious (the only other successful example I can think of being Being John Malkovich) and for that alone, respect is due. Definitely worth a sitting or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your worst nightmare come true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that `The Cell' is not a pleasant movie would be a gross understatement. It is a twisted and nightmarish examination of the inner workings of the mind of a psychopath. The story is a standard race against time by the police to save the psycho's next victim, which is just an excuse to make a demented mind torquing horror flick.The device for delivering this disturbing fantasy is novel. Technology allows therapist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) to enter the mind of a monster who conveniently goes comatose while his next victim is on autosnuff in a tank that is programmed to fill with water before the movie ends. Her mission is to transport herself into his sick mind and get his confidence so she can find out where the girl is hidden. Once inside, writer Mark Protosevich and former music video director Tarsem Singh (directing his first feature film) have carte blanche to let their imaginations run wild, no longer limited by the mundane forces of the physical world. They pull out all the stops and deliver an ingenious and gruesome adventure that is garishly photographed and deeply disconcerting to the most placid of viewers. Singh gets high marks for his innovative perspectives in bringing the wry dream world to life. He has a very good eye and there are some beautiful shots, especially the desert scenes. Clearly, his music video experience broadened his creative boundaries, which was a plus in shooting a film without any.Jennifer Lopez is a good actress who has let her publicity exploits eclipse her acting ability. She was in this film more for her looks and outrageous sexiness than her acting, though she did a good job considering her role. She gave it her best shot at creating a sympathetic character, but unfortunately, the effort was lost amid the gore and sensationalism. Her love of outlandish garb came in handy in this film. Vincent Donofrio was marvelous as the beast. He appeared convincingly disturbed, and he was imposing as the monster in the dream scenes.This film is more form than substance. The story was weak but the horror was strong. I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the imaginative direction and photography. Horror and Lopez lovers add another 1 or 2 points. This film is very violent and gory and is not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serialkiller goes MTV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has got an optical brilliance that makes him stand in one row with other masterpieces like "Strange Days" or "The Matrix". One of the most excellent scenes is, when Dr. Catherine Deane dives into Carl´s soul for the first time, sees all his victims and meets the psychopath when he was a child. The other positive thing is, that Jennifer Lopez looks good in every take. But compared to real classics like "Silence of the lambs", "Se7en" or "Henry" this movie lacks. The suspense is low and there are no new ideas at all. Jennifer Lopez is untrustworthy as a self-sacrificing psychologist, Vince Vaughn gives a stereotype FBI agent, and Vincent D´Onofrio is a serialkiller that you neither hate nor feel pity with him. Perhaps there are worser movies like this one ("The Bone Collector" for example...), but director Tarsem Singh forgot with all the visual greatness the humaneness and the emotions. At last this is a very cold piece of cinema.</fullReview>

The only disappointment is that it is a little TOO graphic, making it seem like a cheap horror B-movie.

Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) is a serial killer who turns his victims into dolls. Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is a detective look for Carl Strargher. When Strargher is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia, he goes into a coma. Novak needs to figure out where he is keeping his latest victim. He confronts Deane and asks her to go into his mind. She agrees and enters his mind to find the victim."The Cell" is visually stunning, suspenseful and smart. Lopez's acting is very good. She can act scared very well. But, we already knew that because of "Anaconda." D'Onofrio is a very creepy guy. He handles this role well because of his odd looks and creepy motions. "The Cell" is brilliant in it's own odd way. It takes you up and down, right and left, and sideways. The special effects are great. They help the story move right along. The visions are scary, but intriguing. The movie is all around brilliant.</fullReview>

So it would come as no particular surprise then that the FBI would come out of nowhere and demand that Catherine and her crew start work pronto on a crazy man who makes dolls out of his victims. The trick is that they want to find where the next possible victim is before it's too late. With less than forty eight hours to find this victim, odds are that porcelain dolls will have a new exclusive member. Jennifer 's acting is by far the pits, if anyone can whisper more in her movies than she, I would like to hear it. You think after MONEY TRAIN and OUT OF SIGHT she would tune up her voice up just considerably enough so someone in the theater doesn't go, "Huh?" The entering of the mind, when Peter first experiences it, is visually hard on the eyes. But other than this, the movie is boring as heck, reaping more dollars than satisfaction. If you like Jennifer and don't mind seeing her walk around in not so revealing clothes, by all means enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is perfect. I'm not talking about the dialogue, I'm not talking about the acting, I'm not even really talking about the stunning visuals. I'm talking about the amount of discussion it generates. You either love this movie or you hate this movie. I think that's MARVELLOUS. It's like "Fight Club"; plenty of people hated it, plenty of people marvelled at it. Because a movie is capable of creating such dissention among movie fans, I think that ranks it with the best masterpieces of the past like "Dr. Strangelove", "Taxi Driver", and "2001", to name a few.Also, a quick history lesson, which I'm sure many of the more literary readers will already know. Igor Stravinsky composed one of the finest pieces of "modern" music in the early 1900's, "The Rite of Spring" ballet. It is today considered a classic. However, when it premiered in Paris, the audience not only booed...they rioted. They threw rocks at the orchestra and the dancers in hopes they would discontinue; fights broke out, not only in the performance hall, but on the streets outside.People very often fear what they do not understand, and the least of these people react in a very violent manner...either physically OR verbally. Think about that. Then go watch this film again. If you STILL don't like it, more power to you. All I ask is you give it a chance...because mark my words:This film will be remembered long after the curtain has fallen on our lives.(PLEASE respond to this review if you have any thoughts at all; I welcome the opportunity to defend my argument.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, original and useless video clip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Indian American Tarsem Singh is well known in the video clip art world. This well directed film with high impact images is centered in a serial killer who is based in an industrial area with water tanks like aquarium and the victims are left into an empty tub which is filled in up to the final drowning. The problem raises when the last victim is being left in the tub and the serial killer, which meanwhile has been found, became in coma. The only way to save the victim's life is to experiment the recent scientific achievement of entering into the subconscious of the killer to get details of his traumas, solve it and hopefully obtain tools to know where the victim is hidden. The trip scenes from one body to another reminds the well achieved science fiction film "Innerspace" by Joe Dante. Film tries to be deep: dream images with dusty paths, the hiding-place is like a terror museum with puppets, the tub, the vital fluid and the holy water basin tries to explain the origin of the life flashbacking to the killer's infancy. The drowning of the victims is revealed partially in the trauma of the baptism. Some scenes are crude like the one where his body is suspended by chains fixed in the flesh. Images when the psychiatric operator (Jennifer Lopez) is ferried into the killer's body are like the best video clip ever seen. Colours are well marked but the result is a poor commercial film with beautiful images and a sensual Jennifer lopez, that does not explore further into the killer's mind and gets particularly benefit of the popularity of Jennifer Lopez and the "serial killer's film wave" oughting to be a blockbuster.Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell was a big disappointment. The first ten minutes make you think you'll have all the beautiful images they're showing for the (small) 104 minutes length. But the word to use here is WRONG. After a short and pleasant introduction to the technologies that give you the chance to go in someone's mind, you see a disturbing image (that did not disturbed me at all) and you follow a serial killer's life. And one day, for a very conventional and not innovative (in the world of cinema) reason, the technicians, and that includes the awful Jennifer Lopez, have to go see in the killer's mind. And his mind is special and unpredictable. Does that remind you something? Yes, it's exactly the same thing that the boring The Thirteenth Floor...there's even Vincent D'Onofrio in The Cell too! The time spent in the killer's mind isn't long enough, and doesn't bring anything at all. And some parts are almost funny...especially when Jennifer Lopez fights the bad guy while wearing Xena-like clothes and handling a crossbow...her acting is so fake and superficial that all the scenes involving her (almost the whole movie) look like big jokes or bloopers. I wonder why they chose her...oh yeah, now I know...when she's wearing her tight panties or her tight shirt...that doesn't worth millions of dollars, not even the four bucks you'll pay to rent it...I want a refund!!!! The film had potential, but they should have spent the whole film on the young boy's case...it wouldn't have turned into the pitiful thing it actually is... 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many plot contrivances can one movie support to get to its central conceit? To get an idea, see "The Cell", where a child psychologist and an FBI agent mind meld with a serial killer in an effort to save his final victim:1) There exists a lab in the middle of nowhere that is dedicated to psychiatry of the comatose. When the movie begins, it has one patient.2) There is a no-longer-used third mind-meld apparatus at the lab.3) Our serial killer has a thing for time delaying his victims' deaths, thereby building in the obligatory dramatic race against the clock without requiring his actual presence at the moment of death.4) Our serial killer also has an extremely rare form of schizophrenia which one day will act suddenly to render him permanently comatose.5) Our serial killer has his long-delayed, once-in-a-lifetime attack of this disorder minutes before he is seized by the FBI.6) The FBI agent needs to go into the serial killer's mind to discover the crucial clue, which turns out to be an ordinary forensic detail that would have been discovered by any reasonably competent investigator not encumbered with having to resist being seduced by Jennifer Lopez in a serial killer's dreamworld.If you can suspend your disbelief long enough to get around all that, you would also find being suspended by wires from hooks embedded in your back a "comforting" experience, just like our serial killer.Memo to Mind-Meld Lab: if you want to make progress with your comatose child patient, stop sending Ms. Lopez into his pubescent subconscious. What's the incentive to be cured, when one's id is getting regular one-on-one visits from Jennifer Lopez in a skin-tight Mae West castoff designed by Salvador Dali? Talk about your recipe for malingering....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have already seen "The Cell" in the movies twice and rented it on video twice and I have to say that I really liked this movie. It has become one of my all-time favourite films where you have unlikely heroes and villains in a world of gray. The unlikely heroine is Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a child psychologist who via futuristic technology, literally enters the minds of her young comatose patients in hopes of treating them more effectively. The unlikely hero is Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn), a determined, at-times burned out FBI agent who had just nabbed our unlikely villain. Enter Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a rather unconventional serial killer whose MO is drowning his victims and turning them into human Barbie dolls. Paths are crossed when the lawman relies on the shrink to enter this psychopath's twisted, hellish universe in hopes of saving his last victim.What I liked about "The Cell" first of all because of the fact that I found the talented Miss Lopez's character to be a woman full of beauty, intelligence, compassion,...and having a constantly changing wardrobe. Her presence always seem to bring light to any movie regardless of the genre. Aside from the visual shots and the special effects which I thought were very cool and insanely bizarre, the overall content of the film was from a very human standpoint in terms of the acting and the dialogue. What is also human is the subject matter dealing with the duality of man--the conflicting of good and evil personalities in which through the killer's mind, he is seen as both a sadistic, demonic figure, and as an innocent little boy brutalised by his father.WARNING SPOILERS:Thus it is the killer's "evil" side which is dominant, the killer's "evil" side who is really our unlikely villain. I give "The Cell" seven out of ten stars, a well worthy B-movie certainly recommended for those with strong stomachs who are in this brand of material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not all movies are created to be warm, fluffy, standardized and sedated Hollywood stereotypes. I for one found this movie almost completely different to everything else I have seen in, well, a long time. When was the last time you saw a horror movie that showed some seriously disturbing s***?Instead of the Urban Legend-ish "ooh scary. An axe in the head for half a second", we got ourselves some scenes that really freak you out and make you feel sick (the point of these movies, perhaps?). My favourite including the good old slow-mo close up shot of someone's face screaming in agony as their intestines are pulled out by a crazy guy prancing, giggling, and clapping around him. Sick and crazy - as it should be.The characters were simple, because most people are simple. Catherine and Peter never got together, because that's what normally happens. They knew each other for less than a day, were a bit attracted, fantasized a bit, and then left. It was better than some crappy-20-minute-emotional-outburst-where-the-two-lead-characters-reveal-the ir-deepest-secrets-and-fall-in-love-2/3-of-the-way-through-on-the-first-day- they've-ever-met (geez, like we don't have enough of that already). I know it did have a bit of this, but at least it was kept to a minimum.And please, enough with the movie comparisons. You people praise stuff like The Green Mile, despite it being exactly the same as everything else, but the moment a serial killer movie comes out that's not a revelation in cinema, it's all "tries to be Seven" this, and "Silence of the Lambs wannabe" that. This movie is outstandingly different in that it had a simple goal - look good and freak people out, which it did, very well. I thought it was one of the most satisfying movies I've seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst directed, worst written, and worst thought out movies I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some serial killer movies in my day. I've seen some artsy movies too. Not to mention the thousands of movies I've seen which portray the ancient idea of `Style Over Substance'. But The Cell has to be one of the most poorly thought out movies I have ever seen.First off, this movie has a fresh idea. The idea behind this movie is `what does the mind of a serial killer look like". The movie takes this idea to another level by adding in a little science fiction: a machine that can take people INTO other people's heads. These are fine ideas. In fact, they're pretty good. But this is a perfect example of a good `idea' gone horribly wrong.Now, anyone out there reading this who happens to be a writer, I have a few words for you. Don't see this movie. You will be offended. I am a writer. I haven't written much, but I do understand writing, especially in film. Let me tell you this: this movie goes against everything I know and have learned as a writer. If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, David Mamet, or Chris McQuarrie, just stop reading this and go to another movie. The worst problem with this movie, in my opinion, is the poor characters. The Vince Vaughn character is so underdeveloped that I felt nothing for him. In fact, I stopped caring about every character after the first act. It has nothing to do with `Style Over Substance', I just stopped caring, and that is a very bad thing, especially for a writer. To who ever wrote this movie: a good idea can get you so far, but it's your characters that keep the audience interested. Next, the visuals. Many people praise this movie for it's artistic visuals. Well, I didn't think that they were that big of a deal. I can tell it took a lot of time and money to make them, but they really don't look that well. I also found that every visual, the good looking ones anyway, were all given away in the trailer. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts of this movie.Whew, now on to the sickness. I love serial killer movies. Se7en and Silence of the Lambs are two of my favorite movies of all time, not to mention I study criminal psychology. I've never met a serial killer, but I know their behavior. This serial killer is, well, pretty accurate. They do use the stereotype of having the serial killer coming from a abusive family. Most serial killers are well-educated members of society. You never know. People just snap sometimes. But that's not my problem. My problem is the overuse of disgusting images. I know that these images are needed to show how screwed up Carl is. But I think they over do it, just a bit.Direction: this is flat out bad. This man should be shot. Ask yourself: what is the director's job? It's to handle the actors. Now a days, he handles all creative aspects of the film, but his primary job is to coach the actors. Is that done here? No. The director has done a good job coaching the scenery, not the actors. These guys are good actors, yet they give shabby performances (though Vincent D' Onofrio is great being a creepy nut job, as always). This is not their fault. This is the fault of a director who doesn't care about characters, and therefore, doesn't care about the actors. Now, finally, we have the logic holes. Holy Lord. I won't even get into it. Like I've said before, I can look over logic holes as long as they aren't unbelievably obvious. Well, they're obvious in this movie. I won't go into to them because you'll see them when they come.Conclusion: This is a bad movie. Anyone calling it genius (cough, cough, ROGER EBERT, cough) does not know what they are talking about. People like Mr. Ebert only care about `pretty pictures', not about the heart of the movies. How else could he give The Cell a perfect 4 out of 4, and only give a great film like Gladiator, a 2. The Usual Suspects? 1 and a half. Fight Club? 1 and a half (though I guess I can understand that). See a pattern? I hope so. Ebert hates good writing, but he does love anything that just looks good like Titan A. E. which he gave 3 and a half out of four. This movie uses Mr. Ebert to try and get you good people to see this movie, mainly because he's the only major critic who loved it. I just want you good people to see that Mr. Ebert has no clue what he is talking about. This IS a bad movie. It is not art. It is not even disturbing. This is weirdness at its lowest level. This is no movie. This is one BAD movie. I didn't hate it. I just think it's bad. Now some of you `artists' may disagree with me. Well, movie is a very complicated art form. To be truly a work of art, a movie needs more than to look pretty. A painting is a work of art because of how it looks and what it means. A book is a work of art because of what it stands for, how it reads, and how smart it is. A movie is a combination of both a painting and a book, to put a visual picture on good characters and a good plot. Go to my THE HAUNTING review and read my M&amp;M analogy, and you'll understand better. This movie is all coating. If you don't like disgusting images, weird plots, and flat-out bad characters, please do yourself a favor and see something else... Please. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent D'Onofrio is Carl, a psycho who relishes in drowning women in small fibre glass cells and masturbating while hanging over their dead, bleached bodies. As an unconscious cry for help to be stopped he leaves subtle traces behind for the feds, but by the time the law is closing its net on him, Carl is having a serious cardiac arrest and sinks into a coma from which he won't recover. To find out where Carl left behind his latest victim-to-be, an idealistic law enforcer is willing to use every unorthodox method around.Child psychologist Jennifer Lopez is working with such a method: she makes a link with her patients' subconscious. His or hers state of mind is represented by certain places and situations which can be entered and/or witnessed. She agrees to make a link to Carl and look for the answer in his mind.Although the idea of trying to find a woman in peril is intriguing and done with sincere care for all concerned, it still feels like an alibi to create a visual feast, full of troubling, grande imagery. Some of the setpieces are obviously symbolic, others are seemingly meaningless but equally powerful. The psycho's mind is a twisted labyrinth where oriental rooms, disturbing childhood memories, dream logic, and bizarre occurrences and characters make for an unforgettable experience.This film proves that the concept of beauty is a very personal and relative one. It can be found in innocent imagery as little deers, lambs and bunny rabbits in a grassy, sunny environment, as well as in darker territory and acts and objects usually regarded as 'evil', 'dirty' and 'sick'. Hey, don't get me wrong, what Carl is doing here is bad, bad, bad, but I appreciate the film for daring to make clear that no-one is 'pure'. There is no pure evil, no pure goodness. There's more than one side to everything and everyone.I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. Partly because of the imagery which almost made me drool and partly because of the wonderful, interesting characters and their ordeals.Everybody's comparing this film to "Silence of the Lambs", maybe because it enables people to categorize the picture, so they can place it somehow, reducing its originality. But actually this films owns more debt to Joseph ruben's "Dreamscape" (1984), which starred Dennis Quaid as a scientist who was capable of penetrating other people's nightmares and used this gift to investigate their origins.But that film was kind of a bore, whereas "The Cell" is the real thing.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

The story seemed interesting, but was poorly executed. I did not get into any of the characters, and was quite bored throughout the flick. However, I cannot say enough about Singh's technique in shooting the character journeys in each other's mind. It's simply spectacular, as if I were in a dream. However, I had a hard time accepting Jennifer Lopez's stint as a Virgin Mary-like figure. Was I the only one who thought that was a little far-fetched? I guess they were trying to make this into a real artsy flick, but failed miserably. People called it disturbing and claustrophobic, I found it to be dull and slow. Rent it, and you'll prolly say the same thing.</fullReview>

Nothing new and ground-breaking in other words. But isn´t there anything original about this movie? Well, yes.The visuals. Director Tarsem Singh has created some of the most impressive and breathtaking visuals ever seen on the big screen. The scenes inside the killer´s mind (Vincent D´Onofrio) are really spectacular and ,sometimes, pretty disturbing.What about the acting then? Well, Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn are both pretty decent in their roles and Vincent D´Onofrio gives out a solid performance. Unfortunately , they are not good enough to make you care about the movie´s characters. Shame.I can´t say I´m disappointed with "The Cell" but it could have been better. I mean, sometimes it takes a little more than stunning visuals to complete a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This eerie psychological thriller is laden with all kinds of special effects. I think they even tossed the kitchen sink, too. The basic plot is that there's this really hot-looking doctor (Jennifer Lopez) who undergoes this cool experimental procedure in which she enters the mind of another human being - in her case, a child in a coma. Her skills are tapped when an intrepid detective (Vince Vaughn) has captured a schizophrenic serial killer (Vincent D'Onfrio) who is in such an advanced state of psychosis that he's unconscious and is therefore unable to reveal to the police the location of his latest victim, who is apparently trapped in a cell-like glass container that has enough food and water for 72 hours, but no more (then, apparently, the cell floods - you may have seen that in the promos for the movie). Enter Miss Lopez, who wanders into this sicko's mind, finding out why he is what he is and trying her goldangist to find out where the young lady is.If nothing else, this is not a dull movie. In fact, the "Wow, cool!" quotient of The Cell is pretty high. Let's just say that if you're into mindbending horror films, this might be the one for you. There IS some gore, there's a whole lot of cussin', and quite frankly no one under 21 should see it. There's no sex, however (darn!). But there's a LOT of visual imagery. Kind of like Beetlejuice combined with Army of Darkness. There is a lot of torture and a few absolutely shocking acts. It's disturbing, never calming. And Lopez is the one who holds it all together. Many models-turned-actresses/singers can't hack it in more than one profession, but clearly there is some talent at work here. She's a delight, never innocent, but never in over her head, either. Her character is strong, resilient, and very intelligent. Vaughn, who doesn't have enough scenes with Lopez, plays against type as the take-charge lawman on the job (although he's a little stereotypical); I usually see him as the bad guy, but here he's Johnny Cop. Good casting!This is a jaw-dropping experience you probably won't forget too quickly. But then again, in a few years, it'll probably be passé' and you won't hardly remember The Cell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out good but eventually turns into a borderline Marilyn Manson video.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always very wary of movies directed by music video directors. Usually they turn out horrible (Mystery Men), or actually very good (Seven, Fight Club). The Cell on the other hand falls somewhere in between. WARNING SPOILERS: It starts out with an effective sequence in which Jennifer Lopez is in the mind of a child in a coma. Everything in this scene works to astonishing effect and one scene in particular is guranteed to make you jump. The scenes showing the killer doing his deeds are extremely grotesque and fittingly offputting. The initial investigation into his whereabouts are also extremely well done.But where the movie really goes downhill is when Ms. Lopez goes into the mind of the killer. All restraint that the director showed in not giving into his music-video cliche tendencies completely goes out the window. I honestly thought I was at times watching a Marilyn Manson video without the music. It's really a shame, because there was so much potential with this story. There are a couple of decent scenes inside the killer's mind but overall it felt like a waste of time.Possibly with a different director (preferably one without a music-video background) this movie could have turned out much better. The performances are solid throughout, the soundtrack is suitably eerie and some of the set pieces had the potential to be breathtaking. By no means is it horrible, but it could have been so much more.Rating:5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are familiar with the Dennis Quaid 1984 science fiction thriller 'Dreamscape', 'The Cell' will seem like very familiar territory. Replacing the psychic talent Quaid utilized in the earlier film with cutting-edge 21st century technology, therapist Jennifer Lopez' 'spirit' enters a young patient's subconscious, and attempts to repair psychological damage from the inside out, by dealing with the 'demons' that lurk there. Her patient, a child in a coma from a traumatizing experience involving seals, lives in a desert world of magic, which Lopez handles with imagination and compassion. While she hasn't achieved a breakthrough, yet, her love and confidence is sufficient to keep funds for the project flowing.Meanwhile, in the 'real' world, a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio, in another of his string of remarkable performances) is drowning then raping young girls, and a team of FBI agents, led by Vince Vaughn, are conducting a frantic manhunt, as yet another girl has disappeared. When evidence leads to the killer, they discover him in a coma, and a crisis arises; they only have 40 hours to discover the whereabouts of the latest victim, before the cell she is imprisoned in fills with water, and she drowns.There is only one avenue with a chance of success, and soon Lopez finds herself in the mind of a madman.This film is a visual 'trip', full of Dali-esquire imagery, and space/time distortions. While the plot twists are predictable (one wishes the imagination shown in the visual effects had been carried into the script, as well), the story will keep your attention, and Lopez proves that she can move from erotic goddess to religious Madonna in the same film, convincingly.If you want a really fascinating double feature, watch 'Dreamscape' AND 'The Cell', and compare the two films! But be careful...seeing the two films in tandem may give you some VERY unsettling dreams.</fullReview>

One day Carl Stargher, a serial killer is catched by the FBI. In cause of a shock he falls into coma. They don´t know where he has hidden his last victim. Now it´s Catherines turn to find it out. She´s running against time.First I thought: "Oh please, not another serial killer thriller!". Slipping into a psychopath´s mind? Sounds weird. And it is! It´s sometimes hard to watch. But somehow it turned out to be an original thriller with impressing visual effects. Carl Stargher, the serial killer played by Vincent d´Onofrio, reminded me of the Jame Gumb character in "The silence of the lambs". "The cell" can´t reach "The silence..." - the solution was a little too simple - but it comes very close to it. A disturbing thriller</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast for the eyes.... but not more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is divided in two parts. The "real" story, that is a boring and lame stereotype serial-killer-story and the "dreamworld" part, with astonishing pictures, strange atmosphere and high thrill.Every time the "dreamworld"-part ends I was bored to death and just waiting for the next "dreamworld"-part. "The Cell" is a feast for the eyes, but it has no interesting story, so if you going to watch it, don't expect a thrilling plot, just enjoy the brilliant pictures and you might be pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of coming out a little thin in the screenplay, I was pleasantly surprised by the visual power show by this movie. Personally not being a "special effects movie" fan, I enjoyed the dreamlike-S&amp;M portrait of the subjects minds, and two or three scenes really caught my attention (and my memory). The actors work is regular to say the most, specially because the screenplay doesn't work very ward on building the characters individualities. The bottom line is that, although it's not a fabulous movie, it does show some originality in theme and specially in visual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watching "the cell" it occurred to me i'd heard nothing but bad reviews. save for roger ebert. sitting there before an enormous screen and a fantastic viewing experience, i couldn't believe it. ugly story, brilliant movie.while i cannot except the notion of giving it full marks, its greatness seemed to me to be undeniable. i heard a review say it was offensive to women. well, the character is. it's been said that it is offensive in general. in its own way, but what do you expect when you go to a movie about the mind of a serial killer? plus, if this movie was like, say, "jingle all the way", all would indeed be merry, but it would also not be effective.in "the cell", each new idea is compelling, each new scene is intense, each performance is better than expected. there are feelings i associate with movies like "2001", "se7en", and even "8 1/2" (a lot of numbers in there!)obviously, "the cell" is not for all tastes. to me, it obviously demands repeated viewings. i found it thought-provoking, moving, amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Serial killing with a common poor boy.Let's take the serial killer played by insane-labeled Vincent d'Onofrio. He keeps his victims in a remote sanitized plexiglass cell where they can play to the gallery before to die. He gets his victims with a special trick appealing to the pity of a girl he's previously chosen. His latest victim-to-be has to be rescued, before she dies in her cell, with a little help from Jennifer Lopez who can lay an intricate relationship with the serial killer. Well that's yet too much from Silence of the lambs. And not very well set up. The problem is there is no appalling and fascinating Hannibal Lecter in it. Evil is just in his dreams, and because of his violent father. In fact he is only a poor little boy who suffers a lot. And you've got to wait 1 1/2 hour for that psychiatrical diagnosis.Pump up the villain!Chasing a murderer in his dreams could have been interesting. But the discrepancy between dream and reality is too much cut-and-dried. There are some psychedelic transitory scenes: nowhere top class work although some other scenes are well thought and shot. I'm thinking of those where dreams are closest to common life and common dreams. The script would have hence been better with a Freddy Dr. Mabuse villain and without all that heavy and picturesque dream psychology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about a movie that creates a ridiculous set of plot contrivances to justify fifteen minutes of special effects. For all the "art" trappings, this movie is far worse than the average vapid fx blockbuster. At least in most of those films the effects are designed around the story. Why does the killer keep his victims in an automated drowning machine for 48 hours? Who ever imagined such hogwash as a viral schizophrenia, activated by water, that results in a deathlike coma? These are ridiculous contrivances that keep the film weakly chugging along during any scene that doesn't include mutilated corpses or evil scary demon guys with rings in their backs. Compared to this, MI2 was a model of common sense story building. But this flimsy plot might have been forgiven had the writers decided to include a little bit of dialogue,or decided to hire real actors, or build a tiny hint of dramatic tension with the film's climax? Lacking all this, we have just another visually creative fx piece with a remarkably vapid storyline. Nothing new, really, as we see hundreds of these every year. We just don't usually refer to these types of movies as "art".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, iconoclastic gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell isn't perfect, but it's definitely a much better movie than most of the other reviewers would have you believe. I think most of the negative reactions are largely based on misunderstandings of what this movie seeks to achieve.People complain that the movie's fantastic imagery is too gory, too twisted, too disturbing, too misogynistic. I have to ask-- what else would you expect to find inside the psyche of a man who butchers women in his spare time?There are a few story lulls. But again, I think the critics who say the plot and characters are too thin are missing the point. The story is just a clothesline for the incredible fantasy sequences, and there's nothing wrong with that. Nobody complains about a lack of plot when they see a John Woo movie, where the story is only necessary to link gunfight and martial arts sequences together. The same idea applies here--The Cell is more of a flow of images than a narrative, and that's just fine. As for the complaint that the acting is bad, I can only reply that I thought the performances were perfectly sufficient. Nothing Oscar-worthy, but they get the job done. Again, nobody ever complains about the bad acting in lots of other genre movies where the plot exists only for the sake of imagination and imagery. Sure, Mark Hamill's acting in the Star Wars films is pretty bad, but nobody cares except people who are missing the point.No, The Cell isn't the best movie ever made, but it isn't nearly as bad as most reviewers seem to think. Give it a second chance, with a more open mind, and maybe you'll appreciate it a bit more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with most of the other comments but actually, I LIKED the movie. Yes. The plot wasn't good, however, this movie is in my opinion one of the best cinematographic movies that has come out in the last two years or so. Apart from that, it is the movie that has the most number of symbolisms after Birdy. So, if you watch movies not for the plot but for what the director is trying to give you, I suggest you give The Cell a try..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can i say about 'THE CELL'?Other than it was a very dissapointing movie,with really no meaning,and very bad acting.Of course the only good thing was the visual effects,but i am not that stupid,i can see right through the producer,he thought if he was to make a dull,lifeless movie and add some great special effects it would be great.Well...No!It was a terrible attempt,and Jennifer Lopez doesent help much too.The movie is called "THE CELL", yet the actual CELL is used in the movie for 10 minutes,for the other 90 minutes,Jennifer is placed in a costume and sent to another world.The first time you see the visual effects they are supurb,especially the backgrounds,but they take advantage of it,and over-use it. The cell really had no point,i still figure what it was on about!And the scenes were done poorly,every minute the scenes would change,leaving no logical sense. I disliked this movie totally,and i gained no satisfaction,the visual effects were stunning,but i look much deeper into a movie.Overall i give THE CELL 5 out of 10.GOOD POINTS OF FILM:Visual EffectsBAD POINTS OF FILM:Awful script/Bad acting/Lifeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing New *spoiler*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hesitant in seeing The Cell. I can't help but be skeptical about any film containing Jennifer Lopez , and the trailers reeked of 'spectacular FX at the expense of well-developed story and dialogue.' I really should have followed my instincts and avoided this film at all costs, because I was correct in my assumptions. Jennifer Lopez was, well, Jennifer Lopez. She looked for the most part of the film as though she was in a music clip - in the opening scene when she descended from the horse, I almost expected her to break into song. No, this isn't because I have typecast her purely as a singer - other singers also dabble in acting (Bjork being a terrific case in point - see Dancer in the Dark) and have managed to pull off the transition very convincingly. Lopez just doesn't cut it. As for the plot, who isn't a little bored of the old "psycho abducting, mutilating and killing young women" storyline? In the tradition of Silence of the Lambs, The Bone Collector, and Kiss the Girls, this film features yet another (supposedly) strong young woman out to save the day. What I thought would be the saving grace of The Cell was it's special effects - the majority of reviews I'd read commended the film for its contrasting gruesome and often beautiful imagery. I was sorely disappointed. How many times can one view a naked mutilated female corpse strapped up in a morbid pose and not feel like the film's makers were stooping to all sorts of lows? Apart from the film's opening scenes, all those intended to 'shock' the viewers looked like they'd been lifted straight out of a Marilyn Manson or Nine Inch Nails video clip - not the most original or mesmerising images.Whilst I think that the concept of the film - taking a look inside a disturbed mind - could have been a fabulous one if placed in the right hands, the makers of this film made it cheap, dull, and lifeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An invigorating visual experience in which the visuals serve as a body bag for a weak script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is another addition to the bizarre, nasty, serial killer genre. While it boasts breathtaking (if meaningless) images you've most probably never seen before, these visuals are merely a distraction from the weak, dull script and recycled dialogue. Jennifer Lopez adds to the films slick, sexy look as Catherine Deane, a child therapist who enters the mind of a comatose serial killer (Vincent Donofrio, in a creepy, almost silent performance as a schizophrenic, sadomasochistic killer who drowns women in a tank in the middle of the desert) in order to locate his next victim. The movie is a true case of style over substance, and Vince Vaughn's performance as an FBI agent is truly hammy, but it has enough stunning images and costumes and interesting visual ideas that have to be seen to be believed. Not for the faint of heart. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the worst film I have *ever* seen. And I've seen a lot of films. It was VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY graphically violent, misogynistic, and gory. 'Silence of the Lambs' or 'Se7en' seem like Disney filcks after seeing this. The plot is flimsier than some of Jennifer Lopez's costumes. (Both 'Silence' and 'Se7en' have about 100,000 times the plot.) It was *such* a waste of time. Jennifer Lopez has a lot more talent and range than this film affords her, and she is capable of better. You have to wonder how a piece of rubbish like this gets 'greenlighted.' I want the 2.5 hours back I wasted on this piece of pornography. I'd ask for my money back too, but thankfully I didn't pay to see it...my friend did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Successful meld of serial-killer manhunt with dream-therapy SF</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** A movie that will (and evidently does) divide viewers into those who love it for the right reasons, love it for the wrong reasons and those who hate it. The trailer makes it obvious that it is about getting into the twisted mind of a serial killer, depicted using surreal and disturbing imagery. The graphics of the film live up to expectations and are awe-inspiring in places. They are not let down by the taut, coherent framework provided by the twin plots of "FBI manhunt" and "Scientists explore intrusion into dreams as therapeutic technique". The relatively little known cast perform well - I am just about convinced by Jennifer Lopez as an actress rather than a Latin singer, and D'Onofrio plays a bad guy much more sinister than his "Bug" in "Men in Black". Reference points include other mind-of-a-killer movies like "Silence of the Lambs", "Seven" and 'Copycat", graphic internal-reality depictions like "Altered States" and 'The Matrix", also "Twin Peaks" and particularly Theodore Roszak's out-of-print novel (never filmed) "Dreamwatcher". If you liked a reasonable proportion of these, you'll love "The Cell". A major sticking point is that it is very effective at portraying the imagery of a sick mind (like the other thrillers listed above). This provides an enjoyable psychological roller-coaster for some but may be deeply disturbing to other viewers. Many will come away from this movie feeling at least a little bit..mentally violated. I suspect that psychologist consultants have advised the production or writing teams on archetypal images that are guaranteed to hit funnybones of the subconscious. You have been warned. Having said which, "The Cell" is not a sex-and-gore extravaganza. Most of the disturbing material is hinted at or glossed over rather than explicitly depicted. Perhaps one of the strengths and problems of this movie is that it forces us to confront our own imaginative extrapolations. Some other reviews certainly complain about things which did *not* overtly appear on screen! Another point in its favour is the avoidance of any Hollywood cliche endings, although the subplot that provides the opening also provides a neat bracketting epilogue. About 8/10 overall. At the risk of a slight SPOILER, I must take issue with the people who think that CatherineWorld is "laughable", "unrealistic", etc. The whole point is that CarlWorld is the landscape of his unconscious, has evolved naturally, and is beyond conscious control, and hence is internally realistic (apart from typical dream-style continuity jumps and random changes like the pulsating stairway). CatherineWorld is deliberately lucid-dreamed into being, in short order, under stress, by Catherine in order to provide a safe/holy/angelic meeting place into which to invite the boy-Carl. Of course it looks like a shonky set. That's part of the point. Second SPOILER for the confused about "dying in dreams". It *is* a well-known old wives' tale and is known to be fallacious in general (I have died in a dream and survived). However, psychosomatically induced bodily damage and mental trauma, both potentially fatal, *could* occur. Carl dies in real life not because he dies in a dream, but because his boy-self wants to die. Period. This can only be arranged in the dream sequence, since that is Carl's only way of communicating with the outside world. Third SPOILER for those who can't follow the subplots. There is an implication that each individual remains dominant inside their own heads on either the subconscious level (like Carl) or consciously (like Catherine). Solving Edward's problem cannot be done inside his own head because his boogeyman alter-ego is too strong there, but Catherine only feels able to invite him into her mind after surviving the experience of doing so with Carl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don´t be mistaken by the hype; "The Cell" is a very noisy film, bad written, with bad characters, with just one or two shots that deserve to be seen (but not something to burn ten bucks for), with a very bad plot that is merely there to justify the special FX (including the actors). Surprisingly, Jennifer Lopez has the best acting of the bunch, even if her character is completely underestimated. The script opens many doors, still left open by the time the flick ends. I mean, COME ON, PEOPLE!!! Only ´cause it is a summer movie you don´t need to make it idiotic and simplistic; the gore and perversions are all there, but they doesn´t have any POINT! What is the POINT of The Cell?? Why should we BOTHER? I don´t want to waste my money with something I can watch for free in MTV anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite it's faults, I can't help but like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't really a review, just a collection of random thoughts on the movie The Cell. WARNING: The is a spoiler at the end.This film does have many faults but I still like it. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground with this movie, you either like it or hate it. I like it, a lot. Serial killers don't really interest me. The movie Seven probably did the best with the subject in the context of a horror movie. However, this film transcends the genre by treading into Lovecraftian Dreamlands territory.I find it strange that horror fans seem to be strangely silent about this film. No one on the Fangoria BBS will even talk about it. They can't seem to get over the fact that the 80's horror film-thing is over and done with. To bad for them, they are really missing out on a good movie.There are a lot of `gee-whiz-golly' special FX but there was still a noticeable amount restraint used with them. They never went too far (by this I mean, overindulgence) with FX; at times, I craved more eye candy and I'm sure they could have delivered. I also have the feeling that the pressure was there to do so. I'm glad they didn't cave-in.Some of the sets felt very theatrical and fake, if you will. This is not a criticism, merely an observation. I actually liked that. Some people might not.This movie, along with two other underrated and mind-altering gems, Dreamscape and Brainstorm, should not be watched together as it would be rather unhinging for certain "susceptible" persons minds.SPOILER: By the way, modern dream research has proven that you can die in your dreams and you will NOT die for real. Hollywood likes to use this silly myth in movies a lot (see the movie Dreamscape and BTW, it's a good movie as well). Again, despite such flaws, I still liked The Cell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most brutal, disturbing, and beautiful film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, the one-line summary seems like something of an oxymoron. One would ask, "How can something so hyperbolically disgusting be considered beautiful?" Ask the director of "The Cell", Tarsem Singh, a first-time director who is sure to come by more work in the coming months and years.With this film, he has woven a haunting story chronicling the quest to save someone... and the person who has made them a victim. On the surface, the film is just a simple story of the cops trying to save a girl from a ruthless serial killer, but connotatively, there is far more to the story. There are underlying themes of self-improvement, judgment, determination, and commitment that one must truly consider in order to discover.Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a child psychotherapist working with an experiment to exorcise the demon from a schizophrenic child's mind and save him. She tries several times to do so, and the boy's parents begin to lose confidence in the experiment. But Catherine is a determined doctor who will try as many times as it takes to save this child from the boogeyman that haunts his head. She continues to run into this boogeyman within the vast desert that is the child's mind, and is doing whatever it takes to overcome him... if at all possible.There is another conflict brewing. Carl Stargher is another schizophrenic with a condition not unlike the child's. Unfortunately, he's older, he's stronger, and he is one mean serial killer. We're talking Hannibal Lecter meets Charles Manson here. This is a man that kidnaps women that he finds to be beautiful or appealing, takes them to his home on the outskirts of a larger city, places them in a cell, and leaves them there to drown within 40 hours. The FBI has caught wind of this killer's actions and is determined to find him before another victim dies.During a violent seizure that Carl is unfortunate to experience, he falls into a coma and the hands of the FBI, who now are more determined than ever to find this latest victim that he has kidnapped. There's no way to get the information out of him by asking him, so they turn to Catherine Deane and her experiement of entering other people's minds to help. They believe that with Catherine's expertise on the matter, and the fact that she's the only one who's ever been subjected to this procedure, she will be able to convince Carl, within his mind, that what he does is wrong and that she can save him and the girl if he tells her where she is.This journey will not be easy, nor will it be for the viewer. Once inside Carl's mind, Catherine is subjected to violent and haunting images that she is certain will corrupt her mind forever. She travels through the dark corridors and doors winthin Carl's subconcious, witnessing various horrible images that control Carl's mind. She witnesses a savage beating by his father, a baptism in which he is almost drowned, and a time when Carl, as a child, envisioned vivisecting a horse. It is these obstacles that Catherine must overcome in order to save Carl... and herself.Words cannot describe the visuals in this film. Astonishing cinematography, special-effects, production design, and costumes make "The Cell" a visual masterpiece. There are extravagant sets to represent how complicated one's mind can be. While there are visual overtones, there are also virtues in the film's plot and acting. While there is an absence of interesting dialogue, the actors play their parts surprisingly well. Jennifer Lopez plays a motherly figure who would undoubtedly be the best to ease one's pain, both with her physical beauty, soothing voice, and mind of an angel. Lopez is excellent at playing this role and will hopefully be asked to do so again. Vincent D'Onofrio, meanwhile, continues his streak of psychotic figures in film, playing a confused and multi-minded serial killer who tries to overcome himself, but is possessed by schizophrenia and the effects it has on him. His demon must be conquered by another, because he, himself, cannot do it. With all these virtues in tow, keeping in mind the excess brutality in gore throughout the film, I give "The Cell" 4 stars on a five star scale.</fullReview>

How ? I think that Vince Vaughn didn't have much script when he enter the mind of Jennifer Lopez. Just screaming and screaming and press the button to get back to the reality.Well, this is a thriller.

I have to say that it was stunningly made, but for me, this shouldn´t be what pushes a story ahead. Nevertheless, the events taking place outside the killers mind really frightened me, where his last victim, played by the great Tara Subkoff, is shown being trapped in a cell which is filling up with water. She was the only thing I loved about this movie. Without having any dialogue to say at all, she manages to really take you in with her strong performance, taking her character through various stages of fear without sticking to a stereotype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the most strange, breathtaking film ever seen. Apparently a crime film, the movie is as original as controversial in opinions. Jennifer Lopez does a good job (but not for an Academy Award) and D'Onofrio rocks with his performance as the psycho-killer. But first, let me point out the plot a little bit.The film starts like "Lawrence of Arabia" (you'll have to see it..), and then carries on with the typical story about the bad guy killer and the handsome good detective. Then, the film does a 180? turn and changes completely in a succession of surrealistic images in a strange atmosphere. And here is when the film reaches the top, showing to the audience incredible and unbelievable worlds as never seen.And this strange atmosphere gives the original point to The Cell, 'cause without it, the movie will be the same boring story of policeman, criminals and killers. But, this bizarre stuff hasn't been received, in an average, with two thumbs up by people. And I must say, DO EAT NOTHING BEFORE WATCHING THIS MOVIE, I warn you, you'll regret it.Even though, The Cell is a must-see if you're looking for something different in the film industry. It's a well-done horror film, that doesn't let you move from the seat from the beginning till the end. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will already have read about the great visuals in this film and I do not dispute that it is technically good. However, this is a horrid, ugly, humanity sucker of a film. The violence is never subtle or suggested, it in your face, heavy handed and sledgehammered into you psyche. A video nasty. Everything from torture to a serial killer into S&amp;M masturbating over the body of the young lady he has just murdered is brought to the screen. Now I am no prude but it wasn't necessary. I left the cinema feeling disturbed and dirty, a voyeur of the worst kind. Not every film needs to be hearwarming or even edifying but this is humourless, bleak and unpleasant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot was somewhat unoriginal. Without the basic format of "Job A must be achieved within time limit B. To achieve Job A within time limit B, hero C must enter an artificial reality, so convincing, that if persuaded that they have been killed within the fictional world, hero C dies in reality." scores of Star Trek spin-off episodes would never have existed. True, there have been some interesting twists to the basic format in this movie, but the Matrix puts them to shame. BUT! Don't get me wrong, i was not once bored by this film. The plot may have been less than amazing, but the cinematography and the convincing performances more than made up for that. This has to be one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The desert scenes were amazing, and some of the imagery within the psycho's was perfectly conveyed. Is this a case of style over content? Probably. But, look at Luc Beson's 80s work: This is not necessarily a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Matrix meets Silence of the Lambs"? Hardly !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarsem's THE CELL (2000) was touted as "The Matrix meets Silence of the Lambs." And despite Jennifer Lopez's, at times surprisingly respectable, lead performance in this latest addition to the emerging 'Philosophy of Mind' sub-genre of SciFi films (: Matrix, Dark City, Existenz,?), Tarsem (Duamdwar Singh)'s "disturbing, twisted, gnarled, and truly unique" first vision is too loose in its narrative qualities to be compared to those major films.While highlighting some interesting issues concerning future therapeutic possibilities (and the dire psychological dangers !) of interactive virtual-reality technology, the "ambiguous" stance this film takes towards today's materiality, in our "Prozac world" of a contemporary behavioralist medical science, while plundering archetypal, awesome visual effects from a Freud/Jungianist spirituality, within the "dark sides" of a child schizophrenic's, a serial killer's, and a child therapist's Id's, was just too disconnected to work well. It is, however, a film interesting enough to recommend; if for no other reason than state-of-the-art cinematography of fantastic imagery from those "dark sides."Vincent D'Onofrio's performance bears the mark of a gifted actor stunningly capable of the serial- killer/psychopath roles; that is, of one who has gained the immeasurable benefit of having worked with THE director who'd bring out all the craft of any actor's talent : Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket). The subtle homage to David Lynch's Twin Peaks ("Mares eat oats and does eat oats?") WAS a notable insider flourish. Unfortunately, the contemporary 'Hollywood' use of what I refer to as the 'non-casual introduction of recreational drug use to signal an imminent dramatic mental state' did not suffice to effectively mark an interesting possibility for fuller character development; i. e., Lopez's "therapist" role vis-?-vis the under-developed character of Vince Vaughn's "FBI agent."Moral, possibly judicial, concerns surrounding the dubious ethics of new liberties inherent to our therapist's (Lopez's) enhanced technological ability, most specifically in the 'spiritual' act of that freedom she takes, to virtually exercise a real and effective "mercy killing," as euthanasia without any repercussions - in what could only be construed as the metaphysical 'redemption' of the child-like innocence of an immortal soul - is perhaps the most compelling aspect of a merely visual film. And, given Lopez's kick ass performance in those hard-hitting scenes, the most entertaining, too !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first striking images you see in The Cell is Jennifer Lopez, dressed in an ornate and flowing white gown, traverse a pristine desert on the back of a magnificent stallion. That's just one of the striking visuals used in the film. After the introduction of the major players, the film swings into motion. Lopez is a doctor that is able to enter into minds via a fairly new technology. When she enters the mind of Vincent D'Onofrio's killer, we are plunged into a chaotic, and at times, very disturbing mind. The film plays on three different levels. On one hand, it's a race against time thriller. Lopez and Vince Vaughn have to figure out what's happened with the most recent victim who is locked in a cell that will flood with water within two days. The other part is, it's a journey into the mind of a disturbed person. Inside the killer's mind, we meet his younger self. Through brief glimpses into the past, we see what has transformed an innnocent boy, into a very sadistic and remorseless killer. The third level the film works on is a sci-fi level. The idea of one person going into the mind of another has always been around, but never before has it been executed with such results. The director Tarsem, who transported R.E.M. into another world with their Losing My Religion video, pulls no punches in this film. There are scenes that will make you squirm, but at the same time, will bring you closer to understanding motivations for D'Onofrio's character. Like The Silence of the Lambs and Seven, The Cell takes a genre that seems to have run it's course, and puts a fresh spin on it. Many who see The Cell may be put off by the grostesqueness of what is presented before them. For those brave viewers who are willing to look where few dare not look, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually spectacular, but not fully fulfilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with a visually impressive scene, with Jennifer Lopez in a white dress walking at the top of large sand dune, then arriving beside a boy, and showing a huge ship buried in the sand. The beginning has a surreal feel to it. Miss Lopez has a gift of being able to go inside the mind of traumatised kids to help them.Meanwhile, there is a deranged killer at large named Carl Stargher. This guy is really disturbed. He puts women in a glass cell, and fills it up with water, slowly (it takes forty hours to fill). Then when they are dead, he covers them in bleach and places them on a table. Then he suspends himself above the body via hooks embedded in his skin, and masturbates.When Stargher falls into a coma, Miss Lopez is asked to go inside his mind to discover the location of a victim. The following scenes are where the film excels. Inside Stargher's mind are a collection of spectacular surreal images; and also a psychedelic trip, when a FBI agent enters the killers mind.These scenes make the film worthwhile, and another positive is ultra sexy Jennifer Lopez; but somehow the film doesn't quite fulfil. Like Greenaway's Prospero's Books, this one is worth watching just to look at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell, initially appearing as though it were simply pieced together from other fantasy films, is in reality a very original and highly intelligent movie that will itself most likely be copied in the near future. It is a very clever story about a psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) who uses a highly advanced virtual-reality device to enter the minds of her patients, which she must use to try and get crucial information from the mind of a comatose serial killer. The mind scenes are of course the most vivid, for they are awe-inspiring and unique. What would the mind of a serial killer look like? The Cell gives us a pretty good idea. Lopez does not need to be a great actress for this role; she puts just enough into this character to make it work. The plot is certainly impossible, and any attempt to explain how the mind probe works would just trivialize the entire film; this is one of those movies where you just need to accept that somehow it all works, and then you can lose yourself in it. The Cell is in the same vein as 2001, Blade Runner, Tron and The Matrix, because it doesn't just provide a new look at an old world - it creates a new world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even mind bending visuals can make The Cell memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing in the tradition of psycho shockers that Se7en started, The Cell forces reactions out of the audience with unimaginable (and unbelievable?) crimes, disturbing visuals, and satanic overtones.Jennifer Lopez does a believable job of delivering the lines that were written for her and can't be held responsible for the lack of character development, she does all she can to make us care about her, but in the end, we don't care enough to get to the edge of our seats. Her foray into the minds of others, as well as the whole "if you die in your dreams, you die in real life", is very much a rehash of Nightmare On Elm Street but with more disturbing scenes of child abuse.Some movies take you to a dark place so you can better understand it, some movies take you into a dark place to make you fear it, The Cell brings you into that dark place for recreation. You get the feeling that the movie was pieced together by a team of surreal artists who each were responsible for 10 minutes of the film; after their scenes were shot, a writer came in and tried to piece them all together. All the eye-candy is entertaining, but without a good flow, it's random images, a sort of slideshow that takes place during a plot that we've all seen done before.Something bad happened with the timing of the film also, maybe it peaked too early, or maybe it was just because the ending was so obvious, but by the time they got to the ending, it just didn't seem important. I'd bet $10 that the DVD release is going to have an "alternate ending" and "added footage" that didn't make it into the big screen version. It's possible that the ending was a scaled down version that would more appeal to the masses than the one originally intended, hopefully it will add something that makes us feel a little bit more about what happens in the end.(It was hard to write a review on this one, for the simple fact that it was so "blah". Most of the flashy visuals were shown in the previews and the story was a failure. It's hard to come up with anything constructive to say besides "it was okay.")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mysteries of the mind realized horribly and beautifully on the silver screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some reviews on the IMDB and heard some people say how disappointed they were with "The Cell". People have said "it was stupid because they didn't have to go inside his mind" or they didn't have to do this or that. After "The Cell" ended, I was left wondering about my own personal dreamland or what goes on inside everyone else's mental landscape and if we could see what it's like inside. After the first 5 minutes of "The Cell", there was already this feeling of "I want more". I was not disappointed when they gave more. I left the theater totally satisfied with what I saw and I was touched by the images that were displayed on the wide screen. The combination of mental images range from gorgeous to grotesque, and the manner with which they are woven together is simply masterful. Out of Hollywood has come what may be a special-effects art film, a movie that makes us question the mythical landscape of the human psyche.The most intriguing idea of the film is never overdone or incomplete. Honestly, what would it be like to wander about inside the mind of a psychopathic killer? Some of the visions that were realized are a step beyond what I thought a conscious human being was capable of comprehending. It stuck with me because I can vividly remember dreams I've had over the years that were just like some of the ones in the film, nightmares you can't wake up from, dreams that are too good to be true. The most awesome sequence for me what when the cop first traveled into the mindscape, the splash of colors were reminiscent of the "stargate" sequence of "2001", and they really looked a lot like what you would see if you close your eyes and press down on them with your fingers, and not just an effects artist's daydream.I think "The Cell" is one of the better films I have seen this year, and I wouldn't mind seeing it on the big screen again. I can't wait for Tarsem to make another film. "The Cell" is a horrifying, yet beautiful masterpiece that will make you question what goes on inside your mind, inside other's minds, and if one day, we'll really be able to waltz around inside someone else's dreamscape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye candy that rivals "What Dreams May Come"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always had great respect for artists who can successfully make the transition from one medium to another. Remember singer David Bowie's credible acting in "The Hunger"? Add to that list singer Jennifer Lopez's credible performance in "The Cell", an eye-candy film set inside the surreal world that is a killer's mind. But the artist I'm thinking of here is the film's director, known as Tarsem, who's internationally acclaimed for his work on music videos and on commercials for clients like Nike and Coca-Cola. Does he make the grade for the long form in film? Even after the sobering, provocative experience that is The Cell, one wonders. But there is definite potential here, enough to anticipate Tarsem's followup effort, whatever it may be.What exactly is The Cell? A vast landscape of breathtaking, mystifying, nightmarish scenes that researchers encounter when they enter the minds of not-so-average subjects. Child therapist Jennifer Lopez is involved with the cutting edge technology of a pharmaceutical firm that uses mind-altering drugs to place her mind onto the grid of someone else's. Once inside, she can exit by using a signal, but she can also become trapped if not careful. A serial killer, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, has a victim held captive somewhere, and is uncommunicative since having a seizure. The keys to finding the captive are somewhere locked in his mind, and there's a time limit in finding her. Sound familiar? Think "Dreamscape" meets "Silence of the Lambs", crossed with "Altered States" and "The Matrix". D'Onofrio's killer is straight out of "Silence", with Buffalo Bob-type methods and eccentricities. He's less Boston Strangler than he is manic performance artist, a trait well-suited for this film, which at times plays like an opera. Half of The Cell features very little dialogue, as we take a tour through the morbid museum that is the killer's mind. Lopez, stunningly beautiful in an array of fantasy outfits, has the charms and sincerity to pull off her role, but her character is cheated by the sparse script. The real acting here is handled by Vince Vaughn, who plays FBI agent and serial killer expert Peter Novak. Vaughn's performance injects a note of reality into what is otherwise Alice In Wonderland As Envisioned By Peter Max. The images in The Cell may leave an impression on you, though this story lacks real emotion or suspense. But the ride is intriguing nonetheless. Gruesome at times, much of the film reflects the director's music video roots. Meticulously-photographed shots beg to be studied and analyzed. Exquisite set pieces that would make Salvador Dali take notes hold our attention like a child's first view into a kaleidoscope. It's all eye-candy of the highest quality, to be sure, perhaps even more creative than "What Dreams May Come". Would this movie be one you'd watch over and over? Or does the novelty wear off fairly soon? That depends on what you look for in eye-candy like "The Cell". If your cravings lean toward plot-driven drama or compelling dialogue, keep looking for films in which the tail is not wagging the dog. While the movie's DVD release will make a superb color test disc for your high-end monitor, one might also look at these types of films as great background video for those Friday night gatherings that don't require sound from the movie itself. Just plop on the CD of your choice (preferably classical, world-beat, fusion, or acid jazz) and watch "The Cell" evolve into the great performance piece it's crying out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the Cellular hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that the director of this movie is good friends with Mark Romanek, famed director of boss music videos including nine inch nails, and that their sensibilities were very similar, I knew I would go see it. I will admit that for maybe 5-10 minutes TOTAL during the movie, my desire to view dark, twisted visuals was satiated. Otherwise, we are dealing with some pretty hollow filmmaking. Doe-eyed Lopez seemed to be on some sort of squishy crusade throughout the film to seem like the most nurturing child-shrink possible, even to the extent of doing a dead-on Mother Mary impression towards the end, complete with a "Pieta" with child victim in her arms. She never really seems up to any of the tasks she undertakes, such as entering a "deranged" killer's mind (I guess deranged means you have crooked teeth and poor diction nowadays) to deduce the whereabouts of a kidnapee. Only in the mind of said killer are there any interesting things going on, and even these seem lifted from various videos by this director and others. Vince Vaughn is laughably terrible in his fluff role as FBI cool guy. The script is so pedestrian that his deadpan delivery almost seems to mock the movie he is taking part in. There is no chemistry between the two leads, and I really couldn't find myself caring too much about anything that happened to them or anyone else in the film for that matter. It was fun to see the child molester father from "Happiness" in another part, but sort of off-putting that this film is so lame compared to his previous work. This is one hype-driven movie if I ever saw one. Don't go see it; rent it in a month and fast forward through all the schmaltz, stop at the mind-trip sequences, then put it back in the box and drop it off at Blockbuster. You won't be missing anything remotely worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with a lot of the previous reviewers who remark on the weak acting, thin plot, and bad writing, but find it visually compelling. There is no question that there are many weaknesses, and I certainly do not believe in style over substance, but the only point of the movie was to explore a killer's brain, and the directing achieved that goal in a very beautiful way. The mind of a schizophrenic is an uncertain area and one in which someone attempting to portray it on film is given a great deal of leeway. This could easily have been done terribly by many directors utilizing stale imagery and obvious analogies and whatnot. In The Cell, though, the dreamscapes are very original and dynamic. The point of the movie is to transport the viewer into another world and it works. I don't think this movie pretends to be anything it's not. It is a visual exercise based on a plot that could be nothing but a visual exercise. The style is the substance (unlike a film like Run Lola Run which is mechanical and does not work toward any goal whatsoever but is highly praised as artistic). It is not a great movie by any means but very enjoyable and I will most definitely see this director's next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few movies this year that I'm buying on DVD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with guarded enthusiasm, as I had read reviews poo pooing the weak plot. I didn't think the plot was that bad, and was better than about 80 percent of the yearly shlock cranked out by the movie industry. It was visually stunning, as I had expected. I haven't been moved by imagery so much in a long time, and I saw aspects of video style cinematography in the line of Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Hellraiser, etc., and got a lot of the same feelings I get from a good Boris Vallejo or H.R. Giger painting. Watch for the horse part. I won't spoil it, but I am still wondering if they managed to do it all with CGI or with a combination of matte and CGI or something. There's more than one horse, so stay on your toes. I liked it a lot, and Jennifer Lopez in tight black leather is enough for the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The visual effects are a treat that make this film a 5/5. Unless you have a strong stomach and are able to suspend judgment about some of the less than believable storyline parts, you won't enjoy this film. On a visual level, it has the quality of a "Lawrence of Arabia"in the context of the landscape of the dreaming mind. Anyone who dreams in color knows that that's a vibrant canvas. And, the mind of the psychotic serial killer is a wonder to behold. On a story level it's a 3/5. On a psychology level ... it's pure pop-psych--but a good enough vehicle to enable the visual effects. Despite storyline flaws, the film will provide those who like suspense with sufficient goosebumps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, where do I start? at first The Cell is pretty engaging? you're never sure what you're going to see? it was creepy and it was freaking me out! I thought this guy is a complete FREAK and there is NO WAY I'm going into his mind?But that was just at first. After a while? nothing happens? and what's worse is nothing MEANINGFUL happens.Hey, I like weird movies, but when something NEW-weird happens and where weird stuff happens for a reason. This stuff was good in HELLRAISER, but just didn't go anywhere here.It's disappointing because this movie had SO much potential. I really wish the director (or the writers or whoever) had worked with someone to bring out the meaning behind the story. For a deep movie (into the mind) it wasn't deep at all. They needed more dialogs? we needed to care about the characters more. What kind of childhood did Novack (Vince Vaughn) have? What was up with Catherine (Jennifer Lopez) nightmares? What about the kid?Jennifer looks BEAUtiful (whats with the lip-gloss in every movie?) and gad, I'd kill for those curls! Poor Vince Vaughn he deserves to be in a 5 star movie.Yes, I definitely have mixed feelings about this movie. I give it 3 stars (out of 5), but I totally understand if someone rates this lower (or higher???)... there is something there... but there could have been so much more. My rating is only for premise.Oo yeah, and stoopied ending. ~Mooniebutt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CELL * * * *Rated R for violence, sexualityWelcome to HDTV! Yep, fancy videotape was used in making this movie, the remainder shot entirely on 35mm film. It's important because the medium is truly the message and the story here: the high-tech Institute run by detached scientist Henry West (Dylan Baker) employs an unusual and highly derivative treatment room (remember COMA?) that they put empathic child psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in to make contact with an autistic child. She's not doing so well and gets fired.An MTV killer, using video and Lakota spiritual practices, is on the loose, gaining momentum and victims by the minute. I guess living in Bakersfield gets boring.The local cops call in the FBI, specifically Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn), who is supposed to be the opposite of caring Catherine; he doesn't care if he makes enemies, he knows the killer entraps his young women victims in a bizarre (and I mean weird) human aquarium and kills them over a period of 40 hours. Agent Novak &amp; crew use some unexpected clues to pinpoint their man. The police know their time is limited and twists eyeballs &amp; arms to get Catherine back on her old experimental job at Henry West's High Tech Empathy Transfer Ranch. Only this time Catherine must use the imaginative and controversial neuro-transfer and psychotropic drug system to get some critical details from murderer Carl Stargher's (Vincent D'Onofrio) twisted mind if his latest victim, Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff) is to be saved.We get a mish-mash of visual and thematic shocks and jolts here, spurred on by the entrance into Carl's mind by Catherine: it ranges from Kabuki theater to Fellini-esque phony snowflakes in the hot sun (Namibia, not Colorado) with a host of surprises that will hopefully reveal a clue as to the immediate whereabouts of our latest victim. What we have instead is a prosaic story that relies on that ancient film standby, parallel editing. This old convention using new media is one thing that is drawing such differing critical reactions to this film.One thing about America though, if you can hit the ball, you're in the game. That's what happened to both the director (Tarsem Singh) an East Indian who came from a boarding school in the Himalayas to Harvard to study business (what else?) . It turns out he really does have a knack for finance, since his first commercials won awards that attracted the heavies in the ad industry. The writer is a self-admitted weirdo, Mark Protosevich. It's also his first feature attempt, but it appears both guys "think visually" and it shows on the screen. Only in the land of cinema would these fellows pull off such an outrageous stunt, since the film plays much more like a stage version of M BUTTERFLY, but without the interesting character development or story. Instead we get a lavish view of a serial killer's mind: fears of baptism (drowning), sadism at Daddy's heavy hand, and sexuality so repressed that his victims are reduced to a collection of re-animated dolls. The hinge point, and the one redeeming dramatic item, is Catherine's decision to allow Carl to enter her mind, in order to be held, accepted, understood, perceived as human.The ending is questionable. I think it ended well, all things considered, but you'll have to see it yourself to decide. There are a lot of ghastly images of dead, but strangely beautiful, naked young women and I'm not sure if that's what our society really needs more of right now. Of course it's horrifying, but you must ask yourself, is it cool or does it suck? That's pretty much the level of discussion on the movie right now in the chat rooms, but it indicates we may have an innovative newcomer who is not afraid to use startling images to reinvigorate a stale, formulaic industry. I say it's a good start.VerbotenSept. 8, 2000</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dreamscape" but bloodier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Video director Tarsem Singh's "The Cell" is okay if you haven't seen too many movies: you'll be impressed by the strong imagery, often quite disturbing but generally quite striking. But if you've seen, say, "Dreamscape" or "Mishima" or "Cat People" or movie by directors Andrew Blake or Michael Zen, what is supposedly striking is simply derivative: you've seen it all beforeBut the problems with "The Cell" aren't limited to copycatting, but also to casting. Jennifer Lopez as some sort of genius therapist? That's as bad as Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist in the latest James Bond movie. Lopez is lit so that she's always glowing, very radiant, but she speaks in a little-girl voice that is simply grating.Rent "Dreamscape" again, instead. It's better, it's more fun, it's wittier. "The Cell" is one of those movies that pre-hyped itself so much, with claims that they had to cut scenes to meet the R rating, that the gore and the nudity, etc., were so in-your-face that the MPAA wanted to give it an NC-17 rating, etc., that you walk out of the theater asking yourself, "What was all the fuss about?", drive home, and by tomorrow have forgotten all about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same story with nothing really that much different than anything else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Cell on opening day and I must say since I have not read any of the other reviews I was let down. The story is nothing that we have not seen before in the past. The one plus of the film was, as everyone might say, was the visuals. But, there were not much of them. The film kept going back and forth from the inner non-real world to the real world. It should have stayed in the non real world. Let me put it quickly, from one who is really "jonesing" for something different The Cell would have been much more interesting if the following were implemented. 1)Lopez should have been the bad "guy-girl". She should have been in Vincent D's place. Lopez would have been cool in this way if not for her voice alone. Lopez is sweet and her voice would have thrown people because of its sweetness masking an evil person/demon killer. Dynamics are enhanced. Sweetness going to Evil Demon is much more stressful. Also, the costumes and makeup would have been so much more interesting on her i.e. black makeup in sword scene. 2)The film should have located itself in the non real world for most of the film-that's where all the interesting s**t was happening. 3) By doing #2 the visual imagery that Tarsem was going after would have been increased and a lot more dynamic. The visuals were cool but we did not get to see them enough. I ask all who have seen the movie, was it not the moment we see Ms Olympia Kim Chivesky-whatever move toward Lopez and swoop her up the ooh aah high point of the movie? That's the s**t. People are overwhelmed by those things that they believe just can't be. And seeing Kim w/the lighting the way it was, handle Lopez in that quick edit was unsettling. That scene was a jar dropper and it is those kinds of scenes that would have made The Cell something that it was selling itself as; a truly visual thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big-time effects with a story that goes nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon seeing the previews for this film, I just had to go see it. Being a big fan of movies like "Seven" and other psychological thrillers, I thought that this movie would be right up my alley. Alas, I was severely disappointed when I left the movie theater last night, since the creators forgot to add a PLOT to the string of visual effects. It appears as though someone came up with the idea of creating a visual thrill ride unlike anything anyone had ever seen before....and then stopped short. Don't get me wrong; the effects and the ideas behind them were spectacular, the directing was very good, and the acting was surprisingly decent. After putting all this effort into the film, I cannot comprehend how something called "a good story-line" evaded the film-makers. There is no depth to any of the characters, and even the key character, Carl the killer, is barely explored. Big deal, he was abused as a kid - so what?An intelligent audience should demand more of a plot than that. We briefly learn that Catherine (Lopez), had a brother that was in some kind of accident....and then it is completely forgotten.Go see it and judge it for yourself. It's worth seeing for the visuals, so I won't say that it is a complete waste of time. I just felt very let down after seeing a movie that I thought was going to be amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cell presents some pretty twisted, evil images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The average person gets hung up on the fact that "The Cell" presents some pretty twisted, evil images and doesn't probe any deeper into the film. But these beautiful images have substance. They are the images of the unconscious mind; specifically they are the images of a schizophrenic serial killer who's gone through more child abuse than most people can comprehend.The wounds of our childhood do linger in our unconscious mind, and only in our dreams and in our unconscious and often destructive behavior do they come out. This is the point of the imagery, and in fact, one of the major points of the film. Another major theme is exploration of this question: if someone suffers tremendous child abuse as a kid, does s/he have the free will to not pass on these sins to the next generation? The answer is yes, if you believe Vince Vaughn when he says (roughly): "I believe that someone can suffer as much as Carl Stargher did and still never ever hurt another living being." The script is incredibly tight: there isn't a scene in the movie that isn't vital to understanding the film. As a result, the film grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the last. This, my friends, is the mark of a gifted screenwriter. The acting is better than average, and of course the cinematography is kickass. Next to "Bladerunner," "Schindler's List," and "The Shawshank Redemption," this is my favorite film of all time.</fullReview>

It tries to be a freak show, and basically succeeds. Not a great film, but don't try to think too much. Just watch and don't analyze..you should do fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film, I was absolutely blown away. The images is this thing are intense, and the closest I've ever seen to what a schizophrenic's demons are really like. Being a psychiatric student, I was sincerely impressed.The second time I watched this, I actually paid attention to the dialogue, and I realized it was actually scripted very weakly. The gripping dialogue of Silence of the Lambs and Seven isn't really present. I also noticed that though the demons were painted very well, they weren't as powerful as the real demons encountered at that level of Schizophrenia(however, that would have definitely called for an NC-17).The end result? A movie that makes an attempt at really trying to show schizophrenia, but forgetting that there really has to be dialogue for movies such as this to work well. The acting is good, as are the visuals, but the script leaves much to be desired. ***1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The freaky remain un-freaked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After walking out of the theater, I was left wondering if I had seen the same "The Cell" as everyone else had. I have seen reviews suggesting that it was one of the most disturbing movies ever, and I failed to see that at all. What I did see was a good use of special effects, mixed with a story that still needed a lot of work. (Spoilers to follow)This movie starts out way too fast -- much more time should have been spent on character development. Jennifer Lopez's character is force-fed quickly to the audience, and you almost have to pull from Jennifer herself in order to relate. She (Catharine) is the standard "underqualified yet unexplainably, naturally great" scientist, who also happens to be a knockout. Our antagonist, Carl Stargher (D'Onofrio), is also thrown at us very vaguely at first, and by the time we are supposed to hate him, we really don't have that much reason to. When the story starts to show just how awful Stargher is, Catharine has already made us feel sorry for the 'little boy' inside his mind.The extensive use of 'dream' worlds in this movie provided the writer/director with a lot of freedom, but brought with it some trade-offs. Dream sequences give the artistic freedom to do anything -- and this is where the CGI ran wild. There is a lot of eye-candy in these scenes, but it was not anywhere near as freaky or disturbing as this movie was pumped to be. The trade-off here is that the audience becomes de-sensitized during the dreams, since they know that it isn't "real" anyway.This movie should be stripped of its 'horror' class and be given 'sci-fi drama' instead. There are only a couple parts that I would consider scary, and they are so predictable that it is ridiculous. Once again, bad use of the freedom that this film had.Combine all of the above with a vague, barely visible attraction between Lopez and Vaughn, and a timeline that is totally unbelievable, and you have "The Cell".</fullReview>

Great visuals, pretty good acting, especially Vincent D'Onofrio (is that how you spell it?) and a little bit but not too cliched storyline. Some of the parts were very disturbing. The camera work was amazing, kinda reminded me of the update of House on Haunted Hill or a Marilyn Manson video. Wicked stuff.The last thing I wanted to mention was the musical score of the film. From beginning to end I was completely captivated by it. The "desert" scenes were very haunting and gave me the chills.

		<fullReview>That's right. The Cell is not a ground-breaking masterpiece of visual surrealism. Nor is it a horrifying/gory thriller. It's more like a mediocre crime story wrapped around an average rock video. There is no suspense to speak of. The acting is just plain awful (except D'onofrio, who is OK, but not special), and the script is worse.The much-discussed 'mind-link' sequences do include some beautiful surrealistic images, but certainly nothing especially new or artistic; Certainly nothing better than we've seen before. And there are a few gory moments, but nothing to rival Taxi Driver, Seven, or many, many other films.What was most surprising to me, is that a film which has evoked so many passionate responses is itself so cold and uninvolving. We are not engaged by the characters. In fact, they are barely engaged by each other. Even the aforementioned moments of horror seem to hold us at a safe, unemotional, distance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to The Cell with the expectation of amazing SFX sequences, which it delivers. I won't give up the plot becuase it's already been done here. Safe to say a mild "Silence of the Lambs" meets "Dune" meets H.R. Geiger.The creepy "Seven" imagery and herky-jerky cuts owes as much to the animation of The Quay Brothers as it does to the grotesque photography of Joel Peter Witkin. Unfortunately even the eye-candy imagery and effects can't save this plodding bore of a thriller. Predictable and uneffective script is only worsened by the flat delivery of the dialogue. It may not be the actor's fault (at least not Vaughn's and D'Onofrio's). I don't know how good of an actor Lopez is as I have never seen "Selena", but she kind of whiny, whimpering in her lines. I also noticed that Lopez keep a good heavy layer of lip gloss going in her "reality" character. I wonder if that helps her out when she's suited up in that rubber suit suspended from the ceiling while psychoanalyzing the killer? One other thing, this film has some rather gruesome images and I wouldn't recommend this for young teenagers or little children, even with the presence of pop "diva" Lopez. I am always surprised when I see parents dragging their little kids to films like this. And of course today, I saw no less than 3 small children (10 or under) at this film with parents. The film features some rather graphic scenes of abuse and murder, get a clue parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, first of all, I'll admit right away ... I'm one of those gals who goes to see movies simply because of the people that are in them, and not necessarily for the actual content of the film. (I don't do this ALL the time, mind you, but on occasion...) So, since I've been a big fan of Vince Vaughn's ever since I saw "Swingers" a few years ago, I knew that I had to see "The Cell". (Not to mention, the movie looked like it would scare the pants off of me, and I'm always up for a good scare.) So, I dragged my best friend to see it on opening night. (Much to her protest ... she likes scary movies too, but she'd had a bad feeling about this one.) So we got settled in our seats, with our popcorn and soda and what-have-you, and I was all ready for a great movie to start off my weekend, with a few chills along the way. Let me just tell you, I got more than I bargained for. While I'm not going to say that it was the best movie I've ever seen, I will say that it's worth braving the outrageously high ticket prices to go see it. Like I said in my one line description above, disturbing is the first word that comes to mind when asked to describe this movie. It's like absolutely nothing I've ever seen before. I don't think I've ever seen a movie, where I've been disgusted one second, snickering the next second and then hiding my eyes the next second. While the imagery in the movie might be a little too intense for some people (such as my best friend ... oh alright, and me too ... so what if I covered my eyes a few times?), it's simply too unique and bizarre a movie to pass up. I've already convinced my parents that they have to see it, and I hope I can convince you to see it too. Like I said, it's worth the money ... and the slight waves of nausea. :) Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i hadn't seen this movie for free, I would've been severely disappointed. If only the producers had spent more time on a script, this would've been an interesting movie. Instead it was a huge waste of time and talent. I could rehash the plot but there wasn't much to it. But it revolves around inept FBI agents, a smart but deranged psychopath and a brilliant yet sexy , single heroine. The film is pretty formulaic to the showdown and rescue. Lopez exuded talent and sex appeal in Selena and Out Of Sight but she pouts her way through this movie. D'onfrio is the saving grace, he seems to be the only one not taking this so serious. And what is with these seemingly normal individuals who enter the mind of a psycho and come out fine? And did these scientist have any moral hang-ups about doing this? How about the parents of Baine adding some conflict by not agreeing to allow the FBI to occupy the time set aside for their son? Could've been more interesting but everything just fell into place too easy. I guess the film makers sold out their script budget for film stock and dv equipment. &gt;By the way, did anyone ever consider not allowing those school kids at the end, to play near a crime scene?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CELL has it moments but thats about all. Jennifer Lopez in the lead female role is not right to say the least. She is a pretty face with a hot body but nothing more. Vince Vaughn as the protagonist FBI agent is wasted in this film.There is nothing to go on with his character. He is just there for facial expressions. The only one who deserves credit is D'Onofrio as the demonic villain.There is also a sub-plot in this film that is underdeveloped and thrown out for a quicker ending. Director Tarsem Singh must have watched a lot of music videos and Ken Russell films before embarking on this project. It shows. At least when Ken Russell makes a bad film it comes from the heart. Singh just pretends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects have replaced plot lines!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this movie because Roger Ebert held it in such high acclaim. He thought it was one of the three best movies of the year. I got 30 minutes into the movie and was surprised to find that the dialogue was shallow and boring, the acting was flat, and the plot line was a potentially good story gone wrong.The imagery was beautiful and creative but the story lacked depth. All these new movies are spending too much time on developing the special effects and they're forgetting that the plot is what makes the viewers lean forward in their seats. Unfortunately, many people go for this easy to understand, simple minded, type of movie and that's why so many more ofthese movies are being made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell has some interesting visuals that would look fantastic when seen independently of the movie. Unfortunately, when seeing them within the context of the film I couldn't appreciate them because I was so distracted by the poor acting and sophomoric dialogue. The movie looks like it was shot by a video director- a lot of flash trying to cover for little substance. I have a feeling that the concept pitched was "Jennifer Lopez in cool costumes with creepy scenery". Done well, this movie could have become another Seven. Instead, it ended up sinking to the depths of Stigmata. I recommend renting it, turning off the volume and making up your own dialogue. Trust me, you'll be happier if you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie and only mildly disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went into the theater to see The Cell I don't know what I was expecting. The trailer and commercials for the movie made no sense to me. Even after I saw Jennifer Lopez on some late night show to talk about her movie, I didn't understand anything about it. I probably wouldn't have even seen the movie if my friend didn't offer to get me in for free (he works at the theater). So when we went in the theater I noticed that there was on;y about eight other people in the room with us, so I immediately figured that this movie was going to suck. As it turns out, this is actually I movie that I would have liked to have seen even if it wasn't free. I think if the advertisements were better and focused more on reality, which is where the majority of the movie takes place, and not in the sci-fi world of the cell more people would want to see the movie. I'm not going to tell you exactly what the movie is about, I think it's better if you learn that for yourself. I know that part is contradicting itself. I mean that since the advertisments are already out and you already show some interest in seeing this movie I think it would be more interesting for you if you have no clue what to expect. I'm just gonna stop there before I start to confuse myself. Oh yeah, that's another thing. the commercials are slightly, no, extremely confusing, but the movie is surprisingly easy to follow. So overall I gave this movie a 7/10 stars. Another thing, if you're seeing this movie for some shots of Jennifer Lopez's ass don't see the movie, there is on;y one good butt shot in the whole movie, but there are lots of breasts. they aren't jennifer's though. And they're dead breasts. But hey they're still breasts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange, visually striking- yet empty and supremely disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading Ebert's four-star foaming-at-the-mouth review of Tarsem's new film, "The Cell", I was waiting to be completely mystified and enraptured by a truly great and unique film. What I got was a visually stunning motion picture with a plot that never truly builds or climaxes. It's also chock-full of hollow characters (aside from Vince Vaughn's generically obsessive g-man) who we don't give a damn about. I keep hearing the phrases "completely original" or "an experience you've never had at the movies" being tossed around to describe this flick. In its defense- sure, it looks and sounds great with wardrobes, sets, and dream-worlds that are indeed unique and nightmarish. Yet the plot, about a serial killer and his persuers is rehashed from several different films: the gritty style and atmosphere ("Seven"), the heinous murderer ("Silence of the Lambs"), the getting-inside-of-your-mind idea (the forgotten, yet fabulous "Dreamscape" from the early-80's and "Being John Malkovich", too).Ebert must have known he was going to get a lot of flack for his gushing review (which might as well have hailed it as 2000's "Citizen Kane"). Even though most other reviews have hit the nail on the head (USA Today gave it a 'D', and The Washington Post gave it a big fat 'F') with their comments, don't let influential critic Roger Ebert brainwash you into seeing this nice-looking turkey.

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and sickening - little redeeming value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't quite know what to say about this. I am a big fan of the movie "Jacob's Ladder," and this film managed to re-create (to an extent) the incredibly unusual depressing atmosphere of that film, but in a way much more visually graphic and MUCH thinner on plot and spiritual meaning. I feel that "Jacob's Ladder" was an atmospheric and spiritual masterpiece worth seeing, but I can't imagine why anybody would actually want to see "The Cell." I can't say that I was entertained in ANY WAY by this film, and in order for a movie to be worth something there must be SOME reason to pay the money, walk into the theater, and give 2 hours of time and attention. I walked out feeling very confused, with a sick feeling in my stomach. I had just seen some images that don't belong on the big screen, at least not in this kind of combination. The film felt very exploitative and something was just not right with the pacing... I can't put my finger on it. Also, the musical score was absolutely, horrendously bad (yes, I pay attention to film scores). Anyway, I don't have much more to say, because this one will be quickly and thankfully forgotten. It gave me a stomach ache and brought down my whole week. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silence of the Dreamscape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me of two thrillers put together into one film. The Oscar winning SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and the cult classic DREAMSCAPE, and put the two films together and you've got THE CELL. And one thing about THE CELL is that is has some of the most spectacular production designs since SLEEPY HOLLOW. THE CELL has a serial killer, Carl Stargher (Vincent D' Onofrio) a man who kidnaps young women and places them in a "cell" of sorts where as the hours go on, the glass cell fills with water until his victims drown to death. He then dumps their bodies and makes them up to look like porcelin dolls. Enter FBI agents Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) who are on the trail of Carl. They do find Carl, however he is unconscious and it's a matter of time before Carl's latest victim downs in his cage. So they are suggested a new scientific discovery, where a group of scientist are helping giving people therapy, they enter the troubled person's mind, through their dreams. And the only way the agents can know about the victim's whereabouts is by entering into Carl's mind. Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a therapist who is the kindest and gentlest person who can communicate with people better than anyone else. Catharine is a expert into traveling into other people's minds, so going into the mind of Carl will be a experience into hell that Catharine would never expect. There are some good points and bad points about THE CELL. The good points, THE SET DESIGNS!!!!! WOW!!! They are rather well done, a lot of imagination and creativity went into making this film. I really enjoyed how things seem real or surreal, and how entering another person's nightmares can be scary for the guest just as much as it is for the resident. I also liked how the movie was in a good pacing. It can be very suspensful and tense in some scenes and it does take it's time to slow down to catch it's breath. Then the acting is also good. I always enjoy Jennifer Lopez in SELENA and OUT OF SIGHT, and she did win me over with THE CELL. Also giving a good performance is Vince Vaughn as the FBI agent who suffers his own nightmares, and Vincent D'Onofrio as the sadistic killer. Then there is the bad points. The plot does seem muddled and thin at times. There are scenes where you think that the movie is going to be leading to, then it turns out to be a weak sub-plot. And with it's mixture of SE7EN and DREAMSCAPE it isn't that original, with the exception of the style of the dreams. And there are some really disturbing scenes to watch, I mean so disturbing that you will probably be turning green like I did. One of the most horrific scenes is what the Vincent D'Onofrio's character has on his back, and what he likes to do after killing his victims. But I did count more plus points than negative points for this film, so I enjoyed it. First time film director Tarsem Singh (who directed the symbolic R.E.M. video "Losing My Religion") does show the same style of symbolism and images in this film as he did in his music videos. And it does have some scenes that still can't leave my mind after watching it. It does have a dark and creepy mood to it, and then again, this is a terrifying thriller that works out pretty well. **** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generously gave it a 7 of 10...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would love to write a glowing report about the story, the actors, the writing. Instead, I can say the plot has too many flaws to rank this a must-see film. We have seen this story before, done much better. The performances were flat. The only real performance might be Vincent D'Onofrio, but even he couldn't save the film.Jennifer proves once and for all that her a** is hers and not surgically altered. Many people will see it for that few seconds at her refrigerator.The film has been described as a cross between Matrix and Silence of the Lambs. That might be said, although I heard fellow movie-goers saying a few other films bred into the screenplay. Fact is, if you are looking for Silence or Matrix, go and rent them, because this falls short of the mark.After my negative comments, let's look at why I was generous enough to give rehashed plot and characters a 7 out of 10. The visual imagery is simply stunning, beyond compare. What the plot and actors lack, the sets more than make up for. This is a film made for the big screen! See it in the theater. DVD isn't even quality enough for this. Experience it in the theater at least once.Check your brain at the door and just enjoy the colors, bright, dark, emotional. The cinematography is the real film, not the shoddy story along with it.Spoilers!!!! Warning, do not read if you do not want to know more...Shoddy detective work by the FBI is simply disappointing. The whole film pins the detective work on a woman entering a serial killer's mind to find a woman we barely care about. She is never given much of a soul to make us care if they find her alive or not. What agent would see a strange piece of machinery, which is obviously part of the mutilation chamber in the killer's home and no one is working on checking that angle until said detective "goes into" the killer's mind to save the well experienced child psychologist from remaining trapped. Then, like a revelation, he sees the symbol from the machinery in the killer's mind and connects it to the real world, calls his people to find the manufacturer. In the 30 plus hours they had to crack into the killer's brain, the FBI still hadn't finished setting up a grid in the killer's tiny home and no one had bothered to examine the cellar, where they found the incriminating video. Instead, the FBI had focused on the messy, tiny attic for the grid.The little boy - his father is wealthy and the boy is found on a seal island in a coma. Why tell us any of that? Why introduce his parents for 2 minutes and introduce a possible bad relationship between the kid's father and Lopez, then never examine either thing?I feel that Singh has a brilliant career ahead of him if only he can find a more polished screenwriter than Protosevitch, who also might have a career if he puts his own thoughts on his own stories rather than churning out bad imitations of other original screenplays.We already know Lopez has a glorious career ahead of her. Between modeling, acting, and singing, we will be seeing her for years. She needs to be more careful about script control. This character could have been more interesting, but again that falls on a poor writer. At least she isn't acting with snakes anymore.Vin D'Onofrio needs more vehicles to show his talents. Certainly, when the bio of Stephen King is made, he should get the role!Vince Vaughn has potential, but also needs to screen his roles more in the future, selecting the best vehicle to display his acting ability.Jake Weber, as usual, plays it low-key, barely noticeable by most movie-goers. Good character actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FX with emotion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over all it is a stunning film, gaining merit by it's technical qualities alone, it's fusion of emotion into computer artistry makes it a unique master peace. This film creates feelings and conflict with computer graphic technology rather than dialogue, and action. Which is a very difficult task, that has been failed by other films that relay heavily on special effects. I felt an intensity in many of the scenes that was quite refreshing. The film fell short a bit in the "real world" scenes. I felt distant from the story and rushed. The conflict Lopez's character felt about entering the mind of the killer seamed forced and the dialogue was week. It was not nearly as entertaining as when she is brought to the throne of the power by the beast of the killer's perversion. The advertizing was acceptable, and saved many of the best scenes for the movie. It didn't give the plot away. I wouldn't agree that this film was comparable to "The Matrix" or "Silence of the lambs" as the commercial states, but it is a good film none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice art school project but not worth the ticket price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to go see a 2-hour art project with some great special effects, go see The Cell. If you're looking for characters, plot, any form of depth, please don't waste your money. The Cell will ultimately disappoint you.The Cell focuses on a young psychotherapist (Jennifer Lopez) who enters the minds of coma victims via some techno-hyped contraption. When we first see her, she's trying to help a young boy. THAT STORY would have been much more interesting than the now much-used serial killer story line we are given.Instead, Lopez must enter the mind of the comatose serial killer to determine where he has hidden his latest victim before she meets her death. Enter Vince Vaughn as the FBI agent trying to use his wits to solve the case instead of techno hocus pocus. He and Lopez have NADA in the way of chemistry, adding to the cardboard natures of their characters. Vaughn tries very hard but he's given such lousy lines he can't. When they actually hook him up so he can do a three-way intervention with Lopez in the killer's mind, I had to laugh. A guy with NO training whatsover is just let loose like this. Somebody PLEASE call the APA!Lopez is likable enough but she's overshadowed by all the special effects. They look pretty enough but it felt like one long, drawn-out art film. All the religious imagery was fine and dandy but it completely overwhelmed it. Some of the nastier grotesque images could have been left out. I was sitting there an hour into the film thinking "When the heck are we going to have a plot??? When will I actually start to enjoy this???" It's a sad day when hype and effects become the story itself. Will the last person with a creative storyline for a movie please shut the door before you leave Hollywood in a cloud of dust? One last thought. Whoever dressed Lopez in the almost final scene in which she is wearing what resembles a 70s tablecloth should be smacked upside the head. What a nightmare...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confine yorself to a lengthy Jennifer Lopez music video without the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarsem Singh spins a feature length music video (great eye candy) abandoning the all important story along the way. The very beautiful Jennifer Lopez portrays a caring therapist with a special talent for treating comatose patients with a modified Vulcan mindmeld (aided by Gary Oldman's armor in Coppola's `Dracula' and props borrowed from `Coma' ).`The Matrix', `Dreamscape' and `Flatliners' are good primers to watch before viewing this film. Because Singh never shows the viewer what happens to people that enter other people's minds. Remember Faye Dunaway in `The Eyes of Laura Mars'? What happens to a person who `looks' into the eyes of a murderer? In `Dreamscape', Dennis Quaid plays an unwilling novice who quickly learns that entering other people's subconscious minds are not without severe consequences. Being a scoundrel, he later manages to enter co-star Kate Capshaw's dream too, uh Tarsem, BIG missed opportunity here! Kiefer Sutherland portrays a tormented soul in `Flatliners' who learns a painful lesson in life, what happens in death. His memorable performance unlike Lopez's endless droning is filled with the desperate emotions after he discovers what he has unleashed. Keanu in `the Matrix' spits up blood after getting whupped in his subconscious state. Lopez for her part never breaks a sweat throughout the entire length of the film, she just acts drowsy and dopey after her mindsurfing trips. She does however somehow manage to find time to do her hair before the key scenes in the film. Mindsurfing serial killers no big deal after all.Vince Vaughn playing a cheap version of Jodie Foster's role in `Silence of the Lambs', never explains certain disturbing statements he makes during the film. HUGH loss. The lambs were screaming their heads off and again a great story opportunity lost.Vaughn's character and his merry F.B.I. men are keystone cops in this picture. Call in the true experts who know how to read a crime scene: Scott Glen in `Silence of the Lambs', Eddie Murphy in `Beverly Hills Cop II' and Marissa Tomey in `My Cousin Vinny'. If you want to see a botched crime scene see the excellent documentary `The Thin Blue Line'. Can the F.B.I. be portrayed any dumber than in this film?Good performances from Jake Weber who plays Vaughn's partner with a good grasp of the case before he too gets caught up in Lopez's rope-a-dope, and also manages to ignore the mountain of physical evidence staring at his face. Vince D'Onofrio plays yet another psycho-killer, Surprise!Didn't care for the recycled instrument panel from Star Trek either. Critical scenes were flushed away by cheap looking screen shots featuring blinking text and screen clutter. Simple and effective computer screen sequences like the ones used in `The Fly' and `The Fly II' with Jeff Goldblum and Eric Stolz are critical in moving a story like this along. The Cell, awesome sets, costumes and makeup, No story. Call up Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, track down Hitchcock, there is much to learn.</fullReview>

The plot leaves enough mystery and uncertainty as real life does: Nothing is ever fully dis-covered, no one is completely known.

The "dream" sequences are great, with stunning visual effects (the Horse scene alone is fascinating!)... But, there are times when the story loses a chapter and skips ahead. Some of the plot points do get resolved (the child, for example), but others are just a bit off..., There are also times when the plot moves ahead TOO quickly and points are missed. Lopez does get some great lines, but they seem out of place for her character (especially the "this is my dream" line...)....

		<fullReview>I went into the theater expecting "Silence of the Lambs" meets "The Matrix," but to my dismay, what I got was "Marilyn Manson makes a two hour Music Video." The only thing that held this movie together was the visual effects. Jennifer Lopez didn't impress me as a Child Therapist, perhaps because she didn't do a whole lot of therapy, save the bathtub scene. That goes double for all the other characters. Vincent D'Onofrio is one of the most talented actors out there, but all the time we spent "in the mind" of this serial killer, I walked out hardly knowing anything about the character. What I needed was more interaction ala Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. I was much more afraid of Dr. Lecter than I was of Stargher, because Lecter seemed more real to me. The "Chicken Switch" embedded in Jennifer Lopez's hand, and the fact that she could leave at anytime, ruined the suspense for me. Content was also a problem. We scratched the surface on many interesting subjects, (religion, sex) but stopped short of finding anything else out. In my opinion diving into the mind of a serial killer the old fashioned way, good ol' conversation, was much more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is far overdone with FX that aren't needed. Hollywood has gone crazy for CGI, using it even when "normal" filming techniques would be cheaper and easier. A prime example: Jennifer Lopez "falls upwards" out of her cell, and impacts what seems to be water. Why not just put her in a pool, film it and dub? This effect worked great in an Enigma music video. Instead, they hang her on hooks and digitally remove gravity. Overall, this film was bizarre, with some genuinely creepy moments, but the "in-brain" sequences relied more on FX than creativity. Silence of the Lambs achieved the same effect much more efficiently.</fullReview>

I believe the movie was so graphic in the child abuse sequences that it could absolutely cause harm to children. Did anyone else feel that the rating was inappropriate? Silence of the Lambs was much more frightening without being nearly so graphic. Some of the scenes in this film were absolutely gratuitous violence; not relevant to the mind of the killer.

The Cell shows an interesting point: The audience feels the killer must be punished for his crimes yet as we explore the killer's childhood we begin to understand his motive to the things he had committed. The movie shows us that even though the man is a killer in his manhood he was not necessary bad when he was a kid. Conducted by the pain and suffering he went through his childhood he became the man he is. But, since the kid and the man are the same person, when the man is being hurt, the kid will also be hurt. I cannot say Jennifer Lopez gives an outstanding performance but she does give a decent one. Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio are well-admired actors by myself and I enjoyed their performances. I hope everyone else enjoyed or will enjoy the movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not like the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just went to see The Cell last night. I did think it would have been scarier from the previews than what it was. The art and cinematography was outstanding. The characters were very good, as well. But....the ending did not live up to the strong and substantial core.In my opinion only, and to my own taste: I wanted the ending to tie together with the "mind tranference". I thought that the climax should have proceeded with Catherine (Jennifer Lopez) finding out the whereabouts of the kidnapped victim in the "transference state" with the serial killer and then "transferring" her thoughts to the FBI character that had experienced the same with her previously, only getting some clues from the dream state, then , Catherine going back to help the child , which in turn , tells her where the victim was, and then Catherine mentally transferring the information to the FBI agent out in reality. Then as the FBI agent finds the victim, Catherine, at the same time "babtize" the child. (AT THE SAME TIME). It just seemed a waste to go through all of the great artistic scenes so well coordinated, and symbollic...to squelch the climax. Then the very ending with the child in the coma needed a better symbolic ending. I really felt like I was just put out in left field at the end of this creative movie. This is only my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the special effects in this movie blew me away and are probably the best of the summer, they are definately the most expressive and artistic. The story is a has been, serial killer takes a victim, everyone must find victim, police go to professionals for help...come on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, THE BONE COLLECTOR...etc. some parts made me squirm and others just entranced me as fantasy literally becomes reality in the mind of a killer.once again i must say that the effects blew me away and jennifer lopez did an excellent job as she took on the personas of a therapist, a saint and jennifer, warrior princess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind is a terrible thing to waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cell" starts out like a formula movie, with two parallel stories - the serial killer chase and the mind-altering therapy - that soon converge into a preordained plot and conclusion. You have seen this movie before including the repeated line, 'remember this is not real'. There is nothing to save this film from its ordinariness, not the suspenseful buildup, not the special effects, not the suspend-your-disbelief story, not the simplistic characterizations, and not even a lovely Jennifer Lopez who is asked to do very little acting. The film has been compared to "Silence of the Lambs" but, in truth, it is a lot closer to "Altered States". "The Cell" is inferior to both films because of lack of sophistication, lame dramatic payoffs, and a surprising lack of conviction. Take the cell, which should be the centerpiece of the film, but draws about as much fear as an overflowing commode. Compared that to the cell in "Silence of the Lambs" where the diabolic Hannibal the Cannibal held court. Or the ingenuity of "Altered States" compared with "The Cell" - covered faces on suspended bodies with garb taken from either "Star Trek" or "Dune". The story has more holes than Swiss cheese including a daring 'rescue' involving a third mind-traveler and a final solution which begged the question of why no one thought of it earlier. It starts to get confusing when the trapped Jennifer Lopez character starts looking like Carmen Miranda or the menacing killer seems to resemble Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Campy, this film is not. You have to ask yourself about the film's conviction when it seeks sympathy for this dastardly violent psychopath and yet wants us not to excuse him just because he was abused badly by his father. "The Cell" is a lot like a cheap joyride - good for that furious burst of anticipated fear but lacking any direction nor value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's fulcrum is a series of brutal images, ranging from gross child abuse to violent sexual practices. (It does manage to separate the two while still connecting them.) These postcards from hell are interleaved with some truly beautiful visuals, mostly computer generated other than Jennifer Lopez's face. There are many Hindu and Christian icons to look for.As others have said, the plot is obviously an excuse for the foray into the mind-images the film was made to show us. The FBI agents in the movie were perfectly capable of solving the case without the virtual-reality mind probe machine. Interestingly enough, the screenplay makes this fact clear and I suspect that is deliberate.Speaking of Lopez, I don't agree with the comments that say she isn't good. I think she made a reasonably convincing character which would have been difficult for anyone with this script.Go see it, but leave the younger kids at home. If there was ever a good reason for NC17 as opposed to R, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take the most gruesome parts of Silence of the Lambs--those sections with the girl in the pit in the basement--and multiply by quite a bit. Now take away all the interesting dialog and great acting. Throw in some very interesting special effects and you have The Cell.I have a very hard time understanding why anyone would want to watch a movie that so intensely depicts abduction and torture, and the sick mind that might do such things. I am not squeamish, but The Cell went waay too far. Don't let the special effects draw you in--that's why I went. The story and acting here cannot come close to justifying having to sit through even one of the at least six or seven extremely disturbing scenes in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film today, and I felt compelled to comment on it. I am sure that a lot of people walked away from The Cell lauding it as an intense thriller. I, however, am not one of those people. Having said this, let's get to work.First of all, the pacing is a little slow. Not slow enough to ruin the picture, but enough so that there were moments when I was aware of the time passing by. A well paced movie flows from beginning to end, and when it's over you stand up wondering where the two hours went.Secondly, the script leaves a lot to be desired. The "thriller" was rather formulaic in my opinion. There were no significant plot twists, and I knew exactly how the movie was going to end well before it ended. Also, the entire set of dream sequences, although impressive, had little to no bearing on the outcome of the story. Everything that happens as far as cracking the case is concerned occurs in the real world. For this movie, the sub-plot is far more interesting than the actual plot, which is a big no-no.Perhaps the worst fault in the script is that it is highly implausible. This technology that allows an individual to enter the mind of another is absolutely ludicrous, and I found myself unable to make that leap successfully.Despite these setbacks, the movie does have its good points, the main one being Tarsem Singh. He took the less-than-extraordinary script to this movie and exploited its strengths to the max, which is a very smart move. The irrelevant dream sequences are absolutely stunning, giving The Cell its well deserved label of "eye candy."Also, Singh put his talented cast to good work, allowing them the freedom to add their own unique spin to the characters. Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn turn in convincing performances, and Vincent D'Onofrio/Jake Thomas play a very disturbing Carl Stargher, even though together they speak about 6 times in the movie.Therefore, on a scale from 1 to 10, this movie falls in the 5-6 range. If you absolutely must see it, then go see it in a theater, because anything less would be an injustice to the marvelous visual effects being presented. However, don't walk into the theater expecting anything more than impressive eye candy, because you will find yourself sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Cinematic Sequences; very creative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed what Tarsem Singh tries to accomplish: telling a somewhat familiar tale by using incredible camera tricks in key areas of the film.Once you see Jennifer Lopez in this film, you will realize that it was not her acting ability that got her the title role. Her beauty make up for her lack of emotion. Yet, she is effective.However,help thinking that Meryl Streep would have crushed in the female lead role.I think that Hollywood would do well to look outside this country for talented directors. So many trained in America are so influenced by the Hollywood smash-bang blockbuster mentality .What American director would have thought of using the camera like that during the baptism sequence? Not many that come to my mind. It seems that in the movies from India that I have seen the direction is very much focused on visuals, and using the camera creatively. It would be nice to see this in more mainstream Hollywood films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarsem: Magritte on the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One angle about THE CELL that I haven't seen mentioned yet is its relation to surrealist painting. Sure, lots of people use the word "surreal" in their descriptions of this film, and some liken it (incorrectly) to a Dali painting, but there are more substantive connections, and they are worth pointing out.The two main influences I see are Delvaux and Magritte. Delvaux's influence is the simpler of the two: his paintings are filled with pale, nude, mannequin-esque women. Often, these figures are framed in confining spaces, or are shown partly submerged in water. Skeletons frequently hover around Delvaux's nudes, suggesting death.Magritte's influence appears much more profound, and understanding it should clear away misconceptions about the role of plot in this movie. Most critics, even people who liked THE CELL, complain about the thin, predictable, sometimes klunky story. "Style over substance" is practically a mantra in reviews of this film. I think THE CELL is best understood as a Magritte painting in motion. One of the most striking things about Magritte is the way his paintings suggest a story, or resonate with implications of some larger narrative. Almost always, this looming sense of story is dark, threatening, nefarious. Magritte "quoted" liberally from pulp detective magazine covers, FANTOMAS movie posters, and the like. Tarsem's choice of a serial killer story as the ostensible context for his truly dreamlike flood of images, therefore, makes him the cinematic heir of Magritte's legacy.The influence does not end there, though. The cloths draped over the faces of those connected through THE CELL's dream technology are directly reminiscent of several of Magritte's earlier paintings, in which human figures appear with cloths over their heads. In both the paintings and THE CELL, the cloths suggest impeded breathing, and especially in the film they play on primal fears of suffocating in one's sleep. Interestingly, Magritte's mother died by drowning, and many critics have drawn associations between this event and the smothering cloths in the paintings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This my friends is one very strange movie. If I were to break this film down into components I would say it's an even mixture of "The Matrix" and "Strange Days" with more than a generous touch of the Grateful Dead to make this journey complete. The movie began true to form, your run of the mill type of serial killer movie. Then, after about the first thirty minutes or so, the movie took a hard right turn onto the exit marked "Oz" and never returned. The special effects were very well done, and the acting was decent, but I found the story quite weak. On a scale of 1-10, I gave "The Cell" 4 qualudes, and 2 valium for a total of 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most interesting thing about this movie is how EMOTIONAL people get over it. I mean, look at the plot:A psychiatrist seeks to contact a comatose killer's subconscious to find out where he has hidden his last victim (who is still alive).Okay, fine. So far, nothing special. If you gave this plot to 10 different directors and told them to make a movie out of it, 8 would make average movies, one would be above average, and one would be so-so.Now add Jennifer Lopez. THIS gets some people EMOTIONAL. Many critics (both the professional and the self-appointed kind) seem to become rabid when her name comes up. Jennifer Lopez? The movie must SUCK! It must be shallow, tacky, and un-wholesome! I wonder where people get all this animosity from. Give the poor woman a chance. Don't hold her beauty or her uninspired musical career against her. Her role in this movie is not all that tough to play, and she does a fine job. Doubt she'll get an Oscar for this one, but she holds her own and delivers what's needed of her character.Now add Tarsem. THIS also gets some people EMOTIONAL. Many seem to feel that a movie directed by a guy who also makes commercials and music videos can't be taken seriously. Why not? I don't know. They don't know either, I bet. I mean, film is a visual medium by nature (if it wasn't, it would be radio). And so we have this guy, Tarsem, who is really good at packaging narrative content into creative and visually-engaging formats (that is what commercials and music videos are, after all) and he has been given more time and a bigger budget than ever before. Think about it, and you'll see that this is a good thing.Now add the violence. More EMOTIONAL people. The movie is gory in parts, yes. Is it necessary for it to be so gory? Tough call. But then again, it DOES involve a serial killer...Now mix these ingredients together, and you get a gory and violent movie, starring Jennifer Lopez, that is packed with more creative images, symbolisms, and cinematographic acrobatics than your mind can handle. And that gets people who have seen it very, very worked up and emotional.Worth seeing? Yes. Definitely. But do yourself a favor and let the movie work its thing on you -- don't go in there all biased and miss the forest from the trees. Appreciate the visual overload, be thankful that the plot stays true to itself and doesn't pull any cheap cop-out tricks on you, and try to savor how unique and un-summer-movie-like this summer movie is.And hey -- even if you don't like it, you'll at least get a rush out of it and have passionately slanderous things to say about its creators.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid piece of filmmaking from Tarsem, in his major film debut. This film has something most American films lack: imagination. And what an imagination this director has. The script is solid, the performances on point (Sure we could always use more character development), and the visuals are an added bonus. Ms. Lopez proves herself to be one of films most exciting risk-takers by starring in this film. Vince Vaughn adds his usual rock-steady cool, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste is always exciting to watch - though I would have loved to see her venture into the killer's mind for a minute. Vincent D'Onofrio remains one of my top 5 favorite character actors, and is very effective here, as usual. He's played so many different characters it's hard to typecast him. His Starger is his creepiest role yet. So many American films are afraid to take any real chances, which is unfortunate. The last American film I saw prior to "The Cell" which took my breath away was "Magnolia". And that was last December. Think of all the films that have been released between "Magnolia" and "The Cell". Good job to everyone involved in the making of this movie.</fullReview>

Except that Jennifer Lopez goes in the mind of people, not in dreams.- spoilers alert -The movie is well done, but so highly predictable.. we all knew when they talked about the 3rd chair that Vince Vaughn would jump in somehow, we all knew they would find the girl when the level was right at the top..There is NOTHING you can't predict in that movie.

		<fullReview>Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly good as the child psychologist that, with the aid of technology, is able to walk through people's minds.A combination of science fiction and thriller, this film will primarily be acknowledged for its incredible style and visual impact. The overall look of the film is astounding: Ranging from absolute stark desolation to rich and verdant lushness.The film is neither as frightening nor as gory as some would have you believe ? rather the gore and thrill aspects are required by the plot, the visuals, and the story.The things you see are stunning ? unfortunately if you have seen the television commercials you have seen most of the best.From audience reaction I am surprised that for some people this may not be an easy film to watch; but I was intrigued by nearly every moment of it.One technological aspect that I truly enjoyed was the sound of the film ? NOT the music or soundtrack ? but the way everyday sounds were used to accentuate key moments in the story.The costumes by Ieko Ishioka -- when in the ?out-of-body' sequences -- were less costume and more sculpture.Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn were completely believable in their roles as the serial killer in a coma and the FBI agent looking for his current victim.This film seemed to be billed as a horror flick but it turned out to be a mental thriller.Not a film for everyone ? but if you want to see a Sci-Fi/Thriller/Horror flick with an exotic visual style this IS your film to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'd pretty much have to agree with most of what has been posted about this movie. it's worth seeing on the big screen ONLY for the set design, wardrobe and mind-blowing effects which are undoubtedly some of the most visually stunning effects ever to be seen in film. Then we have the contrived plot (which is more of an excuse to make this film) which embodies all the cliches and stereotypes of a serial killer film in one two-hour motion picture. And lastly we have Jennifer Lopez, the 2 billion dollar butt, who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, with her Shirley Temple curls and her 80s lip gloss. If not for the effects and D'Onofrio's performance, this would've been a worthless two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how empty this film was. I was impressed with the performance by Jennifer Lopez only because I had VERY low expectations after I saw her performance in U-Turn. She seems to be a little better than she used to be, however still only manages a level of competence at the role that you might expect from William Shatner doing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, but I digress. The movie borrows heavily from most psychological thrillers you can name, in particular Silence of the Lambs.The only portions of the film that were not recipe were the internal aspects of the killer's mind. The failure of this concept is that, while visually impressive, the images aren't specifically detailed or abstract in any meaningful way. There is no useful symbolism employed in Carl's mind in the way of how the mind operates, or what Schizophrenia is like, or any representation of how they might solve their predicament. As such the movie seems very contrived and does not deliver suspense or thrills. All it delivers is a series of strange and meaningless images that are briefly interesting to view.Two more points: the soundtrack was one of the most painful to listen to since The Untouchables and possibly even before, furthermore, if ONE MORE film tries to mount tension by asserting the "If your mind thinks you die, then you die in the real world." premise, I'm going to walk straight out of the theatre. In a phrase- OVERUSED PLOT DEVICE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After a summer of so-so films, "The Cell" is a good change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cell" is a film that is not for everyone. It's for people who like to try something different, but like some exotic foods, you have to acquire the taste for it. This isn't the perfect movie but in a summer of films that continually disappoint (such as the incredibly over-hyped "X-Men"), "The Cell" is a welcome change of pace. Many have cited the plot as being weak. Granted, the "on-the-track-of-the-serial-killer-to-save-the-victim" storyline has been used to ad nauseum. But it's never been presented visually like this. The direction of the film is marvelous. Tarsem's direction brings a vivid sense of wonder and imagination to the screen. One reviewer on this site bemoaned his past as a music video director, but compared to the crop of directors out there creating bland, non-daring films, Tarsem follows in the steps of Fincher in bringing to life bizarre stories in a fascinating and original way. As I mentioned above this film is not for everyone and I can see how one could dislike the film. New ideas and images in film are met with uncertainty and hostility because they rock the boat (take Stanley Kubrick and reactions to his early works at the time, for example). "The Cell" is a new type of film that one who is curious and marvels at change should see. The story may not rock your world, but the visual originality will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would definitely recommend this movie for all those adepts of "weird" visuals out there (without going as far as recommending it to hard core David Cronenberg fans...) The serial killer storyline in itself is not as disturbing as David Fincher's "Seven" for instance(same thing goes for the acting), but the fact that the exceptional visuals are just as spectacular and elaborate (if not superior) as those found in the "Matrix", this, in my book, is worth the compliment "The Cell" deserves. I very much enjoyed Vincent D'Onofrio's offering as the schizo serial killer (although I should possibly have researched if the very rare and peculiar form of schizophrenia he displayed was real or fictional before stating this unequivocally). Jennifer Lopez gave us better acting in Soderbergh's "Out of Sight". As for Vince Vaughn, he was decent or "égal ? lui-m?me" (nothing can be worse than his horrible performance in "Swingers"). Bottom line, the clever/elaborate visuals make this movie a must-see "techno-fantasy", not the plot. For an intricate storyline in that specific genre, I recommend the Spanish "Open your eyes" with Penelope Cruz or any David Fincher film (especially "Fight Club" and "The Game") if you happen to be a Fincher fan (which I am).8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-SOME INFORMATION REGARDING THE PLOT IS GIVEN BELOW-This film made up in imagery for what it lacked in a script. Praise goes to Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn for doing their best in an underdeveloped script which relied too heavily on visual imagery to tell the tale of a twisted schizophrenic played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Lopez has done better work (see: "Out of Sight", "Selena") and Vince Vaughn was stymied in this nightmarish journey through the subconscious (for examples of his talent see: "Swingers", "Clay Pigeons", "Return to Paradise"). Although the imagery was excellent and intense at times, I would rather watch a movie with say, a laid out and fully diagramed plot rather than a 30 minute short story stretched to an unbelievably long 107 minutes. What do you expect from a music video director who went to the "Michael Bay School of Directing"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like in life, sometimes things are too good to be true in movies. The Cell is a great example of this. It has a great premise (In order to save a serial killer's latest victim, they must go inside of his mind), but ultimately falls flat on it's face, causing the viewer to become quite frustrated. The acting is sub-par, and the plot has a major hole the size of Texas, almost as if this is a b-movie with a big budget. And much like Hollow Man, the film presents very interesting concepts, and fails to explore them to their fullest. Another half hour of the mind sequences might have came close, but that is uncertain. New director Tarsem shows that he has a flair for the visual, however he is unable to pull this screenplay out from the gutter. The movie may look cool, but it is a shiny apply ridden with worms on the inside. Grade C-</fullReview>

If this was a music video, it would be incredible. Instead we have two highly underwritten cliched characters, that I could care less about! We have a scene where Jennifer Lopez sits at home, in her underwear, smoking a joint, watching sadistic cartoons...talk about character development..!Think about it, what do we know about Lopez's character, besides her being a devoted child psychologist. NOTHING. Boy, it's tough work bringing that character to life. Oh, and the tortured FBI agent who works relentlessly to bring criminals to justice, I've never seen that before! Or the serial killer, was (gasp!) abused by his father when he was young..well, that's totally new...! This movie is about one thing: eyecandy. And I admit, I loved the visuals, but I need more. Even the score sucked. The opening title song made me want to shoot myself it was so headache inducing.When will people learn that CHARACTERS are what make movies interesting. Not special effects...! If you want to see a real movie, with interesting characters, and unpredictable story, AND great visuals, save your money and buy the 'Fight Club' DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Fooled...This is NOT "The Next Matrix"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 rating, which reflects my disappointment in watching it. The TV advertisements were really cool, so I was surprised to find the movie to be a bit of a chore to get through. The story is similar to "Silence of the Lambs," but with a far inferior script and a cast of instantly forgettable actors, including Lopez, who confirms many people's assessment that she can sort of act (and sort of sing and sort of dance) but brings nothing truly interesting or inspired to the art. There were many times during the film I felt like I was watching a really bad TV police drama. A note to Hollywood writers: if you have more than three characters whose main purpose is to sit around waiting for other actors to do something, you have a problem! Also, about every fourth sequence in the movie involved someone being tortured, which I found difficult to watch after a while.As far as the special effects go, they were OK, but had nowhere near the visceral impact of "The Matrix." What many in the movie-making industry have yet to figure out is the reason the SFX "worked" in that movie (as well as "Star Wars," "2001," heck, even "The Wizard of Oz") is because in these movies the EFFECTS served the STORY, not the other way around. There was some nice cinematography, but all in all the visuals weren't great or even very good.If you must see this film, save your money and wait for the video. Even in a less-than-stellar summer movie season, you would not be missing anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Graphic scenes of twisted reality made me shift uncomfortably in my seat, however I love it when a movie makes me do that. It was that kind of mood that kept me watching and enjoying. The visual and audio effects were astounding as they manipulated my mind and kept me on the edge of the realization that I was watching somebody's inner sanctum.Although at times the plot made me reel back and start to critique the movie with large amounts of cynicism, I thought that the originality of the movie made up for its obviousness in its destination. I was impressed with the paralleling of scenes, and the lengths the movie went to express the effects of human cruelty.As for the acting, Jennifer Lopez is not something to write home about. However, I believe her character was straight forward and without much depth so it did little to hinder the movie. Vincent Vaughn had a few moments to impress, and I thought did a commendable job of straying away from his former characters in movies like Swingers. Overall, I would say this was definitely a movie that strove for originality and placed high above much of any other movie that has presented itself on the screen in the recent months.</fullReview>

The whole thing started off interesting enough but about halfway through, the movie lost its edge, and I found myself wishing I'd gone to see Spike Lee's new flick instead. And while I'm on the subject of disappointments, Vince Vaughn, a normally phenomenal actor, seemed to be reading off cue cards the whole time. Sigh. So much for the saving grace.</fullReview>

I'm thinking... no HOPING top awards go to set and costume design of this movie.Unfortunately the reality parts of THE CELL is dull and slow-moving and sadly predictable. I'm so nauseatingly tired of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SE7EN rip-offs in place of serial killer movies. It would've been a whole lot of fun without the serial killer subplot or even a subplot at all. Just a trippy full-length dreamscape movie with jaw-dropping, eye-gazing images. Maybe add some music and create a kind of new millennium YELLOW SUBMARINE or TOMMY.As for Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn. I don't think their acting ability is c-average. Just their performance, rent OUT OF SIGHT and SWINGERS together, and you'll see what I mean. Vincent D'Onofrio is always a good freak (rent FULL METAL JACKET, too) and I wish Pruitt Taylor Vince had a bigger part. Wait a minute? Three Vince's? What's up with that?My biggest complaints are just the teases or under-developments of this movie. Average shot of Jennifer in panties (coulda been better), why is she lighting a joint, really? Why doesn't her chemistry sizzle more with Vaughn? And with all the supporting characters there, why won't they do something? Especially Dylan Baker, who was just a waste here.Overall, though, the most creative movie out yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Silence of the Lambs meets Matrix it's not, but that hype aside, it was for the most part an entertaining film that I'm glad I saw in the theater.Film makers must LOVE to get to do "dream worlds" as there are no rules and you're free to play with the camera any way you think is clever. They did just that here and there are some very clever visuals.The story wasn't all that bad either but it wasn't strong enough to last to the end. You could almost hear it running out of breath as the 2 hour visual marathon counted down.Despite the weak ending I would still recommend seeing this in the theater, at matinee prices. Now, if you have a killer DVD home theater with projection screen, it could wait for rental.spoiler ending discussion, turn back if you don't want to know the end of this film===========spoiler ending discussion, turn back if you don't want to know the end of this film===========spoiler ending discussion, turn back if you don't want to know the end of this film===========spoiler ending discussion, turn back if you don't want to know the end of this film===========spoiler ending discussion, turn back if you don't want to know the end of this film=========== Ok, you've been warnedWell before the credits roll on the end of this film, Vince Vaughn finds the clues he needs to save the missing girl. There is NO tension here, even his struggles to break open her cell are anticlimactic and inevitable. As mean as it sounds it might have been more powerful if they had been too late and he rushes back to Jennifer Lopez' side to help her destroy the evil serial killer. Forget that, way too complicated.Then there's Jennifer Lopez' desire to save "the child inside" of the serial killer, so she goes back in on her own. PLEEEEEASE. How convenient they built a system where she can easily lock out all the SCIENTISTS and go it alone. Contrived enough? Nope, she also knows how to set the system up in a specific untried way that allows the killer into her mind. Well, it happened just like that and in a wonderfully gory sequence she defeats him "on her turf". Now if that's not enough, she manages to save "the boy inside" by drowning him in a baptismal-like ceremony. Back in the "real world" the killer dies from the relief of being saved? Humm, guess so.Ok, sure - why the heck not? You want a happy ending, BUT it was so formula and anticlimactic. It would have been much stronger if the killer actually fooled her into thinking she defeated him and used her to escape to another body - like the little boy she was trying to reach in the beginning. Is that possible? Of course it is...this is a movie.</fullReview>

Or the serial killer, was (gasp!) abused by his father when he was young..well, that's totally new...! This movie is about one thing: eyecandy. And I admit, I loved the visuals, but I need more. Even the score sucked. The opening title song made me want to shoot myself it was so headache inducing.When will people learn that CHARACTERS are what make movies interesting. Not special effects...! If you want to see a real movie, with interesting characters, and unpredictable story, AND great visuals, save your money and buy the 'Fight Club' DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will give you images that you are not likely to be soon forgetting. Incredible cinematogrophy, just incredible. The story is not as detailed and intricate as other classic movies, but so what? This movie is eye candy and there is nothing wrong with that. This movie wants to show you what goes on in the mind of a killer and examine why they think and act the way they do. I am not a "schizo" but I reckon that the images of the ones that we see in this movie are pretty close to that world. The director takes you into the fantasy world created by a serial killer. You will be amazed as Lopez is able to enter his world and look for clues to a remaining mystery that he has left behind. Each time Lopez must tell herself that "this is not real," good luck. The movie has a lot of style and I like style. There are no overly "hollywood" scenes and the end does make you feel some compassion for someone that many might consider a monster. I harken back to a line from The Silence of the Lambs, "Serial killers are not born, they are made." Evil can motivate people to do unspeakable things, and just maybe, they are deserving of some compassion, along with their victims.</fullReview>

Vince Vaughn is wonderfully understated as an FBI agent. Lopez's performance is adequate especially given how good she has been elsewhere, but she's mostly here to look good (which she does).

		<shortDescription>Stunningly intense visual cinematic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film tonight and I was stunned. To start off with, the visuals were amazing. Very well-done and well designed and put to very good use. I read somewhere that someone thought all the visuals were 'pretentious'. Whatever that means. It's a very imaginary film. And I think of this as a film. There are certain movies that I regard as 'movies' and not 'films', and the highest, most well-done cinematic experiences rich in certain details are 'films'. This is a 'film' in many senses. I read the script a while back and new that it was intensely original (no matter what the ignoramous critics may say) and that the person who wrote it possessed a love and knowledge of all things of the art and mind. "The Cell" deals with the issues of the mind combined with art. And the way different art reflects different states of mind. Brilliant. My favorite part would probably have to be when Vince Vaughn (footnote, he has terrible bags under his eyes, but anyway..) first goes into the mind of Carl Stargher. He wakes up in a pond and sees three women shrouded in black and sitting staring up at the sky reminiscent of an Egyptian painting. At least to me. And they each turn to him simultaneously and whisper something like "Have you seen my son?" Spooky and very imaginative. I like the whole idea of his victims populating his mental universe. Of course they would; they're on his conscience and subconscience, either out of guilt or simple memory. And they've become helpless prisoners and victims of his world forever, and his latest victim was destined for that unless they could save her. I won't spoil the ending here, but I have to say about one aspect of the film's ending: Jennifer Lopez returns to Carl's mind as the Virgin Mary in a very sweet and gentle scene and cleanses young Carl before he dies. In this film, they don't just find the serial killer and kill him, they cleanse him. (And I'm not religious or anything, but I still found that very profound and wise.) Roger Ebert said he felt this is one of the best films of the year because you really care about the characters. He's absolutely right. And it's one of the best films of the year for every other reason. Kudos to Eiko Ishioka, costume designer. She won an Academy Award for her work on Bram Stoker's Dracula. Do I sense another Oscar coming?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I just expected too much based on the very intriguing trailers. Maybe I've seen one too many 'gotta find the victim before they die' films. If you take away the 20 or so minutes of great costumes, visual effects, and surreal images, one is left with a very average 'detective racing against the clock seeking help from an unusual source' thriller. Taken as such, it's not a bad film - it just isn't a great film. Don't go see it expecting The Matrix 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good vs. Evil? No! Compassion vs. Rage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this movie is NOT for everyone. This movie is very gory and sexually twisted. That being said, this is the best movie I've seen this year. The movie runs away from the typical movie plots. The FBI agent isn't at odds with the local police department and forced take on the bad guy solo. No, here Vaughn works with the local police perfectly just like they do in real life. He doesn't bust down the door alone like Jodie Foster, instead he sends in a well armed SWAT team. It's the little things like this that I enjoy. They also don't play the typical good vs. evil plot where the bad guy is completely one dimensional and inhuman. Here, D'Onofrio plays a tormented soul who is battling internally with his rage from his excessively abusive childhood.The Cell asks the tough question, can we be compassionate to a killer because he/she was tortured and abused as a child? Vaughn hints at the idea that he was abused as a child and as a victim you don't have to turn to violence and that it doesn't take away responsibility.Overall we get poignant observations on how we as humans view abuse, pain, death, and compassion and all of this is wrapped up in a tremendously visual experience. It's the plot of `Silence of the Lambs' with the visuals of `What Dreams May Come' put inside of a Nine Inch Nails video.There's no paltry dialogue or forced love story getting in the way of plot, which is upsetting for typical movie go-ers but, perfect for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMAZING FILM...filmmaking that does not hold back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read other peoples' reviews of this movie, I am glad that they are able to point out all of the characteristics that they can. However, the characteristics that make this movie GOOD are what they say make the movie horrible.Lets get the visual effects out of the way. Yes, they are amazing. They deserve awards for many different things: costumes, effects, and definitely cinematography. I was constantly wowed by what the director and cinematographer did and were willing to try. The eyes are definitely made happy.Other reviews that I have read here say that this movie is confusing and somewhat choppy. This is what makes this movie such a success. Any person who expects a serial killer's mind to be nice and organized so that the movie can navigate smoothly through is an idiot. The fact that the director seized the opportunity to show the world of the serial killer's mind so well is amazing. He didn't organize the man's thoughts so that movie goers didnt have to think; he let them run wild, and run wild they do.I would say that the editing deserves some credit in this film also. The confusion that others complain about came to exist much in the editing process. The editors, like the director, went crazy and jumped around, splicing in many different shots in a short amount of time, made the film jumpy so that the mind really does appear confusing. Its amazing what fine filmmaking can come out with. We really get into the killer's mind and are as confused as he is. We want to find organization; we want to be let out of the "cell" and the director makes it hard for us to be there, and makes us realize the inner turmoil that this man is experiencing.All of the complaints about the plot having "holes" most likely originate from this technique that the makers were employing. It seems that anything that was left out, that might confuse some viewers, was done exactly for that reason. It was done to show that not everything can be known and that the mind is definitely not a perfect place. Everything was definitely deliberate, and done SO well.I have a feeling that some of the other general complaints, and those bad reviews that everyone reads come from the fact that some reviewers were just disgusted by this film. They wanted to go to the movie theater, go inside a serial killer's mind, and see nice pretty ponies, and not the horror that actually goes on there. These filmmakers did not chicken out in order to get good reviews and to allow viewers to sit happily and not squirm in their seats. They show you reality, and a horrific reality it is. Be scared, be disgusted; they want you to be. And it wouldn't be a good film if you weren't.FINE FILM!! So, all of you who did not understand, or could not appreciate, what the makers of this movie were attempting to do, and did so well, go back and see the movie again and watch closely. It will amaze you.</fullReview>

Here we have a movie with some of the most incredible and surreal scenes I've ever seen on film, yet it is marred by a very cliche plot and cheesy sci-fi techy crap that doesn't seem to fit in.Travelling into the mind of a psychotic schitzophrenic sounds like a fabulous idea for a film. Using this idea one could easily get away with presenting the audience with very abstract visuals. Indeed there are some absolutely brilliant and shocking scenes in the film with some marvelous and stylish techniques used. I loved the sudden jerks that the camera makes as well as the metallic sounds crashing now and then to make the killer's mind seem all the more twisted. I loved the grainy appearance of the surreal sequences as well... and the gore that makes one cringe.However, there could have been MANY more of these scenes in the movie. There weren't enough of them and contrasting these brilliant visuals with the absolutely DULL and and drawn out scenes outside of the killer's mind, made the movie seem like a roller coaster ride between absolute sensory overload and ridiculous schlock. Jennifer lopez' performance was average if that, and the story was a very predictable one.Also the fusion of a sort of science fiction element to the film made it seem more ridiculous. The film would have been more unique and scary if the process of entering the mind of the killer would have been more of a spiritual one, rather than involving far fetched and generic looking gadgetry.This movie would have been excellent if it had made no compromises in order to be more accessible to the close minded movie watching public known as "the shallow choch who loves visuals but doesn't care about plot or acting".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell: Serial killers are a terrifying breed - unlike "regular" murderers motivated by passion, or occasionally money, there is never a simple motive for their crimes, which makes them difficult to catch. The FBI has a special group whose sole job is to track down these monsters: part cop, part psychologist, part psychic, they use sophisticated diagnostic tools to determine who these killer might be (age, race, etc) and why they kill. When a notorious predator falls into a coma agents desperately try to revive him to find where he is holding his latest victim. With time running out, they enlist the aid of a child therapist who, using a new technology, literally steps into the mind of the serial killer, and embarks on a terrifying journey.I read several advance reviews that call this movie a fusion of "The Matrix" and "The Silence of the Lambs". That annoys me: although the film is about a serial killer, and a missing victim, the similarities end there. "Silence" boasted a tight, well-written script, with fleshed out characters, complex relationships and a composite of several real life serial killers (they don't hand out five Oscars on a whim). Likewise, "The Matrix" connection is tenuous at best - its clever, unique plot was bolstered and not completely overwhelmed by - I hate to use the phrase because it sounds so cliched - its groundbreaking special effects. "The Cell's" plot is a thin veneer whose sole purpose is to stitch together the numerous digital sequences. It is haphazardly constructed, inconsistent and at times confusing. The characters are essentially shadows with minimal dialogue - is there any particular reason that Ms. Lopez whispers throughout the entire film? It seems like a cheap Marilyn Monroe imitation. Vincent D'Onofrio is the only person who gives an above average performance and given the state of his character, the bulk of it is physical. Obviously, that means I didn't enjoy the movie. Not necessarily.From the opening sequence, the viewer is immersed in an amazing visual spectacle that fluctuates between stunning beauty, frightening decay and utter confusion. The initial foray into the killer's mind is especially daring and disturbing, definitely one of the most innovative artistic sequences I've seen on film - if Picasso, Warhol and Dali collaborated on a digital imaging project, they would create something like this. Whenever the characters were in the fantasy realm I was totally engrossed whether I was being treated to a warped glass menagerie, sadomasochistic nightmare or bizarre passion play. Unfortunately, they always returned to lackluster reality, which in this instance is particularly banal. This could have been a great movie - as it is, it's still worth the price of admission for the stunning imagery.</fullReview>

Either my taste in movies has changed (which I think is partially true), or this movie largely stank. Clumsily plotted and paced, this movie drones on and on without ever really engaging the viewer. Unlike "Silence of the Lambs" and "The Matrix" (which in recent commercials for this film was compared to), it lacks the emotional dexterity and depth of either. Instead, we get a soggy music video, not any more disturbing than something from 'Nine Inch Nails' and certainly nowhere near the type of harrowing exeprience I expected after seeing the trailers and hearing the buzz. All in all, pretty mediocre. Oh well! Go see it for the trailers of "Lost Souls" and "Unbreakable", which unlike this film actually seem to contain genuine thrills! We'll see.....</fullReview>

T.P. is much more entertaining, without all the shock value crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cell was an excellent movie... as long as it didn't take place in the real world. While the movie portrayed psychosymbols and nifty Tarsem art, it was unique and fantastic. When it was grounded (held back) by taking place in reality, the movie was predictable and uninspired. I'd blame this on Protosevich's much touted script. I don't see justification. The hype should fall on Tarsem, and if it has and I've missed it, then super. Yes, it is reminiscent of his REM video, but style is style. If I were in any sort of position to, I'd challenge Tarsem to lose the corny story and make a movie that doesn't use the story as a crutch against great and beautiful art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that people who like the art of film will love. As for the plot, the acting, and the gruesome factor, I left the movie thinking; "They weren't great, but they didn't hurt the movie." The heart of the movie is the pure visual appeal and the stunning assault on the senses it creates. The director was constantly using the full frame of the film as an artist might use a canvas. A word of warning though... there are a couple of scenes in this movie that were reminiscent of the weirdo pain stuff in the Hellraiser movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really think that Ebert should start thinking twice before he throws out another one of those "best movie of the year" comments! It certainly does not apply to this movie. The plot is so plain and uninteresting that all the eye-popping and colorful artsy visuals cannot save it. I didn't find the movie pretentious or unrestrained, it's just that there's hardly anything deep to say about it at all. It was fun to watch, but definitely not satisfying to the thinking man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, Horrifyingly disgusting and mesmerizingly beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the most intense, disgusting, intriguing, disturbing, beautiful and truly scary films I've ever seen.Jennifer Lopez, a social worker, uses virtual reality to heal her patients. The FBI uses her to get into the minds of a serial killer. Her task turns from detective work to mothering as she feels sorrow for the serial killer's troubled childhood. There are moments during this film when I wanted to get up and leave because visually I was too overwhelmed. There were times in the script that seemed unfulfilled. The acting, too seemed unsatisfying at times. But nevertheless the quality of the art direction, cinematography, story and terror is truly unique and magical. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to The Cell not expecting much. And I left disappointed. You've probably heard about the film's rich visual effects, its innovation, its brilliant exploration of the criminal mind. Baloney. The film is hollow, and deserves comparison to another current hollow movie, Hollow Man. Both films are receiving wide acclaim for their effects -- ingenious! shocking! groundbreaking! -- and both films lack the same thing: substance. The Cell feels like one very long, very gruesome music video -- it's not a film at all. We feel no commitment to the characters, because the story doesn't let us feel committed to them. It moves along in parts, in little MTV-like sections, which are largely unconnected, and not compelling, anyway. The director -- who, incidentally, got his start in music videos -- tries to distract us from this fact with overblown design, over-saturated colors, grainy film, sweeping helicopter pans, and plenty of terrified reaction shots from Jennifer Lopez. But I don't think he succeeds. The theatre was packed tonight when I took in the movie, but I suspect within a couple of weeks the audiences will have disappeared. I hope that's the case, anyway. SPOILER. The only reactions I heard tonight were when Vincent D'Onofrio pulled Vince Vaughn's intestines from his stomach. A woman behind me said, "Oh, come on. Really." She wasn't scared. She wasn't shocked. She wasn't disgusted. None of us were. We were recognizing The Cell as a lesson in excess. Sure, it's packed full of images and "symbolism" (Jennifer Lopez is like Mary, get it?), but when the screen fades to black, there's nothing left for us. Just cheap tricks, a weak script, a boatload of cliches, and plenty of bad psych-fi. If you're looking for a contemporary, visually stunning film that explores the dark corners of the unconscious, see Fight Club.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an extremely visually disturbing film. Some of the images are still with me hours after I left the theater. This should at least be nominated for Best Cinemaphotography as well as Production Design at the Academy Awards next year. This is also not a movie you want to show to your children. Some of the images and stuff are very, very weird and downright scary at times. A very well-photographed movie with an OK plot and good acting and a definite must-see on your summer movie list.Vincent D'Onofrio plays a serial killer who is in a coma. The only hope of rescuing his latest victim in time is to enter his mind. The police turn to Jennifer Lopez who plays a children's therapist who is part of a special project to enter the minds of comatose children at a clinic using a VR-type setup and the usual pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo.Very disturbing, scary, and beautifully photographed movie.

		<fullReview>I agree wholeheartedly with Roger Ebert - "The Cell" is one of the best films of 2000. It is beautifully disgusting and disgustingly beautiful all at once. Tarsem has created a movie which realize an non-typical fear: having your body follow your mind. As is mentioned in the film, the body can be tricked by the mind into believing what it sees is real - a problem tackled with grace and an immediate solution here.Despite the beautiful visuals, the acting is minimal. And, actually, I mean that in a good way. The dialogue is sparse - the visuals are the obvious stars. But the spurts of dialogue are immensely important. They frame the story, accentuate the finer points such as the different types of schizophrenia affecting Carl and Edward. (as an aside on the subplot with Edward - I would've loved to have seen his parents reaction after Catherine went into Carl's mind.)The film has numerous scenes which will no doubt become infamous in years to come: D'Onofrio's Carl Stargher marching down the steps from his throne as his curtains/cape flows behind him; Stargher hanging above the body of a victim; King Stargher playing another character's intestine as if it was a music box; Lopez's flashy dominatrix uniform as well as her gorgeous "imitation" of the Virgin Mary (which, quite honestly, I don't see what all the fuss was about - the scene in which this appears is not graphic and is probably one of the calmest in the film.)All-in-all, I was stunned. This is by-far (in my opinion) the best film out so far this year. If the Academy overlooks this film (in the effects department anyway) come February, I will incredibly shocked.Kudos to Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vince Vaughn and Tarsem Singh for an intense experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cell is by far the strangest movie I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts off with a surreal walk over a massive sand dune to blaring Arabic music, and gets stranger from there.Jennifer Lopez plays psychologist Catherine Deane who, through the wonder of modern science, goes inside the mind of schizophrenic patients. In the movie's opening scenes, we learn that she is participating in research project to bring catatonic schizophrenics back to reality. This premise is the set up for the main story in which the FBI is trying to stop a schizophrenic serial killer who's crimes are becoming more frequent. As luck would have it, the Feebs catch up with the killer as he collapses into a permanent state of catatonia. The problem is the he is the only one who knows where his latest victim is being hidden. Desperate to find the girl before she dies (in a manner that gives rise to the film's title) Catherine (Lopez) goes into the mind of the killer in hopes of finding the missing girl.What follows is a series of very strange scenes I really can't find the words to describe. The visual imagery of The Cell is at times beautiful and at times disturbing. The sets and costumes are elaborate and well crafted. If the academy isn't turned off by the story, The Cell could pick up a couple of nods in February.A few cautions about this film. If you do not like movies that jump around with little continuity, I would recommend you pass on this one. Also, this film is rated "R" and I would take the rating very seriously. Although the language is minimal, there is some violence and numerous depictions of mutilated female bodies (many of them nude).I don't know that I can go so far as to say I liked The Cell, but it was definitely better than I expected. All in all I give it a 7 out of 10, because that's the max I will give without saying I actually liked a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Lopez enters the surreal mind of a serial killer to locate a trapped victim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story line is straightforward. A research facility is doing experiments in which one person can enter the mind of another via a biochemical hookup. There is a serial killer loose who traps his victims in water tanks and then does other unspeakable horrors to them. As a last resort, empathetic Jennifer Lopez agrees to enter the mind of the comatose killer, who has been captured, in order to find the latest victim before she is drowned. Later in the movie, the detective in charge joins her in this quest.This is an immensely clever plot because it allows the film makers to create and show on the screen any kind of dreamlike images without adhering to the rules of logical real life, because none of it is real. We are in the realm of dreams, the subconscious, the id, fleeting thoughts, emotions, pieces of rationality and communication but most of it heavily symbolic. The imagination of the film makers takes over on these pictorial journeys into surrealism.Surrealism is or can be an attractive art, but it also has a dark side of decadence. It seems to thrive when a culture is on the decline and headed for or in the midst of killing and blood and gore. It seems to revel in ugliness. In "The Cell", there are a few beautiful images in which Lopez is a kind of Madonna or robed queen, but most often the images are very disturbing because the killer is very disturbed. The movie theme emerges of the horrors of childhood violence and those of a disturbed man. But it also becomes soupy in its plot line of Lopez finding the unsullied child in the mind of the killer and attempting to save him.The movies of the recent past revel in blood. Reviewers on IMDb quite often explicitly say they want to see blood and gore. I view this blood lust as a perversion. To me, seeing this on screen in detail is meaningless in the sense of adding anything to a story. Is it supposed to horrify so that we rebel against the killing on screen when the results of a shooting or knifing are shown explicitly? I don't think so. It looks to me like pure exploitation for those who want to see blood. It's decadence. The same goes for scenes of people vomiting. Since I started watching and reviewing post-1990 movies, I am amazed at the vomiting scenes. Is this what audiences demand to see? Is this what sells? In the 1930s, many crime films took the viewer into the MORGUE. That was the thrill of those days. Now it's blood and vomit. Of course, the other thing that sticks out is the sex or porn on screen, also done to exploit an audience, and many IMDb reviewers explicitly call for the actresses to go nude. I cannot help but conclude that many movies are reflecting a strong strain of decadent culture in America. I associate it with the endless war-making of the U.S. government, not by cause and effect though. I don't know how these social trends get propagated, but they are there to see.I actually think that "The Cell" is mostly non-exploitative in its imagery. I think they wanted to show the darknesses of a man's disturbed mind and the attempts of a princess to rescue a boy and her perils. It became something like a fairy tale brought to the screen, but with imagery not to be found in a fairy tale told in words. That approach, however, of hyping up a fairy tale into images that will disturb youngsters or condition them to violence and its exercise, that approach is decadent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visionary Tarsem Singh's Visionary Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no other 2011 movie that I'm more anxious to watch than Tarsem Singh's Immortals, a new retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Titans. Singh is one of the most visually innovative directors working today but in eleven years this will be his third movie. His refusal to compromise his vision has made him an abnormality in Hollywood. His last movie, The Fall, came out in 2006 and was self-financed; it was the most beautiful movie of that year and no one saw it; it barely had distribution and didn't make a huge profit. But it has created a following. When I saw this movie I thought two things: 1) I couldn't wait to watch his next movie; and 2) he couldn't possible surpass himself.Well, regarding the second one it turns out he already did, with his 2000 debut The Cell, a movie that is hard to categorise because it mixes horror, science fiction, mystery, fantasy and drama in one single coherent and fascinating story. But for simplicity's sake let's call it a horror movie.Serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) becomes comatose shortly after kidnapping a new victim. The police know, from Stargher's modus operandi, that if she isn't found soon she will drown inside an unbreakable glass cell that fills with water (Stargher kindly films the slow death and sends tapes to the cops). So it's up to FBI Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn in a fine performance before his conversion into a mediocre comedy actor) to ask Dr. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) for help. You see, Catherine has helped develop a method that allows people to enter the minds of comatose patients to see if she can wake them up. Of course no one wants Stargher to wake up ? they just want clues that can lead them to the final victim.The only problem is that Stargher's psyche has fragmented into three personalities: his abused childhood self, the adult Carl, and a demonic god-like creature that rules supreme over his fantasy mental landscape.I think this premise is good in itself and screenwriter Mark Protosevich deserves congratulations for it. It has a sense of urgency: a life is at stake, the clock is ticking, and the tension keeps us on the edge of our seats anxious to see how they're going to beat Stargher's omnipotent god personality and find out what they came looking for.But the visuals are the main attraction. When the movie takes place in the real world, it's nothing special to look at. But when it gets inside a mind (Stargher's isn't the only one that's visited) it's a parade of classic art-inspired sets, beautiful landscapes, otherworldly costumes (courtesy of Eiko Ishioka, the costume designer of Francis Ford Coppola's unforgettable Dracula), and architecture that mixes the ordinary with the fantastic. Norwegian painter Odd Nerdrum, British artist Damien Hirst, and H.R. Giger (of Alien fame) are just some of the artists referenced by Singh in this vast display of artistic erudition. If you're an art fan, you'll have as much fun enjoying the story as you'll have spotting the references, although it's not necessary to know them to appreciate the movie. It's just an extra for people who like to dissect movies.Although the movie is gorgeous to look at, even when it's horrifying (and when it gets inside Stargher's mind the movie may reach uncomfortable levels of misogynistic and bondage imagery for some viewers), Singh also has a good grip on narrative. The first minutes show him deftly developing three different narratives ? Catherine, Novak, and Stargher ? and slowly making them run into each other until they become integrated.The movie, unexpectedly, also has strong humanist themes running through it. Catherine is a psychiatrist trying to cure comatose patients. We first see her inside a boy's mind trying to help him wake up. Catherine is all love and altruism. When she enters Stargher's mind she feels sorry for him even though he's a serial killer. Although most viewers would like to see Stargher meet a horrible end, Catherine tries to save him from his tormenting demonic ruler so he can have some peace at last. Catherine believes in forgiveness and it's no wonder Christian symbolism is another big part of the movie's imagery.The movie also takes time to show how Stargher developed his hatred for women and doesn't spare us the abuses he endured during childhood at the hands of his brutal father. Modern movies love absolute, mysterious evil ? Anton Chigurh, The Joker, etc. ? because it's cooler (and simpler to portray?) but the people who study and capture serial killers (people who know real evil, not Hollywood mass-consumption evil) will be the first to say that human monsters are made. So The Cell was quite refreshing and intellectual in this regard too.D'Onofrio steals the show whereas Lopez demonstrates once again that with a good screenplay she can give efficient performances (I've always liked her tough cop roles in The Money Train and Out of Sight), and Vaughn was quite a surprise in an intense dramatic role. Add to their performances a suspenseful story, then make art direction, make-up, costume design and cinematography integral characters of the story, and you have a mesmerising horror thriller that disturbs as much as it moves.Tarsem Singh's debut announced a brave new voice in Hollywood, a voice that audiences have barely heard yet but that carries greatness. Let's hope that with Immortals Singh finally receive his due.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An FBI agent (Vince Vaughn) persuades a social worker (Jennifer Lopez), who is adept with a new experimental technology, to enter the mind of a comatose serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) in order to learn where he has hidden his latest kidnap victim.The director, Tarsem Singh, presides over a movie whose raison d'?tre is a series of garish but arresting dream sequences, which make use of a wide variety of old and new cinematic techniques. Sickening images, both in and out of the dreams, make the movie unpleasant; while the heavy stamp of self-seriousness makes it occasionally silly. But I really liked Jennifer Lopez, who is touchingly sincere; and I liked the movie's relative lack of cynicism. The grotesquerie has a point. We're challenged to have compassion for a man we might expect to hate comfortably; but in order to play fair, the movie has to show us just how sick he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I accidentally started watching this film last night on Starz and really felt obligated to finish it since I noticed that it had Vince Vaughn. "Okay," I thought, "Here is a film early in his career"- you know like before Jennifer Aniston and the bromances like "Dodgeball" and "The Wedding Crashers." He seems to be in every movie that has been coming out in the past 5 years.I understand the appeal of Vincent D'onfrio, if you see his work in "Full Metal Jacket" "Men In Black" and "Law and Order: Criminal Intent" are all I need to show why he has a career. He plays monsters and disturbed people well - gives them a soul rather than making them into frightening behemoths. His reminds you of the dude at the reunion BBQ/pool party who works in the mail room and not the cougar bait neighbor who suns himself by the pool.Jennifer Lopez? I am not so sure either - I can't say she is a terrible actress and I wanted to pin the blame of why this movie could not be awesome but she was adequate - not as good as I think Cate Blanchett would have been.This movie was used as a star vehicle and really should have been acted by more experienced actors- you can see Vaughn trying play the devoted detective and Lopez playing the kind yet seriously devoted child psychologist. Both fall flat because of experience - I don't think that Vaughn knew that he was meant to be a bit crude or the unrefined types. The writers tried to make up for the acting by putting things into the script to explain the story rather than letting the acting and the film explain the story.I could not get into how the invention that got Lopez into the criminal's mind- it almost seemed forced rather than like a graceful way to show us how they will get in. They were almost apologetic for it being science-fiction. Explaining how it got there is not good sci-fi. Saying, "yeah we got this nifty tool, because this is what we use it for- keep up nerds!" and instead fumblingly explaining in the dialogue how it works and came to be. Yes, sci-fi lovers care about plot holes- but not about tool props. (Levar Burton wore a gold painted banana clip over his eyes to play Geordi LaForge in Star Trek: The Next Generation. We knew why it was there, but never quite how it worked until later seasons.)If you have ever watched "The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" you can see the right way to explain the use of imaginary technology, how it worked and never explained how it came to be unless it was a plot point to make the story arc work.I liked the imagery - D'Onofrio was not wasted in this film and made the script work like the master he was. He couldn't save the film in the same sense that Hopkins couldn't save "Hannibal" - they both played their roles well but the hole-y script combined with a weakened female costar made the movie weak.Miss Jenny from the block is not a terrible actress, "Selena" is proof of the ability to show a tender side which was what she was meant to show -but she has not been allowed to show her strong side in a more appropriate way - her sharpness has been blunted by the director who is amazing at visuals and stringing together plot with pictures but never quite sure how to get her to show she means business an seems unsure of herself in some ways here. Perhaps this is why Vaughn may have been a wasted resource here too, because if he was more of a bully- in the here he would have balanced the cruel nature of the D'Onofrio character- seeming more cocksure- he would have been great here. Lopez fit into the imagery, especially in the end- a fitting self image especially for Latinas- Scenes shown in this movie could be described as amazing eye candy and I would be remiss to say it helped make the film watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people love or hate this film. If you have a weak stomach or can't like a movie without everything spelled out very easily for you, then skip this one.Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as the Serial Killer. He shows that there can be humanity in a sick sick person. I can see why he would be drawn to this challenging role.Jennifer Lopez was good. Her job was mostly to seem highly empathetic which she did well in her role as a children's social worker. Many people here don't seem to know that social workers are also often trained and licensed in counseling. I did not find it odd that her character would keep Carl's dog, Valentine. She would remember Carl how he was as a child, trying to survive and sacrificing himself for her good.Vince Vaughan seemed decent and haunted by his past as a horribly abused child himself. If he hadn't seemed such a decent man, the plot wouldn't have worked and I like to see him doing a role other than the smart-ass shallow guy as he has done recently.I find this movie life affirming in many ways, not anti-life. It shows that horribly abused children can grow up to be protectors (Vaughan) not just serial killers. It shows that someone with an organic mental illness (like the serial killer) might have been a good person if his father hadn't been such a horrible abuser and that there is still good in most people.Other than that, it is all about the visuals. Tarsem Singh kicks all kinds of butt with the visuals. I am waiting to get my hands on his more recent Movie "The Fall" which I also hear is visually stunning.You can love or hate this movie, but, I believe this is a film that will stand up over time like Metropolis.</fullReview>

Thats not to say that J Lo (an odd but interesting choice) and Vince Vaughn didn't do a good job, not in the least. J Lo's performance was above par and Vince did a very good job considering the role did not suit him too well. But Vincent's performance is what sort of pulled everything together and connected any loose ends that would have otherwise left me squirming in my seat. If you enjoy psychological thrillers such as "The Bone Collector" or "Se7en" Then consider watching The Cell, you might find that its exactly what your looking for to entertain you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed But Unforgettable Fantasy That Might Keep You Wired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of toiling in the commercial as well as music video industry, helming videos like R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion" or ads for Nike, director Tarsem Singh makes a memorable cinematic debut with this chilling, atmospheric hybrid of "Silence of the Lambs" meets "The Matrix." Actually, several other films such as "Fantastic Voyage," "Altered States," "Dreamscape," "Se7en," and Alfred Hitchcock's classic "Spellbound" come to mind that resemble Singh's psychiatry-themed parable "The Cell" with Jennifer Lopez. Hopefully, Singh will learn from the many mistakes that he made in this vile but visually resplendent mishmash.Slipshod scripting, an anti-climactic reversal of roles, and a passive villain undermine this otherwise picturesque nail-biter about a nervy child therapist who tours the mind of a comatose serial killer so that the FBI can uncover clues about the fiend's last victim before the victim drowns in 48 hours. Bizarre visual imagery enhances this far-fetched tale but doesn't compensate for freshman scenarist Mark Protosevich's muddled but melodramatic yarn about the evil that men do and the redemption they seek for such acts. Moreover, "The Cell" depicts women as vulnerable victims that can only be brutalized or saved by strong, resourceful men. The underlying message in "The Cell" is that any man, however inexperienced he may be, can do a job better than a woman whose expertise lies in that field.Sexy Jennifer Lopez of "Out of Sight" stars as Catherine Dean, a pot-smoking psychologist who uses breakthrough virtual reality brain wave technology to explore the troubled minds of her patients. During the opening sequence of "The Cell," Catherine appears like a princess bride in a flowing wedding dress with white-feathers. She is riding a dark horse across a surrealistic African desert. Dismounting from the steed, which turns into a Dali-like statue, she crosses a sprawling sand dune and saunters toward a small child, Edward Baines (Colton James), standing alone by a huge dead tree. Actually, neither Catherine nor the child is in the desert. She is treating this catatonic child with a transcendental form of mind therapy called neurological synaptic-transfer that allows her to probe his mind as if it were a landscape and converse with him as if he were conscious. In reality, not only are Catherine and Edward both outfitted in skin-tight, corduroy-style suits, but they are also hanging by wires so that they appear to be hovering motionlessly in the air like the corpses in director Michael Crichton's 1978 medical thriller "Coma." No matter how hard Catherine tries, she has not been able to bring the child out of his coma and feels as frustrated by her fruitless forays as the boy's dejected parents.Vince Vaughn of "Psycho" co-stars as tenacious FBI agent Peter Novak. He is a rough-hewn "Dirty Harry" style cop who once prosecuted criminals before he got so fed up with the way that the legal system coddled felons that he joined the Feds instead to catch them. Novak has just nabbed a creepy serial slayer, Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio of "Full Metal Jacket"), who abducts beautiful women, drowns them, bleaches them white, and uses them to satisfy his ghastly necrophiliac urges.Unfortunately, the FBI caught Stargher moments after he suffered a seizure that plunged him into a coma that doctors diagnose as irreversible. This constitutes another flaw in "The Cell." The villain is out for the count, and anything that Stargher does in his perverted mind can be counteracted by Catherine. She has a chicken switch microchip embedded in her hand that that she can activate when things get too hairy for her. The problem here too is that nothing that occurs when Catherine visits the minds of either Edward or Stargher is real. Nevertheless, while she is inside their minds, she believes that she is in an actual place dealing with actual people.Desperate to liberate Stargher's last victim (Tara Subkoff) before a clock mechanism floods an inescapable underground chamber with her trapped in it, agent Novak appeals to Dean and her experimental, high-tech, neurological team. Our stalwart heroine agrees after some initial misgivings, but she discovers that Carl is as dangerous comatose as when he is fully conscious. In Stargher's warped mind, Catherine encounters both Carl as an adult and as a young, innocent child (Jake Thomas) and struggles to ferret out clues to the girl's whereabouts. Eventually, she gets lost in Stargher's Gothic dungeon of a mind. Meanwhile, like the cavalry charging to the rescue, Novak enters Stargher's mind through the dubious synaptic-transfer device so that he can both free Catherine and find the victim. Tarsem and Protosevich treat their sadomasochistic fiend with surprising sympathetic. Evidently, Stargher became a demented monster because his mother abandoned him and his father abused him. The scenes of the evil father whipping his whimpering son with a belt for playing with dolls because the father isn't about to raise a son with what he defines as homosexual tendencies is heavy stuff. Fundamentalist religious groups won't it that Carl's woes began with an old-fashioned river baptism. Protosevich's provocative but unsavory script may repel some people, especially when the serial slayer suspends himself from the ceiling by rings embedded in his back so that he can achieve a weightless feeling before he has intercourse with his eviscerated victims.Sadly, despite its suspenseful finale to save Stargher's last victim, "The Cell" collapses long before Novak discovers the damsel-in-distress' location. The filmmakers never explain how the brain wave technology works so credibility lies entirely in the eye of the beholder. While it is possible to overlook this obvious shortcoming because the elaborate virtual reality mind procedure doesn't exist, an even greater flaw both in a dramatic as well as sexual sense which cannot be easily ignored occurs when Catherine cannot complete the task that the FBI assigned her while a less experienced FBI agent performs her job for her! Not only is this anti-climactic, but it also conveys as stereotypical image of women as the weaker sex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't lie. I wasted this because of Jennifer Lopez. It was before i knew to despise Vince Vaughn, and I had not started to appreciate Vincent D'Onofrio, so it was just JLo that I was here to see. Of course, she was great, and her makeup and costumes were fantastic. Other than that, I wasn't much impressed with what I saw. I don't like special effects just for the sake of special effects.Now, if you are into Rodriguez/Tarantino violence and blood, then there is some stuff here that you will find to your liking. I won't spoil it and tell you what they do to the women, children and dogs. Nasty stuff.But is really didn't have a credible plot (what science fiction does?) so it just dragged along until the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just watch,don't listen.A very unique visual treat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell probably has the most unique visual presentation.It's a creative and imaginative work of art.Once you're deep into the mind,it's pure art.But on the surface,like the Serial killer himself,it's all mediocre.It's filled with fascinating dream sequences and an exploration of a disturbed mind which makes it ever more intriguing to watch.It's an interesting concept but it is really weak in its content.The script is flawed and the less you listen to it the better,it only makes for a mediocre film.But Tarsem Singh injects a lot of his creative and unique imagery to heighten the impact of the story and gives you a satisfying,somewhat thoughtful film.If he were given a better script,I'm sure he'd make really good use of his talent.The story is basically about a serial killer who is in Coma and knows the whereabouts of his latest victims.The FBI wants to know where she is through him.They come across a company that deals with a new kind of technology.An ability to go into the mind and world of another person.A young women puts herself into danger as she enters the mind of the serial killer.It's an intriguing piece of entertainment but the script is just too weak.Apart from that,the production sets and the MTV-inspired camera work,which is put to good use,is outstanding.Simply put,it's a visual fest without much strength in the writing.The film might be flawed but it satisfies in the end,if you don't put much effort thinking about the story or the writing.It's nothing extraordinary or new,except its director's unique vision.From the cast,D'onofrio is sinister and disturbing but he's underused and fails to be anything interesting when you're outside,but when we're in,that's where he grabs yous.And Vaughn does a fine job in a dramatic role since he's always played a comic role.But here,he does just fine.But it's Jennifer Lopez who fails to impress.I just didn't see her in the role.She just doesn't fit.She's just too corny and tame and too soft at times.Her character was a waste.Yes,she is really good to look at but other than that she's okay.It's the director who keeps everything afloat with a lot of references to religious undertones and gives an artistic look.He pours in enough of his talent to keep us entertained.This will remind people of Silence of the Lambs or a bit of Seven,mainly because of the music.But still,it's kind of original in its execution.Just don't think much about it or listen too deep to the actors and you'll enjoy yourself by just watching all that's going on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual feast, but not as smart as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A psychologist who enters the minds of her patients is asked to help a detective in finding a notorious serial killer's latest victim who is set to drown within a deadline. The problem is the killer is in a coma so to get at what's in his head, the psychologist must enter it.The movie really cut a new path through serial killer territory since much of it takes place literally inside the killer's mind. So if you ever thought that killers in certain movies were a little too smart or their hideout was too fortified and remote to be convincingly creepy in a real way, well your answer might be here. The killer here is truly in his most twisted little alcove of seclusion and there are some truly twisted things there. The movie is made by a first time feature director, but one with a good visual flair. The surreal settings and genuine gruesomeness give their share of thrills and chills.However, since we are in the killer's mind the outcome could have been a bit more original in addition to the set up. Since the setup gave a lot of maneuverability in a very intriguing thriller setting. --- 7/10Rated R: graphic violent imagery, sexual content, and profanity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original and Thought Provoking Addition to the Thriller Genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film, I wasn't sure what to expect. I only saw it recently, and since it's initial release in 2000 it seems to have been largely forgotten. That in mind, I wasn't expecting too much from it. However, "The Cell" really surprised me and turned out to be one of the very best of it's genre. The film works well on many different levels and is very interesting, original and entertaining. The whole premise for the film is very original I thought, and it has been delivered very well. Jennifer Lopez' character is a child physcologist of sorts who, with the aid of incredible new technology, delves deep into the minds of her patients to try and cure them. When a serial killer is found in a coma, she is hired to try and help discover where his latest victim is being held before it's too late.It's a simple premise and it has been very well delivered - as a viewer you never feel as if the story is running away with itself, everything is very well restrained and measured - it would have been all too easy for the writers to go ahead of themselves with this plot and lose the audience. The best part of the film for me was the amazing scenes in which Lopez is inside the mind of Carl, the clinically insane killer. These scenes have been superbly put together, with all kinds of Camera Lens trickery and some truly amazing visual effects. Probably the most impressive thing about these scenes is that they are all very well integrated and run very smoothly from one to the other - this is an important aspect of the film's success. Visual icons used to make the meaning of scenes and to push the narrative forward could have been too obvious and lost all credibility all to easily, but again these are very well realised and add to the whole strong intelligence of the movie. The use of colour composition and camera work is simply stunning on numerous occasions - the "dream" world of the killer's mind has been incredibly realised.The final winning aspect of this film is it's cast. This is the best I've ever seen Jennier Lopez in a serious role - why doesn't such pick such great roles like this anymore? Vince Vaughn puts in a strong performance as the ex-Lawyer turned Cop who is hell bent saving the latest of the killer's victims. Vincent D'Onofrio is outstanding as the deranged serial killer - probably the best performance in the film because he manages to capture the humanity of his evil character perfectly - a mature and sophisticated performance. Direction by Tarsem Singh is good - he has managed to command one of the finest Lopez performances ever here and for that, must be applauded. Overall - this film is a real winner. The cast strong, writing well realised and the cinematography is stunning throughout. An original, thought provoking and valuable addition to the Thriller genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you combine The Silence of the Lambs and The Matrix, then you will have a movie called The Cell. Actually, that sounds like an interesting type of combination to me.Catharine Deane is a psychotherapist who is part of a new treatment, which allows her to go inside the mind of her patients. Her experience in this method takes an unexpected turn when an FBI agent comes to ask for a desperate favor. They had just tracked down a serial killer named Carl Stargher, his way of life is to abduct women one at a time and place them in a secret area where they are kept for about 40 hours until they are slowly drowned. Unfortunately, the killer has fallen into an irreversible coma, which means he cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim before she dies. Now, Catherine Deane must race against time to explore the twisted mind of the killer to get the information she needs, but Carl's damaged personality poses dangers that threaten to overwhelm her.The film is really creative and original on how a mind of a sadistic killer would look like, The film also is very specific with important details dealing with the situation of the film.I also believe that the possible message from the movie is, do not abuse your kids in any way, or they will grow up to become a sick crazy sadistic killer like the one in the movie.You'll know what I mean when you see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High art which is also entertaining, psychotherapy which is accessible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I view this film as one of the best psychological thrillers to have ever been made. It is gorgeous to look at, as seductive as beauty in and of itself can be, but it is also both seductive and satisfying intellectually. Jennifer Lopez has proved herself to be a woman who can portray strength, sensitivity, beauty, and intelligence well, appealing to both men and women at the same time. In this role, she is intellectually and emotionally stronger than she is physically - as a therapist, she has to be, and it is as a therapist that she wages war with her patients' enemies and, when lucky and stubborn enough, doesn't just win a few battles. I liked seeing a good role model for this kind of struggle on the big screen. (In another of Lopez' films, Enough, we see the other side of this, where the battle being waged is both necessary and physical, and I think these two films would make a great double feature. :)I have friends who won't watch this film through to the end no matter how much I encourage them. The film is scary and unsettling at a level which is deep enough to put many people off. If, however, you don't watch to the end, you miss one of the most transcendent sequences in film, one which more than makes up for the route by which it is achieved. More importantly, it's my opinion that we shouldn't shy away from the worst that we are capable of and, instead, should focus our most intense light on it. That's the only way I can see to alter and/or mediate the things which happen which make us afraid, which haunt us, which diminish us. Instead of the simplistic battle of good versus evil, this film tackles the complex battle of healing psychological scars which, along with chemical/hormonal triggers, have created a monster. It's the battle of separating out what is human and reachable from what is inhuman and untouchable in a single mind tortured by the dichotomy. It is the battle of modern life, where there are no clearcut white hats and black, where complexity is unavoidable, and where dealing with people entails dealing with your own demons as well as theirs.But, also, if you are scared or upset by the early stages of the film, you owe yourself the healing and succor of its resolution. This film gets deep into your psyche and stirs things up, especially if you've experienced any of the realities it is trying to reveal. But, especially if that's the case, you owe it to yourself to let the film work its artistic magic on your psyche as it finds a way to heal the various characters it portrays. They are very creative solutions and worth adding to your personal arsenal against whatever bumps in the night of your unconscious mind.The brilliance of the cinematography, direction, musical score, and acting is that, as beautiful and riveting as they all are, they take a back seat to telling the story. If you take the time to watch the various extras on the DVD version, you will not be sorry. For me, it was thrilling to find out how much the hundreds of people, all artists in their own fields, working on the film got to stretch and grow in the experience. It's the kind of collaboration you hope for all of your life and only rarely get to realize. For that, alone, The Cell is wonderful in my eyes.Because I myself am a survivor and know how heady an experience watching this film can be for both people who have been victims (and I'm guessing also for those who have been victimizers), I recommend that people who have such backgrounds watch it with people they trust and/or in a safe environment. Or, if that can't happen, that there is someone you can talk to about the feelings which come up during and/or after the film. This is actually one of the few films which I feel could be used in clinical situations to help advance the healing of people who have these issues to deal with. There are scenes of violence and terror in this film which are evocative and get under your skin... but there are also scenes of transcendence, caring, and healing which are just as powerful if you can get to the last third of the film without turning it off first. :)As a thriller, it's a real roller coaster ride... as a work of art, it's unsurpassed... as an experience, it's fascinating and can be mind-altering. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

The concept of being in someone's mind fascinates me and it is manifested brilliantly in this movie. A cruel and sharp mind plotted this plot; a lot of hard-core violence that only a true sadist can produce -done with delicate taste though. Superb acting... The children acted great and this is certainly Vincent D'Onofrio's best performance. I registered to IMDb only to rate and comment this movie.In the final analysis: A truly horrifying horror movie.

		<shortDescription>The most violent horror ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sick and disturbing horror has the most fantastic visuals ever! The horror is extremely chilling and is all psychologically disturbed and in some points just down-right bizarre. The plot is this: in a future world, where advanced technology can allow human beings to " walk through the mind of another" by sending them to sleep and connecting their brains. It is proved useful when a masochistic serial killer who drowns his victims in a glass container, has a seizure and goes into a coma. The whereabouts of his latest victim can only be found in the deranged and warped mind of the killer, which must be explored by J-Lo. The film features some randomly bizarre sequences including a horse being vivisected and a cow's head spinning rapidly like a washing machine and the blood pouring into a bucket. The film also contains some really nasty violence, a guy's intestines are stuck to a roller wheel ( imagine it as a large rolling pin with spikes on it) and then the wheel is slowly turnt unravelling the guy's intestines and wrapping them around the wheel. The horror is amazing and has some truly creepy moments as well as one scene that makes you jump so high you hit the ceiling. Overall, a great film 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as The Silence of the Lambs, but enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is a weird movie with absolutely stunning special effects and scenes. The story however is a bigger problem. It isn't very original as it has stolen much of the ideas from The Silence of the Lambs (a serial killer kidnaps young women, kills them and does something weird with them), but thanks to the many special scenes, it was quite enjoyable. A company has found a way to enter someone's mind. They use it to get access to schizophrenic people who are in a coma. One day the FBI needs the company to help them. They have arrested a schizophrenic serial killer that has kidnapped and killed several girls in a gruesome way. He's in some kind of coma and will never wake up out of it again. They desperately try to make contact with him, because they want to find his latest victim, who they believe is still alive. As I already said this movie really has a lot of similarities with The Silence of the Lambs. The main difference between the two is that this movie has added an element of science fiction to it, while The Silence of the Lambs had a more realistic feeling. Normally I would have hated the Cell for that, but thanks to many special, dreamlike scenes, I enjoyed it, however not everything about the movie was as convincing as I would like it to be. All in all this is an entertaining movie. It's certainly not as good as The Silence of the Lambs, but it sure was worth a watch. I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hesitated in my decision to see this film because it had Jennifer Lopez. I never really liked her as an actress because she always seemed to try too hard. Touted as the best film of the summer in 2000, "The Cell" is nothing more than special effects and visually stunning set designs gone wrong. There was nothing in this film that was appealing. With each setting, it seemed like the designers got better at creating the backdrop for where the story took place; however, the settings don't make the movie. Vince Vaughn, Vincent D'Onorfio join Lopez to do their best in making "The Cell" the best movie of the year. The biggest reason for its failure was the complexity of the plot. I couldn't understand what the writer was trying to bring across from scene to scene. It seemed liked it dragged on longer than it had to. Besides the drawn out and complex plot, the ending to "The Cell" was so tedious it was laughable. "The Cell" did serve one purpose: it can now be distributed to film schools for students who want to become directors as a lesson in film-making on what not to do.</fullReview>

Thomas doesn't earn any accolades for his performance even though he is the key character to unlock the predicament. He does not phase into this serial killer; he remains as a hurt and innocent child, fearing for his father. The ending is very dramatic and does need to be viewed two times to understand the entire scheme. This film does have a few blunders, but its still a 3 1/2+ star film out of 5.

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is an outstanding piece of horror/science fiction, that is not getting the praise it deserves. One reason is that many people can't get past the fact that this is a Jennifer Lopez movie. Another is that the themes in this movie are incredibly disturbing. There are some _very_ sick scenes in this movie, which you don't expect from a Hollywood product. Then, there is the very misleading poster of J-Lo's beautiful face, in elaborate fetish make-up and headgear. I suppose the marketing department became confused as to how they were going to sell this movie. Having said that, it no overstatement to say that this movie is a horror classic. Not in the sense that it will be imitated any time soon. The hugely expensive sets and costumes and the director's individuality will see to that. This movie is a classic, because it is a visually stunning examination of the depths of the human subconscious. While on this journey, it touches on modern art (including Damien Hurst's infamous cow in formaldehyde), psychological theory (both Jung and Freud) and sado-masochism.This movie comes into it's own on dvd and when viewed on a large, digital tv. The cinematography is incredible. The vividly colored landscapes and the elaborate fetish clothing are made for a medium that can show them off to full effect.To satisfy the mind, many of the scenes are disturbing in content - the drowning victims in the cell, the masturbation over a corpse while suspended from large hooks, Vince Vaughn's intestinal torture and Jennifer Lopez' character's solution to her predicament are very disturbing to the unwary. However, for hardened horror movie fans, this is a true smorgasbord of deviance. Considering that most horror movies go for the simple thrill, the supernatural monster, or the everpresent avenging slasher, this is a very unique movie. (And yes, the movie devices of the victim in the well and the female heroine are borrowed from Silence Of The Lambs.)Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly pointless, boring, and unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie had a potentially interesting story behind it, it fails to do anything even remotely worthwhile with it. There are plenty of beautiful sceneries and lovely costumes, but that's really it. This movie is so pointless it hurts.First of all, they should have never cast Jennifer Lopez in this. On the one hand, you might say that the role is perfect for her since all she has to do is walk around in fancy dresses and look pretty, which is all OK (I mean, there are worse things to look at), but when you realize that she's supposed to be a scientist it all just falls apart..the whole idea of her playing somebody that actually uses her brain is just too ludicrous.Then, there's the story, or lack thereof. It starts of as a standard serial killer movie, but then we get the novelty of going into the criminal's mind. Which is all great, if it weren't for the fact that the way that the kidnapped girl is eventually found has next to nothing to do with what happens in the criminal's mind, and is in fact so obvious that you wonder how they could have overlooked it in the first place. This basically makes the entire part in the criminal's mind rather pointless, if you ask me.This impression is further strenghtened by the fact that the "mind" scenes are little more than a series of loosely tacked together sequences of Jennifer running around in increasingly bombastic dresses, with some unexpected pieces of gore thrown in for good (?) measure. Some of the gore was so over the top that I couldn't help but laugh...the scene where a horse gets split into pieces by falling glass blades was so bizarre that I burst into laughter rather than feel disgusted as I probably should have. The fact that I laughing rather than was shocked should give a nice indication of how far this movies misses its mark: the supposedly scare parts are funny, the supposedly exciting parts are predictable and the supposedly entertaining parts are boring in the extreme. "The Cell" is a prime example of somebody having a nice idea for a movie, then screwing it all up in the worst possible way by doing just about everything wrong: wrong cast, wrong direction, wrong pacing, wrong plot. etc. Painfully boring and frustrating to watch1/2 out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look beyond Lopez.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Lopez's face on the movie poster was almost enough to keep me away from this film. However, my interest in the strange compelled me to rent The Cell the first day it came out on video. True, it's pretty far-fetched, and some of the scenes are a bit lame, but to see the part of this movie that pulled my vote to a seven you have to look INSIDE the serial killer's mind. It's a fascinating interpretation, with impressive cinematography and visuals. Enjoy-or rather experience-the bizarre world that is not our own. Give it a chance for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie about 10 times. First one was shocking. I've never seen something that intense, violent and abusive. In a positive way - if there can be one. Anyway - it's great. Colors, action, dream-like scenography - it all reminds me of David Lynch.Now, when I watch it I see something different every time. Now I dare to say that this movie is excellent. Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn look like they are trying to wake up from the worst dream - from the beginning of the movie till the end. D'Onofrio looks like HELL. Literally. He's taken from everyone's worst nightmares. I like the scene when he's going down from the stairs with this long 'wings-like' material. Love it. Excellent. Wanna see more movies like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The visuals are what makes this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie 5 times in theaters because i just didnt think it would be as stunning on video. I was wrong. The visuals in this movie can be very disturbing for the weak of stomach and of mind. I loved all the dream sequences esp. the "mechanical dolls" and the black dog and everyones favorite - the horse! I also enjoyed the footage of the Carls attic and his altered dolls. Also, if you can, try to pay special attention to the soundtrack while watching the movie. I always notice a soundtrack and the first time i saw the opening scene i was amazed and in love with the music!Definetly check this one out if you can handle the disturbing and want a wild visual trip. This is for those of us with a taste for the dark and abstract. Try not to let Lopez scare you away from watching this one - ignore her, watch the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview> The Cell, I have to say is the weirdest movie I have ever seen. it was VERY weird, but it was also interesting and scary. Jennifer Lopez portrays Catherine Deane, a young woman who enters people's minds. (Talk about weird) Then, she comes to a case of a killer who murders young women in a tank that slowly fills with water, and then he drains out their blood (This guy is a psycho) Then, when he is caught, Catherine must enter his mind to find where his recent victim is, and try to save her. In this mind twisting thriller, Jennifer Lopez does a good job and makes her performance believable. Like I said, this movie is REALLY disgusting and weird. I give The Cell an 8 out of 10. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally decided to rent this movie after passing it by many times at the video store. I had heard that it was incredibly disturbing to watch and the acting was poor, but I decided to give it try. I'm glad I did. The visual effects were amazing, the wardrobe was like no other.The acting was mediocre, which was probably why I didn't find it too disturbing and walk out. The characters also could have been better developed. I don't know why, but this movie left me with something. Maybe it was the amazing "eye-candy". I highly recommend checking it out.Just don't go into it expecting a well developed plot or characters. Just sit back and enjoy (?) the scenery into the mind of a psychopath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now i have heard a lot of commentation before i have seen this movie. All i have heard was this movie sucks and i thought well it looks very presumptous and mindblowing from the trailer. Usually when someone tells me a movie sucks...it really does stink. But when i asked them why it sucks...it was a completely different answer! They all said..."I didn't get it"....That was it! So i saw the movie and i got the whole concept and I loved it!This movie is not for anyone who is under 18 unless they are intellectual and can grasp the whole concept. I would let my own children watch but they wouldn't understand it! This movie challenges the audience to watch a movie that goes beyond psychological depths..yes the characters may not be explained well but who cares...you just have to let loose and let yourself in this dream. Jennifer Lopez looks amazing and the cast works well! This movie is Excellent and maybe more people should think about what the movie is about first then ....oh Jennifer Lopez is in it..maybe i should see it? It's not like that and it's not boring so...don't judge a movie by it's star!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries to go one step further into the realm of disgust..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is just something about Jennifer Lopez that really bothers me. She just rubs me the wrong way. Now I realize that many guys would like her to rub them any way possible, but that is a discussion for another time. But something about her as an entertainer just irritates me. That too is a discussion for another time. But with that in mind I went to see this film and really tried to discard my animosity towards her; because I had heard and read that this was a great film. I Like films like Seven and Kiss The Girls and The Bone Collector. Films that have a sick killer that have to be caught before they wreak havoc and kill again. But there are few problems with this film and to be honest, most of them have been covered in previous reviews. However, there are a few more that I have to comment on so bear with me.First of all, I am not privy to see what kind of box office draw Lopez is over seas. I would however like to know what kind of power she has because I have heard in certain circles that she is about to be elevated into Julia Roberts status when it come to paychecks. And this is something that I just can't fathom. The Cell opened well enough at 17.5 million and then went on to gross a very respectable 61.3 million dollars, good for 36th place in the year 2000. Similarly, The Wedding Planner opened at 14 million and will probably go onto to gross about 50 million. No one is denying that she has drawing power. But to class her in the same category as Julia Roberts and perhaps Sandra Bullock is not fair. Not only that but it will probably inflate her ego even more than it already is. If I hear one more time how nice of an ass she has, I'll think I'll go crazy. Looks are not always the deciding factor in a box office draw. While Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks are attractive people, they are certainly not as physically appealing as Lopez and say Brad Pitt but they outdraw them because they pick the right roles. People don't always flock to see the hottest models, if that was the case them Carmen Electra and any number of models would have the biggest roles in Hollywood thrust upon them. That is just an observation. Back to the film.The Cell takes Jennifer Lopez and puts her into a very tightly fit suit that is apparently adequate and coducive for travelling into someone's mind. I would think a pair of jeans and a t-shirt would be more comfortable but hey, I only took my first year of psychology before I went onto political science. But I'll be sure to ask my university professor the next time I see him. So, her job is to enter into people's minds to find out what deep catacombs they can enter and then discover what it is that either makes them tick, makes them go off or why it is they are comatose. So now of course, there is a killer on the loose. And this killer is even more twisted than Leatherface, more diabolical than Hannibal Lecter and more destructive than psychologically imbalanced than Kevin Spacey's character from Seven. And that is my biggest problem with this film. I think we have seen films like this before. Sure, the entering into a killers mind via psychosis and fancy wires and such is different but that is all that is different. What remains the same is all the psycho babble bull caca that every psycho has. He was abused as a kid, his father was a bastard, he lived a sheltered abused life, his mother wasn't around, ya da ya da ya da Yoda. Big deal. That is nothing new in a film that wants to pride itself on on new ideas. And in my opinion, while watching this film, I could seriously imagine a boardroom meeting at New Line between the head honchos there and the guys who had the idea for this movie. The conversation would go something like this:New Line Guy: Hey, you guys saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre Right?Guys for the film: Yea, like twenty years ago dude.NLG: Okay, well I'm sure you saw Silence Of The Lambs and Seven, right?GFF: Oh yea, those were great kick ass films.NLG: Okay great! Now, you see, I like the idea for the film, but it needs some more...how do I say this? More ooomph. You know, we've all seen the bad ass killer before. You know, the f***** up nutcase that has bad childhood memories. So what we need now is to make him even worse than the others.GFF: Worse than Lecter? How do you do that?NLG: Je ne sais pas ( showing that he is a smart man, he knows French ) how about make him hang from hooks, you know like the "dude" from Hellraiser...GFF: Hellraiser? What is that...NLG: Never mind, but he hangs from hooks that stretch his flesh and he does it because he only feels real when the pain is there, because you know pain is real. ( Guys For Film are simultaneously fascinated and confused. But they listen on ) And once we enter into his mind, you know do some weird things like split a horse into seventeen pieces with a giant blade because you know Psyche 101 says that abusive adults first experience aggression and abuse towards animals.GFF: Yea, I've heard that.NLG: And we can have some really scary times with his dad and then we can have a really hot actress play the chick that goes into his head and tries to save him and the audience will eat it up.GFF: (Collectively) YEAAA!! ( High fives all around ).I just look at this film and I see nothing original in terms of ideas. Everything is just looked upon to go a step further than what we have seen before. The production design is a wonder and they should be commended for a fantastic job, but I had no interest in any of the characters. And when you are apathetic towards your hero and villain, that is not good for the film. I just don't appreciate the film the same way some other seem to. I do understand that there are only so many stories you can tell in Hollywood and that eventually they all get recycled but this is just not one of the good ones.The Cell is an average film with the most basic ideas to further a killers ruthlessness. Stick with SEVEN, unless you just have to see Lopez in a bright shiny suit playing with the two Vinces.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Cell" is far and away the worst movie of the year. Not only does it drop us into a plot ripped straight out of every serial killer movie of the 90's, but it doesn't even bother to give us any interesting characters.Let's do a comparison study:"Silence of the Lambs": A half-retarded serial killer (Carl=Buffalo Bill) is hiding his latest victim away in an isolated space (The cell=the well), so a woman (Catherine=Clarice) has to talk to another psycho (uh..Carl=Hannibal) before she dies. Anything else? Oh yeah, both killers liked to throw their victims in rivers too. "Seven": Climax? (Desert=Desert).The only problem is those movies were thought provoking and scary. "The Cell" is just disgusting. I read a comment that said we shouldn't be knocking movies that bother to spend good money on special effects. Hey, buddy, it's called HOLLYWOOD. Although usually they have to cash in a good script in order to meet the payments. Case in point. The visual effects are much more depressing then scary or imaginative. Shots of dismembered bodies are literally hanging from the walls, and stomach-turning shots of torture abound. What person is their right mind could find that imaginative? It's just a huge, headache-inducing mess from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice costumes and effects, but where is the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a strange combination of Hellraiser, Seven, Dreamscape, and Silence of the Lambs all rolled into one flick. And I believe that is part of the problem I have with this movie.I get the feeling that a couple of people got together and wrote down the names of these movies and said, "Hey! Lets start shooting!" The story is straightforward enough, but it's like the people who created the film could never quite get the point of it across. We see some bizzare imagery of the tormented mind of our killer, but that seems to be the entirety of the movie.I had a distinct feeling of eating but not being full after watching this movie. There were so many more levels that could have been added, but were dropped in favor of gore, or T&amp;A. The tagline for this film mentions that "Once you enter the mind of a killer, YOU MAY NEVER GET OUT!", but, in the end, you never really have enough time to care enough about any of the characters in this film to really worry if anyone but yourself gets out of this film alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't judge a film by its critics ...... The Cell is disturbing, yet surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this having read a number of reviews here in England that were not very favourable. This coupled with an IMDB user rating below 7 and the fact that the director specialised in music videos meant that I went to see The Cell without great expectations. I'm happy to say it far exceeded what I expected. I've seen the film described as a cross between The Matrix and Silence of the Lambs. This is quite an accurate appraisal. The Cell is an original horror movie - a rare beast these days. Originality is something I value highly in horror films and this is different to any horror movie you've ever seen.The character development of the Lopez character and agent Novak is rather lacking and some of the main questions the film is seeking to answer could have been given solutions on a more psychological level. This is not a classic movie or even a horror classic, but it's better than another slasher flick (ironic or otherwise!)Be prepared for some very disturbing, dark images. For me, much worse than anything Se7en or Silence of the Lambs had to offer. You need to steel yourself for this one, but it's worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning, Not Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new level in the science of psychology is reached as the doctor is literally able to get inside the mind of the patient in `The Cell,' directed by Tarsem Singh and starring Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn. An original, imaginative concept, being able to actually explore the mind of a schizophrenic from the inside, takes this movie into somewhat virgin territory; the story itself, however, is not all that new, something of a cross between `Silence Of The Lambs,' and `The Matrix.' It is visually stunning, reminiscent of the `Mind's Eye' videos of the early ?90s, but advanced, of course, in keeping with the latest technology. The visuals are complimented with a driving, rhythmic score that is mesmerizing, especially when set against some of the wide angle shots of the superb cinematography. The scenes depicting the entrance into the patient's mind has the feel of Kubrick's `2001,' making the jump to light speed. Lopez gives a credible performance as Catherine Deane, who agrees to enter the mind of the demented Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), but the role isn't much of a stretch for her (nor would it have been for any capable actress). She does have a wonderful screen presence, however, that blends nicely and actually adds to the already outstanding visuals, all of which makes for some truly memorable images. Vaughn also does a good job as F.B.I. agent Peter Novak, but there's not a lot of depth to the character. There is some insight into what makes him tick, but it's not much; just enough to take him slightly beyond stereotype. D'Onofrio's Carl isn't much of a stretch either, but he is frightening (especially in the sequences that show how he sees himself in his own mind), more thanks to a lot of makeup rather than any disarming psychological terror he may have wrought (Carl is a somewhat pale imitation of Hannibal Lecter). There are some outstanding supporting performances here, especially by Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Dr. Kent) and Jake Weber (Agent Ramsey); neither character is necessarily cut from original cloth, but they both run with what they have and make them credible. Jake Thomas also does a notable turn as the young Carl Stargher. What `The Cell' really delivers is a memorable visual experience that is quite a trip in and of itself; the creative imagery that alternates an almost claustrophobic sense with breathtaking expansive, pacific vistas is worth the price of admission alone. That the story it frames is credible and interesting as well makes this a film worth seeing. It won't leave you dizzy with excitement, but there are some tense moments that are going to make you sit up and take notice. When all is said and done, this is a movie you're going to be glad you took the time to check out. I rate this one 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cell is one of those films that would like you to think it's weird, strange &amp; out there, but it's got quite a conventional hollywood heart. Yes, there are "weird" &amp; "disturbing" images in it, but they are what hollywood probably considers weird/disturbing. They are nothing we haven't seen before. Weirdness doesn't fully inhabit this film, but rather partially, to get your initial interest up, &amp; perhaps hope to hide the fact that this is a lazy seven/silence of the lambs rehash with a little exotic window dressing. There's something that rings false about the Cell's "weirdness".The first time Lopez enters the killer's mind has some interesting imagery, ok. As the film progresses, however, the visuals , that were more abstract &amp; wilder at the outset, become ordinary &amp; quite literal. The film &amp; the imagery(either in Lopez' head or the killers') turns to the "defeat the bad guy, save the victim girl" routine. Why can't we have a genuinely weird film, from beginning to finish, where the characters lose themselves to this new world, or are affected by it, mixing with their own world &amp; values? Why do these films insist on clearly defining what is evil/fantasy, &amp; where it is to be found, &amp; what is good/normal? Why does evil have to be "over there, somewhere" &amp; good "here, with us"?The endings in these types of films prove unsatisfactory as well; problems are all solved, &amp; the characters are back in a safe, normal world, as if the journey through this killer's mind was an amusement park ride, to be visited for a few hours, &amp; then all are returned to the "safety" of their homes &amp; world that they know. As if evil is something "out there", something alien to us. For more genuinely bizarre &amp; disturbing imagery, that stays honest to its ideas &amp; respects the viewer, try out films by David Lynch, Fellini, Luis Bunuel, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been a really interesting, possibly great movie, but it is not. Not by a long shot. This movie is an empty, pretentious piece of garbage. Beautiful imagery flows by, but none of it has any meaning. Characters are hollow. Some would say they are simple, archetypal figures. I would say that they're shells, non-characters parading around AS characters with flimsy back stories and lame characterization devices. The exploration of a serial killer's mind is handled with exactly the type of smug pop psychology that marks only the worst films of the genre. It would have been more interesting if first time director Tarsem Singh had explored the morality of invading a person's mind. But there is none of that. There are no grand themes, there are no real ideas being explored here. The story is just a rickety excuse to show lots of purty pictures. Someone should tell Tarsem that purty pictures don't mean a thing if there is nothing behind them. People have compared this film to 2001, Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club. THey've compared Tarsem to a burgeoning figure amongst filmmakers, on par with Fincher, PT ANderson, Jonze, and worst of all, Stanley Kubrick. THis is ludircous, and quite insulting to those genuinely talented people, those genuinely inspired films. This is garbage. Jennifer Lopez is terrible, purring every line like she's in a cheap 80s video porno. Vince Vaughn looks like a drunken lout slumming as an actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing quite like it: non-formulaic dreamlike psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cell could be described as a sci-fi psychological thriller except the only sci-fi element is a process that can make people go into other's people's minds, or it seemed to me, their dreams. Once you're inside the mind of someone, it goes into fantastical, sometimes surreal, territory. The cell of the title could be seen as the glass cage where a serial killer keeps and drowns his victims. However, I think the cell refers also to being trapped in one's own traumatic memories unable to escape. I enjoyed this film and found it quite stimulating (especially the visuals).There were scenes I had never seen before that were certainly helped a lot by amazing (sometimes over-the-top) costumes, make-up and hair. Despite being a killer, his mindscape was darkly imaginative instead of being realistically gritty (with exceptions). Of particular note were the fractioning horse scene and simply the killer walking down from his "throne" with the long trail. Most people will remember this film because of the visuals. However, I found the premise of going into a serial killer's mind singularly fascinating. The how and why I leave for you to discover but let's just say the manhunt aspect is over pretty quickly (something rarely seen but plot convenient) to change into a rescue operation.The serial killer himself was a rather creepy, menacing and tormented man-child played very well by an unrecognizable Vincent D'Onofrio. The killer himself is interesting and has an original modus operandi. Despite his atrocious acts, there's an attempt to try to understand him by showing us parts of his past and him as a child in his mindscape. It makes the viewer somewhat torn between sympathy towards the child and foreboding at his adult self. Jennifer Lopez was very good at showing empathy, not so much at being scared. Vince Vaughn was surprising in a dead-serious FBI agent role. Speaking of scares, the whole aspect of being stuck in that glass cell, especially in the second half, didn't quite work emotionally for me. The actress in it certainly tried her best to show distress, but I was personally more interested into going back to the mindscape.I found everything that happened to the child, and the way the bleached victims looked, way more chilling. Praise to the director on not being overtly graphic letting our imagination fill in the gaps. I think Tarsem is a director in the line of Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam to watch out for because he shows much talent and vision. The Cell defies the expectations of your standard serial killer movie and dazzles with unsettling imagery that I would call original except that several are borrowed from late 20th century artists. To be fair, most of it has never been shown on film like this before.Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way that The Cell was always described to me was that it had good cinematography but bad everything else. Well, now that I've actually viewed it I can state that the above statement is not entirely true. Firstly, the cinematography is otherworldly. The special effects, the lighting, the makeup, the costumes are all absolutely amazing. I cannot stress this fact enough. I knew that this movie was going to look excellent but my expectations on that matter were far exceeded. The interior of a schizophrenics mind is portrayed precisely how you would imagine his mind would look like. This entails very grotesque and bizarre moments that essentially make this movie. Secondly, I will admit that there is some poor dialog scattered throughout this film and there is some decidedly wooden acting (Mrs. Lopez can be thanked for that) but all in all the plot moves quickly and is intriguing, not too dissimilar to a taut episode CSI . It is the root that keeps this film in balance, so it does not stray into mere absurdity. The crime/thriller backbone plot (however, edge-of-your seat captivating it is) is merely a background for the real insanity that is the topography of the killer's mind. I think this movie did poorly when it was released because it did not have a proper audience that would come and see it but, none the less, I think most people who will give this criminally underrated movie a chance will enjoy it like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not too bad. The visual effects were very good, and the villain was pretty freaky. There was just one thing that really bothered me.Am I alone in thinking that psychiatrist (J Lo, whatever her name was supposed to be) acted really stupid at the end? Remember how at the end she went into the simulation but reversed the feed so instead of it putting her in the killer's mind it put the killer inside her mind? The idea, of course, being that in your own mind you have an enormous advantage. You control the "world" if you would, you're basically God. But then she totally fails to exploit that. She fights the killer with equal weapons, and doesn't use the terrain to her advantage at all.If it was me in her place the killer would find himself in the middle of a flat plane with his big sword and fetish gear... surrounded by an endless army of superhuman power-armored ninjas toting 20 mm autocannons that he'd have to fight his way through just to get to me. And I'd have turned myself into a 100 foot armored colossus that uses a battleship cannon as a sidearm. As he fought my army I'd be smiting him with thunderbolts and fire from the sky the whole time, and causing the ground to constantly fall away from under his feet, exposing superhot lava from which the zombies of his victims would be constantly trying to grab him and eat his ankles.This is assuming, of course, that I can't just make a cage around him and then arbitrarily raise the world's sea level by ten kilometers or take away the atmosphere and kill him that way.Am I alone in this, or did it occur to other people too?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but somewhat entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this silly but somewhat entertaining sci-fi thriller, Jennifer Lopez plays a scientist who, using modern technology, can literally enter the mind of another person. She is given the dubious task of entering the twisted mind of psychopath Vincent D'Onofrio, to track down his next victim.A large portion of the film is made up of abstract images that J-Lo witnesses as she travels deeper and deeper into the mind of D'Onofrio, and the rest of the film is made of constant cutbacks to Vince Vaughn loping around, trying to find the "cell" in which the psycho's next victim is kept. The film seems to be a pointless exercise in style over content. Nevertheless, the film does move at quite an impressive pace, despite the fact that its point is rather distant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a intricate investigation into the human mind from what I had been led to believe about this film. Instead, I got a mishmash of police drama, drug trip, science-fiction, and shallow arm-chair psych. Even the psychology is a mishmash of Freudian complexes and Jungian symbols.The movie is basically a showcase for FX. Beyond that, it's much ado about nothing. Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>6.7 at the Best No Doubt, but it could have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From today's standard the movie gets 6.7 stars but wait a minute it was made in 2000. Every aspect of this movie is outstanding except few extras which could have made it stellar for a longer period. The child's plot got extended without reason. The point was to prove that you probe mind and do something interesting not fix the kid. The ending was not spectacular because of extended plot (kind of you have dual plots so I was confused why I have another lingering feeling after the movie). You show some attachment in the movie and then you let the people walk their way as if they are from Gamma Quadrant Bisexual creatures. If we portray something different then those people are going to celebrate the movie but if they are minority the rule of statistics is against you unless majority is sympathetic to the cause you know where I am going actually. I think we should have added some happy ending towards attraction. Movie is much better made and should be seen couple of times. Another point is to throw some Da Vinci code type puzzles which people can solve only after multiple visits, this way you get repeat customers and linger the though. After watching the movie I felt we have not made any progress in special effects and Silicon Graphics still holds value or it seems movie is made in 2011 (curiously it did retain its youthfulness). I am not a regular fan of such movies I just saw it to find out what went wrong with Cell 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good visuals, and one of the most beautiful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most beautiful movie I've seen, and crisp visuals director Tarsem Singh provides in every scene is one of the best I've seen.There is no need to go over the plot here as many have already commented, but I do have bit of a problem with it. Asides from being the doctor who invented the method for entering people's dreams, in actuality J Lo weren't the key linchpin to solving the case which detracts from the focus of the "Who's the main protagonist in this movie ?". The catharsis that would have been there if she solved the case, but alas that was not to be.But asides from this, it is an interesting movie that is mind provoking. Maybe it does have little bit of Bollywood and European cinema in it, but the setting is distinctly American as it takes place in of all place, Bakersfield California.Interesting mixture of culture makes this movie an entertaining piece to watch. Props, the set, and the visuals are all first class. It's worth watching just for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful nightmare.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember renting this at the video store in high school about 6 years ago and i didn't think much of this film. However, watching it again recently, I do realise how much this film conveys beauty and darkness into one, thus making it a really fascinating, if at times slow, ride.Essentially the plot is about Jennifer Lopez, who plays Catherine, a psychologist who is able to enter the minds of her patients through a new technology available, where she goes into the patient's mind and talks to them etc etc. She is asked to enter the mind of a serial killer in order to know where he has kept his latest victim who will soon drown. The only problem is that obviously entering a mind like that holds big risks, as she enters the unknown, and she may never get out....Jennifer Lopez gives a reasonably good performance and is definitely watchable. Essentially the plot is a lot like Silence of the Lambs, though you get to know more about the killer, who you often feel sorry for. This film sort of gives reasons for why someone can become crazy, and this film is more sympathetic to the killer.The visuals in this are fantastic and you can only marvel at the creativity. Though it does feel that this is sometimes more for show than heart, and I did feel that the scenes in the serial killer's mind did go a bit slow sometimes. I mean, Catherine is working on a clock and time basis - the victim doesn't have much time so I did think that she could have done it a bit faster, but then obviously she has to go easy and slowly with the killer or it will blow up so it was acceptable.This is essentially a Silence of the Lambs with added Science Fiction thrown in to make it seem more unique. The main problem with the film is that the characters aren't particularly interesting, despite the fact that they could have very well been. Vince Vaughn is also pretty bland in his role as the detective.This is more a thriller than horror, as some people might think it is horror, but I wouldn't recommend watching this at night for the first time since you won't know what is in store. After that, it should be fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silence Of The Lambs meets Dreamscape in this slick, sick sci-fi/horror which stars J-Lo as Catherine Deane, a psychologist who enters the mind of comatose serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) in an attempt to discover the whereabouts of his latest victim, Anne Marie Vicksey, who is trapped in a glass room that is slowly filling with water.When Catherine runs into trouble whilst inside Stargher's twisted subconscious world, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) plunges himself into the nightmare in an attempt to save her.As far as dazzling eye candy is concerned, The Cell is a real winner: packed with arresting cinematography, surrealist effects, striking set design, and incredibly creative costumes, the film is simply stunning to look at and, for this reason alone, is well worth checking out. It's a shame, however, that The Cell's intriguing storyline isn't quite as polished as the visuals.Certain aspects of the story are handled extremely well, such as the abduction and plight of Anne Marie and Stargher's perverted treatment of his victims' bodies, but other areas of the plot make little sense or feel under-developed: Catherine saving Stargher's inner child seems ultimately rather pointless (he's a serial killer; he dies; so who cares); Novak hints at a troubled childhood, but we never learn what it is that happened to him; and the FBI agent's realisation that he knows how to locate Ann-Marie is way too sudden.As far as the performances go, Lopez and Vaughn are adequate, but it is D'Onofrio who steals the show, both as the 'real-life' lank-haired killer (who gets his kicks by suspending himself above his victims' bleached corpses and having a quick hand shandy whilst watching them die on video), and his wicked dream persona?a decadent, sniggering demi-god in a freaky world of his own making.</fullReview>

To say, "This movie is screwed up!" is an understatement. I not only give kudos to the the director for his idea of bringing the film to the screen, but the writer for getting the director to see his vision. This is a film that I'm, personally, not into, but I like Lopez and I'm a big fan of hers, so, granted it took me over eight years to sit down and watch it, I did it. Vaughn and Lopez pulled this movie off, along with the director's vision. The colors in the dream sequence are so vibrant that they all stand apart on their own (look at Lopez's lips compared to her face). I'm not a fan of the genre, but I'm definitely a fan of this film! To get someone like me to give this film 7 out of 10 stars, in my book, has it together!</fullReview>

The hard core, edgy as well as conflicted mental disorder probing into the mind of insanity bursts onto the screen as images beyond imagination etch an emotionally riveting, poignant, tense and taut film. Great pacing, editing, photography lend to a serious and gripping movie about mental science fiction entering into another mind that is both grotesque and almost spiritual. Jennifer Lopez and Vincent D'Onofrio offer up strong, exciting performances that both frighten and capture the heart. This movie has yet to be surpassed in terms of dreamscapes and haunting relational destruction and redemption without all the traditional baggage of popular movies. [4/19/09] - In the tradition of "Silence of the Lambs" (1991) and "Manhunter" (1986), the intriguing FBI investigatory mystery thriller combines with the surrealism of "Brazil" (1985) and the more recent horror movie "1408" (2007), this serious, no thrills but in your face imagery and fastastic images punches through to a senstively presented, humanely psychological insight into people, children and adults.

People from the music scene shouldn't be involved in movies. Look at Madonna and others, most of their movies became nothing at the box office. But you better watch this one. Lopez is believable. Acting and storyline is great. They are trying to get in a killer his brains. And it works but things go wrong. When we are in a brain sequence we see beautiful landscapes, great make up, the chosen wardrobe is unbelievable, in fact, a great setting. When I'm talking about The Cell to friends they always react, oh that one with Jennifer, couldn't be that great. They are all so wrong, go watch it, extremely underrated</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing but mysteriously captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a psychiatrist having to use a new technique to enter another person's mind, in order to save a woman who has been kidnapped and being tortured by a psychopath."The Cell" is a very chilling film. The plot is disturbing, sick and even revolting. The acts that he does to himself and to the victims are cruel, bloody and revolting. Such acts are visually presented, making the film rather horrifying to watch. Indeed these scenes, together with the suspense of the woman who is about to be tortured, keeps the adrenaline running. So, "The Cell" has the unique property of scaring and revolting me, but I still find it mysteriously captivating and want to keep watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Cell", at the most basic level, is about a serial killer who slowly drowns young women in large glass cages, and then has sex with their corpses while watching video footage of them drowning to "inspire" him. Lovely. Not one of the better story lines of that year, in my opinion. Though if it were it would have been a waste, as the people behind this film are clearly not adept at storytelling; the story carried as it is by uninteresting characters and almost completely banal dialogue. What the film does offer is arresting, unique and inventive imagery. Indeed, there is enough of it in the final half hour to merit at least one viewing of the film. It is a shame that this imagery wasn't featured in a better film, not least because it means that the rest of this film can't be given the wide berth that, aside from a well executed scene between Vaugh and Lopez, it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing but worth the effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented The Cell on DVD some eight years late, after watching director Tarsem Singh's latest work, The Fall, a couple of weeks ago at my local movie house. He's got to be one of the most original directors around at the moment, and his visions are stunning, colourful and definitely not your standard fare. Both these movies are very strong visually. I get the feeling that Tarsem Singh finds a series of beautiful locations, gets some exquisite costumes made, and then thinks of the story he can use as the excuse to put them on screen. Possibly he's a frustrated National Geographic photographer?To be honest, I'm glad I never watched The Cell in a theatre because it's really quite disturbing and I had to get up half way through, put it on pause and make a cup of tea! You see, the problem is, I don't 'do' drowning. It may be something to do with the seven years I spent working at sea, where the threat of a watery grave is ever present, but depictions of trapped people drowning have a visceral and immediate effect on me, I feel nauseous, I can't just look at it dispassionately and say "Oh yes, nice direction! That's very well done. She really does look like she's drowning?.." It makes me curl up in a ball. I hated Titanic for many reasons, but the drownings were the main one. And the depictions of drowning in The Cell are nothing if not vivid. It's weird really because if he'd strangled them, I could probably have watched it without turning a hair.But even given my squeamishness, I persevered and it was worth it, as this is a well made and visually imaginative movie. I was also quite pleasantly surprised by Jennifer Lopez' performance, given that I'm not a fan of her singing. Lopez plays Catherine Deane, who works at a cutting edge psychiatric clinic where she gets into the mind of the patients to try and unlock what's going on in there. When the movie opens she is inside the mind of a boy in a coma. Lacking progress, she'd like to reverse the process and take him into her mind, but her superiors tell her it's too risky. Meanwhile a serial killer is on the loose. A deeply unpleasant nut job who snatches and drowns his victims before soaking them in bleach and sexually assaulting their bodies, he tortures them by submersion in a tank at a remote location, via remote control, and videos it all for his later pleasure. Be warned, this is not an easy watch. The police catch him but cannot locate his last victim (well played by Tara Subkoff). It is a race against time to find her before she too dies horribly. After he lapses into a psychotic coma of some sort, they send him to Lopez' clinic in a desperate attempt to get into his head. Failing to gain enough on her first attempts, Deane decides to go with the dangerous option, and take him into her head instead.Vince Vaughn co stars as the FBI detective Peter Novak and Vincent D'Onofrio plays the sadistic villain Carl. The whole supporting cast is good, right down to the albino German Shepherd. I'm a long time sci-fi fan, so I appreciate that I may be more open to this genre than many, I can recall reading many similar stories years ago, and this story is far from original. You really watch it for the visuals. If you are not a sci-fi fan I have no doubt this movie will turn you right off and may upset you. But I especially liked that they resisted the temptation to have Lopez and Vaughn fall into each other's arms in a clichéd ending. Instead, she walks off into the sunset with the dog. Wise move!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, for all the movies in the 90's that got made about serial killers, I can't think of any after "Silence Of The Lambs", that did anything at all interesting, with the exception of "The Cell".The mind is a prison, and only J-Lo can navigate it's bizarre and grotesque and classically inspired landscapes, to free the child within. This could be the description to a number of children's fantasy films, if the child in question, were not within the psyche of a man who drowns women, hangs by his skin over their corpses and ejaculates on them as he watches recordings of them struggle.Full of uncommon ugliness and beauty, this sci-fi, cop, pop psychobabble extravaganza, somehow makes it's odd cast and visuals into something coherent and entertaining, much like Luc Besson's "The Fifth Element", where if you repeat the events of the film to yourself they don't add up to much, but the actual "watching" of the film and seeing all of the elements interconnect, make up for any slack in the story. I watched this again after "The Fall", and realized I'd never really given this a fair shake, but even Jennifer Lopez does a decent job here. If you've seen this, give it another shot, if you haven't see it. It's fruit for the eyes (which is different from CGI candy), and all the better for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Cell" is a sojourn into a nightmarish world created by a sick and tortured mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been fascinated with dreams. They are guaranteed escapes from reality that we all share, and we don't need psychedelic drugs to take us there. All we have to do is close our eyes and fall asleep. Our dreams can be vivid, or they can be sketchy. They can be based on what's familiar, or be total fantasies. They can be realms of happiness, or be chambers of horror. There is one thing, however, that we can all agree upon: dreams most certainly are mysterious.I've often wondered if dreams are much, much more than simply a means of purging and recharging the brain. Could our dreams be significant? Could they have meaning? Could we learn from them? Could they be applied to our waking lives and be advantageously used to, perhaps, help solve problems? And if so, could the opposite also be true? Could our dreams harm us, or even kill us? Are we resigned to be merely silent witnesses, forced to go where our dreams lead us, or could we be active participants in them?These questions have been explored in films before, most notably "A Nightmare On Elm Street" and "Dreamscape" (both released in 1984) and "The Matrix" (1999). The best-selling author Stephen King explored these questions in "The Stand" (1978) and "Insomnia" (1994). Now, "The Cell" can be added to the list. All are based on the theory that within us lies an ability to control the direction, flow and outcome of our dreams...provided that we realize we are dreaming. Once we do, we'll realize we are not constrained by the rules and laws of nature. In dreams, we can create our own rules. In dreams, everything is possible.I believe that the cast of "The Cell" could not have been more perfect. Vincent D'Onofrio is phenomenal as Carl Stargher, a serial killer who's perhaps as tortured as his victims. I could not help but feel sorry for this man. He seemed to be "made" a murderer against his will by a combination of severe childhood abuse and a virus that destroyed his mind. Vince Vaughn is excellent as Peter Novak, a homicide detective consumed by frustration, exhaustion, and desperation. Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly good as the soft-spoken social worker/parapsychologist, Dr. Catherine Deane, who is as empathetic and courageous as she is beautiful. What unfolds is a compelling story of a race against time to save a killer's last victim...but incredibly, most of the action in this film takes place in the killer's mind. The cinematography, set direction and special effects are mesmerizing, both beautiful and horrific. The bottom line: "The Cell" is essentially a sojourn into the nightmarish world created by a sick and tortured mind.I have seen this film at least a dozen times since it's release, and each time I've noticed details that I'd somehow overlooked in the past. If you are a fan of science fiction and horror, this captivating film should not be overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing visuals....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is something you may remember, dream about and even be frightened of a few years after you have seen it.Director Singh and the cinematographer are to be commended for what almost translates to abstract art on screen.The acting requires a bit of suspension of logic, but Lopez does well, looks stunning, and if you can ignore the performance of Vince Vaughn as detective you will enjoy this film.Basically, Jennifer Lopez is a psychologist who must enter the mind of serial killer, 'Starger' (well-portrayed by a frightening Vincent D'Onofrio). Abused since childhood, the killer has endured a private hell, and Lopez finds herself drawn into it, so as she may rescue his most recent hostage. There are scenes of the desert, stark and vibrant. A horse and young boy, fleeing from a horrific phantom image. The "king" in the young boy's mind is actually the writhing twisted spirit of the serial killer. It is a character drawn out of a novel by Marquis De Sade, an unspeakable evil which fantasizes about twisting human innards and organs, many of the visuals are seemingly lifted from De Sade's tales of horror.Lopez also has a later scene wherein she looks like a religious Madonna, cherry blossoms and scarlet robes. Visually beautiful. Well worth watching. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly Bizarre And Visually Amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Cell", Jennifer Lopez plays Catherine Deane - a psychotherapist who is part of a new-found procedure that allows a person to enter the mind of another person. This special procedure gets a new kind of use when Catherine is asked to enter the mind of a recently captured, very demented comatose serial killer who tortures his victims before killing them, in an attempt to find out where his most recent victim is at. In a race against time, Catherine begins a disturbing journey into the psychopath's mind to try and save a young woman's life that is hanging in the balance.Among the vast pool of serial-killer/detective movies, I can confidently say that "The Cell" is likely the most bizarre of any of them. Story-wise, in some instances this film may not seem like much of anything original - detective trying to save a helpless victim from a serial killer in a race against time. In that aspect, it's really not original. However, the spin on the story is the entering of the killer's mind, and the utterly bizarre and disturbing things that can be found in there. The psychopathic murderer in this film is one twisted man, and we learn this before we actually enter his mind, after seeing him hanging himself from hooks and tormenting women, among other things. But the real genius of this film is the somewhat futuristic/sci-fi element of the mind exploration. It's a magnificent idea that hasn't been elaborated enough, and this film does it well.But the most disturbing thing about this film is the twisted, bizarre imagery that we see on display inside of the villain's head. The set decorating, colors, and the general scenario of these scenes are beautiful but terrifying - it's all pure eye candy. The sounds, visuals, and overall atmosphere of the internal-mind sequences are abstract, stunning, and haunting. I can't even begin to describe it, it's something you have to see for yourself. Serious credit needs to be given to the set designers and cinematographers, they did an amazing job, as well as the script and the director's vision (I believe the director of this film is known for directing music videos, which makes sense). Vincent D'Onforio plays the twisted killer excellently, and is the best thing about the film. And while Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn (who also give solid performances) are considered the 'main' characters, we really learn more about the killer than we do anyone else. I'm not sure if that's a bad or good thing, but it is interesting.All in all, "The Cell" is a severely strange film, but it is also an excellent and very scary experience. Visually, this film is a complete knock-out, and the story is written well enough also. If you would like to see a (very) different psychological crime/horror film, "The Cell" is likely your cup of tea. As for me, I thought it was very well-done, and probably one of the strangest but most visually enthralling films I've seen in quite some time. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film...Jennifer's BEST Performance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film while visiting my mothers house for my sister's baby shower, she had owned this film for a while and I never put it on. Every time I saw the trailer I wanted to see the film, but never had it. So finally I said the hell with it and watched. And I think I should slap myself silly(as a movie buff I should've seen it a long time ago). This film is one of those thrillers that doesn't come by very often. The premise is simple and interesting; a serial killer who tortures his victims, kills them, than makes them into dolls is finally caught, but not before he has some sort of seizure that leaves him comatose. If the police don't get to his latest victim within 40 hours she will die, so they need Jennifer Lopez's character to enter into his mind(she's a hypnotherapist)and gain his trust and find out where the victim is. The film is fast paced when it needs to be and it takes its time when it needs to. In other words the editing is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Although, the film is categorized as being Sci-Fi/Thriller, there is quite a bit of Drama involved that gives the killer's character a sympathetic side(like Frankenstein's Monster). And Jennifer Lopez shows that she can definitely act(unlike Mariah Carey who is a better singer than actor). New Line Cinema has also released a pretty decent DVD(New Line is one of the best Horror movie distributors next to Anchor Bay). With two or three commentaries, deleted/alternate scenes and trailers. The only thing I have a problem with is the packaging. It's the easy to scratch type boxes(the kind Rush Hour came in). If New Line ever re-released this I would like a better box for it to come in and a making of documentary. Once again;a great film. If you haven't seen it go see it. If you like this film go see... Manhunter(1988) with Brian Cox as Hannibal Lektor(based on the Thomas Harris book The Red Dragon), Silence of the Lambs(1991) with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector(based on the Thomas Harris book of the same name) and Kiss the Girls(1997) with Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross(based on the John Patterson book of the same name). NOTE:I recommend reading the books before seeing the film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are here some very good visual effects, and this is not very well, because after seeing them I expected the same from the storyline, which doesn't give much of an impact. The film comes with interesting ideas which could have impressed more if the makers had worked on a little more. Too bad, it is an interesting idea, and I would have expected the ending to give me a little headache(in a good way), but it left a bad taste in my mouth. The "mind" world should have been more disturbing, and weirder (not that commercial),giving something to think about. Still, nice images, it was like contemplating on paintings. You can spare a little time to watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>visual masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer of the film I though,it would be something extravagant.And when I saw the film I though that is an art.The story is usual-a serial killer and a psychologist which is trying to save one of the killer's victims by a new scientific method.But the enormous value of the film is in the scenes when the psychologist and then the cop rove through the sick mind of the killer trying to find answers about the victim who is still alive.Amazing close-ups mixed with beautiful visual effects and compositional decisions.There is a surrealistic harmony in the pictures from the killer's mind.I felt like on the screen there were Salvador Dali'pictures changing one after another.O yeah in this film there is a lot of surrealism and I liked it.Moreover the surrealism is mixed with a story of modern thriller and the replacement of the atmosphere of a thriller and the atmosphere of Dali' picture is also breath-taking.Now there are not so much films with such aesthetic value and that one definitely worths watching.The music is also very impressive.It is oriental and the scene when"Jenny"was talking with the white dog there was music,as a background,which was very similar to the Bulgarian national music.I am a Bulgarian and those rhythm extremely excited me.That film has also very important social idea,about the violence in home and the spoiling of the child's mind.The acting is very successful too.I was surprised to see Jennifer in such role but she is very good.I also think that the film would be even better if there was one actor like Al Pachino,Hopkins or Mell Gibson in the role of the killer for example.As a conclusion-an actual social idea,great visual effects and picturesque outlook,plus horror,drama,triller and sci-fi elements with a lot of surrealism on a background of"beautiful" music-masterpiece.Congratulations to the director and all the people working on the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't get trapped in the cell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot understand why this film was hyped as the one of the best films released in the summer of 2000. "The Cell" is nothing more than special effects and visually stunning set designs gone wrong. There was nothing in this film that was appealing. With each setting, it seemed like the designers got better at creating the backdrop for where the story took place; however, the settings don't make the movie.The biggest reason for its failure was the complexity of the plot. What was the writer trying to bring across with each scene he wrote. It seemed liked it dragged on longer than necessary. Besides the drawn out and complex plot, the ending was very tedious. "The Cell" did serve one purpose: it was a lesson for me to tell all to avoid renting this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cell is a movie that has really made it's own genre. It has a very unique plot, but the director failed to follow up on it and we are left hanging at the end, with many unanswered questions. However, if you are going into the theater for a good trip and a bit of fun, this may be the movie for you. But be warned. The graphic violence and twisted scenes are not for everybody. Actor Vincent D'Onofrio is excellent, and (unfortunatly) really makes you believe that this could be true. He is very realistic. His seems to be the only character that requires any good acting, and the only one that has any. J.Lo was poorly cast. She does not quite bring the character to life like it could have been. Vince Vaughn did his best in a role that required very little acting at all. All in all, I say D'Onofrio's acting is what made this movie (mostly) work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been reading through the comments here (not all 589, thank you) and see a pattern I disagree with. First off, J-Lo can't act. Well, I think she is completely successful as a spunky, sensitive psychiatric social worker with a gift of empathy with disturbed children. Also, people feel that the film is needlessly gory, or simply needless, as it examines the psychotic mind. Hey, folks, this isn't the first film to go up that alley. The envisioning of the psychotic's mind is brilliantly and stunningly communicated through artful and fantastic visions. The plot's hokey? Okay, I'll give you that one (SPOILER: Just where did he get all that running water in the middle of the desert? And how did he get those huge, heavy panes of glass down that little door?). But I think of this film as a science fiction flick, and logical plotting is not the hallmark of the science-fiction world. I saw this at the theater and recently found the DVD, and I was thoroughly chilled and excited by this strikingly beautiful and haunting work. This isn't 'Gigli,' folks. This is one fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no denying it - the plot of this film is pretty weak. On the other hand, it's visuals are jaw dropping. The first time I saw The Cell, it thought it was so-so, but the second time I could ignore the literally-going-into-the-mind-of-a-killer-silliness, and just feast my eyes on the nightmarish realisation of a sick mind. It's a shame that the budget wouldn't allow even more elaborate visuals. I, for one, would have liked to see more of that, and less stuff going on in the real world.D'Onofrio can do the weird-psycho part in his sleep, and this is Lopez' second best performance (check out Out of Sight for the best one), but it's the freaky, weird, demented, disturbing, and beautiful scenery, costumes, effects, and cinematography that makes this one worth watching.

		<fullReview>Another reviewer here (b-ward-1) writes (***POSSIBLE SPOILER***):&gt; Most laughable moment occurs in the climactic scene when the Detective&gt; is about to rescue the drowning woman from a large glass tank. Instead&gt; of getting on with the job of smashing the tank, he holds his FBI badge&gt; up against the glass. Like she was going check his credentials?!?It's clear from the situation that smashing the glass could be very dangerous for her. She needs to be at the back of the tank before he can do this safely. The dialogue spells this out. But she doesn't know who this man is who is giving her orders. So he shows her his FBI ID. Made perfect sense to me.Thank heavens he took this precaution. She'd have been sliced to pieces by the shards of glass as the water swept her out of the tank. Perhaps we could've got a laugh with that -- Vince Vaughn's chagrin as a severed head whooshes past; cut to the shadow of a smile on the face of the comatose D'Onofrio. Nah -- that'd be a different movie. Back to the script as written.A very curious movie this. The "Silence of the Lambs" plot isn't up to much, but it works fine as something to hang the outrageously beautiful dream sequences on. More than a hint of Powell-Pressburger about this.</fullReview>

Lopez as a therapist who enters the mind of a serial killer simply serves as window dressing to the main plot, which has Vince Vaughan and Tim Roth racing again the clock to track down the killer before he claims his next victim. D'Onofrio is a standout as the nightmarish killer. He has an incredibly repugnant scene with this latest victim barely five minutes into the movie that surely must have sent more than one person scurrying from the theater. Not recommended.

		<shortDescription>The Important Elements Are Just Not There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crazed killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) has been caught in a comatose state. The problem is that there is a woman (Tara Subkoff) who will be dead in 40 hours because of D'Onofrio. Now detective Vince Vaughn has enlisted the help of child psychologist Jennifer Lopez to go into the mind of the killer literally using a new form of treatment. What follows is a wild and chaotic jumble of colors and images that are hard to describe or talk about. First-time director Tarsem Singh shows some real potential here, but "The Cell" falls flat because major elements are just not present. None of the performers are very impressive and the screenplay is not focused at all. The film ends up feeling like a drug-induced dream (or nightmare) that is little more than eye candy. The special effects are somewhat impressive, but the film looks a bit cheap and rushed during real-time (scenes outside of the killer's mind). The costume designs are elaborate and so are the Oscar-nominated makeup effects. However, the film is only fair at best and ends up being a cross between "The Silence of the Lambs" and dozens of cheap horror films. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This not a really good film, but it is not a waste of money either. I practically enjoyed it, but cannot say it was good, because I had the feeling the movie could have been better and I feel that the reason it was not better was the director. Tarsem Singh really made a couple of good beautiful shots, but sometimes his way of making us see some things I just did not like. There was for instance that scene when Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) entered Stargher's (Vincent D'Onofrio) mind for the first time. That scene could have been so much better if Singh would not have decided to make it a dream sequence like he did, meaning that the color should have been normal and also the speech. Nevertheless that was one of the very good moments of this film. First of all the beginning of the scene with Catharine Dean (Jennifer Lopez) who reminded me of Princess Leia in Return of the Jedi there. Lopez had something of a cat suit instead of a bikini though and I must say she looked very good in that (the hair (two tails all black with red endings), the make up and the red neck - thing did their jobs too though). The whole thing that follows then, between her and Vaughn really was sexy (almost had me a ?., well I'll better not tell you kids that) and the rest of the scene in which Lopez wears that ?costume' is just??disturbing. My other favorite scene is the whole ending, from the arrows until it is over. It is just so intense, I must give Singh credit for that.What can I say about acting, well all were good (I especially liked the Lopez arrow ? scene attitude (call me crazy but I like me a feisty female every once in a while)), but D'Onofrio definitely stole the show as the totally whacko, freaked out lunatic. Maybe he was even a bit too good. I know there is no Oscar here, but he was believable and that's what counts.Apart from that, you know there has been some commotion over the fact that Lopez' has a rather enormous butt, well I got a good glimpse of it when she went to the fridge in the movie and all I can say is that I liked what I saw. By the way, in this movie, there was some attention spend on the well formed body Lopez has, but be not fooled by the R rating for nudity, it is not her that is nude.7 out of 10</fullReview>

I've disagreed with him occasionally (especially about Fight Club), but a lot of times he brings a lot of insight to his reviews. But how he could possibly think that The Cell is one of the best movies of the year is beyond my comprehension. There were many things wrong with it, but I think the biggest problem was all the regurgitation. It's a regurgitation of basically every serial killer movie to come out since Silence of the Lambs. I'm getting pretty sick of movies like this, where a deranged killer has a sick fetish and kills his female victims in an incredibly overcomplicated and ridiculous way and then does something ceremonious with the corpse. I've seen this before. I've seen it before SEVERAL TIMES. There's nothing in it that's original. Everything in it is borrowed from some other movie. In the end, it raised several conflicts that are never resolved or resolved so shabbily that they in turn raise new conflicts. If this movie is one of the best of the year, I don't think I wanna waste money on another movie until 2001.</fullReview>

I couldn't understand what the writer was trying to bring across from scene to scene. It seemed liked it dragged on longer than it had to. Besides the drawn out and complex plot, the ending to "The Cell" was so tedious it was laughable.

The movie was merely an excuse to string them together. The combination failed to draw me in, and I found myself paying more attention to the hardness of my seat than the story.Next time I hope he will do us all a favor, and dispense with plot altogether.

		<fullReview>Although I am a big sci-fi fan, I had no interest in seeing "The Cell" in a theater because all the initial reviews I had read were extremely negative (bad acting, bad script, etc). Then I came across of couple of reviews that rated this film as one of the year's best! Perplexed, I decided to see this movie.I thought it was great. I think a lot of the negative reviews were due to the disturbing subject matter, and also because the director got his start in music videos (for some reason that's considered a bad thing by some folks). Anyway, the visuals in this film were simply jaw-dropping. I particularly enjoyed the opening sequence -- its combination of desert imagery and weird but effective music really set the tone for this film.Most movies these days suffer from poor endings, but this one didn't. The well-crafted screenplay set up a multi-layered climax that wrapped up the film nicely. And I thought the acting was good throughout. This movie is not for everybody. It has some very disturbing elements. All I can tell you is that I enjoyed it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where to begin with how good a film this is. The story is tight and covers all of the bases. It is by no means a masterpiece and it's not horribly cerebral, at least in typical "Hollywood" terms. In other words, "The Cell" doesn't give you a character study of EVERY one of the principal characters. However that's not to say that it isn't smart cinema.As a first film, Tarsem has decided not to bite off more than he can chew. He's obviously stuck to what made him successful in the first place, stunning visuals packed with surrealistic meaning. And I do mean "surrealistic" in the true sense of the word. It's incredibly reminiscent of the movement headed by such notable artist as Magritte, Dali, Ernst and Miro. Tarsem doesn't have to give the audience the typical Hollywood exposition because it's character study is laid out in the subconscious, which we see in vivid detail. A film that seems superficial at first, but on a second viewing becomes deeper in content.Tarsem's tool kit is all encompassing, using almost every speed of film stock available from Kodak. At one point, the film's grain becomes the size of basketballs, as he used the fasted stock he could find for an exterior scene filled with sunlight (which normally calls for slow speed stock). In the blink of an eye, the grain disappears with what I can only assume is a stock rated 200 ASA, or slower. This is a filmmaker who knows all of the tools and uses them like a fine artist. Not only does each film call for a different look, but each scene may also demand a unique style.Many might complain that we don't see much depth from Lopez and the Vaughn characters. In fact, at one point Vaughn hints that he too was abused as a child, however nothing ever comes of it. But who cares? When it comes down to it we just want to know Vaughn he has such a bug up his ass to catch the bad guys, and that explanation does just fine.The character we do want to know about is D'Onofrio's "Carl Stargher" and, thanks to his vivid subconscious, we get to know him in spades. In fact, to those who say that his character is less fleshed out than Hannibal in "Silence Of The Lambs" I say, "you're nuts"! This is one of the rare instances that we see the kindlier gentler side of a homicidal maniac, albeit as a child. We actually see WHY this guy is as screwy as he is.Speaking of D'Onofrio, Tarsem should also get kudos for his choreography. When D'Onofrio is king of his dream world, he moves with such artistry that he looked like a Rodin sculpture come alive. I loved it.This is why the film is so good. Everything looks controlled, not like the usual havoc of filmmaking where the filmmakers wish for "happy accidents". It is a moving painting, not a masterpiece, but a brilliant first oil to say the least.For you hard core music video fans, take note of the homage to fellow director Mark Romanek with the spinning cube from Madanna's "Bedtime Story". Special note, one should be on the look out for the scene where Tarsem pays homage to his own REM video. The set is right out of the "Losing My Religion" video and the underlining meaning of that statement is enough to make me like Tarsem a great deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously made by someone who has never directed something longer then 4 minutes. Tarsem made his mark directing music videos and commercials, and it shows as he is not able to keep a consistent story going for more then 5 minutes here. He tries to make us sympathize with the serial killer... however we never do as we never get to really know him. D`Onfrio is good in his few speaking parts, which prove to be the highlights of the movie. No sense of genuine redemtion or regret for what he has done at the end. The "struggle" between the two halves of his personality is horribly done as well. Rent it on video if you are really interested. Although most of the eye candy (which is without a doubt why most people are seeing it) is in the previews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Visuals, good storyline, but lacks substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director apparently wanted to make a dark/light contrasting piece of artwork on the screen, which succeeded. It was a beautiful piece of visual artwork but was not supported music, acting nor character development.The movie had potential with the visuals, story line, and Vincent D'Onofrio as the villain. Vincent D'Onofrio was under utilized as an actor with few lines that were muffled and soft not lending to a shy man with under developed social skills. Nor to a mysterious man who wishes to be anonymous. The components to suggest these things are left to the viewer's imagination. So Vincent D'Onofrio although gave a great performance he was under utilized. Also music was lacking in certain areas of the picture that could have given the audience the air of suspense or the feeling that the character was ominous.Jennifer Lopez! What can I say? A pretty face but no substance.Where was the terror? If she was not scared why should I be scared. Keep working on it Jennifer Lopez you almost had it. The girls in the tanks had better acting abilities.I can not blame it all on Jennifer Lopez it was the directors fault for not bringing it all together in a nice neat package. Also what was the deal with the framing of the screen with garbage ivy stuff that has nothing to due with what Jennifer's character nor Vincent's character would have been seeing. Thus proving that the director was trying to create some visual work of art.I gave it a 5 out of 10 for visuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had excellent special effects-they were unique yet realistic (mostly) and should definitely be in the running for the awards shows! If you liked pulp fiction or silence of the lambs you will love this movie, i however did not like either much and thought this one was entirely too gross for me. I could have thoroughly done without the ring hoists on his back and various other scary icky things. The hair people should definitely get high marks for this because Lopez's hair looked so fun and bouncy, although I don't know how she could stand it because I tried it today and it just got in my way (although if I were paid to be beautiful I suppose I could stand it) the butt/cleavage shots were a nice touch for the male population but could have saved those of us who don't care what Lopez looks like in her undies, a good 10 minutes of sitting in that movie. The plot was interesting and intriguing and the effects and styling were awesome but I did not like the grotesqueness of this movie or much else. It's definitely interesting but don't spend 7 bucks on this movie--don't even spend 5...if it's at the cheap movie place (under 3 bucks) Id definitely recommend it--otherwise just read about it and look at pictures and you'll get the good parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of style, NO SUBSTANCE!! Sandwich without the meat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very interested in seeing this film from the initial previews I saw on TV. They had such cool visual appeal, and looked truly cinematographicaly (that's a mouthful) brilliant. However, I was skeptical about seeing Lopez as an actress, and the other actors as far as I could see were nobodys. Yet I really REALLY wanted to see this film, and was finaly getting around to some reviews just recently now that the film had been out. The impression I got from the reviews was evenly split.. So what's the final word in a nutshell...Simply put as this.. "Lots of style, NO SUBSTANCE". This movie is nothing more than a typical televised cop TV show, with visual imagery that seems not to add to the story, but to cover up how ordinary and boring this film really is. Lopez CAN NOT ACT! I have read people saying that this film was truly terrifying and that D'Onofrino was the most amazing creppy serial killer on film. WHAT?? what friggin movie did these people see?? D'Onofrino is HARDLY EVEN IN THIS FILM!! and comparisons to Perkins Hanibal... you have to be kidding me. Instead D'Onofrino obsession doesn't even come out as twisted or frightning, it's just down right stupid and laughable.There is NO suspense, NO drama, NO thrilling-ness in this film. It isn't even scary! Yes director Tarsem's imagery is fantastic, but it does nothing for the story. You can have the greatest shots in a film and imagery, but a film needs to have A good story, and good actors too (which this film is SERIOUSLY lacking). Instead I just kept waiting for the dream sequences so I could only admire the artistic value of it as if I was viewing a painting or a performance piece. That sensations lasts for about 10 minutes.For someone who says that the only way you can enjoy this film is to enjoy the 'art' of cinema is a load of tripe. Good cinematic art ALONE does not make a good movie, 'The Reflecting Skin' PROVES it. Art in film needs to be coupled with good performances and dialogue, of which there are SEVERAL films that have done this well. The Cell will NEVER be in this category.These are typical cardboard characters also. The tortured killer, the determined cop, the sympathetic scientist... ya da ya da.. How could Roger Ebert, a guy whose reviews I find the most to my taste [and enjoyable to read], give this movie 4 stars out of 4?? Uggh... Then of course it has to follow that STUPID cliche of the cop having to go in and save her, even though he is of course not a doctor.. GROAN...At the end I was waiting for them to just friggin follow the stupid line, and then fall in love, (hey if you're going to play a cliche play all of it).. kiss at the end, but they don't, so what's the point. This movie is not worth seeing, or even renting. I'll put it to you this way. I know I have seen a good movie in a theatre when the ending credits come up and I don't want to get up and leave, like High Fidelity. I know I have seen a bad movie when I am constantly looking at my watch, and looking for the door 3 minutes before the credits hit the screen.Rating 3 out of 10</fullReview>

No surprise whatsoever in the story, everything that has to happen happens, in very slow time (boringly slow). On top of that, hardly any character development. The little there is is a collection of old cliches. What's the point of seeing such a movie? I see none...Interesting visual effects... but not more than a good video clip.

		<shortDescription>Good visuals, but that's about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cell is little more than a number of extended MTV music videos strung together with bits and pieces of a plot in between. As a matter of fact, I think some of them were directly from some music videos. Well some of the scenes are more out of a photography shoot and some are even quite stunning. But there is much more to a movie than visuals.The underlying idea is being able to enter people's minds to help them is stolen from Dreamscape. In Dreamscape it was to help with nightmares in The Cell it is to help bring someone out of a coma. They even stole the idea that it might be possible to die in a dream from psycho-somatic effects.The story is that the technology must be used to save a girl who has a very limited time to live. To do this there is a battle of wills and psyche between the sick monster guy and the trained psychologist. Sounds a lot like Silence of the Lambs. Although Silence of the Lambs was incredibly better thought out and executed.My advice is to take the eight dollars for the movie, buy some NyQuil, and rent Dreamscape and silence of the lambs. Drink the whole bottle of NyQuil watch the movies and some MTV (a couple of Marilyn Manson/Nine Inch Nails videos with a brief REM losing my religion interlude between them, then one of the super fluffy pastel videos with stuff floating around) and then wait for the crash as the NyQuil wears off. The cost is the same in both cases and if you choose the non-"The Cell" option you will get the added bonus of seeing at least one good movie. Oh and I am not alone. As I was leaving the theater I heard a number of grumbled comments including, "Now I have seen the worst movie of the summer, It was even worse than the Replacements".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie relies completely on the power of its images for its impact, neither the story nor the acting nor the dialogue are anything beyond the usual. (This is yet another movie about detectives trying to defeat a serial killer who tortures and dismembers women in completely disgusting ways - Think "Seven," "Kiss the Girls," etc.)But for me, the imagery was so grotesque and gruesome that I quickly ceased to be entertained and by the end of the film I was trying to get the knot in my stomach to relax. I didn't really need to see graphic disembowelments, people hanging from rings that pierced their skin, women's dead bodies as sexual objects, and on and on.Which is too bad, because some of the imagery was incredibly beautiful as well.Overall, I give this movie 3 stars because of its slaughterhouse approach to film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch this movie, are you impressed by the visuals or the story? Yes, we've seen it before, style or substance. Visual effects can cover up plot holes. The movie deals with odd situations in dreams, with loads of surreal images. Not one of those images had a purpose or any meaning. If this movie was written well, you would have to look deep into the scene, find symbolic meanings for the surreal images and then marvel at the visual effects. But no thought is needed for this trash fest, just sit back and watch a whole bunch of weird images that don't make any sense. If you want a good movie that deals with people entering dreams and has weirdness for a reason, watch "The City of Lost Children."</fullReview>

Vincent D'Onofrio's costumes were good but you saw them for small amounts of time, he was the only redeeming thing from this movie. At the end of the film when I was walking out a guy in the front row was sleeping...for the "visual masterpiece" it is that's pretty bad.

		<fullReview>Directed by a guy who's won awards for music videos, "The Cell" does for the big screen what music videos do for the little: Pushes the visuals to the extreme man! Hell, Jennifer Lopez, who stars as a child pyschologist, is even asked to carry the film's sane side and she's been in several wicked music videos. Nothing had prepared her for this though.And I'm not really talking so much about the darkness that comprises the entire been there, done that enter-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer plot. I'm talking about the world of acting where one may need to reach inside oneself and not worry so much about how they look when they give their performance.Since I did mention the dark as sin plot, I guess I should go ahead and admit to walking out of a scene where viewers get to participate in the violent fantasy visuals that comprise the reasoning behind why the pyscho killer is indeed a pyshco. What can I say? I can't stand to watch boys being so brutally harmed, be it real or fake. Others will object to the pyscho's sexual fixation on making his victims doll-like. It becomes obvious very quickly that the film doesn't know how to keep viewers thrilled, intrigued, and visually stimulated without disturbing a majority of moviegoers at the same time.While a movie can survive without being for everybody, it cannot survive if it has basic problems with it. Over characterization of the one person you can't stand to hear another thing about, selling out reality by having most of the movie occur in a place where anything goes because it's not real, the odd attempt to victimize the antagonist even to the point of romanticising him, and finally diluting the idea on who the real victim is. Is it the girl who's trapped in his torture device, I don't know anything about her. Is it Jennifer Lopez trapped inside the mad man's head, I don't know anything about her, really. Is it the cop? The co-workers?It's us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another below average thriller with scifi and bucketful of clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen some fragments of this movie before but now that i managed to almost watch it completely i have to admit that it's a huge mess of a movie. I can understand the surreal dream sequences but they just don't work very well in my opinion. The special effects look digital, bland and quite cheap to me and they'd have worked better with different kind of lighting. Pacing could have been slower to make the film more suspenseful.I found Lopez not to be the best choice to play the role of the main character. There is very little character development and most of the characters in this movie are left one dimensional. Even the bad guy didn't seem to have much depth in his character. He just is the enemy with a troubled childhood and that makes him evil. (Ah, really that's so original *sigh*.) I rarely like scifi elements in a movie and this time it's not an exception. I just hated the whole idea of having a device that has the ability to go into one's mind. If that's combined with a bucketful of clichés presented in this movie it makes a really bad mess with no sense of style.The movie takes itself too seriously and that's the major part of the problem. When a movie has most of its elements that are over the top not believable at all then why should it be so serious. It could just as well be a comedy after seeing the first scene with the bad guy and his victim. It just was so unbelievably over the top silly and disgusting that it can't be taken seriously. There never was an explanation for why he ever became so super evil, so it must have been his childhood.I'm a fan of bad movies but this time i had no idea what to think of this. I'm not very picky but this movie was just disappointing. I'm glad that i never paid anything to see it.In short this movie tries very hard to be artfully surreal but manages to be so over the top that it's very hard to to take it as a serious movie. There isn't much of plot twists in this movie, the bad guy is revealed too early on and the end resolution is fortunate for everyone.It's hard to recommend this movie to anyone so i can just assume that people who like scifi and bad taste might even like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarsem is a master of the visual craft. Film is a visual medium. So therefore, he is a talented director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***1/2 out of ****So many films promise the cinematic acid trip of a life-time; the seductive visual excitement that no other film can possibly present to you. Few follow up on their promises, but I have many times before enjoyed a good visual trip. But is it right to adore a film for its visual craft alone? Maybe. But when it has the kind of substance that only a select few will see, then there's much reason for one to like it. I am referring to a film such as "The Cell". This magnificent piece of cinematic eye-candy is some of the best I've seen in a while, and for quite some time this particular sense of whimsy remains consistent. This certainly helps the film a lot, since director Tarsem Singh, professionally known only by his first name, seems to have the born skill of artful filmmaking. You may not agree with me on my opinion, but I think "The Cell" is a mighty fine movie. It exists to thrill the audience with its visuals, and by all means it succeeds. I found myself captivated whenever Tarsem's unique and stunning visuals were on-screen, but a little bored when they weren't. This gives me a chance to say that while it's still wonderful and suitably grand on the visual scale, "The Cell" is not perfect. There were some points in the film's story where I felt more narrative detail was needed, and then, as I mentioned, there were times when the lack of amazing eye-candy really hurt the film's entertainment value. None the less, these are the kind of flaws I can easily forgive. I'm perhaps too forgiving of a film like this, but I'm not going to lie; I really enjoyed it. This is one of 2002's more unique films, if not one of its overall best. "The Cell" has none the less made me want to see more out of Tarsem, and it's also made me re-evaluate Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn as actors/actresses. Both have had their good days, and then their bad days, but this is one of those times where a director can master them to the best of their ability. This is a great film and Tarsem is a great director. It's not a movie that will appeal to just anyone, but then again what are visually trippy, wholesomely satisfactory cinematic films for? This is what I believe to be the work of a man who has alas been misunderstood by many. If you can look past some of the obvious plot flaws, then you'll most likely enjoy the "trip" while it lasts. It's not a film for everyone; some think of it as pretentious, overly-ambitious, and even boring. I think it's a pretty darn good film. And if it means anything, I suppose that counts for something. Whether it appeals to you or not, I say see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is it a visual treat, the plot is definitely thought-provoking. The serial killer is a young man, but it's actually his dad who has taken possession of his body and is doing the killing. When J Lo enters the boy's mind, she sees his memories of how his evil dad abused him as a child. Finally, the only way she can save him (as a soul) is to take him into her own mind and let the body with the father's persona die. It had a profound effect on me, to the extent that I believe it is possible, if one wants it to be so. This is one for my all time favourite movies list, along with Max Headroom, Without a Clue, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Lorna Doone (TV 1990), Robin Hood (TV 1991), Edward Scissorhands, They Might be Giants, The Thomas Crown Affair (Steve McQueen's) and Dr Terror's House of Horrors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I probably would have enjoyed this if I'd seen it in a damp cellar with a bunch of guys in overcoats. But I saw CELL at a Sunday matinée in Canoga Park, or some other garden of urban blight, in a theater full of little children - I mean ten year old children, five year old children, whole families of children, at least fifty altogether. In some cases the parents were in attendance. I knew that I was in the presence of a universal sin, a thing that should not be. To my shame I did not chase everyone out and set fire to the building.The design elements are spectacularly rendered. Its scenes of sexual violence and perversion are among the most effectively pornographic in the whole torture genre, far beyond the abilities of a James Wan or, pardon the expression, a Marcus Nispel. But maybe because it is better made, and more generally appealing, this film is even more of an abomination upon the earth.Movies like this and SE7EN, by their successful blend of style and puerility, allow SAW and the snuff remakes of good movies by Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper to ride the coattails of respectability right into the multiplex. The development strikes me as not a particularly good one. Watch this alone, and masturbate to it in the dark if you must satisfy your lust for human suffering. But don't spread your disease to the mall, where children indulge in the time-honored pastime of sneaking into the rated R stuff. Let them transgress enough to see some sex, but not the pornography of wounds.I am not for censorship. I am for responsibility. Make this movie, show this movie, but show it to adults. We used to give an X to adult movies, and this must be at least as bad for a kid as CLOCKWORK ORANGE or MIDNIGHT COWBOY. The science of early trauma on personality development is irrefutable. If you sell a product this dangerous, and you're not sure whether the distributor's behaving ethically, go find out or reap the consequences: a generation who sees sadism and entertainment as synonymous concepts.So much for morality. Beyond the pale of good and evil, this movie simply sucks whenever it goes outside somebody's head. The story choices are hackneyed, the characters as familiar as dirty socks, the pace breathlessly leaden. The director and writer have conspired to create the least interesting world outside the gimmick, spent all their positive energies fulfilling the gimmick, and made a bad gimmicky movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death by schizophrenia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To bring the mind of a serial killer, in that instance an extreme case of schizophrenia, to the front of the screen or the investigation to be able to save the last kidnapped victim planned to die by some mechanism that will drown her eventually, that's the ambition of the film. But does it make a real thriller? They use a technique that will eventually exist for the large public in the near future. The mind of a doctor or qualified medical personnel gets into the mind of the patient, in this case a criminal, in order to communicate with him and get the information the police needs to get on the track. Risky because with such schizophrenic people, there is only one world and it is theirs. You cannot enter their world without being an intruder and at once they react in making you captive, and you may eventually get catatonic with the patient's mind taking over your own mind. At first by making you their prisoner and later, with a reversal, which is for the medical personnel to let the patient's mind get into his or her mind, eventually to become the tool to satisfy the patient's deepest desire which is to dissolve in the outside world they cannot reach at all, except through your mind and then you are making them die virtually but it can mean real death since the mind controls all mechanisms of the body. It may also for a patient who is not totally enslaved by his death instinct mean a liberation, the desire being to be loved, to love, to be acknowledged. In our case here the attempt enables the medical personnel to satisfy the criminal's self-death instinct, and at the same time to enable the profiler to get into the criminal's mind and see the detail that will make it possible to trace the equipment and then the location of this equipment used to imprison, drown and eventually turn into a sex object the girl who is in the cage. The main interest is the visual exploration of this mental world in which this serial killer is living. The film insists on the triggering of this schizophrenia by traumas coming from his infancy, and particularly his father who, it is shown, brutalized him when a child, but also submitted him to a baptism by total immersion that will give him the model for his crimes as well as the model for his mental death. It is also implied that sexuality was associated to this brutalizing, hence molesting. Yet the question is asked and two points of view are expressed, one considering there is no escape and another considering that one can always manage to escape. This approach is doubled with the question whether it is genetic or accidental. Difficult to say but the film seems to satisfy itself with the idea it is a deep trauma, a deep trouble and that it is so deep that there is only one mental exit and it is mental death, in other words mental suicide. Do we have the right, as the medical personnel does, to help him get mentally killed, in other words to get there and kill him in his own mind? Ethically I doubt it but criminally there is no proof of any violence because it is all mental, virtual. And yet? And what can be the consequences on the medical personnel in time if that person takes pleasure in and becomes enslaved to this power over the minds of other people, to the point of killing them, morbidly satisfying their desire or turning themselves into doctor, police, judge, jury and executioner? No one has that right.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of J-lo's best performances in a film to date. She stars here as a psychologist who agrees to undergo hypnosis in order to enter the mind of a serial killer who murders women for thrills. The FBI believes this is their last resort as every last attempt to catch the sicko has only led to more victims being kidnapped and more bodies turning up. Vince Vaughn plays an FBI agent hot on the sicko's trail. The best part of the film are the visually stunning images that you see once Jennifer Lopez's character enters the mind of the killer. The plot begins to unravel as she proceeds from one corner of his mind to another, revealing his past, childhood and other darks secrets until she finally comes face to face with the monster within.</fullReview>

Well, first and foremost I will take this opportunity to slate Jenifer Lopez. Maybe I have just seen the wrong J-LO films, maybe I should watch Maid in Manhatten or Giggli..... I THINK NOT! Why on Earth is someone who is famous for being a b*tch and having a nice bum acting in films? This is the first film I have seen her in since Annaconda, both times she has shown her capacity for acting to be about as convincing as a porn star at acting. Other than the ridiculous performance put forward by this stale wench the film had good bits but it should have been much darker than it was. Going through a serial killers mind shouldn't be like walking through an art gallery with pictures of bats, it should be a warped and disturbing place, it just wasn't chaotic enough. ---------------------- Ben Affleck: "J-Lo you are crap in bed and you can't act"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I say that I only watched this one as I had recently read on CNN.com that Jennifer Lopez is the most desired woman in the world. Poor thing! It is the price you have to pay for being famous as a result of being hoisted around by the Hollywood Crane Operating Network.The outcome is a film which is not even a parody of science-fiction films, but a rather fanciful foray into fantasies which elude any logical consequences of even the most overblown febrile minds. Out-dated supposed special-effects are splashed about the film rather like a bad cook would throw in any kind of ingredients in a cake without much idea of what the resulting mess is going to be like: indigestible is the usual outcome, and in this respect the film scores.Whether it is worth fantasizing over Ms. Lopez, who looks nice on one of my screensavers, I leave it to you; but it occurs to me that there are ordinary young ladies walking down my street every day who seem to me far more desiresome and might well be called López, too. Such are the benefits of living in sunny Spain.Inasmuch as this film is rather mindless twaddle and that Ms. Lopez is far from being any kind of serious candidate for actress - as is frequent among other members of the top-model beautiful people squad jetting around all over the place, you would well spend your time twiddling with buttons on your remote control and follow the excitement of a goalless draw on another channel; the "injured" player is a far better actor and/or stunt-man, and there aren't any horrendous special-effects to mess up the real effects.</fullReview>

I don't know what Hollywood wants, graphic scenes of bizarre dismemberment, inept police, psychosis on demand or some combo of all three. I've seen this plot now with different scenery at least ten times. In this one they turn it into an extended avant-garde music video without the music. The actors, (with the exception of Jennifer Lopez, she isn't an actress), try their best as they most often do. It might be time somebody asks the suits in Hollywood to get mental checkups. This same movie, although alot shorter and more concise with different actors but with similar plots has been on The Outer Limits in about four different incarnations, all preceding this movie.

		<shortDescription>A tentative, but welcome, new direction for mainstream cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can say what you like, but it's a rare Hollywood movie that leaves you baffled at its content, rather than the fact that it ever got made. I think there should be MORE pretentiousness in the movies, not less; the future of CGI lies surely not in trying to 'realistically' recreate lost civilisations, or in mimicking monumental natural disasters, where you can quite clearly and bathetically see the joins, than in magicking up strange worlds of pure artifice, like 'Mission Impossible 2' and this. Any film would find it hard to beat that opening - Jennifer Lopez, resplendent in a feathery white, regal gown, astride an ebony black horse riding across the desert, huge, gleaming, yet miraculously tidy sandscapes, a tiny, beautifully white dot climbing these ephemeral mountains. It's like a magnificent parody of a Depeche Mode video, in colour. I could watch hours of this - doesn't everyone want to see their dreams filled with a huge budget and otherworldly colour? Then the problems start. The dream figures talk, the frayed box of Freudian tricks is opened, narrative, interpretation, explanation, purpose, all the things dreams expel, force their way in, like a clumping great boot stomping on a bubble. This is why subsequent 'dreams' or entering into others' unconscious, feel like a bit of a cheat - we are always aware of their narrative significance, or their status as character shorthand - when one terrible crisis is reduced to childhood abuse, I groaned. And the 'real world' of the detective wins. These two worlds, that of the detective, and that of the dream adventurer/'psychologist' are gendered in a hackneyed way - the male detective active in solving the crime, can invade the passive world of the female, where she is active only in her mind, but not the other way round. And just when you're enjoying the exquisite dream worlds, you are thuddingly reminded of the plot - those worlds are so compelling that I don't think anyone would have noticed if we got lost there - when the 'real' and 'dream' worlds got confused for a brief moment, I though the narrative was going to excitingly collapse into real ambiguity, but have no fear. Because in outline the whole thing is quite traditional, maverick cop, psychological crime story etc. You hope, like 'Vertigo' or 'Memento', that Novak (see!) will get sucked into a demented mental labyrinth, but he recovers his psychological gung-ho with unconvincing ease.Never mind. The encouraging thing is that films like this are being made and making money. The dreams themselves are full of wonderful visual registers, my favourite being the echoes of Joseph Cornell, the Marquis de Sade and Bollywood. The emphasis on sexual traumas is predictable but refreshingly direct. Some day we will be able to ditch stories and wallow in this expensive fusion of desire, colour, set-design, beautiful stars as an abstract whole that doesn't need explaining. Until then, enjoy.</fullReview>

By the way, the visual effects were not that impressive. I've seen more disturbing visuals in music videos than in this movie. In fact, now that I think about it the whole movie looked more like a music video than the disturbing thriller it was supposed to be.

		<fullReview>...of unbelievably disappointing movies. I can't believe I shelled out 7 bucks to watch this bilge. I was excited at first, thinking that it would be a souped-up "Silence of the Lambs" (which was great), and then I became even more anxious when I saw that Roger Ebert gave it one of his trademark "Thumbs Up!" and 4 stars to boot, so I thought it was safe to say that it has enough original content to possibly compete with "Silence of the Lambs." However, when I finally sat down in the theater and began to watch it, I was greatly disappointed with what I viewed. Not only was "The Cell" a horribly done recycled plot...no, scratch that...it was like an aluminum can that someone crushed, spit on, thrown to the side of the road, and was then recycled by a good Samaritan attempting to clean up the streets. Anyway, what I saw was a movie that was too intent on showing us disturbing images and vast environments done completely in CGI...true, some of these images were beautiful, I'll give it that, but, for example, the desert scene at the start pales in comparison to, say, Lawrence of Arabia, which, by the way did not need "magical" computer graphics to display stunning visual effects.Not only was Tarsem too intent on "wowing" us with fuzzy, dated visuals, he seemed to think that these would replace a solid plot. I don't think so...in Stargher's subconscious, for instance, there were great scenes of strange and interesting things, but there was no in depth look at his mind. Even "Being John Malkovich" achieved at least some insightful looks at how the subconscious could be made up. But, Tarsem again felt that visual effects would be a suitable substitute. Also, the plot was very jumpy and shaky that I didn't know how some of the things happened. I mean, half of the "problems" in the movie solved in about the time it takes me to yawn from boredom, and some of them are remedied from out of the blue.So, in conclusion, I must say that this movie was a big disappointment, but I'll admit that some of the scenes were impressive, and D'Nofrio's performance was excellent, but one actor and cool-looking special effects are not enough to make a good movie (look at "Hollow Plot"--er, uh, "Hollow Man"). Next time, try to keep some semblance of a plot for us, Tarsem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>underwhelming in every possible way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene in The Cell, very early on, in which Jennifer Lopez is smoking a joint. It only happens once, isn't mentioned again, and isn't relevant to the plot in any way. It's as if director Tarsem Singh thought he could up Lopez's appeal to that valuable younger demographic if only he threw in some weed...along with a shot of Lopez's butt. I'm part of that demographic, by the way, and I'm not at all impressed by this film.Now, let me be clear. The issue here is not that I have any particular problem with drug use in movies. I just think the scene sums up the entire film in general. Got a thin, generic plot? Throw in some marijuana and semi-nudity; the kids will love you for it. What, the characters don't have anything interesting to say? Better fill your movie with repetitive special effects instead. Huh, no suspense in your suspense thriller? Put some violence on the screen; they won't know the difference.Really, at some point, The Cell represents just about everything that's wrong with the Hollywood machine. It has but three character focuses, yet all of them are about as generic as possible. Lopez is a sexy but capable and good-hearted social worker, Vaughn is a by-the-numbers FBI guy, and D'Onofrio is a completely typical serial killer. Not one of them much grows during the film. Not one of them is interesting.And this is also one of those films that asks the viewer to accept every possible coincidence. D'Onofrio has an ultra rare mental disease, an ultra rare dog, and an ultra rare killing machine. I just find that to be a few too many "1 in a million" types of occurrences. And don't expect impressive visuals to bear the burden, either. Granted, what effects the film has are good. But, after the first forty-five minutes or so, Sighn begins to repeat the same stock images over and over again. There's enough eye candy to fill a decent trailer but nothing more.And, perhaps the worst part about it all is that The Cell is just watchable enough that Hollywood will continue to churn out more movies with the same flaws. As much as I hated it, I have to admit I wasn't bored during it. But I do regret paying $6.75 to see it. Wait for video if you still have to see it. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Puke.That's how I felt after watching this trash. I spent 1/4 of the time counting how many people walked out of the theater, and believe me, quite a few did! However I stayed, just so I could endure the (predictable) ending, and of course, write my review!Story revolves around Ms Lopez being able to enter the subconscious memory of comatose patients via a fancy futuristic mind-gizmo. A serial killer has a 'viral schizophrenic' attack (whatever that means!!) and ends up in a coma. It's up to her to get into his mind and find the whereabouts of his last victim before she dies.WARNING! SPOILER ALERT! There are disturbing sexual images, horrific scenes of death, and a gruesome torture scene that's sure to make you hurl into your popcorn. I felt like I was watching a 2 hour long Marilyn Manson MTV video. Most of the flick was depressing and ugly. Anything beautiful is violently mutilated. We see a horse being sliced into sections, and each section is anatomically presented, still beating and alive. (So that's what goes on in a serial killer's mind!)Ms Lopez is shown as a sort of patron saint, her mind-world is pure and angelic. I had a hard time accepting this one. Suspension of disbelief is required here! And what was up with her husky, barely audible whisper? She also can't act! There are many comments saying how beautiful this flick is. There is nothing beautiful about this flick, period. What it does is bring out the lowest common denominator in the human psyche. This junk will definitely appeal to those who have sick fantasies about corpses.CONCLUSION? If you want to watch a really scary, gruesome visual movie, watch Se7en instead. Ms Lopez - stick to singing Pop!</fullReview>

Psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) uses an experimental technique to enter the murderer's mind to see if she can learn her location.All of which is a thinly disguised opportunity for scenes, endless and offensive, of young women being murdered and tortured, of gruesome mutilations and so on. The purpose, I assume, is to illustrate how sick this guy is. Well, I think the sick people here are the director and screenwriters.The censor's certificate says that this movie "contains violence, sexual themes and content that may offend."I was offended.

Now that I've watched the DVD at a friend's place, I can only say that my original instincts were on target.The movie did nothing for me as entertainment; it was unpleasant throughout, slow-moving and dull, and the decent actors just were not sufficiently interesting or attractive to make it worth watching.The "Daliesque" surrealism was not very clever at all, and only two or three scenes struck me as visually interesting; the one where the black dog shakes its head in slow-motion, and the one with the three women sitting in the same position (when Peter first woke up inside the killer's mind).To me, this was in almost every way a forgettable movie.

		<fullReview>Tarsem Singh's "The Fall" is one of my favorite films. It's touching and funny and, while the imagery is the meat of the film, there is a strong storyline and characters that engage and create sympathy in the viewer. I am glad I saw it before I viewed "The Cell". Otherwise I would never have gone. I would have read that Singh was involved and said, "isn't that they guy who did The Cell? No f'n way." This film is such a vapid mess of style sans substance, flat characters, insipid dialog, exposition ad nauseam and predictable hackneyed plot points, that any allure the imagery might have provided was lost in the mire. I started fast forwarding about 40 minutes in, and I am surprised that I made it that far. Sure enough, I found that you can skip 90% of the dialog and still follow the story. This was mostly digital masturbation. Had I not seen The Fall I would have suggested that Singh go back to music videos and stay there. But having seen it, I know he can do good films. This just isn't one of them. This is CSI for Adult Swim. You might enjoy it if you're stoned enough... but leave the sound off! Not even 'shrooms could save that dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking *more* in style than substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have absolutely no problem with a movie that puts style above substance, but rather than filled with style, I thought the Cell was completely lacking in style. In fact, I thought the movie had more substance than style.In fact, I think Tarsem's biggest flaw is a lack of style. I don't like Tim Burton's style personally, for example, very much either, but Burton is at least very developed stylistically. There's no mistaking a Tim Burton movie: the man has a very unique vision he applies to every one of his films. I don't think Tarsem has that going for him yet, but he's still very early in his career. I also think Tarsem fails to consider the movie as a true, organic whole. He's obviously very visually oriented, but there needs to be more than just visuals even to make the visuals really stand out.I felt there was a very different aesthetic and sense of consistency between, say, the Closer music video and the Cell, though they are often compared. Sure they share similar-looking images at times, but I don't feel there was a very consistent design language that echoed throughout the Cell to really tie the scenes together, and, in terms of atmosphere and accompanying music, I definitely think it's a different aesthetic all together.With a movie like this, I count on the soundtrack equally as much as the visuals to pull the whole thing together, and I felt the Cell was especially lacking in that area. And, before anyone says anything, I can definitely respect all sorts of soundtracks. What I'm looking for is consistency of design - even if I absolutely hate a movie's soundtracks, it's generally easy to tell whether that soundtrack was properly conceived and designed around the visual presentation. Like I said, I don't like Tim Burton's movies for example, but you can tell he has a very pre-conceived notion of the entire thing from costumes to sets to the music. For Tarsem, I believe that he just mixed and matched a bunch of elements which don't go together very well without really considering how they tie together to create a whole.The best thing the movie had going visually was Eiko Ishioka's costume designs, and it's obvious that her designs created Tarsem's favorite images of the movie for which he wisely brought her back in the Fall, but it became too apparent that Tarsem was simply reviving the design style Ishioka had already applied to Bram Stoker's Dracula rather than seeking something unique for the movie (which she could have definitely pulled off), and, unlike Dracula which had that level of consistency tying all the stylistic elements of the movie together (though that movie also not something I particularly cared for, but could respect stylistically), this movie seemed like a jumble of inconsistent, mismatching styles both visually and auditory (I really do think that Tarsem just mixed and match a bunch of conflicting styles without considering how to tie them together).Then again, one could argue that the movie should be that way, as it's supposed to represent someone's stream of consciousness which may not necessarily have anything to tie one thought to the next (especially in the case of a psychotic killer).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it was weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the type of movie that strikes me as being not very good but because of it's bizarre visuals will get some high praise from people on IMDb. Really there isn't much of a story here. The FBI is looking for a missing woman who was kidnapped by a deranged killer but is forced to "go inside the killer's head" and find out her whereabouts. Once inside his head Lopez basically wanders around the weird visual landscape and asks the various versions of the Killer where the girl is. She finds out that the serial killer was abused as a child (surprise!) and eventually, with the help of Vince Vaughn discovers the location of the girl. There really isn't much dialogue of note here, and the writing plays a back seat to the sets and costumes. In an illogical move Lopez invites the killer into her mind so she can help the "boy" trapped inside. It seems rather unnecessary as 1)nothing is real inside that world as they state several times 2)why not just put the man to death on the outside and cease all his brain activity? after all it would be a lot easier since he is stuck in a coma. 3)who cares?I didn't really give a rip about any of the characters as they are merely set pieces in this bizarre fantasy. Some people have touted how disturbing some of the images are here, and I guess from a technical perspective it is well done, but really if you find enjoyment in disturbing images then what does that say about yourself? It's not like there is any real insight given about serial killers here by going into his mind. We learn that his father is in a major way to blame for his actions, but guess what, hundreds of studies have already shown that parental abuse can lead to criminal behavior.In the end I wasn't very entertained with this movie, I didn't think there was much story and none of the characters were particularly interesting as they really were just 2d images in the background. The look of the film was intriguing to me at first, but after awhile it started to wear thin on me as it was all style and little substance. I think this movie would have worked better as a short film and could have done away with the entire kidnapped girl aspect of the movie. If you find disturbing entertaining then by all means rent this movie, but if are looking for something more then surrealist paintings brought to life then look elsewhere.Zoopansick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, boring wannabe thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SMALL SPOILER First I wanna say that I bought the DVD of The Cell and watched the movie like three times, so I know what I am talking about. I bought the DVD about a year ago after I heard so many people saying that the movie was simply great. Boy were they wrong. Sure, the move is visually perfect and J-Lo is a good actress but that's not enough to make The cell a good movie. First of all, the story is as boring as predictable and even sometimes really stupid (J-Lo as Xena look alike at the end). Second, the movie is just plain boring. Though it tries to create tension it never succeeds. The whole "can you die in the killer's mind" s**t and the woman that is trapped in the cell is just not enough to create tension, because most people already know how it is going to end (all the good guys live, the bad guy dies). Yakk, what a piece of crap! So why did I watch the movie three times then, you're asking? Honestly, I've been hoping that there was something brillant in the plot that I missed the first time watching (but there wasn't). * out of ***** (for the visuals)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many comment on the gore. Well, as an Argento fan, there is nothing really "gory" here.This movie has some great visuals and a pretty bad plot. The problem with this is, the visuals, whil impressive at times, don't actually seem to mean very much. What's the point of a guy with scales on his head? What's the point of a guy with a huge curtain hooked onto his back? What does it mean?In the extras the designers are falling over themselves to tell us how great they are. As I said, the visuals are great, but they're just meaningless pictures with no substance. Hence, the film scores low. There is no real acting by Lopez.Funny, at times I found the visuals won me over, but like chinese food, once it's over you just want something with substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people have seen "The Cell" as one of the most bizarre and freaky movies ever made. Maybe I'm in a minority but all it was to me was a generic horror movie with wild visuals. Several things stood out as either not making sense or contrived for the plot. Jennifer Lopez (Or is it J. Lo now?) is hot, trendy, and hip. But she ain't no psychologist or scientist. And why is it in these movies the bad guy is some seriously disturbed loner who works a menial job, yet somehow can afford the time and money to build elaborate traps and torture devices? It just never seems to happen the bad guy needs to go to work or buy groceries, or whatever.The dream scenes are exotic and fortunately *don't* have the MTV inspired quick cuts and flashiness that passes for storytelling today. A few of the sequences do have the transcendence of a real dream, but the effect quickly passes for standard horror gore and conflict. One thing that did kept creeping in the back of my mind, however, is that Stanley Kubrick could have done wonders with a story like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Cell" was a complete waste of money and time. This was about the opinion of anyone in our group when we came out of the theater.Personally, I think that this movie falls in the same category as "The Matrix" (which I liked): Great visuals, but no sensible plot to speak of. However, other movies in this group don't usually pretend to have a deep-going story. "The Cell" did, and that made it really painful to watch.Please forget all the crap you've heard about "diving into the soul of a serial killer": This movie was about as profound as an episode of "Beverly Hills 90210", in spite of all the suggestive imagery.Music video director Singh has not (yet?) learned one of the fundamental rules of film-making: That the pictures should tell a story, not the story tell some pictures.Summary: Unless you're one of the folks who'll like to drool over Jennifer Lopez' bare thighs, you should consider spending your money on something worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hollywood Inconscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At many moments we are tempted to say that Hollywood truly has no inconscience. Or, to say the least, its inconscience is a real sad, flat place. You were warned, a big budget movie (with miss Lopez, no less), that will portray the exciting and complex world of the inconscience. How interesting can it possibly be? Not at all, really. Don't expect anything like the restaurant scene in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH. THE CELL suffers from a crying lack of imagination. We are confronted with different sceneries from three different inconsciences: the comatose child, the murderer, and Lopez. All three worlds compete for the title of most pathetic reconstitution of the human mind. There is not a single moment of geniune creativity. The whole thing is a series of bad cliches (the desert, the sea, the healing water...) with no connection whatsoever. The people behind this movie intented the end result to be some kind of a post modernist surrealisitc cinematic Dali painting. What they succeed in doing is a badly directed Marelyn Manson Video Clip. It is clear that the director comes from the video clip world. If we were not to blame him for the shallowness of the work (it's not that important, the objective is to have a good time), we can't forgive him for his irritating camera work. The use of visual effects, the cutting, the jumping around damage the nerves after about 15 minutes. Use of slow motion even becomes laughable at times. But we can't blame anybody really. This is a hollywood flick made to cash in money. But the problem is that it dosen't work at this level. Mass entertainment requires some talent, you know. And the director, the script writer and the whole crew don't show us any. And don't expect Jennifer Lopez to save the show. She is not going to become a good actress all of a sudden.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge, beautiful nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with criticising this film is: You are not allowed to say it's a failure because Tarsem Singh doesn't seem to have tried anything. He mentioned several times in interviews, how ridiculous he finds the story and how stupid the screenplay is. For him, only pictures are important. And from this point of view, you must agree with him and admit, that the director achieved what he wanted: a huge storm of pictures. The story is extremely unimportant.If the virtual sequences were left out, this movie would run 30 minutes and it would be a bad copy of ?The Silence of the Lambs`. The virtual sequences are beautiful but they are full of pictures and ?symbols` that mean nothing. The problem with this thriller is that nothing is real and that's why I wasn't scared at all. This also makes it the ideal movie for Jennifer Lopez: Her unconvincing acting doesn't matter because everything around her is even less real than her character.I hope, there won't be other films like this in future. We have enough musical videoclips and they are not too short, no, they shouldn't be longer. It's not necessary to stretch them and transfer them onto the screen. There is so much tasteless nonsense inside this movie! In the end when everything is over, Katherine asks Peter how he copes with the experiences and he answers something like: ?I just don't remember everything about it.` ?Me too`, I agreed.</fullReview>

After working for a while on the mind of a child she is trying to bring back from a coma, she is asked by the FBI to probe the mind of a psychopath who has been knocked unconscious in order to find the woman he has captured.

		<shortDescription>The Cell is BAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason that I have generally disagreed with the moralist Hollywood-grudging Liebermans in D.C. is that violence, sex, and language (the three things the MPAA hate most) are not immoral unto themselves. Violence can be presented in either a moral context or an immoral context. Context is the key word in that sentence. Many films that have been accused of promoting violence have actually been against the thing they were charged of. Such films in the last several years have included `Natural Born Killers' and `Fight Club'-both films that were accused of immorally glamorizing gratuitous violence and both films that had intellectually redeeming contexts. `Natural Born Killers' was ironically about how the media sells violence on the news to Americans and `Fight Club' was a complex story about a generation of disillusioned men who are fed up with America's consumerist culture and turn to fighting as a method of anarchic catharsis. Thus, a film can justify the things that are typically deemed inappropriate with a compelling story or an interesting statement. `The Cell' had neither. But you can be sure of what it did have: a father abusing his son with a hot iron, a man's stomach torn open and his intestines gradually rolled out on a skew, numerous women being drowned, a sword being drawn into a man's chest and twisted around.all as if pain was nonexistent in this world. Perhaps the absence of pain is explicable considering most of the film takes place, in fact not in our world, but in the subconscious minds of the characters. The scenes that do take place in the subconscious mind, just in case some young film-lovers thought they'd seen something new, take from Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali and bring surrealism into the mainstream digital reality of the 21st century, creating a video-game version of `Un Chien Andalou' from 1922. The scenes are beautiful to watch although I am not sure how much credit I can give to the cinematographer being that the mis-en-scene was not there when he shot it. Rather, the contents of the shots were added in as visual effects in post-production. Though the surreal visuals are indeed eye-candy, they are not enough to support the rest of the film. It seems almost as though director Tarsem Singh had had really wild dreams one night, expressed them to a powerful man with powerful equipment, and effortlessly came up with a story to tie his vision together. Although the surrealist sequences may stand out on their own as superior pieces of visual filmmaking, it is supposed to be an entire movie. The plot, about a psychotherapist (Jennifer Lopez) who enters the mind of a schizophrenic serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) in order to uncover the whereabouts of his latest victim before she is drowned, is merely an amalgamation of other successful films in the thriller-horror genre-`Silence of the Lambs,' `The Sixth Sense,' `Event Horizon,' etc.. It also takes the flashy slow-mo action style of `The Matrix,' which has been used in almost every action/thriller to be released since. Along with an unoriginal plotline are b-rate performances from Lopez, D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. One reason why `The Silence of the Lambs' was so extraordinary was the complexity of the two main characters and the humanizing performances by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. As opposed to Hopkins' chilling representation of a villain with subtle humanity, D'Onofrio barely utters a word, relying on demonic screeching and a gruesome Marilyn Manson-esque appearance to portray the villain. If there is a lack of interesting material on the surface of `The Cell,' there is a famine below the surface. With the potentially philosophic concept of entering the mind of killer, you would have thought they could've done something interesting, or at least made an attempt. Instead, while the eye of the viewer is being hypnotized by the abilities of modern technology (we can give credit to machinery, not the director), the mind of the viewer is left with nothing but a new understanding for certain politicians' needs to censor Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's a riddle for you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Q: What do you get when you give a pretentious music video director a multi-million dollar budget and let him masturbate for 2 hours?A: "The Cell".All the talk is about the visions inside the serial killer's head, but we get the visions in the director's head instead -- laborious art pieces and nonsequitors that are tedious instead of meaningful, script be damned. This guy has obviously seen "2001" and "Coma" too many times. Not that the script is anything special -- it's right off the serial-killer-movie assembly line. The only thing more disheartening than the movie was the previews for all the OTHER serial killer movies we will have to endure this year. "Se7en" is the only worthy entry in this genre, taking a formula plot and turning it into an indictment of American life. Any nice moments in "The Cell" are wasted, as the movie is only interested in itself. The proof is in the scenes which are NOT in the fantasy world -- they are shot as dry and boring as possible. You can sense the director's impatience during these scenes, anxious to get back into the fantasy world so he can show off his stuff.Word of mouth should give "The Cell" an early death in theatres, which is what it deserves. Even a shot or two of The Posterior cannot redeem a sad exercise in directoral masturbation. Save your money -- and that goes for any Hollywood exec wanting to hire the director, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Cell" is pretty much the apex of pretentious window-dressing of a C-grade story. Yet again, we get to see beautiful young women (blonde, even--I guess plus-sized, ethnic and older women don't rate with serial killers) stalked, abducted, tortured at length and finally making a gorgeous nude corpse. Of course, this is a SERIOUS treatment--we know cuz there's all this high-flown "psychological" mumbo-jumbo "explaining" the villain's twisted mind (surprise: he was an abused child). Jennifer Lopez plays some sort of scientist-telepath drafted to mind-meld with the captured, catatonic killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) so the latest victim can be rescued in the nick. This leads to the film's real raison d'etre--silly, wildly overdesigned "surreal" scenes inside the killer's brain. His white-trash childhood must have involved lots of between-beatings trips to museums, since these visions raid the annals of Western secular, Eastern religious, and sci-fi fantasy graphic arts with shameless and completely senseless regularity. Just what does all this fancy digitalized exotica have to do with his abnormal desires? Uh...well, they sure look pretty."The Cell" makes "Altered States" look like an advanced course in Jungian theory. The admittedly often-stunning dream visuals are annoying because their pretentiousness outstrips any actual content--for all its (huge case of) self-seriousness, the movie is just a sleazy exploitation flick art-directed to the nines. The combination between upscale affectation and lowbrow script makes it all seem the more fraudulent and offensive. Plus, it's dull and suspenseless; there's a vague unpleasantness here that could pass for atmosphere, but music video/TV commercial director Tarsen doesn't really have any feel for pace or building tension.If you're eager to see Jennifer Lopez looking swell (though suspiciously Madonna-in-various-videos-like) in fantasy fetishwear, here's your chance. But looking at production stills would probably be more satisfying than wading through this mess. Nobody gets to give a real performance; the characters exist as little more than live-models for Tarsen's peurile fantasias. "The Cell" is like a coffee-table book of high-concept fashion layouts after Dali, as cut-and-pasted by a fan of autopsy photos. Yeech.</fullReview>

I would rate it as high as Silence of the Lambs and even though it bears a similar premise it adds sci-fi and visual imagery to heighten the effect.

		<fullReview>This film made us sick and disgusted. The acting was lame (my apologies to James Gammon, an actor I admire, who got stuck in this crappy flick, fortunately only for a couple of minutes). This is one of those movies that will probably make lots of money playing to the stupidity of ignorant people, mainly male, who get off on seeing women tortured. It's just the sort of thing to set off the lowliest sort of scum in our society. This is the wrong way to make money. Certainly the special effects people should be given credit for doing their job well, but that they accepted such a job demonstrates a lack of character and integrity. The whole point of this movie was to thrill people who enjoy being grossed out, but it wasn't just a gross-out, it went too far into titillating the worst human senses. There was hardly any plot. There was almost no character development. There was nothing but visual effect. I might consider the dreamlike sequences well done if it were not for lack of control demonstrated by those in charge of creating them. It is much more challenging to present horror by affecting the audience's imagination, and these special effects people weren't up to the challenge, so they took the easy way out and simply splashed the plastic gore and human degradation all over the screen. The movie seemed to be providing an instruction manual to sociopaths on fun ways to torture and murder.</fullReview>

While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out. The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things... one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl, I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really didn't care what happened to her. While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way, they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) Finally, does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen better film on teeth...another assimilation of various pop movie culture poopie. boo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fantastical visuals of this film go unaccompanied by any sort of plot or story. Well that is somehwat of a lie. There is a story, but it is inexplicably horrible. "Hrmm" says the director "The Matrix was a popular film, and so was the Sixth Sense, I think I will make a stupid spin off film that makes money simply because most movie-goers are stupider than the actual film and won't notice."Well I noticed. I just tend to get somewhat bitter when people ruin things that I love. Jeez-um-crow The Cell was a disappointment. Even the visuals which are honesty the only thing going for this film, grow boring and generic. Perhaps if this was made by someone who wanted to actually make something that evokes thought from it's viewers it could have been alright. There are a few interesting ideas, which I only credit to the writer. If you ever catch yourself renting this film put it back on the shelf and rent the Sixth Sense or the Matrix or even Seven and you will be a lot happier. Oh yeah, the acting is horrible as well, which I only again credit to the director, the dialogue was unbelievably unbelievable...bad bad bad bad bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThis is the type of movie which you're probably going to want to see more to see how nasty and gruesome it can be,rather than for a genuine interest in the movie.But,unfortunately in this case,it's going to leave you feeling rather wasted that you did.I can admire a film when it's going to be scary or thrilling,but when the results are mostly just disturbingly nasty and twisted as is the case with The Cell,it's really just a case of not giving into temptation.Vince Vaughn and the lovely Jennifer Lopez invest quite well into their roles,but the story is actually pretty pointless,and just seems to show hollywood scraping at the bottom of the barrel in a desperate,last ditch attempt to get a new and interesting storyline (in this case,enter the mind of a serial killer,via the use of modern technological equiptment).I'd like to say that this is once again a case of the older films will always be better,as the film is rather unselfconsciously similar to The Silence Of The Lambs (i.e. ,try to understand a serial killer ,there's a young girl trapped in a torture chamber of some kind who'll die very soon if something is'nt sorted out),but,since I thought that film was just out to shock as well,all I can say is that these films collide into uncomfortable territory together.**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made Silence of the Lambs such a great movie is what made this movie so terrible. Silence has a terrifying villain, a mystery that is far from uncovered, you get to know more about the villain and the mystery, the interplay of the characters, the mystery unraveling... very cool, very interesting. The lack of CGI effects made the directors of Silence focus on a compelling movie and script. Unfortunately, not true for this utterly boring piece of tripe which seems like the directors thought they could provide a cheap rip off and just add CGI effects. Even assuming she could (and it doesn't seem like she is that good) Jennifer Lopez doesn't even have a chance to act in this silliness. Some that do are terrible. You are set up with an overly gory compilation of bad deeds done by a supposedly terrifying villain and the rest is a major draw out with some decent/commonplace CGI effects to discover what you knew completely in the first few minutes of this stupid film. At the end you are saying to yourself "so what? I've heard Lawnmower Man 2 also went nowhere."</fullReview>

It's irresponsible to show this type of deviant behavior in a sexy, sanitary, romantic and even beautiful light as done in The Cell. Dead things are stinky and bloated yellow black; not hot, tight, fresh skinned, bright eyed supermodels. Is it time to send the men who write this stuff in for some therapy?

What made movies like Silence of the Lambs and Seven so effective, was their ability to get under your skin, and make you uncomfortable. The Cell has a couple of gruesome images (which are only there for shock value), but it never creeps the viewer out the way those two films did. Add to that a couple of really stupid plot advancements, poor special effects, and two bad actors at their absolute worst, and you have the biggest disappointment of the summer.

The good things that people say about this film such as great visual effects and great acting by the film's actors maybe true and the killer may have looked bizarre and the music is good by Howard Shore but that is all that is great about this film. Why don't I like it? Simply because this movie show its sucky scenes. It seems like the film can't make up its mind if it wants to show disturbing things or if it wants to show happy things. The film should have in My opinion took a different turn with the story. Why must there be Clive Barker like stuff in this movie? Some of the things were just completely unnecessary.

Waters &amp; co. are smart enough to know they're not screen actors...anyway), the ludicrous technology (the "face masks" are WASH CLOTHS WITH CIRCUIT PATTERNS PRINTED ON THEM) and painful pacing all combine to make this the wost movie ever.Ever.The plot itself, when you remove J-Lo and pretty much everything in the movie, would've been all right. A psychologist (I think...it's been a while), goes into the mind of her patients, to approach them on their terms, and symbollically work out their problems. This leads to a lot of pretty but useless scenes, where J-Lo's in a white dress on sand dunes, etc.Which brings up the only good thing about the Cell: it's friggin' gorgeous. The horse vivsection scene alone is great to watch, and it's like a whole movie made out of a Nine Inch Nails video (good thing).It's one of only two movies I ever walked out on (the other being Red Planet. I think. Or Mission to Mars. They both sucked), but the only one I demanded a refund for.What's most sad about this movie, is that it could've been good, but somewhere along the line (*coughJ-Locough*), it fell apart.Don't waste your time, unless you're an art student, looking for ideas. 0/10.

		<fullReview>The Best: The whole visual reproduction, this is one of those movies that are richer from the outside, but poor and superficial of contents. The Worst: All the restYou know, it hurts to see good actors transformed in bad actors, the award goes to director Tarsem Singh, I can even believe he told them something like ` Don't care about the acting, I'm making this for the Razzies'. Carl Starger, serial killer full time, likes to kidnap beautiful women, take them to his ware house, submit them to several necrophagus rituals to transform into dolls so later he can worship them and throw them dead in driveways. What a nice guy, he is also addicted in pharmaceuticals (what a shocker, I didn't see that one coming..) all of the sudden he runs out of pills and he falls in coma in his kitchen floor. The FBI has to find the other girl he just kidnapped before she passes away. If only there was a ravishing brilliant psychiatrist who could help us.. but, HEY, there's Jennifer Lopez who has been developing a machine to travel inside the mind of troubled children, that's exactly a girl like those that we needed right now. If traveling inside the mind of Carl, maybe doing reversion on Catherine can work out the problem. May Lord, I'm glad that this isn't one of those movies in which since the very beginning you can discover the end of the movie. Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I lied. (so much for twists). As watching at the Cell, I realized that I was enjoying so much more watching it, rather than hearing it. Some of the sets were extremely reminding of What Dream's May Come (did I spell it right?!) but while WDMC was pleasant the Cell was at parts unpleasant. What is also boring is the fact that the plot couldn't have been any simpler but the screenwriter was trying to make it somehow confuse so it would sound deep, smart and thrilling, the final product was rather different and contradictory, so was the directing which should have been left to someone more competent </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood has a tendency to produce films that cost millions of dollars that fail to do anything apart from look different. "The Cell" is a movie where special effects and a couple of big names brought it box office success, and had at least one well-known critic kneeling before it as a great film.But when you take the time to sort out what the movie is made up of, and what any given element of the movie amounts to, it's very empty indeed. The characterization of everyone in the film, including the crazed killer who is the focus of all the mind-trotting, are as thin as they come. This may as well have been any one of a number of campy horror films with a very basic plot and the least interesting characters you'd hope to find.Some of the visuals were nice, but what's eye candy without something to back it up? Just eye candy. And that's what this film turns out to be. The casting wasn't even very good, with hopelessly bad acting from the majority of the basic cast.If there was a 0 on the IMDB rating scale, I'd give this film a 0, as I consider it a complete waste of time with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever except to those who made it and who need to earn back the millions it cost to make and market as the blockbuster it became.

Silence of the Lambs and Seven should be adequate fill on this entire subject.This was such a bad movie that I just can't seem to get beyond the word suck! The concept of the ability to go into another person's subconscious was interesting, and some of the visuals were neat; however, lose the subject matter and provide a little more meat to the story.The only thing that made me feel better about watching this movie is that I saw the Boondock Saints and Get Real the following evening.

		<fullReview>To start off...this movie was pretty and well shot during the drawn out fantasy sequences. There mom, I said something nice.Whoever wrote the script to The Cell should be excused from any job involving actual use of words in a manner that may produce any response from others. The ignorance and prejudice against the mentally ill alone sets this movies apart as trashy. But then the thrown in additions of preposterous psychobabble (from an extremely unbelieveable Jennifer Lopez) and the unbounded relationships between the therapist and her victim (I mean patient, oops!) sent my skin crawling. And don't get me started on the Viral Schizophrenia....The performances in the Cell were probably the most formulaic and unbelievable performances I have seen all year. Jennifer Lopez proved that her turn in Out of Bounds may have been the fluke everyone thought it was. Even when she was a Fly Girl she could convey more emotion than the wooden cut out of cliches she plays here. Why was Vince Vaughn in this movie. It felt like he mailed in a half-baked performance which molded in transit. I try to forget about the other cast, as I like them and don't want to hold this movie against them.In sum, I found the Cell to be a vomitous mass of human waste which would have been better off not being released.</fullReview>

I was treated to a film that to me was entirely sickening, for a few reasons, firstly because of its explicit imagery of violence and of its linking sex and extreme violence against women and also of its playing down the seriousness of the violence by focusing on both aestheticism and on the "good child that cannot help what has happenend to him and is therefore no longer responsible for what he has done as a bad man".This may not be what the film intended to say, but it is what it said to me. And that I find entirely unpalatable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...by the fact that I spent $20 in watching this awful movie. Avoid it, it's so confusing, so annoying. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I didn't understand why they were so worried about the reversal, it was better than the other way. Catherine's world was ridiculous, it seemed like if she was a saint or something like that.

		<shortDescription>The first movie I've ever walked out of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you took the really bland bits of a psychology textbook, and mixed them liberally with the most annoying visual aspects of current sneaker commercials, then lightly topped it all off with a smattering of ideas stolen from better films, you'd end up with a dead ringer for this accident of a movie.There was nothing to like about this thing at all... Horrible acting from all involved, a laughable bad guy (where did the idiot costume designer get his wig anyway? Was it really a leftover from Dumb &amp; Dumber?) drab sets, uninteresting characters, and about one cliche every second, interspersed with the kind of ugly visuals one gets in pretentious-artist rock videos.It's a real mind-bender of a film, and not in a good way. I've seen some bad films in my time - the Postman, Waterworld, ISHTAR, Battlefield Earth.... but even those films had a fragment of entertainment value (some more unintentionally than others) but this long-winded, self-sumg tribute to the director's ego was caried out with such sterile, all-knowning seriousness that any entertainment value it may have had, even in it's badness, was drained away.It was like a laundry list. I was actively calling the action play-by play. Oh, look! amongst all this horror, a pretty horse! Bet you a thousand bucks it's killed gruesomely in the next fifteen seconds. BANG! SLICE! All this film needed was a fruit-cart being toppled to give it the full "overused drama cliche" treatment.I could forgive the film's lack of original ideas, if it hadn't been so undeservedly smug about itself. Keeping in mind that this idea's been done to death a million times, and in far more entertaining films... Hell, even "Dreamsacpe" bothered to reinvent the idea, by tossing an attempt to assassinate the president into the mix.And as weird-out, trippy visual art films go, it's barely pale in comparison to a Terry Gilliam film - so it doesn't even win on that account. It's second-rate, rehashed trash - the visuals slipping back and forth between full color and gritty grim-filter drabness in a way that art-school dropouts have been wetting themselves to try ever since "The Matrix".I didn't bother to see the end of this stinker, because as I noted in the title of this review - this is the first film I have ever walked out of. Gone. Splitsville.I understand that there is no surprise twist ending, which might have wrung some life out of the second half of the film.. and that the ending is in fact a complete downer.I can't believe I passed up a South Park rerun on TV to watch this thing. It was a completely wasted evening, and all involved in the creation of this film should be banned from further attempts at the form, for the good of the industry.</fullReview>

And, Michael Roeper while you're at it.This was another big, empty spectacle from a guy who use to make cool videos, but the last one was "Closer" and that was six years ago.Ebert gushed about the script on his tv show, but it seems this is one more time when they forgot to write one. Jennifer Lopez fails to convince anyone she could work a cash register at McDonalds, never mind some hokey virtual reality machine. And Vince Vaughn's hair must have been done by Christopher Reeve's stylist from "Superman".When Tarsem accepted his MTV VMA for REM (any more acronyms, anyone?), he said the creative process made him nauseous.

		<fullReview>I walked out after 50 minutes because the images I was seeing were upsetting me and it didn't look like things were going to get better any time soon. I guess this is a tribute to the film's "power," but what I saw just seemed like gratuitous grossness. The film had nary an idea in its pretty/ugly little head and seemed proud of it. A break. To me.

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, tacky, and an utter waste of time and money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This summer has been pretty solid as far as movies go... I've immensely enjoyed movies like X-Men, Gladiator, Chicken Run, and Perfect Storm. Then along came The Cell, which ruined what would have otherwise been a respectable summer. The Cell, in a nutshell: Tacky, over the top, and not in a good way. Some of the worst performances of the year (Jen Lopez with too much makeup and not enough emotion, Vince Vaughn as a lousy TV cop) coupled with some genuinely cool backdrops and settings.Basically, this movie has been unfairly compared to masterpieces of film like Silence of the Lambs, the Matrix, Fight Club, and 2001. The visual punch of The Cell doesn't even begin to make up for it's shortcomings- a lousy plot (with a hole so wide that if it hadn't been ignored the movie would be over in half an hour), atrocious dialogue, and all the subtlety of a Marilyn Manson music video. Please do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Save the 8 bucks and rent "Silence of the Lambs" or "Seven" if you're looking for a quality psychological thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who wants to see this film, I advise you to stay away from this. This film is horrible! I have seen this and fell asleep. This film is really appalling and crappy. It doesn't even deserve any award. This film lacks a storyline. If you see this, you'll be bored to death. The director of this film cannot even direct. Jennifer Lopez cannot even act. If you own this on VHS or DVD, burn it. Dispose of it. Do not even rent it. This film is a waste of your time. it is not even worth your money. I'd rather not watch this again. This film will put you to sleep. It is like nobody speaks English in this film. My father saw it and he complained about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most disgusting film I have seen in ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film is supposedly a psychological thriller about what goes on in the mind of serial killer It is nothing more than a disgusting, voyeristic, pornographic tour of the torture of a woman and the abuse of a child. I don't say that the film is pornographic because of any nudity or sexual imagery (although there was plenty of the latter). No, I call it pornographic because we are supposed to sit in our comfortable chairs, happily munching on popcorn, and watch as one young woman suffers by slowly drowning, and another is tortured with drowning, and while a small child is beaten and maimed: this is sadism as entertainment, and I think that the casual display of violence in this way is far more destructive and immoral than any nakedness or sexual activity. The fact that in this film the violence is sexualised, with young women made out to be dolls and placed in provocative poses highlights my characterisation of the film as pornographic. At the beginning of my piece, I said that this film is intended to be a "psychological thriller". Well, it isn't. If there is any doubt in anyone's mind that the woman in "The Cell" will be rescued (or by whom), or if Jennifer Lopez's character will "come back" from the killer's mind then you should be in a half-way house, as you will be unable to care for yourself in a modern society. There is no tension. There is no examination of anyone's motives or character (with the sole exception of the killer, and even in this case, the only purpose of the examination of his mind is to titillate, not to enlighten). I cannot understand what merits this film displays apart from the artfulness with which it is shot. This in itself is not (or should not be) an excuse to display abuse and torture. Those who took part in this film, particularly those who funded it, shame. To those who watched and were not sickened... remember (or indeed learn about for the first time) Kitty Genovese, the woman murdered in front of 38 witnesses, none of whom did anything to help her (not even call the police). Can we really watch very realistic torture scenes such as those constructed for this film and not feel sickened? I hope not.</fullReview>

While being excessively violent, insulting to women and children (not to mention pets), it misses the opportunity to go anywhere with the premise. What's up with the Vince Vaughn character? The movie leads you to suspect his dark past but then nothing. A real waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like watching a long music video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had I known I was going to be so dissapointed with this film, I would never have used my last bit of cash to see it. Its the epitomy of everything bad in a movie. No characterisation, no plot, bad acting,horrendous music and an array of over-done special effects. When I say no plot, I really mean it. It is simply a vehicle to show off the production designer and directors morbid and depressing outlook on life while throwing in a couple of "Lawnmower Man" special effects (the whole tunnel thing - you know what I mean). Added to this, the film plods around aimlessly for the first hour and a half and then tries to squeeze a whole ending into the final 10 minutes! Quite frankly, it looks like a 2 hour Nine Inch Nails music video. If you happen to enjoy seeing animals cut into pieces, men hanging from hooks, bleeding children and woman being disembowled, go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no originality here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie tries hard to be original and different with the surrealism setting mixed with a thriller plot line, it fails. Flat out, it fails badly. The idea has been done before, in a video game called Killer 7 that most of you will never play or even take the time to look at, but Killer 7 does this splendidly and ends up being one of the most original things I have ever seen. This however, as I said, fails.First, I want to talk about the real world in this movie. It is represented through the mind of a serial killer, and that is represented to the off-beat flashbacks to his underground layer. In case you're clueless: the serial killer in this movie is so ridiculously typical and clichéd. He has a troubled childhood, he started out by killing animals, he has a layer, he only kills women, he has a childish side . . . is there a Hollywood cliché serial killer trait he doesn't have? I've studied real-life serial killers and I will be the first to tell you they do not all have the same cliché traits. So, really, if this director was honestly trying to do something different, he should have at least made the serial killer something other than a spineless pansy who likes to see women dead.Secondly, it steals everything technical from The Matrix. What more is there to say about that? It's so blatantly obvious I'm shocked there wasn't a copyright lawsuit.Third, the surrealist world. Though there were some cool environments, the cliché plot line made it all just stupid. Of course, according to cliché Hollywood, a killer is going to think of himself as a god in his own head. Of course the cliché handbook is going to make the killer have a childish side inside his head that is tortured by a mental dark past. You'd think something that obviously wishes to be different from normal Hollywood would have thought of something, you know, different . . .In the end, I see no reason anyone would want to see this movie unless they have a desire to study endless clichés. It didn't have anything else going for it. I want my wasted time back.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Cell"-out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last week, I was completely shame-faced in front of my friends for having picked this movie. Yes, you've all heard it right: it does have great special effects. But special effects do *not* a great movie make! Where's the real story or the acting? What part of it exactly qualifies this as a "movie"? I have no idea why Jennifer Lopez got top billing, seeing how she had very few lines and mostly non-essential scenes. Plus, the chemistry between her and Vince Vaughn was practically non-existent, if not down-right hokey. But most importantly, what's with all the lip-gloss J.L. was sporting? I didn't realize this was supposed to be a two-hour Revlon ad. I'm not sure whether it was the poor script, the abhorrent directing, or just the absence of a story-line...but Jennifer Lopez managed to make Madonna's acting look good. A complete disappointment, waste of time, and money. People were leaving the movie theater left and right halfway through. In short, don't bother paying the exorbitant amounts of $$ to see this in theaters. Maybe (and that's a BIG maybe) rent it on video for a no-brainer evening. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting how much of the public seems to be divided on this film. Half seem to love it, half seem to hate it. With commercialism hitting the music industry hard, it was only a matter of time until we could see a great example of it in Hollywood. The only thing worse than watching people with no talent, but great image, being iconized by media jackals (news as entertainment, MTVedia, bloated recording industry), was watching this movie.Complete fluff from beginning to end. Lame story, lame (i.e. mindless) visuals (most of you seem to think they were "stunning, spell-binding, etc." but they were just colorful and basically unrelated to the movie - Hmmmm, let's put in a chopped up horse part - yes, that would be cool). Remember, most of the public isn't used to seeing film as art, but film as entertainment.In a society where a person's content no longer matters, but visuals do (clothing, breast implants, lip jobs, hair style, SUV paint-job) it is no surprise to see a movie with such little content, be hailed as it has.Let the productization of America continue!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard about this I thought it might be quite good, how wrong I was. It isn't rubbish, I just don't know if I want to see it again. The main reason I wanted to see it was because it mentioned sexual references. Also, it had the wonderfully shaped Jennifer Lopez in it. But of course, it didn't have any sex or nudity at all, apart from some woman in a tank. Basically this is only good because some people are doing illegal experiments on people in a tank in The Cell. Lopez is obviously the woman that tries to stop it with the help of the government. There are some moments where she is attractive in a bikini, but that's as far as she will go. Dodgeball's Vince Vaughn as FBI Agent Peter Novak, Full Metal Jacket's Vincent D'Onofrio as Carl Rudolph Stargher, Dawn of the Dead's Jake Weber as FBI Special Agent Gordon Ramsey, Happiness's Dylan Baker as Henry West and Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Dr. Miriam Kent. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Worth watching!</fullReview>
