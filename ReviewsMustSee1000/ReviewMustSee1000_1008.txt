		<shortDescription>Cinema dies with Béla Tarr.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Turin Horse is a film that works off the story of one of Nietzche's final encounters where he supposedly wrapped his arms around a horse crying. Of the story, Tarr asks "What happened to the horse?" - and thus The Turin Horse was born. The film takes place at the turn-of-the- century and recreating that kind of atmosphere is hard but Tarr manages to do it magnificently, creating sets and buildings out of stone and wood especially for the film. Originally devised in the late 80s and postponed and delayed by various people for various reasons, it stands out on it's own from any of Tarr's previous works for two reasons. The first is that it's Tarr's last and for most that will be a sign of defeat for cinema - I feel the same way - but for some it will pass them by without even noticing. The second is the visceral performances from the two central characters. Father and daughter. An hour into the film they are met by a visitor spouting Nietzche-like philosophies but is cast out by the father calling it horse manure. The only other appearances come from a group of gypsies and the narration by Tarr himself. The film follows the daily life of the father and daughter as they sleep, eat, dress and look after their ailing horse who's health slowly deteriorates as the film progresses. Tarr's trademark, uncompromising 10-15 minute single shots, either entice the viewer or make them incredibly uncomfortable and it's no different here than in Satan's Tango or Damnation. The cinematography is always the utmost magnificent thing about any of his films and it is absolutely splendid here - bear in mind the film contains a minimal 30 takes. It remains among the best of any Tarr film even managing to overcome the odds set by the beautiful Werckmeister Harmonies. Not to mention the incredible score which is laden throughout the entire piece - the main motif is haunting and will undoubtedly be stuck in my mind for days. Where the score isn't the harsh sound of gale force winds fly through the frame. The wind sets the perfect tone for the center of the movie where we come to terms with the similarity of this families' day to day lives. As the film comes to a close the routines work their way back into the film and you're left wondering how anyone can even stomach it any longer. The characters are heavily undeveloped but the way their routine and daily life is presented one can only express sympathy for their plight and watch as their story unfolds either to their benefit or to their dismay. Tarr has obviously done this on purpose - leaving the human aspect of this film to the very end and sacrificing it for the feelings of the titular animal which serves as the center of this, Béla Tarr's last masterpiece. While the opening 20 minutes contain no dialogue bar the opening narration, the ending is an incredible parallel as the final 15 minutes are played out in complete darkness, ending with Tarr's narration - followed by an ending to be remembered for a long long time to come. A premature death for cinema. Or is it? Only time will tell.http://destroyallcinema.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary and haunting film about the apocalypse...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most of the film's length we watch a father and daughter's sparse and bleak existence in a remote farmhouse, blasted by an eternal wind. Only a couple of visitors come to break the near-silent existence of this couple and their ageing horse. Out of this silence and the wind and the darkness, an apocalyptic vision of a fallen, corrupt world emerges.It's a unique and haunting film, like a filming of a near-wordless play of Beckett, stained with an indelible sadness and regret that our world cannot be saved from darkness. Along with SATANTANGO and WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES, this is another masterpiece from Bela Tarr and his regular band of collaborators.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving piece, I would give a 10 if there was a 7th day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Turin Horse the very day (2.April.11) and heard the director warning the already clapping audience "do not before you watch the movie". I was among the ones who were moved by the piece, not just because its originality, excellent cinematography, impressive music, the acting but because it really touched me from the very heart. I am not a fan of Nietzsche or literate on his works but probably I was in the right state of mind to get a meaning out of the movie in my life. Two main characters were holding on to life, in a loop-like setting. Despite the desperation of the situation, they were carrying on almost mechanically or instinctively to survive. The horse was everything for a living and when the horse was no longer, the universe would fall apart. Special thanks to the director and the ones who financially supported this piece because it is one of rare films with originality value. And a comment for Ms. Alvarez's review, with respect to his opinion, it is clearly a flaw, his generalizing his point of view to majority of the audience in that theater. And where else audiences be able to see such films if not even at film festivals. If there are people seeing this movie as a torture they are always free to leave the theater. While the director humbly accepts the existence of second opinions, why some audiences can't?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy going perhaps, but a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can you make someone see what is staring them in the face? Tarr is nothing if not serious cinema. It may not move, entertain or give you a thrill to the bottom of your popcorn. But it is also, for many cineastes, a standard by which other art cinema can measured. And if that introduction is overweening, perhaps it will deter anyone even vaguely faintly thinking about popcorn - but encourage serious-minded cinema-goers to consider dropping everything to see this.Hungarian Grandmaster Bela Tarr uses a technique made famous by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky ? that of incredibly long takes. We are forced to immerse ourselves in real time, to experience the minutiae of existence (and its totality) in the same way the characters do. But in terms of 'suspension of beliefs', Tarr goes one stage further than Tarkovsky. The latter's films were often connected with metaphysics and decorated with religious iconography; whereas Tarr eschews God and religion in favour of the people, in favour of human rights, in favour of righting wrongs, or simply in favour of what is most basic to any individual. At times seen as heavily political, his films are careful to portray only a 'documentarist' style reality. They are films designed to make you think, rather than make you entertained. In this respect, his work preserves a thread from the fierce artistic integrity of Godard - perhaps by way of Fassbinder, who would also at times exemplify a fierce minimalistic style.In The Turin Horse, Tarr gives us a six-day prelude to an actual event that we never see. Even in those six days, nothing very much happens ? yet you could probably write a Masters philosophy dissertation on that 'nothing very much.' The ontological lynchpin of the film is Nietzsche: in terms of storyline and also the dilemmas a viewer might confront.Our movie begins by informing us of a well-known tale concerning the German philosopher. Nietzsche had caused a public disturbance ? apparently by attempting to save a horse being flogged. Immediately afterwards, Nietzsche collapses and succumbs to mental illness. He will remain that way for the rest of his life. Tarr's film is an imagined reconstruction of the days leading up to the incident. It features the ailing horseman, his grown-up daughter, a visitor who provides the film's only monologue, and a brief visit by a band of gypsies. The horseman and his daughter live in the most spartan of conditions trying to survive, surrounded by a harsh and barren landscape. He probably would have rejected Nietzsche's philosophy, the rejection (or death) of God, and the idea of the 'slave-morality' dominating society. Indeed, the horseman dismisses the reflections of the visitor, whose thoughts are perhaps a shadow of Nietzschean ideas, as "rubbish." We can perceive a shift from classical belief to atheism as the ideas move quite politically: 'man is responsible for his own fate, but there is something greater that takes a hand' - yet that 'something' might be nature, rather than 'God' and it seems undeniably demonstrated in the harsh conditions that gradually drive the horseman and his daughter nearer extinction. Or it could, of course, be 'the ruling classes.' But this is not a film where intellectual arguments are expounded or debated. Most of the dialogue, in the rare instances where dialogue occurs, comprises an occasional monosyllable. The film is in black and white, and consists of merely thirty long takes ? that would be excruciating were they not mesmerizingly beautiful. Each shot is perfectly composed, right down to the individual hairs on the horseman's Rasputinish beard. (This is one reason why it could not work as well on a small screen ? the other being that its impact depends on being a captive audience.) As in The Man from London, Tarr uses environment as main 'characters' ? the buildings, the landscape. They are 'major players.' This gives not only a tremendous sense of grandeur and majesty in simple images, but allows Tarr to convey a more cosmic point, even with such a miniscule budget. The characters each form a microcosm, doing what they do (what Man does) in order to survive. We are aware of the oppression and hardship of the plebiscite ? oppression we can say is caused by 'conditions', but equally by the ruling classes. Dirge-like music, a daily meal of boiled potatoes eaten without cutlery, and a bleakness from which there is no apparent escape.On the Second Day, the horse, once hitched, won't move. The daughter expresses some sympathy for its abject refusal. Yet the horse's gradual deterioration (to a point where it is starving itself to death) almost mirrors the plight of its owners. The horseman and daughter struggle against becoming dehumanised: he by fighting, she by gentleness. What does it mean to be human? As the wind whips dust across the landscape, she reads of the "holy places violated." The downsides of The Turin Horse are that, given its minority-appeal audience, most people will only see it on DVD. The political landscape about which Tarr is so passionate demands extra study in order to be illuminated by the film. Nietzsche declared that art is the proper task of life, that it is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature, but a metaphysical supplement to nature's reality. But can The Turin Horse stand philosophically on its own merits? Some may feel that Tarr has indeed flogged his point to death, and fails to offer any man or super-man to triumph at the end of his inevitable Gotterdammerung.Constant use of steadicam gives the impression that we are personally observing what happens - even when all motion stops and the last light is extinguished. Susan Sontag once championed Tarr as a saviour of the modern cinema. If she had lived to see this, probably his last film, she surely would probably have felt doubly justified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've got to have something better to do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get real tired of pretentious critics trying to make something out of nothing. Experimental/artistic film makers get away with producing drivel only by using the naiveté and over-active imagination of viewers too afraid to look unsophisticated by telling the truth. I've gone to a number of such festivals and all I can say is that if you ever worry about having psychological problems, watch some of these experimental films. You will suddenly realize how normal you are.I would love to see a movie based on Nietzsche's life. That's the lure that got me to watch the film. Don't be fooled. This is a misinterpretation of Nietzsche as looked at through the lens of existentialism. Nietzsche looked upward, not downward. Read Zarathustra. Sure, he criticized the fact that noble natures have been subsumed by Christian values, but that was because he reached for those higher values. This film glorifies the mundane. Nietzsche would never have done that.After an hour of watching people eat a potato (utter nonsense), or enjoying the thrill of a wild trip to the well to get water, the film's most dramatic moment arrives. On a particularly exciting evening when the near-mute father and daughter are watching clothes dry (I only wish I was making this up) a guest arrives. He spouts off some viewpoints that are obliquely Nietzshean and leaves. Then, it's back to the potatoes, wind, dismal music, and clothes drying. The film follows six days in the lives of the world's most vegetative humans. In truth, you would get more emotional angst from a celery stalk. It is not filmed in real time, but it feels as though it is. Oh yeah, the horse. The horse supplies the intellectual content for the film. The horse dreams of having an opposable thumb so that he can pick up a pistol and shoot himself. Since he cannot, he develops an elaborate scheme of making his owner so angry that the owner will do this for him. Alas, the plan goes awry when the owner realizes he is trapped in a huge philosophical dilemma: If I shoot the horse, I have no horse. To be or not to be, that is the farmer's question. Eventually, the horse, being a true stoic, understands that he can only control himself and not others. He, thus, decides to starve himself to death, as death by boredom would take too long. Does the horse succeed? Watch this two and a half hour film to find out.So, in short, if you feel you have done something wrong and deserve to be punished, watch this film. Your sins and those of all your ancestors will be forgiven. Thus spake Zarathustra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant final(?) film for Tarr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't organize my thoughts so I'm just going to spill them out and sort them out some other time. Although it is a shame (a tragedy) that Bela Tarr will make no more films after this, but perhaps it is a fitting end. A farmer (we assume... he has a horse but it's unclear exactly how he makes a living, if he does at all) and his daughter trudge joylessly through their monotonous routine. Getting dressed, schlepping water from the well, eating a meal of simply boiled potatoes, and for relaxation, staring out the window. Over the course of 6 days, we see -- in a manner mildly reminiscent of JEANNE DIELMAN -- the routine start to break down as some sort of vague apocalypse seems to be descending upon them. Life, what little is left of it, is draining out of the world. A neighbor delivers a monologue about the degradation of humanity, how the good people have quietly faded away while the rest debase everything they touch. A wandering pack of gypsies leaves the daughter ("eyes of the devil") a religious text. Is it these two particular people who are doomed, or being judged? Or all of mankind? Tarr, as usual, not only doesn't give answers, he doesn't even let you know if he's asking the question.Which is to say, if you loved any of Tarr's previous four films, you will probably love this one, although it is his bleakest. The cinematography is, as one would expect, jaw-droppingly rich. From the opening shot of the horse defining the word "struggle", to Ohlsdorfer's sunken, skull-like eyes, to the spine-chilling image of the daughter's beaten-down face staring out the window, the film is loaded with stark, gorgeous, unforgettable visions. Mihaly Vig once again submits an incredible score, a funereal dirge that shares the soundtrack with the incessant howling wind. Tarr's films have a tactile effect, and here you can truly feel the bitter cold of the landscape and the house that surely does little to protect its occupants from the elements.It's a haunting film, and perhaps Tarr's most difficult... although only a third the length of SATANTANGO, the repetitiveness gives it less forward momentum. But it completely worked its way under my skin. It's mesmerizing, thought-provoking, breathtaking. If Tarr makes another film, I'll be thrilled, but if he doesn't, at least he's left me some of the greatest works of art I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly oblique existentialist parable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarr's self-proclaimed last film is as open to interpretation as any movie ever was. The film follows a man, his daughter, and their horse as they struggle to survive during hard times in the late nineteenth century. It's a simple, practically minimalist movie with all the repetition that aesthetic implies, gradually coming to a crescendo that's somewhat reminiscent on a small scale of the disharmony the develops in a previous film, Werckmeister Harmonies.The idea for the movie came from an apocryphal story (Tarr doesn't label it as such) about Nietzsche's time in Turin, which relates how the philosopher broke down upon witnessing a carriage driver whip his horse. The filmmakers were interested to look at what happened next for the horse. They also see the incident as representing a sincere recantation of all his works by the philosopher (or heavily imply so). One can apprehend from listening to Tarr that he believes Nietzsche was little more than a psychotic, responsible for promulgating a decline in values. The film depicts such a decline, though any actual link to Nietzsche other than by free association and any substantive intellectual link to the Turin episode are tenuous at best.Tarr announced in the Q&amp;A following the UK Premiere of Turin Horse at the Edinburgh International Film Festvial, that he felt "something's wrong", in a grand sense. The Turin Horse reflects this concern. What exactly is wrong is left almost entirely up to you as the viewer to determine. There's one clear allusion to watching television, but other than that the symptomatology and etiology of modern malaise is open to question. You could say that was a weakness of the movie, someone who believes that free migration and rights for gays are the cause for societal decay, would be equally at home watching this movie as someone who points towards revolutions in social media and the society of spectacle.Patricularly given that no root cause is identified, Tarr and co leave themselves open to charges of the familiar canard of archaism - supposing that the past was a safer more moral and ingenious place. The artist Jeff Koons has perhaps the best counterarguments to Tarr's perspective on modern life. His stated mission is to "remove bourgeois guilt and shame in responding to banality" (highlighting the snobbery of those who cling to traditional values), whereas Tarr's is perhaps to stoke it. I suppose what side you take depends on whether you see someone fragging on a PlayStation and think "good for them", or whether you bemoan their lack of appetite for self-improvement or meaningful interaction with others. In the Q&amp;A at the Edinburgh Film Festival Tarr said that he thinks that people spend too much time stuck in front of screens waiting forlornly for something to happen, part of a sort of technological cargo cult if you will.On a gut level I felt the film went quickly; although empirically it's well over two hours long, it's definitely mesmerising. I've felt for a time that the best way to appreciate Werckmeister Harmonies is as narrative music, as a kind of prelude and fugue, similarly The Turin Horse works well simply in terms of rhythm and visual tone, as a meaningless sketch of the interaction of three hardy entities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>30 takes in 146 minutes will test the audience's patience, but The Turin Horse is more mesmerizing than dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare to see movie walk outs; people will usually stick out rough films until the end because they willingly paid to be there. It is rarer still to see walk outs in an art house theater because the patrons typically have more experienced expectations on contemplative and metaphorical features. The Turin Horse will split audiences right down the middle. Some will be mesmerized with the incredibly long takes, crisp black and white cinematography, and the relentless but futile struggle of the characters. The other half of the audience will groan, comment to their neighbors, drop their head in the hands, and a few baffled theater-goers will just give up and leave.The beginning monologue describes the alleged events which led to Friedrich Nietzsche's mental collapse. He walks out of his house in Turin and witnesses a cabman whipping his horse for being disobedient. Nietzsche runs up to the horse, hugs it, and then spends his next 10 years in the care of his mother and sisters deep in mental illness. The film asks, "But what happened to the horse?" Nietzsche is not a character in The Turin Horse nor is it set in Italy; the majority of the time, you will only see an old man, his daughter, their obstinate horse, and their rural Hungarian farm house.The opening scene is a single shot held for minutes with no interruptions. An old man, Janos Derzsi, rides on a cart pulled by a horse in a truly blinding wind storm. Dirt flies in his face and stings his eyes. The horse sometimes stumbles and trips as he is not whipped by the man on the cart, but by the wind trying to push him backwards. The camera watches them from the side, moves back behind some leafless trees, pushes all the way up until it almost brushes the horse's nose and then repeats the process. All the while, a monotonous organ and string melody repeats itself as if it is a cadence for the distressed travelers.Back at the farm, the man's daughter, Erika Bok, meets him, separates the horse from the cart, and they then spend the next two and a half hours of the film taking care of the horse, fetching water, boiling potatoes, getting dressed and undressed, and then doing all of that again. There is precious little dialogue between anyone except when a neighbor drops by to borrow alcohol and wax philosophy, and when a band of gypsies briefly invade the family's water supply. The audience waits for something to happen, expects something to happen, and little by little begin to realize that what is happening is just everyday life. The director, Bela Tarr, says The Turin Horse is about the "heaviness of human life." Life does seem particularly heavy for these two characters as they fumble about in the wind storm to get water, try to get the horse to eat, and carry out even the simplest chore. Tarr does not just glance over these chores either. After 146 minutes, the audience will know exactly who boils the potatoes, how each of them will eat them, where they hang their clothes, and how to hook the horse up to the cart. In 146 minutes of film, there are only 30 takes. In an era when most movie scenes may last for an average of seconds, the scenes in The Turin Horse average almost five long minutes each. The description here sounds harsh, but I assure you it is accurate. Also, I was one of the audience members who was more mesmerized by the routine movements than exasperated. I will not recommend very many people go and sit through The Turin Horse, but I warn you not to run away from it either. It is a very difficult film to sit through. I do not judge those who left the theater before the film was over, I understand their disbelief. However, when you consider that the director is slowly showing characters get worn down and begin to give up, he succeeds in showing that everyday life is a struggle to fight against.Surprisingly, The Turin Horse won the Jury Grand Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival and is Hungary's entry for the 2012 Best Foreign Film Oscar. Bela Tarr said publicly it will be his last film so I wonder if these prizes and accolades are for the film itself or to celebrate a retiring director. I assume the critics and specialized film festival public truly care for The Turin Horse, but I warn you, it will test your patience and your preconceptions of how much a film is truly plot driven or just about the audience sitting back and watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Journey of Despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment I cast my eyes on the horse toiling through the storm, and my ears embraced the haunting score, I knew that something significant awaited me. I was completely spellbound by the beauty and ferocity of the images on the screen, and I felt myself floating side by side with the rhythmical motions of the camera. This scene alone would have been a profound experience, but what followed made the movie more than profound; a revelation. Oddly I had never seen a film by Bela Tarr before The Turin Horse, as I have enjoyed films by Tarkovsky, Trier, Malick, Dreyer and many more. I knew his name, but had evidently missed out on one of the few true auteurs alive today. However, this made the two and a half hours even more compelling. Once again, I was reminded that the less information you have of a movie you are going to see, the greater the experience will become. And what an experience it was! When the horse refuses to eat, and you realize that the relentless storm engulfing the house will never end, your heart starts to race, as you mentally prepare yourself for a journey towards a desperate end. You slowly glide, circle, zoom, stop and wonder, hand in hand with a cinematographer, who conjures up an endless series of deeply poetic black and white images, transcending space and time. Together with the father and daughter, you sit in silence and wait. And as the flames slowly die out, you drift into darkness; the final destination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two people pretend the world isn't ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bela Tarr claims this will be his last film, and damn does it have finality written all over it. I guess there's few ways to be more final than to devote a work to the end of humanity. And I've never seen a film that struck me as more authentically apocalyptic than this one. It is immediately strange to say then, that one of the things that most impressed me about this juggernaut is its ultra-sly humor. Tarr really is a nihilist and a misanthrope, at least philosophically. The fall of our silly little species really is funny to him, in the darkest way possible, and in half audible beats he makes it funny for us too. All of the other species have sensed the death of the world and have, reasonably, stopped trying to survive. Only homosapiens, represented by a half-functioning horse-carriage driver and his daughter, are clueless enough to continue their wretched routine in the face of a blatant apocalypse. We, along with Tarr, laugh at, pity, and admire the duo for this all at the same time. This is why I call Tarr a misanthrope in philosophy only. In practice, he has love for his fools, even as he leads them towards annihilation. The film includes many references to cinematic finality as well. Fading lanterns, windows that show a world that is becoming not, opaque, all suggest an abandoned cinema. The empty shell of a cinematic artist imagining his own abandoned corpse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophy is Dead: The Turin Horse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched The Turin Horse recently. I had been meaning to get around to it for a long time. After seeing Damnation, which just didn't really click with me, I think I may have have subconsciously lowered The Turin Horse's priority level in my viewing schedule. However, the movie really worked for me. The last couple nights I couldn't sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I never seemed to ever drift fully into sleep. I would kind of doze off, still thinking about it, only to quickly be aroused by my own thoughts and immediately struggle to try to fall back asleep. The film was in many ways similar to Jeanne Dielman. It shows the overwhelming claustrophobia of a daily routine. How just making it through the basic chores necessary to live can be almost unbearable. It could become impossible to accomplish anything more, let alone find a way to assign some sort of meaning to our lives. But beyond that, it also had a significant underlying theme about class systems and a certain ease of life which allows us to become intellectuals. Nietzsche had the luxury of being destroyed by his own philosophy. He had the luxury of feeling sympathy for the beaten horse. However, when that very horse is your livelihood and the ability to make it through life is barely possible and completely reliant upon that animal's compliance, the abstract philosophies sort of fade away. Sometimes the harsh realities of the world nullify philosophy. Even if it was coming from the "right" place. There is a Louis C.K. joke in which he talks about the fact that he doesn't believe in hitting his children, even though his mother used to hit him. He notes that the difference is that he is wealthy and his mother wasn't. She couldn't afford the luxury of the moral high ground. She was tired and needed the most immediately effective option available. The same concept applies to the farmer's situation with the horse. In neither C.K.'s joke nor in Béla Tarr's film is this a justification. It is simply revealing that life is more complicated than our philosophies allow for. The final aspect of the film which mystifies me are the meta-cinematic elements. The film is a bleak, pessimistic, and starkly final film. It is in many ways an antithesis to the slight beacons of hope offered in his earlier films. It is a film about giving up. Which is exactly what Tarr has done. He's given up making films. The horse quits working, eating, and living. The girl eventually gives up living. Even the earth appears to have given up. Life is over. The sun refuses to shine, lamps refuse to light, water wells refuse to give water. Tarr refuses to make more movies. There is nothing left to say. Philosophy is dead. Cinema is over. They've been snuffed out by what Tarr calls "the heaviness of human existence." All that remains is existing in a void of meaninglessness. However, even that seems nearly finished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eternal return and the lonely plateau of Hungary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone said before me: "Cinema dies with Béla Tarr". I believe this to be completely reasonable view; and I'm afraid it is mostly true. If this the last Tarr I will ever see, I just can't express my profound sadness. Sadness that whispers me gently into sleep in a dark and hollow room I call home.Béla Tarr is the voice in the wilderness, wilderness of most humane nature. He is the wind and wailing of - not only the lonely human, but also - the turbulent tides of Hungarian history and for that matter, the whole of Europe. The essence of Béla Tarr is in the way he creates macrocosm inside the microcosm of a single human being. The wind in plateau keeps on screaming, silently whispering. Telling truths about ourselves, of other humans. Who we never quite seem to connect with. And the world keeps going on, after we are gone - the wind will be there. Probably the gypsies will also be there - still.Tarr's human is almost always and everywhere lonely, he is strong and weak, but apart from all that he (or she) is always of the most nietzschean in stature. Proud and lost; lost because of his own inescapable condition. It's also about the eternal return and it's also about the potatoes. They sure are nice and warm, bring the warmth back into your freezing body.I'm a huge fan of his Werckmeister harmóniák (2000) and Sátántangó (1994), though there is nothing wrong with his other work also - rest of his work just doesn't reach the highest peak of filmmaking. A torinói ló is a magnificent, almost indescribable finale to his career if that is how it's going to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Girl:What it is Papa? Father:I don't know.. It is my first Bela Tarr movie and I don't think that words can help me to write a review on 'The Turin Horse' and it is my first review. I have been watching movies since my childhood, reading literature and philosophy in order to understand human condition but the visual and sound sensation I have had with 'The Turin Horse' is matchless. There is a modern novel in which a girl commits suicide because she think that she had to brush her teeth everyday with the same brush. Bela Tarr's characters are eating raw potatoes everyday,fortunately they don't commit suicide but what is the point in living? Bela will compel you to think about it. Father: Eat. we have to... To be very honest 'The Turin Horse' is the most powerful work of cinematic art I've ever came across, it is not social but ontological rather cosmological. What it is to be human? Want to know? Go and watch it, the 'heaviness of human existence' to put it in Bela's words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To summarize this review: It's not a movie for anyone. It either demands a fanatical devotion to Bela Tarr's style or Nietzsche's life and philosophy. The movie is both relevant and radical but it won't capture anyone.I'm a huge fan of Werckmeister Harmonies. This movie possesses the same qualities, but the theme is the biggest obstacle, both for the audience and the movie.As Bela Tarr unravels the mystery of Nietzsche's vanishing, he fantasizes about Nietzsche's meeting with the horse and the horseman that could have caused for his sudden collapse. What sort of universe could they have come from? We see the opposite of God's creation of the world unfold: Instead of six days of creation, we see six days of slow, eerie dismantling of the lives of two people living in an inverted paradise - a dry, desolate, barren land with only a relentless wind, dead leaves and life decaying everywhere. The movie does not try to explain anything in explicit language, but uses masterly b/w cinematography, sporadic musical compositions, and whatever preconceived knowledge the viewer might have of Nietzsche's teachings. There is no god or godly energy, only (as noted by another reviewer) a mechanical struggle for survival. Everything is hopeless, and the destiny of the father and his only daughter is just a silent, anonymous life without joy or pain. Their emotions almost never show, and communication is kept at a secret-like minimum. And it seems like an ironical gesture that right as you look for some sort of rational sense of what's going on, a Nietzsche-like man suddenly appears and explains his thoughts about everything in this, the movie's world. The horseman simply replies: "What rubbish", and you're left with only a slight conception of the massive philosophical teaching that the mystery man just gave. But after that, the movie seems to have more focus.There are many things about the movie, that I understand better while writing this review, but I don't think everything needs to be said, and I'm sure Bela Tarr lovers will have a good time debating the symbolism and cinematic craft.After seeing the movie, I feel terrible. I fundamentally disagree with the meaningless struggle that we see portrayed, but I'm grateful to find myself strong enough to not loose hope after such a gloomy experience. A big quality in the movie is the existential challenges it brings about, but I can only wonder why it didn't show even the slightest hint of hope to bring about something more than just a momentum of deep depression, unlike the epic and beautiful Werckmeister Harmonies. Anyways, well done Bela Tarr - I look forward to hear more insights about the theme of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I don't understand art and should stick to playing Call of Duty games or watching whatever movie Michael Bay comes up with next while he's masturbating to nuclear bomb footage. I really don't understand the praise for this film, it's as if watching the same events over and over again is appealing. I get it, Tarr is making a point about the repetitive and boring lives of these characters. I get it, this isn't supposed to be a fun movie. I get it, I just don't think it's as important as people think it is. Nobody likes to listen to the same soundtrack on loop. Nobody *should* enjoy watching someone eat a potato with his hands in at least three separate scenes. Most importantly, nobody should get the idea that this film is some amazingly shot masterpiece because it does a lot of long takes. Nothing of value goes on in these scenes until over an hour into the film. The dialogue is simple enough that anybody can do it (and these actors still struggle to convincingly pull off their lines), and anybody can cut wood and wash clothes in front of a camera for 2 and a half minutes. Sure the scenes involving the horse took talent and a trained horse to do, but if a scene of a horse is what I'm supposed to look forward to the fvck that sh!t. Movies like "Hard to be A God" and "the Tribe" have long take scenes that actually have things going on in them, like dialogue or multiple things happening on screen, which makes their one takes impressive. And don't even try to compare this to the hour and a half long single take movie "Victoria". Here, the one take feels overly long and dull. Maybe I'm just easily bored. I know this director isn't for everyone, but to me this movie feels like it is meant for people who enjoy monotony to a sadistic extent. At 2 and a half hours this begins to feel more like a waterboarding session than an art-film viewing. The philosophy here is weak and bare bones. The characters here are unfleshed out and bare bones. This movie is bare bones. Skip it for any other art film on your list</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>enduring the end, darkness, long takes, and other critics' adulation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film like The Turin Horse makes me feel a little stupid. Perhaps I am just not 'getting' it, as apparently most critics did when they saw the film - presumably, according to the director (still in his 50's) his last). And it's not like I came to this filmmaker ignorant of his craft and style; sitting through all 450 minutes of Satantango was one of the most mysterious, satisfying if strange filmmaking experiences I've ever had, and that was not without its stretches of time without much "going on" as it were in the usual narrative sense.The idea with The Turin Horse, co-directed by Agnes Hranitzszky, is that Frederich Nietzche saved a horse from being whipped in a town square in the late 19th century, and the horse was removed from its owner and given to another. Tarr could have filmed that sequence - which happened in real life, and further sounds to me like the dream sequence from Crime &amp; Punishment involving a whipped horse, certainly from the opening narration a very cinematic and dramatic turn of events - but he chooses to go right into the story of this old farmer bringing the horse to his tiny not-much-of-a-farm with his daughter, and watch over the course of five/six days their downfall.The thing you should know going into this, if you haven't seen Tarr before, is that he does long takes. All the time. Maybe the shortest shot in this runtime is about 4 minutes. It's certainly not easy to pull this off, everything has to be choreographed and timed just right, and that is certainly a testament to Fred Kinemen's cinematography. For me, actually, if it's anyone's masterpiece it's Kinemen's, who in black and white and usually in a camera that moves, gets the dust and wind and darkness and despair down just right visually speaking. There are many shots in the film, like the one where the farmer and his daughter, in the one sort of moment of story "progression", tries to get away from the farm to somewhere else, and the camera shows them off on the hillside, with a dead, lonely tree up top, and the wind blowing in the foreground. I can't fault visually speaking how it looks - just what is put into it, the content.But why then say that this movie makes me feel 'stupid'? I sensed there was a greater, more profound message here, and I didn't 'get' it, I guess. Perhaps there's something to be said for this being some sort of transcendental experience or other, that what the movie is pretty much 'about' - the pitiless routines of cooking food, fetching water from a well, trying to make a horse eat, putting on clothes - is supposed to make us hypnotized. The sort of real-time, meditative, sort of deadpan and minimalist filmmaking of Satantango had that too, as I'm sure Tarr's other films do, but there was more going on there, more to actual see and note in the characters. Maybe that's part of the point, that this farmer and his daughter, without any electricity or books (well, until a gypsy happens to give one to her, not a long story, they happen by the house in one of the only times other humans interact with them) or any curiosity past living from one day to the next, have made this life and eventual death for themselves. And I can be mesmerized watching routine; Jeanne Dielman is one of the highlights of 1970's French cinema.So what's missing here? Is it missing in myself to not meet the material more than halfway? I don't know. There may be something that Nietzsche is used as this catalyst for the story at all - that there's something to these lives 'Between Good and Evil', or to his philosophy expressed here. Maybe it's about how the breakdown of the world is meant to be comparable to Tarr seeing the breakdown of cinema, with himself leaving the medium (at least for the time being). And to be fair, as more 'things' happen to this father and daughter, I started to get more intrigued. I wanted to meet the film more than halfway, as this director is the epitome of uncompromising, dead-serious art house filmmakers. And there's just enough for me to recommend it to die-hard admirers of this sort of rigorous filmmaking with maybe like 50 shots in the whole run time. I simply wish there had been a sliver more 'there' there in terms of these two people, despite that being the point of the nothingness of existence and so on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the beat goes on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile, but that it is indifferent. But if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death ? however mutable man may be able to make them ? our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfilment. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light." - Stanley Kubrick "Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?" - Albert Camus Everyday is the apocalypse in Bela Tarr's "The Turin Horse". It opens with a parable about philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who encountered a horse being beaten in Turin, Italy, in 1889. The horse refused to work, refused to move, leading to repeated whippings by its owner. This sight led to Nietzsche spiralling into mental illness, depression and finally death. But why? "The Turin Horse" has been compared to Robert Bresson's "Au Hasard Balthazar", a film in which a donkey is incessantly abused by human beings. Tarr's horse is similarly treated, but its response is radically different. Bresson's donkey accepts and largely doesn't understand its fate. Tarr's horse, however, is a perceptive steed with the disposition of a four legged philosopher. His horse slips into depression, suffers an existential crisis and refuses to work, eat or even continue living. The horse, in short, rebels against its owners and life itself; it will not play.Suicide is also the final act of the horse's owners, an elderly cab driver (Janos Derzsi) and his daughter (Erika Bok). They live in a stone cottage which is incessantly pummelled by powerful gusts of wind. Inside the house, father and daughter huddle in the flickering light of lanterns. Outside the house, reality reveals itself to be malevolent, violent, dark and cold. The wind never steps, there is no respite, and the duo seem to expend all their energy attempting to resist it. Eventually, like the horse, they give up. Tarr's early films were explicitly political. As his career progressed, his films became increasingly abstract and metaphysical. For Tarr, a pessimist, politics offers no solution to humanity's problems. It is not simply that the horse is both beaten and exploited by others, but that a hostile universe, for Tarr, necessitates or causes man to exploit man, father to exploit daughter, man to exploit animal. Indeed, sharing water and brandy with "neighbours" and "strangers" is partially what leads to the father and daughter's demise. For Tarr, the sheer nature of Nature corrupts everything, everyone and every relationship. Everyone is at war, the film's nihilism echoing Schophenahuer and Nietzsche at their worst."The Turin Horse" is comprised of thirty long takes. Most of the film's action is intentionally repetitive, Tarr's characters trapped in their private Sisyphus myth. As is typical of Tarr, the film's shot in inky blacks and austere whites. Its cast, with their magnificent beards and sad eyes, recall Dreyer's "Ordet", and the spiritual but existentially brutal films of Bergman, Bresson and Tarkovsky. Tarr's outlook is much more defeatist, though. One character speaks of civilisation's drive to "acquire", "corrupt" and "debase", but the film's scorn goes far beyond systems of social organisation. "Everyday is the same, then you just disappear," Tarr would say in interviews. "There is no apocalypse...this is all I wanted to say." Such a stance was routinely espoused by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who viewed the world as a penal colony in which pain must outweigh enjoyment, an assertion which he recommended be tested by comparing the feelings of an animal engaged in eating another with those of the animal being eaten."Turin" itself ends with "eating". Here the father and daughter sit at a table. "Even the embers went out," she says, referring to a dead lamp. "We have to eat," he recommends. But they don't. After all, what's the point? Fittingly, the film is structured as a series of "six days", reversing the Old Testament's six days of creation and seventh day of rest. Here, the Earth slides toward oblivion, followed by a day of total silence."The Turin Horse" was released in 2011, a year in which many similarly themed films were released, most notably Lars von Trier's kitschy "Melancholia", Abel Ferrara's "Last Day on Earth" and Brad Anderson's humble "Vanishing on 7th Street". Documentary cinema at the time was similarly rife with flicks heralding the apocalypse, usually due to environmental or financial catastrophe. All these films are heavy on doom and light on courses of action. "The Turin Horse" was Tarr's final film before retirement.7.9/10 ? See "Ghost World", "A Prairie Home Companion", "Man Push Cart", "Papillon" and "Red Desert".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art with a capital A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot by cinematographer Fred Kelemen in glorious black-and-white, Bela Tarr's "The Turin Horse" is a movie more concerned with imagery and tone than with telling a conventional narrative. Indeed, a full twenty-one minutes have elapsed before a single line of dialogue has been spoken, and another six before we get a second (though there is some sparse voice-over narration). And that's about the average for this two-hour-and-twenty-six minute film.The movie chronicles the daily life of a semi-crippled father (Janos Derzsi) and his weather-beaten daughter (Erika Bok) living in rural Hungary during the 19th Century. The movie does an effective job showing how, for most of our time here on earth, human experience has been a virtually nonstop battle against the elements - and a joyless, nay, soul-crushing, struggle for survival. The deliberate - some might even say funereal - pacing and lack of verbal communication between father and daughter certainly drive that point home.We're delivered a brief respite from the redundant toil when a disgruntled neighbor wanders in and launches into a rambling diatribe on the metaphysical nature of social and economic inequality, but that doesn't last very long, and soon we're back to watching Bok hauling water, cooking dinner, tending the fire, dressing her father, etc and eating a diet that appears to be made up entirely of boiled potatoes. The movie also shows how, for many in the past and for many still living today, humans are always just one simple event - in this case, the drying up of a well, the sudden illness of a horse - away from full- blown personal catastrophe.The movie is ostensibly based on an incident that happened to the great philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in 1889, when he intervened to stop a cabman in Turin, Italy, from beating his horse, an incident that so traumatized the writer that he took to his bed, became demented, and lived the rest of his life in the care of his mother and sisters. The movie extrapolates from that event to show us the life of that cabman and to speculate on what might have driven him to his mistreatment of the animal. Could it be the numbing sameness and unrelenting brutality of his life that led him to his actions? And could Nietzsche be speaking through the neighbor who comes to visit but cannot convince the father of the truth of what he is saying?The stark landscape with its sparse vegetation and relentless, moaning wind becomes a major force in the drama as well as a key factor in these characters' lives.Tarr's direction is hypnotic and artful, to say the least, and there's no denying that the movie does cast a spell of sorts over its audience. That's good because, otherwise, it would essentially amount to two-and- a-half hours of watching people doing chores. But you'll definitely be happier with your own lot in life after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hoping the actual "end of the world" is this beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Turin Horse" is the end of the world, portrayed with an existentialist sensibility. To me, it's one of the best movies of all time.It's B&amp;W, which is appropriate for both its subject and the past time it portrays. The sound track combines diegetic sounds, spare music by Mihály Vig that's a mournful dirge in a style reminiscent of older Philip Glass, and just tiny bits of dialog. The setting is a run-down hovel and shed, apparently somewhere in Europe before 1900. An awful windstorm blows the whole time.The "feel" definitely derives from Nietzsche. The philosophy is not sketched out in any simple outline though. If you're looking to bone up on Philosophy 101, look elsewhere. The old man and his daughter who live in the hovel are obviously quite poor. They dress in barely adequate clothes, eat nothing but potatoes, and substitute a glass of brandy for breakfast food. The hovel has an uneven floor and no interior walls, most of what little furniture there is is very crude, the beds are lumpy, and the wood-burning cook-stove provides both the hot water and the heating as well as cooking the potatoes. A new hole for more ventilation and light has been knocked through a wall of the shed, but there's no glass in the irregular hole, and the stones that were removed are still tumbled about. Some scarecrows and a rake in the shed suggest they raise their own potatoes and straw; but nothing else, they are clearly not farmers.Words between the old man and his daughter are so few we wonder why: Do they no longer have anything at all to say? Is their habit to not talk hardly at all to _anybody_? Do they not like each other? One of the old man's arms won't move. He relies heavily on his daughter even for seemingly simple tasks like dressing, and despite his handicap works by driving a freight cart (which must be very hard for him to do well). His cart -apparently their sole source of income- is pulled by a sick old horse. The daughter is beyond marriageable age, but it doesn't much matter because there are obviously no suitors around anyway. Apparently nobody has planned for or given any thought to either extreme old age or a next generation. We know intellectually their situation is very precarious, that if anything at all goes wrong the whole thing will come apart.And something does go wrong: their horse starts dying. That alone would push them over the edge, but the sickening horse turns out to be a signal for the end of the entire world. The next six days are rather like the Genesis creation in reverse. They lose the water in their well, then sunlight, then lamplight, and eventually even fire.Béla Tarr, assisted by his partner and co-director Ágnes Hranitzky and his director of photography Fred Kelemen, uses his trademark very very long takes. Partly that's just his normal style, which probably echoes the very long sentences (several pages!) preferred by his writing collaborator, László Krasznahorkai. I found the long takes -besides just being an atypical stylistic choice- served some purposes. First, they give the viewer a first-hand experience of the monotony the story characters are mired in. And second, they introduce the viewer to characters and events very slowly in a very authentic way; this way the director doesn't need to "highlight" the most important aspects so you "get" them right away but instead can simply let you watch until you understand it all.There have been some comments to the effect both that this is Béla Tarr's last movie, and that this is not really the end of the _world_ but rather the end of the _movies_. Who knows, although watching "The Turin Horse", one can't help but get the feeling it really is a "last" movie. A general idea of this movie has apparently been floating around for a very long time, beginning clear back before Béla Tarr's and László Krasznahorkai's collaboration on "Sátántangó". The movie is much less depressing than it sounds, partly because watching the man and woman persist against all odds is so inspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The harsh winds and the inhospitable conditions outdoors are a metaphor for our planet and its degradation at our hands through pollution. The ingratitude with which he eats his potatoes and the unkind manner he treats his trusty horse makes the viewer aware of how little we appreciate natures gifts. Furthermore, this movie contains some of the most vivid and memorable potato eating scenes of modern cinema. ALthough the scenes may seem pointless the eating of the potatoes is the most poignant part of the movie, illustrating both the farmers relationship with his daughter or wife that made them for him, and showing us in our face how little we understand the things that truly matter in our life and on our plant. These scenes stick in the viewers mind and make one reflect on ones treatment of others and the appreciation of the little things in life, even if they are as simple as boiled tubers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Turin Horse -The greatest apocalyptic(spiritual apocalyptic) movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Joseph Heller record scenes in which their protagonists witness a cabman whipping a horse without mercy , in Crime and Punishment and Catch-22, respectively. These scenes are seminal moments in the mental breakdowns of those characters: Raskolnikov is moved by this absurdity, which comes to him in a dream, to spare the life of the pawnbroker; however, once he finds out that the pawnbroker treats her sister like a slave, and that she will be alone the next day, this momentary reversion to normative ethics comes to a halt. Yossarian is wandering the streets of Rome in a phantasmagorical state and sees a horse being beaten; this is part of his final separation from the war effort, just before Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn realize they have to send Yossarian home. These scenes are homage to the last thing that Friedrich Nietzsche did before going insane , intervening between a cab driver and the horse that the driver is beating. Nietzsche did this in the city of Turin , it is also the inspiration if Bela Tarr's film The Turin Horse.The film opens with a brief summary of Nietzsche's final sane deed and then moves to a shot of a decrepit horse dragging a cart down a road. This is just one of the lengthy, fluid takes in the movie that show the sheer artistry of the camera-work. However, in this film, the horse is not the one receiving the beating. Instead, it is the owner and his daughter. They are not beaten by literal truncheons or whips; instead, it is just the very nature of living that beats them down. There is no being, either famous or divine, who is willing to change things for the better for them. The six days that God took to create the world are mirrored in the six days over which this story unfolds.The setting of this film is intriguingly vague. It could take place now; it could have taken place before the Industrial Revolution. There is no running water or electricity in the house, but this farmhouse could be the work of a people like the Amish. The only real significant mention of time is the father's declaration that he has lived in that house for 58 years. Time is clearly something that one serves , rather than observe. There are very few actual events in the movie , they live an ascetic life. The father and daughter have one potato each for their meals. The daughter helps her father put on his clothes, as his right arm does not work. She brings the water from the well up to the house. This soporific rhythm is disrupted by the arrival of the neighbor, who has come to buy brandy. His lengthy diatribe about the ways life has lost its moral center is one of the focal points of the film. Later, some Gypsies come by looking for water; after that, things go back to the routine.Filmed in black and white, this film will quickly hypnotize most viewers. There is little that is visually appealing about this gray, gaunt world, although there are some memorable moments, as when the father points out that he no longer hears worms chewing their way through the wood, because he has reached the ability to concentrate through that noise to silence. This power of meditation is almost unheard of in the bustling times in which we live.The sheer artistry of this film comes from its unrelenting dissidence about the emptiness of modern existence. By having father and daughter refuse to enter our century, the director intimates that our century is not worth having, because while the existence of, say, 160 years ago, lacked modern conveniences and aesthetics, it featured interpersonal relationships that go far deeper than any list of Facebook friends or cell phone contacts ever can. The lingering message is that, as long as we have striven to make a successful and wealthy society, we have done little to make life full and rich.Find more film reviews at HTTP://greatest-movies.net/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is well-known. Nietzsche hugged this mistreated horse in the street and went insane. But that's often told. Nobody has taken interest in the other part.The farmer gets home. He lives with his daughter. They are waiting for destruction and become more and more aware of it. They even try to leave, because the horse is sick, but they can't. Their destiny is harsher than that of Nietzsche. For them it's a question of days.Very little talking and maybe a little too much is left to the viewer, although 2,5 hours move fast.

		<shortDescription>Minimalist Cinema as a Tool to Protest Indifference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Turin Horse is an ambitious piece of cinema which accomplishes a rare thing: it uses its form of cinema as an element within its context. This element brings a natural way to demonstrate an artist's reluctant final revision to the all that is told before. This form that is the minimalist cinema is mostly painful to watch. That's why I don't think someone can call this a "movie". Because we, as the form requires, rarely feel any movement of the camera like that Turin Horse it's still and determined not to move. The grace within the frame is mostly felt during its first minutes when the Turin Horse gallops and sometimes when the daughter moves around the house or brings water from the well? But mostly we are destined to watch the same frame for many annoying minutes. Even these little instances fade when the film loses its most crucial source: light. Of course this is an example of how an artist tries to communicate with its audience. Art doesn't have to be rewarding after all. Although I don't share director's pessimistic world of vision I think he created a coherent way to express his thoughts. To me this piece portrays a redefinition of minimalist cinema and the reason behind its inertia when you look at it from a theoretical point of view. It's a protest for the lack of grace and the frustrated efforts to make a difference on its current state.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hungarian screenwriter, producer and director Béla Tarr's ninth feature film which he co-directed with Hungarian film editor Ágnes Hranitzky and co-wrote with Hungarian writer László Krasznahorkai, premiered In competition at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival in 2011, was screened in the Masters section at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival in 2011, was shot on location in Hungary and is a Hungarian production which was produced by Hungarian producer Gábor Téni, French producers Marie Pierre Macia and Juliette Lepoutre, Swiss producer Ruth Waldburger and German producer Martin Hagemann. It tells the story about a middle-aged horse owner named Ohlsdorfer who lives in a house on a farm nearby a town in Turin, Italy with his daughter and a horse. A few days after having been stopped in the nearby town by Friedrich Nietzsche where he was whipping his horse because it didn't want to move, a windstorm bursts up and the man's horse becomes increasingly resistant and will neither move nor eat. Distinctly and precisely directed by Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the two main characters' viewpoints, draws a dense and ritualistic portrayal of six days in the lives of a father who mostly sits on a chair looking out of a window and his daughter who assists him getting dressed, goes to their well every single day and makes them dinner. While notable for its distinct and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling and low-keyed cinematography by German cinematographer Fred Kelemen, production design, costume design by costume designer Breckl János and use of sound, colors and light, this narrative-driven story about human existence where two isolated people who are living a repetitive lifestyle and who have been living together for many years are waiting for the weather and their horse to become better, depicts three interrelated and internal studies of character and contains a poignant and timely score by Hungarian composer Mihály Vig. This observational, austere and poetic drama triangle which is set in Italy during a spring in the late 19th century and where the similarities between two human beings and a horse becomes more and more apparent, their lives more and more challenging and hope increasingly intangible as the wind grows stronger and stronger, is impelled and reinforced by its stringent narrative structure, subtle character development, rhythmic continuity, distinct atmosphere, silent and contemplating characters, long and philosophical speech, describing voice-over narration, dark and mysterious undertones, the internally and externally expressionistic acting performances by Hungarian actor János Derzsi and Hungarian actress Erika Bók and the fine acting performance by Hungarian actor Mihály Kormos. An existentialistic, cinematographic and majestic statement from an accomplished auteur filmmaker which gained, among other awards, the Grand Jury Prize at the 61st Berlin Film Festival in 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Turin Horse - great artistic film by a great film maker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies often afford us the opportunity to experience things we otherwise would not experience in our own lifetimes. We can live many lifetimes through movies. Movies are an art form and a great film is one that is an involving experience that is real, let's you live and breathe the experience depicted in the film. Bela Tarr is a great film maker who has shown us some very realistic and impacting imagery in his films.The message of this film is that life is a struggle, often tedious and boring, and sometimes unjust. The film is boring as you live the lives in the movie, because the movie depicts life as boring. The film is great from an artistic vantage because it enables you to live the tediousness. You live in a hard world where the greatest pleasure is looking out of a window to view a desolate environment. But the film makes you feel such desolation, tediousness, loneliness, and hardship.There is very little dialog except for one monologue by a visitor in which he ventilates his frustrations with the problems in the world, in an abstract and disorganized manner. But this corresponds to the main message of the film.The artistic value of the film is in providing the viewer with a realistic experience. However, this experience is not fun, exciting, action-packed, or need-fulfilling, and that will turn off most viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ornamented with elements of Bresson's Balthazaar, Tarkovsky's Nostalghia and The Sacrifice, Bergman's The Seventh Seal, and Beckett's Waiting for Godot, this almost unbearably beautiful film stands as Tarr's simplest and most enigmatic. Here, the wind is music and Tarr's familiar film score from Mihály Víg becomes a kind of sweet pain killer. Deadly serious, but not without great suspense, The Turin Horse opens a window to the decay of a world that knew better days. The mother is gone, the other horse has died (or maybe was stolen), the father's right arm that built this magnificent stone barn and house has expired, the bird cage is empty. And it is sad, this last film from Bela Tarr. It's like death: mine, yours, the world's, the cinema's. Without light, how can those images be projected? But, what are the daughter and father watching but a movie? Theirs is a kind of patience, but like the great Tibetan meditation master Chogyam Trungpa said, it is perhaps a patience without wisdom, without clarity in which, after time, people crack. Perhaps the characters are caught in a net of forbearance. Does the camera eye free us? Are we then able to transform forbearance into intelligent patience? Should we watch ourselves watching movies? And at the end, is the light of our minds enough? Thank you, Bela Tarr, for sharing your vision of life with us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is shown in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio, and its subtitles are white on black for the German and Hungarian languages spoken. As for the DVD features, they are solid. The first is s brief 12 minute short film Tarr made in 1978, called Hotel Magnezit which depicts an aging alcoholic who is persecuted by unknown others for alleged wrongdoings. It is not in good shape, visually, and the acting is very poor, to say the least. It's at best, a misfire. Then there is a near 50 minute long press conference at the Berlinale Film Festival, wherein Tarr, his three main actors, and his technical collaborators, answer question from an international group of reporters. While there are a few moments of insight, the stark contrast between the depths of the film and the insipidities of the assorted reporters makes for many awkward moments, where the viewer feels sorry for the questioner and senses the artists' frustrations. There is also the theatrical trailer, and a small booklet with a very poorly written and teeth-gnashingly trite essay, called Brute Existence: The Turin Horse, on the film by American film critic J. Hoberman. Finally there is an audio commentary by another notoriously bad American film critic, Jonathan Rosenbaum, that is one of the worst that you will ever encounter. It truly does seem that the Golden Age of DVD commentaries is at an end. Aside from the fact that the commentary has silent gaps, it also only runs less than half the length of the film because, as Rosenbaum says early on, he thinks the film needs no commentary. So, then why agree to do the damned thing? Let someone with more enthusiasm take over. As for the actual commentary? It's rather pathetic, for Rosenbaum adds almost nothing original, instead mostly reading others' critical opinions on the film, and then even relying on biographical and career information on Tarr from, of all places, the always unreliable Wikipedia. It's truly an astonishing train wreck of a commentary- one which Rosenbaum calls his first solo commentary, and hopefully, for the cineastes out there, what will be his last commentary. Aside from the absolute lack of anything meaningful to say on the film, Rosenbaum's nasal, screechy voice is a turn-off, but even more so is his constant pimping of his own career, and the fact that he is going to be teaching, in 2013 at a new film school Tarr is opening in Croatia. About the only positives that one can say of Rosenbaum's nearly 70 minutes of speaking is that he makes two salient points that few other critics have noticed: 1) that despite being labeled anti-Hollywood, Tarr's films are often shot on sets, and Rosenbaum claims this film was also shot on a soundstage. 2) He acknowledges that Tarr's camera is always doing something interesting to offset the seeming repetition of the activities the characters engage in, and this counterpoint between action and depiction helps craft a grand narrative from what seems to be little material. Other than these two points, Rosenbaum's relentless need to posit himself as an insider into indy film circles, and his utter lack of insight into the film at hand, make listening to the commentary a chore.While the film was much honored at a number of the international film festivals it was shown at, it did not make the list for best Foreign Picture Oscars in America (surprise, surprise). Yet, despite this snub, The turin Horse is yet another great film in Tarr's canon, at least equal to Damnation and Satantango, clearly superior to The Man From London, even if it likely falls a bit shy of Tarr's greatest film, Werckmeister Harmonies. It is a brutally great work of realism in an oddly closed universe consisting of one windy plain (see the scene where the pair try to leave their home, only to wind up right back in it). Near the end of the film, the unnamed daughter asks of her father, or perhaps rhetorically (it does not matter), What is all this darkness?Let me answer: it is art, child. Art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching a horse for 2 and a half hours would probably be about as thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I had heard some peculiar things about this film that did put me off slightly. I heard that it was two and a half hours in length and only had 30 shots. Don't get me wrong, I love a long take as much as the next fat person, but 30 in 150 minutes sounded excessive and potentially tedious. I also heard that the film had no plot at all and just followed an old man and his daughter going about their day-to-day business, which put me off. However, The Turin Horse had such rave reviews from everyone who had seen it. The imagery did look beautiful, and I was really looking forward to experiencing something unique and new. Unfortunately my fears were pretty much met.It is probably one of the most boring films I've seen. Like Uzak, it's Hungarian, and if I've learnt anything from Hungarian films it's that Hungary must be the most lifeless place on Earth. The Turin Horse actually manages to outdo Uzak in terms of boring characters, and gives us THE two most boring characters on the planet. A grunting father and daughter who live in the middle of nowhere and only speak when they have something to grumble about. If these two met up for coffee with the two brothers from Uzak, I could only imagine the stimulating, jovial conversation that would flow between them!The Turin Horse is hardcore art-house. I'm into art-house films when they offer some sort of story of experience. I just can't get my head around films where literally nothing happens. Some people find art in watching the mundane activities of life, but I'm afraid that it just does not interest me. For me, The Turin Horse was basically the same short film being repeated six times, as it takes place over six very long days. It goes like this: They get up, the daughter dresses her father because he's far too boring to dress himself, she goes out to the well and fills up some buckets, brings them in. Then they have a muck about with the most tragically lifeless horse you've ever seen (I think boredom catches), and then they eat a potato and go to bed. Repeat. I didn't find anything "mesmerising" or "gripping" in these activities, as many reviewers have stated.Whatever you do, don't believe the DVD's blurb! The blurb actually makes it sound like a really interesting apocalyptic thriller. It says that the film has left audiences "gasping for breath" which was obviously just mistaken for audiences being rudely woken up when the film had finally finished. Apparently there are "a bizarre series of disturbing events" unless this counts the arrival of some gypsies who get shooed away by the father, because they obviously brought far too much life to the film. The "terrifying, all-consuming finale" may be all-consuming but it's not that terrifying. A better blurb would say, "Imagine a film which captures the boring, daily routine of your own life and amplify it by ten thousand."However, The Turin Horse isn't all bad. Yes it has nothing going for it in terms of plot or characters (something I consider as the most important aspect of a film, especially one at 150 minutes long), but there's no denying how outstandingly beautiful the film looks. It looked so promising when it opened and I was hoping that all my fears would be dashed! It opens with a five minute take of the Turin horse pulling a wagon with the father on, but thanks to the beautifully fluid camera-work it's anything but boring! The way the camera floated around the fog reminded me a bit of Gaspar Noe's visual spectacle, Enter the Void, a film I consider to be the absolute best on a visual level. On top of that there was a wonderful haunting score featuring very melancholic violins and an organ, a score that would drop in and out of the film regularly, and a score which I liked greatly.The imagery and music are the only redeeming features. Sometimes the film looked like a moody painting, painted in ink. There's no denying how atmospheric the whole thing looked, and the fact that all the scenes were done in one uninterrupted take is highly impressive. Even if there are no interesting actions being filmed, I did like the way the camera would move from one perfectly framed shot to another so effortlessly. I especially loved the haunting shot of the daughter sitting out looking out the window like a desperately lonely ghost. I also did like the dread-filled ending where the father carries on his boring life regardless of a total apocalyptic blackout.For some people this is enough. For some, masterful direction, atmosphere, a beautifully melancholic score and gorgeous visuals and cinematography is enough to warrant labelling a film a masterpiece. However, for me I require more. You can have the most beautiful visuals in the world, but if you don't give a fig about who's in them or what's going on in them, then they don't really mean much. The Turin Horse is totally and utterly plot-less, pointless and outrageously laborious. It's one of the most boring things I've seen, but it is also beautifully made. There's no denying Bela Tarr's talent as a director, and if he had a real plot then he would be extremely powerful, but this has no plot. So if your into watching drips eating potatoes through the lens of a masterful director, then you might just be in luck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extraordinary, mesmerizing, spellbinding are some of the adjectives I would use to describe Bela Tarr's apocalyptic masterpiece "The Turin Horse". The script by Tarr and Laszlo Krasznahorkai largely eschews dialogue choosing instead to focus on the day to day activities of an old cabman and his daughter perfectly played by Janos Derzsi and Erika Bok. The pair are confined to an isolated cabin and facing a landscape of famine and unrelenting storms. Staring out the window they can only ask themselves if this is some punishment from God or have we brought this fate on ourselves. Tarr obviously has great empathy for people forced to endure what he refers to as "the heaviness of life" captured by his camera in a series of long tracking shots with minimal editing to enhance the sense of realism. The great work of cinematographer Fred Kelemen and Mihaly Vig's haunting score add to the film's impact. I don't think "The Turin Horse" got the respect it deserved last year at Cannes or this year when it incredibly didn't make the cut for a Best Foreign Language Oscar nomination and I can only expect the film's stature to increase over time.Obviously this is not your traditional movie and if you need a plot-driven film this isn't for you but if you're in the market for a different type of cinema I think you'll find this a unique and special experience. It's an allegory and a warning that perhaps our time is running out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very impressed by art movie from Hungary's Bela Tarr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>History has it that famous German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche had his final mental breakdown in 1889 after he saw a horse being brutally whipped in the Italian city of Turin. This movie, despite its title and what some of the press material said, has nothing to do with that particular episode. In a windswept, cloudy, barren plain (the movie is clearly not set in Italy), an old man and his grown daughter live in a solitary ramshackle cabin, along with a work horse. We see them do their repetitive daily chores (for instance, she cooking or helping her father put on his clothes), barely speaking a word. Despite the accolades it received from some critics, this black and white, almost silent movie, seems rather pointless to me. As an exercise of style is does show some talent from the part of the director, but the film ultimately seems to have nothing to say (unless the movie is about the repetitive, pointless lives of many people in the lower rungs of society, but you can make a film about that theme without recurring to such artsy, off putting mannerisms). The director, Hungary's Bela Tarr, is a darling of the most avant garde film critics. I haven't seen many of his films; his previous one, The Man from London, was equally opaque, but marginally more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this movie yesterday, and although some of my favourite films are European / auteur ones, I've never seen anything by Béla Tarr, so my expectations were high. And I left the room somewhat disappointed, because I learned little or nothing that wasn't included in the synopsis. OK, it's the end of the world. But that's more or less what I read / predicted in the synopsis. The film is slow but rarely there are static shots, because the camera is almost always on the move (mainly slowly, but moving). So, I don't get what this movie brings to the "end of the world" thematic. Concerning that, I would see again "Melancholia". Technically, sometimes this reminded me of Tarkovsky (mostly "Stalker"). I've counted the shots and it came to 28 (of course I can have miscounted them), with smooth transitions, and, again, it seems a well done job. But a movie isn't mainly about technique, it's about getting something out of it at the end. And I got nothing, apart from what I knew from the start...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the lately very popular "end of the world" theme is used with a bit of more originality, excusing in part the abuse of this cheapshot technique of bringing down the entire humanity every time you have a death-0-fobia attack.There is no Hollywood bang here, with its comforting "quick and painless" but nonetheless visually spectacular death to the world, but the Universe dies slowly and unimpressively, a slow decay to the absolute halt of matter that eventually deteriorates time itself. The last 6 days of the World, although summarized in 2 hours and a half give the viewer the impression of a little eternity.The cinematography is good, not much to add to other reviewers comments.However there are some inconsistencies in the characters: in many ways, they seem to have given up the fight. The apparent resilience of the father who insists to the very end that "we have to eat" is just a reflex, part of the routine, not a rationalized struggle for survival, for a breakthrough. And all this is in line with the outside world. BUT, at the same time there is a huge amount of anger and frustration in both of them. An endless hatred to the world but not the slightest sign of love left to each other, this one must have died long before the movie started. On the contrary, hatred is very clear in the unnatural way they interact. And this is not slow decay, but an accumulation that paradoxically will not have the time to burst by the end of the movie/world. The girl is still able to love but channels it only towards the picture of her late mother, but the father is hopeless in this sense, he converts all his potato and palinka fueled energy into distilled hatred.And don't know if at the end of the neighbor's speech, he refers at the entire speech as rubbish(as most of reviewers see it) or only at the latest part of it where the neighbor expresses hope that things will revert, that the oppressed will rise. The later makes more sense to me.</fullReview>

However I think personally that this is just as useless as a modernist painting for understanding anything. You can daydream at this movie and layer your own perceptions onto it, but in the end its a long boring slog which, judging by the reviews, may cause you to hallucinate that it was the best movie ever.I give it a few extra stars for the fact that it caused most IMDb reviewers to temporarily lose their minds.

There wasn't a single action during 2 and a half hour ! And when something did happen ( for example, a group of gypsies or something like that ) , it was right away forgotten and they were back at eating potatoes, dressing up, fetching water, not talking. It was painfully dull, it was worse that routine !! Maybe that was the all point, portraying what a dull insignificant life most people have and if so, why would you like that ? Why would you like to be reminded of your own insignificance ? Why watching some girl cleaning up stables, dressing up her father, doing boring stuff is fascinating to watch ?

		<shortDescription>Decent entry point for non Tarr fans--if you can deal with this, you're prob read for his others.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm only semi familiar with Mr. Tarr's previous films--I am however familiar with the style that is apparently present in all of his films--(long formal takes of very deliberate and precise actions set to a mournful, apocalyptic mood creating a slowly paced to the point of hypnotizing aura about the film.) so I knew thankfully what i was getting into when i decided to check this out. I thought it was honestly just OK as a film, however as a point for non Tarr fans to check his style out it would probably serve as a solid primer. The story (what story there is) is about this older couple trying to survive a week in their little run down shack while a storm rages outside. The structure of the movie is that you see the husband and wife get up and perform the exact same tasks with each passing day--they get up, she gets water from the well and boils potatoes, he shovels manure and chops wood, repeat again and again. Because the two of them work together--they're both able to survive the very windy storm happening outside the shack--in fact there is a significant amount of wind in this movie--reminds me of that one "Mad About You' episode where guest star Yoko Ono has Paul Resier trying to film the wind--and wondering how do you film wind--just wind. (yes this was an actual episode!) Paul would've learned by watching this i think!While i think i understood the larger meaning (the breakdown of society/civilization/humanity that can happen because of a current crisis--or is it happening before the crisis itself???) it doesn't make it easier to watch the same actions happen as you watch scene after scene after scene of the exact same thing happening with little varying difference. (The two sequences that feature huge differences however are quite funny tho--i might have been the only one in the theater to do so, but i did laugh out loud at the whole sequence of the gypsies wandering onto the old couple's premises and the husband's reaction to this unwanted trespass) While i liked how the two of them work together creating a rather nice system--the 2 of them have a very nice system worked out that once the crisis passes goes completely out of whack leading to well the ending--which leads me to wonder just what the couple's relationship was like before this windstorm came passing thru.I think longtime fans of Tarr may be disappointed in that there doesn't seem to be anything earth shattering happening here--but maybe that's exactly what longtime fans of his want. I feel its actually a bit of a comedown from "The Man From Nowhere" which tried to merge Tarr's style to a classic noir story at least, from what i understand (and could make through) Satantango--this seems to be more rigidly in line with what people expect from him. While the film is as beautifully shot as you could possibly want a gorgeous black and white movie to be (that opening sequence with the horse is a real beauty) after a while i think you either have to roll with it and wait until the final day happens (and the implications that the final day brings with it) or decide to mentally check out completely. (if you do decide to mentally check out, at least have the good sense to wait until after the nice drunken monologue delivered by a friend or passerby who comes through, drinks, and delivers a rather scathing critique on humanity today...it might not be much in the larger sense of the film but its a pretty accurate portrayal of a drunk guy's rambling.)</fullReview>

The wind sound loops, the music loops and the plot drags on like a funeral march for 2.5 miserable hours. The trees and the grass in the background don't move in the gale force wind. It's like these two schmucks have their own personal dust storm that follows them wherever they go.

		<shortDescription>Alcoholic Eyes: Tarr is Intellectually and Morally Bankrupt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raskolnikov, the anti-hero and protagonist of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, has a dream of a horse being beaten to death by its drunken owner and bystanders as it is forced to pull a load that it cannot pull (Part One, Chapter Five). In the dream Raskolnikov is a little boy who cries for them to stop. It represents his innate Christian compassion, which he has to suppress in order to commit murders, in order for him to assert his will and reason.Raskolnikov prefigured Nietzsche. He tried to fashion himself into a Nietzschian Superman (based on Napoleon), above morality, above guilt, above society, immune to Christian charity, who could exercise his naked will to power, superior to all men who were constrained by mere values and compassion for their fellow man. So it is sadly and very fittingly ironic that Nietzsche, by expressing compassion for an abused horse, in the end himself broke down and gave into Christian pity, when all his life he claimed to be above and did all he could to negate such "weakness." Let us not forget that Nietzsche led directly to Hitler. Contrary to what "scholars" claim, Hitler WAS a Nietzschian Superman, literally lifted off the pages of Beyond Good and Evil and The Genealogy of Morals. Let us not forget that the moral nihilism of Nietzsche also led to existentialism, which is really the negation of morality by the French, a rationalization and philosophical justification of French moral cowardice, in the wake of French collaboration with the Nazis.So now we have this broken down Bohemian hipster, Bela Tarr, who, with rotten teeth and alcoholic eyes, dressed in fashionable black, wears his existential despair like a fashion accessory (see DVD extra of interview of Tarr at Berlin Film Festival). He misunderstands the meaning of Nietzsche's breaking down and crying for a horse. He doesn't get that Nietzsche's breaking down gives the lie to the anti-Christian, pagan Superman entirely.So now we have this European hipster, Tarr, a dyed-in-the-wool existential atheist, making a movie about, of all things, the End of Days. Like Nietzsche, he ironically, unwittingly capitulates to the Christianity he has spent all his life negating. The joke is on him.Just as Nietzsche led to Hitler, the moral vacuity of Tarr's existentialism and fashionable posture of impotent despair fits in perfectly with the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Hungary and Europe. A culture which coddles such bankrupt artistic elites, which celebrates such a morally and intellectually vacuous filmmaker, certainly cannot protect the innocents in its midst from the oldest, most barbaric human hate. Night has truly descended on Tarr and Hungary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Spoilers here... didn't make it to the end of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film during the Mumbai Film Festival and given it a '6' because of the amazing cinematography. But the movie per se is painstakingly slow and disembroiling. It's like watching paint dry or water melt to ice in slow-motion. Of course, some people may find ice melting into water beautiful, but would you watch it again and again and again? This almost silent film is kinda "moving", yes it moves you out of the cinema hall. In fact, it is inspiring too, so much that i had to come online and write a review to warn some of you who do not like superslow drama. The only engaging moment in this film you might enjoy is the cinematography. Clearly, this was'nt for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring like hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if you enjoy listening to the noise of wind for two hours and watching a black-and-white chalet and people mostly sitting and eating potato ... this is your film. Apart from watching the nothingness happening, you can see really disgusting things like torturing an old horse. An old man is either lying in bed in the same clothe he wears during the day or shouting at the poor girl who is with him. She is either making baked potatoes or putting wood into the stove. You also can watch them eating one of the two potatoes. It is hot. Very interesting! or they drink water. And get out of the little wooden house and make the horse run. This lasts for two hours. It is pretended to be art. I may gets the Oscar... For sane people this is simply a painful, boring time after which you feel the world is very rude to you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to convey exactly how boring this film is. Here's a suggestion: take a big pot of water, put it on the stove, turn the heat to low and watch. Your time will be much better spent than the two and a half hours I wasted watching this movie. If inmates at Guantanamo had been forced to watch this, they could rightfully be suing for unwarranted torture. The blather about Nietzsche is irrelevant to movie, and the apocalyptic subtext unfolds about five wasted days too late. The only reason for two stars is the music - it's haunting and mesmerizing, but even its appeal wanes after you've heard it for the seventh or eighth time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, painful and stuck in the 1920s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please do not believe the IMDb rating for this film. Its terrible.The opening scene is well filmed with some interesting angles and camera techniques, but is one continual shot lasting about 5mins. From there on the film goes downhill, getting slower and slower and more and more basic. One of the final scenes consists of a practically still shot filmed through a window, again lasting at least 5 mins, and barely anything happens. The characters walk out of shot, and come back in to shot. Thats it.Don't get me wrong, the story is quite clever, but it could have been told in 30mins, as it is the film feels like it lasts a lifetime.Several people walked out of our screening. We almost did. Unless you enjoy having boredom and depression forced through your eyeballs then this is one to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring, depressive and non-sense 146-minute-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The catchword for this movie was Nietzsche. As a big fan of Nietzsche I hoped to find a good elaboration of this great philosopher's thoughts in this movie. One sure can find grains of Nietzsche thoughts, but do not go to this movie with my assumption. The director of the movie warned us before the movie started and said "don't applaud my work before it starts, this is my most radical work ever." Yes, the best word for to describe this movie is "radical." I bet this was the most boring, depressive and non-sense 146-minute-movie in the history of cinema. Few people can criticize my thoughts for not being intellectual enough to understand the depth and the beauty of storytelling of this movie, but I would like to save the 99 percent of the movie viewers' time, money and energy. I guess the director of the movie wanted to something in his spare time, but neither the director nor the ones who financially supported the movie and chose to be in the film festivals have the right to torture the viewers and the soul of great philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.</fullReview>
