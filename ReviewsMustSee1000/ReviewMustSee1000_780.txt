		<shortDescription>An incomplete masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being forced to self-exile by the Spanish Civil War, Spaniard director Luis Bu?uel moved to Mexico, and found in the country's struggling film industry the freedom he had so long desired. In the late 50s, and after a decade of making some of the best Mexican movies ever mad, he met Gustavo Alatriste and his wife, actress Silvia Pinal. Alatriste was very interested in Bu?uel's cinema and decided to produce Bu?uel's movies with Pinal as main actress. This partnership gave Bu?uel even more freedom than before, and resulted in three of the most interesting and controversial films of his career. "Viridiana", "El Ángel Extreminador" and this movie, "Simón del Desierto", form a trilogy where Bu?uel criticizes mercilessly, but with humor, the hypocrisy of the high society, the government and of course, religion.Simón (Claudio Brook) is a deep religious man who decided that to be closer to God, he should remain alone in a column, living as an hermit practicing asceticism, in order to escape from the world's temptations. Soon Simón becomes to be regarded as a Saint, and people from all over the region come to hear him speak, and witness his miracles. Satan (Silvia Pinal) visits Simón too, in an attempt to tempt Simón with the earthly pleasures that Simón has decided to leave behind. However, the Devil is probably the lesser of Simón's problems, as his own elitist position as an outsider makes him to discover the truth behind organized religion, and so he begins question the nature of what he does, and more importantly, what he believes.Written by Luis Bu?uel and Julio Alejandro (Bu?uel's collaborator in "Nazarín" and "Viridiana"), the story of "Simón del Desierto" is loosely based on the real life story of Saint Simeon Stylites, a monk who like Simón, decided to spent his days at the top of a pillar. "Simon del Desierto" parodies St. Simeon's story in a wonderful satire about the way Saints are seen and venerated by the religious people. Using the character of Simón, Bu?uel explores the human side of religion and with a good dose of humor, he completely exposes his views on it, making a sharp criticism not on religion itself, but on religious organizations and their blind and passive followers, who in Bu?uel's eyes, become more and more dehumanized the closer they get to God.In many ways, "Simón del Desierto" works like a slow and fascinating descend into one of Bu?uel's surreal nightmares. With a beautiful cinematography by the legendary Gabriel Figueroa, the movie feels initially as a real biopic of the Saint's life, but the portrait of dignity that Bu?uel seems to be creating with Simon soon discovers itself as an absurd, as Simón's exaggerated Holiness proves to be as corrupting as the Devil's temptations, and through a series of visions Bu?uel breaks the realistic tone and smoothly turns the movie into a surreal madness apparently mimicking the dehumanization of the Saint. The madness concludes in one of Bu?uel's most strange finales ever, inviting the audience to make their own conclusions about the movie, and about sainthood.Claudio Brook and Silvia Pinal are basically the main cast of the film, and their work together is really amazing. A very underrated actor, Brook is very convincing, and very funny too, making Bu?uel's character come to life and carrying the film with natural ease and powerful presence. Brook delivers his lines with dignity and power, as if he was really being an actor in a biography of the Saint (Ironically, he would play Jesus in two films after "Simón del Desierto"). Silvia Pinal is very good as the Devil, although not as impressive as she was in "Viridiana", she delivers an excellent performance as the erotic representation of Satan. The supporting cast is very small, and have very limited screen time, but overall they do a good job. Jesús Fernández shines in the small role of a dwarf goatherd who seems to know more than what his humble looks tell.The movie is probably one of the most interesting films of Bu?uel, but at the same time one of the most troubled, as the low budget couldn't allow him better production values. But the worse flaw occurred because in a very unfortunate incident, Alatriste was unable to complete the funding of Bu?uel's film, so the director was forced to stop the film's production and make a quick ending. The bizarre finale of the movie is very simplistic and feels horribly rushed; breaking the pace of the story in a very bad way. Still, even when the rushed ending damages the movie a lot, at least it gives an idea of what Bu?uel's intentions with the film were.While the movie was never completed the way Bu?uel desired, "Simón del Desierto" is equally as good as the master's better known films, and it also offers the chance to understand the ideology of the man known as "master of surrealism". The excellent performances, Figueroa's beautiful photography and Bu?uel's superb direction are definitely the ingredients for a masterpiece, and this modest movie, incomplete as it is, it's definitely one. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Bu?uel's films even if it's not complete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is maybe one of the best films that Bu?uel ever made although not among the most popular. Why? Because the production was shot faster than fast and the money ran out so the film couldn't complete the screenplay and art direction is poor. Besides there is the cultural fact, you need some religious background (Catholic if possible) to understand the irony of the film and the references. Humour differs from drama mainly in it's strong connection with time and environment while the latter is more transcultural and timeless. Bu?uel had a deep religious knowledge although he lacked faith. The reason why the rock scene is so is that Bu?uel didn't like rock. Sometimes people prefer Bu?uel's French films because they look more glamorous, the caracters are more sophisticated and wearing richer clothes. Anyway I think the core of his filmography are his 'hispanic' films and the first ones ('l'age d'or', 'le chien andalou', Él, Los Olvidados, Viridiana, Tristana,...).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bunel's most entertaining movies. Full of witty surprises and black comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Simon Of The Desert' was made in between two of Bunuel's most admired movies 'Diary Of A Chambermaid' and 'Belle De Jour'. It rarely gets mentioned but I think it's one of Bunuel's most entertaining movies. Claudio Brook and Silvia Pinel who had both appeared in 'The Exterminating Angel' star. Brook (who later appeared in the astonishing Mexican nunsploitation classic 'Alucarda') plays the saintly Simon who denies himself earthy pleasures and stands on top of a tall pillar. Pinal (best remembered for the title role in Bunuel's classic 'Viridiana') plays The Devil, who tries various tricks and arguments to tempt the self-righteous Simon, culminating in an unexpected trip into the future. I believe I'm right in saying that the financing ran out making this movie 45 minutes instead of a full length feature. I don't think that was a bad thing, it just goes for the right length, never outstaying its welcome. It's typical Bunuel full of witty surprises and black comedy. I enjoyed it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous fun from legendary Bunuel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The strange and unforgettable conclusion of Luis Bunuel's classic Simon of the Desert sneaks up on viewers so quickly that most react with some kind of surprise or shock that the film has come to an end. Only forty-five minutes, the story of the pillar-perching ascetic defies the conventions of the short film format and unfolds like a fully developed feature. Laugh-out-loud hilarious, the movie bursts with inventive visual gags and clever writing, along with Bunuel's trademark knack for knockout surrealist images. But it doesn't stop there; Bunuel's direction is a tour-de-force (I love the dizzying angles from Simon's lofty elevation intercut with the views of the people below).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema's tallest soapbox</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The funding for this gleefully blasphemous feature was pulled before the film was completed, resulting in an abrupt and not quite satisfying ending. Still, what's left is a little slice of heaven (pun intended) with some of its directors most direct and powerful attacks on the clergy he made a career of hating. Bunuel here presents us with an ascetic so self-involved that he declines to embrace his own mother; he restores the hands to a peasant who immediately uses them to strike his own child; he prides himself on eating only lettuce, mentioning it often and to anyone who will listen. "Simon" is a good-looking film, too, with a visual landscape that echoes its protagonist's austerity and startling surreal touches -- such as a coffin that slides through the desert scrub to the base of the column atop which Simon spends his years -- that recall the glory days of "L'Age d'Or." It might have been a masterpiece had Bunuel been allowed the full scope of his vision; it's a major film as is. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short movie about an anchorite on a column by the master Luis Bu?uel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This surrealist film is based on St. Simon Stylites who lived circa A.D. 400. He was a ragged ascetic (well played by a bearded Claudio Brook) who spent thirty-seven years atop a seventy-foot pillar preaching to Christian flocks and avoiding temptation . As he is tempted by the devil (a beauty Silvia Pinal) under various forms.This rare movie is largely considered a Luis Bu?uel's masterpiece. It's a comic parable about a tattered anchorite with some humor and hilarious criticism to Catholic Church. After returning his native country, Spain, by making 'Viridiana' but this film was prohibited on the grounds of blasphemy, then Bu?uel with his screenwriter Julio Alejandro go back Mexico where realizes in low budget 'Simon of the desert' and produced by Gustavo Alatriste. Good and atmospheric cinematography by excellent Mexican cameraman Gabriel Figueroa. Religious music for a pilgrim hymn and of course 'the drums of Calanda', Luis Bu?uel's location of birth . This movie won deservedly the Special Jury Prize at the 1965 Venice Film Festival. Nice strange story for Luis Bu?uel aficionados, being hauled by some reviewers as one of the best short film - forty minutes- ever made. Rating : Above average, worthwhile watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a plum of a little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is one of the ultimate tales in Christian parody-parables: Luis Bunuel, who partially made a career out of ridiculing (though in good dramatic/comedic measure) the church, made this film about a man (Simon of the title) who stands a-top a column to get closer to God. He gains the total attention and praise (and prayer) of the locals, who visit him daily. But a problem confronts him in the form of Satan, or rather a sultry seductress, bringing him temptations galore. When she finally brings her torment upon him to the ultimate, it takes him to the most unusual of places (in particular unusual for a Bunuel film, who mostly has his films of this period set in the early 20th or 19th century).This is indeed one of the director's most carefully controlled and sometimes cringe-inducing black comedies, one that starts off so dramatically and sincerely I thought I was watching a different Bunuel- it's at first reverent and thoughtful, and if I was a Christian I would've been very moved. But as the story then progressed I noticed the utter absurdity of it all- in a way this is like a long Monty Python sketch only done with a boat-load more of subtlety to Simon's plight. This is a man in total conflict, portrayed well by Claudio Brook, very straight-faced or trying to through it all. The Devil as well, Silvia Pinal, is excellent in eliciting these dark emotions out of Simon, who has to be literally a pillar of strength for these people.The climax of the film, which you will know if you read the film's plot summary here, is one of the superb strokes of genius in any film from Bunuel- at first sight of what he does in his transition of the story is outrageous (in the best possible way), then when it settles into its manic drive of the sequence it's hilarious, then exhilarating, and then finally something that is underlying in many of Bunuel's films- hipness. It's a whole collision of emotions that come with this scene, and it works as a fitting end to this strange, funny allegory-cum-satire of quasi-religious figures and their worshipers. If you find this film in your video store or browsing around online, it's worth to check out for a 45 minute view into the mind of the religious side of Bunuel: wicked, knowing, and in an ironic and touching way very understanding of what these people went through in those old times and what continues today in decadence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may be flawed slightly and only deserve a 9 1/2 but there are many wonderful and very funny things going on here: the way the austere atmosphere established at the beginning soon shows it's actual absurd nature, the weird atonal renderings of the religious tunes, the sudden appearances and transformations of the Devil, the gags - like the coffin swiftly rolling across a field to the accompaniment of modern military drumbeats (fine counterpoint to the tone of religious piety), the sly dialog. In answer to some peasants seeking guidance in his saintliness, Simone responds "Oh ye, poor of body and mind...".Gabriel Figueroa was one of the cinema's greatest cameramen and his work shines here. The high angle views from the pedestal give a great visual thrust to both Simon's high-mindedness and lofty contempt. The clarity and austerity of the black and white shooting cozily underscore a lucid exposition on the futility of asceticism.The film starts out looking like a serious paean set in the 1400's, with period costumes and music; and ends mid 20th century, in a post beatnik dive . The transforming cut takes us straight to the the denouement. In it's abruptness and the length of time leaped through, it is maybe one of the most ambitious cuts ever effected in film (along with Kubrick's jump at the beginning of "Space Oddysey" from the tossed bone/weapon in ape-ancestor times to the gracefully waltzing space ship in 2001). Some see this as a defect made necessary by the sudden disappearance of financial support. Yet great directors know how to use the inherent flexibility of film to manipulate the spectator in time and space, to bolster their art, even when things turn out unexpectedly.Though it might have been better at full feature length, Bunuel did a wonderful job with the sudden ending. Even if it is jarring, the film still feels quite complete. Perhaps it's even a blessing - whoops, no pun intended - especially today in this era of films that last two plus hours followed by a half hour of credits. (Why not make a film about the making of the credits on a ultra long movie like "lord of the rings"?) Maybe the abruptness even reinforces the message of futility in that the devil wins earlier than one usually expects in mainstream length movies. Recall that other Bunuel works are seldom overly long and a few of his early films were also quite short (L'Age d'Or, 60 minutes, Tierra sin Pan, 30m, Chien Andalou, 16 m), yet very effective.As mentioned in a few posts, Bunuel, and especially this film (also Milky Way and Phantom of Liberty) is without question an important inspiration for the Monty Python anti-clerical themes. While Python, which is dry British made-for-TV shtick, can be quite funny in its way, Bunuel's work is far richer in visual style, imagination and execution. It is some of the most intelligent and satisfying filmaking one can see.That Simone's fall is represented by a trip to a 60's disco-tech may not necessarily mean that the disco symbolizes sin. It may instead perhaps be telling us that even if we don't have many ascetics anymore, modern taste can be so dreadful that we have our own hell on earth. Really too bad that this little gem is so hard to find, when we can easily have high quality digital clones of many overlong monstrosities.For those who see this film, or Bunuel, as trivial, overrated or pretentious, perhaps, like Simone, you too excrete dryly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simon of the Desert (1965) **** (out of 4) Bizarre "religious" film from Luis Bunuel is one of the best I've seen from him. Simon (Claudio Brook) climbs a column in the desert to be closer to God but soon has Satan try to tempt him with earthly pleasures. To give anything else away would ruin a few twists and turns along the way but I was pleasantly surprised with this little short. Bunuel has become one of my favorite directors but I find watching his religious films to be very frustrating because he either goes over the top with what I find stupid or I feel he spends way too much time trying to make points but everything here worked pretty well with me. The black humor mixed in with the messages was a great touch and Bunuel did a terrific job with all the temptation scenes. The scene with the nude woman trying to tempt Simon was brilliantly done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ascetic religious Simón (Claudio Brook) believes he is a sinner and decides to self-inflict a sacrifice, living like a hermit on the top of a pedestal in the middle of the desert to be closer to God and resist the temptations of the world. His followers are peasants and travelers that believe that Simón is a saint capable of performing miracles and they crowd to hear his speeches. However, Satan (Silvia Pinal) tries to tempt him with the pleasures of the world. In accordance with the cover of the VHS, Bu?uel inspired in a Christian ascetic saint called Saint Simeon Stylites that lived for thirty-seven years on a small platform on the top of a pillar to parody his story with "Simon of the Desert" and criticize religion and believers with a witty humor. The unexpected plot point is a great and funny surprise with a completely different environment, but what else could the viewer expect from the master of the surrealism? This is the first time that I see this movie that has probably inspired Monty Python's "Life of Brian" and Alanis Morissette playing God in "Dogma". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Simon do Deserto" ("Simon of the Desert")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the funniest film from Bunuel, but also one of his most vicious attacks on organized religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Simon of the Desert" isn't one of Bunuel's best movies, but its certainly one of his most entertaining. The absurdest humor throughout is subtle yet hilarious, and the targets are dead-on. As usual with Bunuel, the cynical jabs at organized religion is bound to offend the devout, but its a perfectly realized satire. This ranks with "Viridiana" as Bunuel's most vicious attack on the church. Its not nearly as shocking when viewed today, but its still highly enjoyable to surrealism fans.There are so many bizarre moments, its difficult to single out any particular one. The most abrupt probably is the ending. Due to dwindling funds for the film, the producers decided to film an ending (which I won't spoil here) that seems to come out of nowhere. Some have criticized this, but I feel its a hilarious prank that Bunuel plays on the audience and possibly the most surreal moment in a film full of them. The low budget also explains the films short length, at 45 minutes. If it was any longer, it may have become monotonous. At this brief running time, its absolutely perfect. "Simon of the Desert" is probably Bunuel's funniest film. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is typical of every religion to preach that self-sacrifice is the path to find God. That giving up all the "pleasures" of the world will purify man. Wonder where those teachings came from, but it is quite a common trait, no matter what religion. Embrace asceticism, rid yourself of the so-called "worldly pleasures" or "sins" and achieve your spiritual or religious goals! The ultimate path to salvation is here! The Catholic teachings are no different, and Luis Bunuel has always been highly critical of organized religion. He has dedicated so many of his films as tools to launch razor sharp, scathing attacks on these beliefs or the Church in general.Loosely based on the real life story of the 5th century ascetic Saint Simeon Stylites, who spent 39 years atop a column ,"Simon of the Desert" is no exception. Picture a bearded monk, Simon (Claudio Brook), devoting his life to ascetic ways. He has already spent six years, six weeks and six days atop a pillar in the middle of the desert, praying for spiritual purification. He has gained a good amount of followers; mostly peasants, some priests and other village folk who believe that he has been blessed with special powers. They come to him for help or deliver some food from time to time. He is offered a brand new, taller pillar as a token of their faith and respect for his sacrifice. Simon continues his act of good faith, keeps delivering sermons and can even seemingly perform miracles.....Sounds like a serious, religious, deeply meaningful, preachy biography of a Saint? Not in the Luis Bunuel universe! Trust Bunuel to turn something that sounds very deep and heavy into a darkly humorous, absurd mock-fest that is unrelenting and uncompromising in its ways so much so as to scandalize half the audiences who could be believers! So this whole God-fearing stuff takes a dramatic turn as some of the priests and peasants start getting critical of Simon and think it is all in vain. Simon is taken to be an arrogant man by some, and a few others think he is faking it. Simon himself begins to deem his actions futile on several occasions. What's more...the Devil shows up too, and tries to "tempt" Simon in his many ways by appearing in the form of a beautiful woman (Silvia Pinal) in an attempt to seduce Simon out of his saintly ways! Will Simon yield to the temptation? Bunuel takes only about 45 minutes to drive his point across and does it with his masterful touch. Accompanied by Gabriel Figueroa's beautiful camera-work, Bunuel makes unpredictable transitions from realism to surrealism to hilarious absurdism all in the miniscule time frame that was available to him. Apparently Gustavo Alatriste, the producer could no longer fund the film for some reasons and that is how Bunuel was forced to abruptly end the film (with a bizarre ending that has been criticized in several write-ups, but do not be misled...it does have its place..and its own charm based on the interpretation), while in reality he wished to add more material to the film. Whatever the reasons, the end result is a highly original, savagely funny and one of the most eccentric works of cinema from the twisted mind of Luis Bunuel.Pay especially careful attention to certain scenes in which Simon mutters random religious ramblings on seeing some ordinary creatures like an insect (that has absolutely no idea of what is going on!) and later tries to do the same with an inanimate object but gives up! Or the scene in which Simon performs a miracle and gives a cripple a new pair of hands...and the eventual consequence of it! Or that brutally funny scene in which some of the priests don't seem to know the meaning of a particular Biblical reference. Every scene drips a lot of really clever writing....and there is no question that this is an exemplary work of genius from the great director.Bunuel's pick of actors add to the amazing experience with their superb performances, especially Claudio Brook, Silvia Pinal and the midget Jesus Fernandez."Simon of the Desert" is the kind of film that leaves you wanting more. Another 45 minutes of running time perhaps? Check out this masterpiece...do not waste anymore time.Score: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Temptation of the Simón</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a 43-minute black-and white short film written and directed by Luis Bu?uel in his 60s at this point already. It is about a very religious and humble almost prophet-like man who looks apparently a lot older than he actually is because of his long beard and also than the actor who plays him.. When we see him transformed near the end, he looks entirely different and much younger. Anyway, we witness this man's (Claudio Brook's) interactions with all kinds pf people, including the devil in the human form of a blonde woman who exposes herself repeatedly in order to lure the man into sin. Brook was a fairly prolific actor and this can also be said about several of the other actors in here, even if they are probably completely unknown outside the Spanish-speaking parts of America. Oh yeah, with regard to that, you will also need subtitles to understand what's going on if you are not fluent in the language. Finally, I felt that this movie looks even older than from 50 years ago. All in all, I did not enjoy it too much. It had its moments, but all in all I found it underwhelming. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starts out promisingly, as we make the acquaintance of the religious ascetic Simon.Standing day and night on his desert column, in an effort to get closer to God, Simon (Claudio Brook) is revered, fed, and watered by accolytes who consider him a saint.I admired Brook's unwavering performance and the quiet presence of his mother (Hortensia Santovena), who remembers better times with her son, when they both were able to laugh. Also compelling is a dwarf who lustily savors foods that Simon rejects, such as cheese and bread, and admires the bulging udder of a goat.However, I quickly tired of the antics of Silvia Pinal, who plays the Devil. I could accept her tiresome behavior in the guise of a prostitute, but when a silly beard adorns her face and she maunders endlessly in a bid to derail Simon I just got bored.Surrealism can be good, I guess, but it's gotta hold together, and this production is way too uneven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I didn't really like this film at all. Confusing and unexpected ending. I don't particularly like this kind of theme, but had to watch it for my film class. I do think that Luis Bunuel did do a great job at directing this film. The story of "Simón del Desierto" is loosely based on Saint Simeon Stylites' life, a monk who like Simón, decided to spent his days at the top of a pillar. "Simon del Desierto" parallels St. Simeon's story. Luis Bunuel shows us the way in which Saints are seen and venerated by the religious people. Using Simón as an example, Bu?uel explores the human side of religion, and exposes his views on it. I thought that was bold and daring move by Bunuel. I like that he was comical throughout the movie which created a less tense atmosphere. One of the scenes that I thought was comical were the ones with the sheep farmer. His jabs at organized religion for example are bound to offend many who are devoted. I don't think that this film is for everyone. I can definitely see how it could offend many people. I wouldn't recommend it if you can't take that sort of humor. I will never see this movie again, but I do think that it is a great film to watch if you are interested in film history. Weird ending and I didn't really understand the meaning behind it.</fullReview>

This film seems just like a bashing of the church by the director and doesn't seem to have much of a purpose except to get his point across, which he clearly does. Even if he did have a purpose, it didn't show up on the screen. It seemed like a bunch of pointless scenes strung together at the last minute to make a movie that was barely entertaining. One thing that Bunuel does well is focus on the teachings of Christ, rather than just the crucifixion and sufferings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A column even of fire leads to no fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1965 film is not even a metaphor, certainly not a parody, but a full denunciation of religious medieval asceticism. We will pass the allusions to Jesus and his forty days in the desert. We will pass the hypocrisy of all those who come to the foot of the column to get the force Simon is supposed to conquer by his personal sacrifice that does not cost much to these hypocrites. The morbidity of this long description of years in the desert and temptations from Satan are finally ridiculed by projecting this ascetic monster into the younger generation of 1965 dancing the twist or some other crazy dance. He is the one who sits at a table, smokes his cigarette but does not dance. In other words he is the Fool who will never get the Fun and will Fancy he is Free and Famous if not Funny whereas he is nothing but F***D up.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinarily Bizarre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel will forever be remembered as one of cinema's greatest masters. Using his own genius brand of cinematic surrealism, Bunuel created a number of memorable, and bizarre, films. One of his greatest efforts has to be the 45 minute long satire that is "Simon of the Desert".Dark comedy, religious satire, and surreal imagery, three things that constantly have shown up in Bunuel's films. If you know anything about Bunuel, it's that he despised the Catholic church, and these opinions are expressed throughout his career, especially in films like "L'age d'Or" and, this film, "Simon of the Desert"."Simon of the Desert" is certainly a very odd film. While this is definitely expected from Bunuel, I was actually kind of surprised at the lack of plot structure. It really just Simon standing on a column, praying, as many bizarre episodes go on below him. The main plot point is that Satan continually tries to seduce him, until her final bizarre visit, in which the film takes a huge unexpected turn that I won't spoil.Throughout the entire film, there's plenty of absurd, dark comedy, such as Simon forgetting how a prayer ends, and even realizing that he has no idea what he's even saying as he prays. In fact, throughout the film religious people seem to admit that they don't REALLY know what they're saying, they're just saying it.The camera-work is incredible. There's a lot of times in which the camera movements really give the film a more epic and surreal feel. They were done so well and so steadily that it all really enhanced the film experience and further proves that Bunuel was an artistic genius.At only 45 minutes, my only complaint is that I wish this film was longer, however strange it all may be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absurdist Masterpiece !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While many reviewers of Luis Bunuel's Simon Of The Desert (1965) seem hung up on the alleged historical fact that the funding for the film was pulled while it was still in production, I just don't see how such information should impinge on the viewer's appreciation, or the lack of it, of a given film. I feel that Simon Of The Desert should be judged for what is seen on the screen, and nothing else.I viewed the film without knowing anything about its alleged funding problem and I think that it's a cinematic masterpiece in the Surrealist and Absurdist traditions just as it stands.I really didn't pick up on the subtleties of Simon's developing crisis of faith, as did other reviewers, , although I suppose that they are actually there to be seen.Actually, Bunuel had me fooled until the very end. I thought that the film as a whole was a tribute of sorts to the real Saint Simeon, a man who had to divorce himself from the "hypocritical" structure and dogma of the established Church to actually find God. This in itself would've been effectively in line with Bunuel's well known disdain for Roman Catholicism and, perhaps, a cinematic acknowledgment that perhaps Bunuel did believe in God and in a genuine spiritual experience, outside of the "phony" constrictions of the established Church hierarchy and dogma, that is.But that the Devil , in the end, magically transports Simon through time and space from the Syrian desert of the 5th century A.D. to a NYC rock and roll nightclub scene ala the 1960's is a very Absurdist twist and dramatically reveals Bunuel's true attitude not only toward the established Church but also toward supposedly pious saints and "holy men" as well.That the Devil tells Simon in the last scene that he is never going back tells me that the 1960's rock scene is Simon's Hell and his just "reward" for his pious and holy life. After a life of severe austerity and deprivation, Simon's "hell" is to spend the rest of eternity in the ultra-materialistic and ultra-sensual world of modern big city life. In short, Bunuel is telling us that the whole idea of saints and "holy men" is just a lot of BS. The abrupt shift in scenes at the end from Simon of the desert to Simon of the modern rock scene is an effective Absurdist commentary on that seemingly atheistic viewpoint.Possible funding problems aside, I find no problem in the relatively short length of this film. The length of the film is sufficient to allow Bunuel to say what he intended to say, and that's all that matters to me. Perhaps, more materialistically minded viewers, imbued with capitalist values, didn't feel that they got their "money's worth" out of this short film, but quantity is never to be equated with quality, in my view.The old adage is "If you have lemons, then make lemonade". If Bunuel did experience funding problems while making this film, then he surely took that "lemon" and turned it into a very tasty "lemonade". at least in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not necessarily anti-religious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard that this movie offered a critique of religion, but from what I can tell it offers no detectable stance on that or any other topic. Yes, Simon is devoutly religious, and yes, he faces a barrage of criticism. But as that criticism comes primarily from "the Devil," it can be read merely as an orthodox religious play rather than as an endorsement of the Devil's arguments. The Devil, moreover, is a vampish woman and Simon is her henpecked foil, a reactionary set-up that makes the movie feel something like a nightmare scene from a sitcom. It is mercifully short (though still tedious) but the twist ending offers no closure or clarification.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man just can't handle the transcendental, is the message here. All he can do is to mumble clichés in Latin while worrying about regularity and ticks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most ironic thing I see in this Bu?uel is how strenuously Simon fights his sexual urges, violently awakened in the occasion by a sultry, curvaceous, Devil...while standing on what must be the biggest phallic symbol a hundred miles around. I think such image resumes the best what SOTD is all about: the fact that the farthest we humans think we have gotten away from our own nature?through physical effort, willpower--the tighter we are attached to it. That's the tragedy and comedy of our human condition, that we can't escape our nature, that of being minds and souls striving to reach a spiritual reality while being incapable of escaping our animal trappings, urges. We may expel them through the front door, thought they have gone for good, yet in the meanwhile they have gotten back by the kitchen door. That's, I think, the subject on which Bu?uel focused his film, consciously or not--the futility of all asceticism, the lack of meaning of any human search for spiritual transcendence or purity--rather than just trying to mock established religion. Bu?uel is that misleading to many; they think for ex. that The Exterminating Angel is about nothing, just a joke, while it really focuses on the mental traps we build for ourselves.Now there's nothing insulting in saying that Bu?uel wasn't aware of what he was doing when shooting this or his other films. That's how real genius generally works, with the artist not even realizing what he's doing. True genius is not rational but intuitive. The artist does his artwork in a given way, including diverse elements, some of which apparently shouldn't be there, not because the logical mind tells him to do so, but simply because "it seems right". Such a thing, image, sound, fits there nicely so he'll add it to the whole. It's only when the art wok is complete that is makes sense, or should maybe.SOTD works very adequately that particular no man's land straddling the humane and the divine, between the everyday and the transcendental; something that has always intrigued me, because also an inescapable element of our human condition. For ex., one thing that has always intrigued me is how Man creates--or acknowledges, if you are a believer--the divine only to smirch it, to make it pedestrian in the next step. I'm thinking, for ex., about an old "recipe" for hard boiled eggs--put them in boiled water the time for three Hail Marys. Or wondering how Jesus handled events that usually make any of us fume; for ex, while he was still a kid, helping Joseph in his carpenter shop, did he let go a swear word when he hit his thumb instead of the nail?. That's another angle on which SOTD works; when, for ex., Simon mixes his prayers with trivial comments about his body functions, symptoms; or about the stupidity of someone around, about even the sudden realization that he may be talking nonsense instead of reaching new peaks of wisdom. But the best ex. is that of the thief hitting his kid with his miraculously given back hand. Bu?uel's message here is clear: Man can't just handle divinity, transcendence; all he can do is to build mockeries of them. Just like the pillar--phallus on which Simon carries out his futile endeavor.The cinematography here is adequate without being superb--many shots from atop the pillar and the corresponding under it, looking up, as to emphasize the only two possible locations for every character?but we have to marvel at Figueroa's work, when all what he had in front of his lenses was the pillar and the desert. As for direction, Bu?uel seems to have given great freedom to his actors, just told them what to do, do a few takes and then select the one he liked better. This is particularly true for Pinal and Brook. One has to admire also the great versatility of Mexican actors, for whom no scene seems to be too shocking, absurd or surrealistic. Both elements together make for great comic moments, amongst others, Simon pompously giving the could shoulder to his mom--his "mission" is far more important--and Pinal's Devil acting as a happy-go-lucky, carefree girl. The ending may be interpreted in many ways, but I think the idea behind it is, how things in life that tempt us--and to which we resist for a time, as Simon does towards earthly pleasures--appear trivial, ordinary once we succumb to them. Pinal herself, a sultry vixen while only a temptation, becomes a regular gal in night clothes when she finally gets him where she wants him. Man can't handle the transcendental I said, because even the transcendental he turns it into the pedestrian.In all a daring, imaginative, if short, surrealistic movie; one that will surely leave an impression on you, whatever that impression may be. Also said to have inspired Monty Python's Life Of Brian. Unfortunately that inspiration doesn't seem to have gone deep enough to make this last go beyond the lame joke and the man-in-drags routine. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simón del desert Horrible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simón del desiert is a Mexican 1965 film directed by Luis Bu?uel. It is loosely based on the story of the ascetic 5th-century Syrian saint Simeon Stylites, who lived for 39 years on top of a column. It stars Claudio Brook as Simon. He lives as hermit on top of a column for self-inflicted sacrifice. He does this an attempt to get closer to God for this reason he has numerous peasant followers and clergymen support him in his sacrifice. They believe he is a saint and can perform miracles. The film chronicles him being tempted by the devil as he continues to live atop of the column, the actions of the supposed holy clergymen and his followers. Interesting enough Satan is portrayed by the lovely actress Silvia Pinal who tries various ways of making Simon lose his focus on God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simon of the desert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon del Desiert is a very religious based movie with a new meaning to keeping the faith, because in this film you follow a man named Simon who is a top a pillar proving his loyalty to the lord, claiming that he has been full of sin all his life and wants to be forgiven to be good servant of the lord. Throughout Simon's journey to becoming a man of free sin life, he is faced with a few challenges. Such challenges are that of trying not to eat or drink much water, only drink and eat when it is necessary and of what he can eat, is the "plants of life", no meat or dairy. Another challenge that Simon will cross, is a women who is claimed as the "devil" this woman tries to seduce Simon into giving into his male needs, Simon stays strong the women tries to undress and everything, but Simon will stay strong even after all her attempts to seduce him. Simon will remaining strong standing atop his pillar, gets betrayed by one of his fellow worshipers, because they stuck dairy products and meat inside of his food supply to make it look like he has been sneaking around with extra food. Simon refuses to have taken part in that and says the man can be forgiven for sins, until the man bursts into foaming out the mouth and falling over dead where he stood, with a bag of golden landing on the ground out of his robe. Although this movie has a very twisted ending, as we follow Simon he is talking about being free and sinful, but then we the movie takes us for a spin and shows the real Simon with the girl who kept appearing as the devil, they were in a nightclub, drinking and smoking. Therefore, this movie kind of shows two sides the "true" way to follow the religion or the hypocritical way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devils Plan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon of the Desert was directed and by Luis Bu?uel, and really serves to show the capacious nature of mankind. Simon, has been on top of a pillar in the middle of a desert for 6 years, 6 months, and 6 days ( a coincidence?) praying, in order to show his devotion to God. People of all walks of life, from a thief whose hands have been cut off, to the Priests of the nearby church, come by in an attempt to witness a miracle, in a thinly veiled attempt to pay their respect. After Simon asks God to restore the thief's hands, the first action the man does with his hands, clasp them together and thank god? I think not, instead he slaps his child, showing that he was not really repentant, and was just taking advantage of Simon's good graces with God. After everyone witness this miracle, they all leave, having seen what they came there to see. It is after this that the devil appears to Simon first in the guise of a beautiful young woman, and then disguised as Jesus (played by Silvia Pinal, the wife of the man financing the films) and tries to get Simon to step off his pillar. The pillar represents Simons attempt to literally get closer to God and get away from earthly desires. As the devil tries to convince Simon to leave the pillar he or she is trying to have Simon renounce God, by giving up, on his internal promise to God. It is not clear whether the Devil has visited Simon any time before visit. If the devil had not visited Simon before then, why was he/she visiting now? It stands to reason that something must have changed, perhaps the fact that more people were going to see Simon and witness the healing power of God, this could have upset the Devil enough to put a plan in motion. Taking Simon away from his pillar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simon of the Desert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon of the Desert was definitely an odd film. I mean the whole movie it is just this legitimately insane man, named Simon, just standing on a pillar praying to God. The odd this is that he has been doing this for six years, six weeks, and six days (that's not coincidental at all). But seriously this guy is nuts. He abandons everyone he loves and everything sane about the human world for God. And now comes along Satan whose is constantly disguised so that he can try and convince Simon to come down from the pillar and stop praying to God. Satan first comes to Simon as a beautiful woman, hoping to entice Simon to get off the pillar, Simon refuses and continues praying to God. Then Satan comes disguised as Jesus Christ himself, but Simon calls the bluff again and ignores Satan again and continues praying to God. Then a coffin pulls up next to the pillar and out jumps Satan, without a disguise, and carries Simon off to some place unknown. The next thing you know you are staring at a nightclub full of people just dancing. We have gone from being back in the bible days to what seems like a modern day night club. And as the camera pans through all the people dancing. We catch Simon sitting at a table in the middle of the dance floor sitting there with Satan. He says he wants to go, but Satan says not and gets up and starts dancing. It is a very strange film, but it is very similar to the story in the Bible when Jesus was in the desert fasting for forty days and Satan comes to him three times and tries to tempt Jesus to bow before him. This film is like the satirical version of that story. I do not really what to think about the film, honestly, it just has to bizarre of an ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only Bunuel could have finished it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Louis Bunuel's "Simon of the Desert" is a great intro into surrealism is you have never viewed a surrealist film before. Simon is a very religious and spiritual man who takes worshiping God to the extreme (in my opinion). The locals seem to praise him but he encounters the devil in multiple forms. The way Bunuel presented the devil was quite funny and made the film a little more lighthearted, even though it still manages to offer up some social commentary on religion. I was shocked to see slight nudity in the film but it really made the film quite funny. I felt that the ending was a little bit too abrupt. I wanted some closure. However, after scrolling through some reviews on IMDb, I found out that Louis Bunuel actually ran out of funds and had to stop production early. What a shame! This film could have really turned into something magnificent. I already think very highly of this film though, it has a nice balance of crazy and sane. Still, Bunuel managed to work the ending in quite well. I had no idea it was not supposed to be so abrupt. This is definitely a film that is layered in symbolism and rich detail. I want to go back and watch it a few more times in order to truly understand what Bunuel was trying to say with this film. Other than the abrupt ending, "Simon of the Desert" is beautiful filmmaking. The characters are strong, the film has funny moments when you do not expect and it is a great example of the extraordinary work Luis Bunuel did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pillar of Confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have one word to describe this film, WHAT? The film was a really unusual hypocritical view on the Christianity religion. The man was placed a on a tower that was literally placed in the desert that towered over everything. Simon wanted to be excluded from the world and wanted to be closer to God. He performed miracles, but the one showed in the film was a man that had both his hands were cut off for stealing. God gave him back his hands to provide for his family and the first thing he does is slap his cheeky son in the face. The film mocks Christian values with comedic banter. The most entertaining scenes were the ones with the sheep farmer. He mocked the young monk and insulted Simon on his tower. He was deformed and probably needed a miracle from God and yet he was content with his life and never asked Simon to ask God to help him. The scenes with the devil are shocking. On moment the devil is playing and the next moment she is exposing her breast. She is definitely creepy and convincing as sadistic creature. The ending was the probably the most confusing part of the film and I still don't fully understand the exact meaning of the ending. The film left the audience with a feeling of disappointment, confusion, and several questions. The devil's last attempt to persuade Simon from his righteous path transported them to the 1960s. One moment they are standing on the pillar and a commercial airline flies overhead and they are in a club. The devil dances while Simon drinks alone in a corner. The main question was "Did he turn his back on God?" or did he remain loyal. The unusual confusing ending ruined the entire film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy with religion at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon of the Desert is a wonderful and tasteful depiction between good versus evil. I enjoyed this movie although it had it slow parts and was hard to sit through at the very beginning. The film starts off with Simon standing on a pillar after dedicating years of his life to praying for everyone sins a crowd has formed around him to move him to a new pillar to continue his dedication. Simon is very hard on his self and sometimes relents to physical torture to show his loyalty to god with hopes that he forgives the rest of the people. This movie then becomes comedic once one of Simon's miracles gives a thief his hands back. Once this person has hands again the first thing he does is smack one of his children and drags them out of the crowd formed around Simon. The director then showcases the devils mysterious ways by casting a young female as the Satan. She attempts to lure Simon off his pillar to join her in celebration of the devils life by exposing her breast to him. He refuses and she vanishes, but returns throughout the movie in different characters. Simon portrays himself as a loyal disciple of God, but judges everyone who comes to the pillar to feed him or ask for a miracle. I found Simon as the ultimate hypocrite. The film is full of suspense after Satan makes his first appearance. Mostly because Satan can appear in Simon's dreams and day dreaming at any time in the most mysterious ways. He enjoys sending beautiful nudes to see Simon to persuade him to the dark side. The movie then moves forward showing Simon and the female in a different period partaking in smoking, drinking and dancing. I felt the overall theme for this movie is atheism. It is obvious the director does not believe in God after watching this movie. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves to watch the conflicts between being Christian and atheist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bu?uel's 1965 film named Simon del Desiert is a strongly religious film that involves a man who preaches to God for over 39 years on the top of a column. Was the winner of the FIPRESCI Prize as well as the Special Jury Prize, and nominated for the Golden Lion award all in the Venice Film Festival. Tis film is about a very deeply religious man, named Simon, who wants to be closer to God, so he climbs on top of a column and preaches there. But the Devil spends her time trying to get him to stop and get him to go back down to earth and try to seduce him. She goes to him with many different disguises such as an old witch, or a young teenager, or many other different disguises including God himself. And he always retaliated and kept preaching, and at the end the devil takes him to the future at a club and the movie ends that way. This movie is a Dramatic comedy with history in it. The movie is filmed in black and white and the characters speak in Spanish. The movie's setting is in a desert somewhere that isn't specified at all. Bu?uel uses this film to criticize the Catholic Church for what he views are hypocritical teachings and practices that are done by Catholics. Actually the entire film can be and will be considered a mockery of the Catholic Church and those who carelessly follow it teachings for no reason. This shouldn't be confused with him criticizing religion in general as Simon is presented as a virtuous man whose attempts at reparation seems to not be fully understood by those who follow him. This film is directed pretty well and for the most part has a clear message. This film overall was fairly decent and was bizarre mostly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary and Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon of the Desert is a religious based movie illustrating the difficulty of living a holy life and the temptations of sin. Simon, a man in the 4th century, lives on top of a beam for about 35 years giving the example of a sinless life for all to follow. He becomes known as a saint and people from all over came to visit him and get blessed by him. God has blessed him to remain holy, but the devil has other plans. Simon can recognize when the devil tries to tempt him to sin. Once, the devil came as a vixen and tried to seduce Simon sexually. This was one of the more comical scenes in the film. The tone of the movie was rather solemn and serious, and when she came, she began to tempt him by taking her top off and being absolutely ridiculous and humorous. Most people do not imagine the devil as a sassy Latin girl, but this was the form he came in. The devil's many stunts did not sway Simon. At the end, he was in a club full of sensual dancing in the 1960's, and this still did not prompt Simon to sway from his beliefs. Bunuel, the director, did an excellent job of filming, although it was only a short 45 minutes. He filmed the movie in black and white. The screen shots were also filmed creatively and effectively. The camera angles were used to make Simon look more holy and glorified, while making the woman look more dirty and sinful. This film was a balance between serious moral issues and humor. I enjoyed it and thought it was craftily made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simón del desiert: Classic Bu?uel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bu?uel, in this classic surrealist film, captures the spirit of the turbulent 60s, while imposing his criticisms of The Church, Spanish culture. Unfortunately, they ran out of money mid production, leaving a traditional ending up in the wind (though, when talking about Bu?uel, traditional is almost always up in the wind). The narrative is somewhat classic in that it follows a time based plot which focuses on several central characters. The cinematography captures the desert and the scenery of rural life in Mexico. The acting, although somewhat surreal, is excellent, and further underlines the criticisms that Bu?uel was attempting to pull out of this film.In trying to dissect this film, it's difficult to give a play-by-play, but the elements of the film play well with one another, giving the impression of a well thought out, and excellently executed film, which, in some ways, asks more questions than it answers.A must watch, Simón del desiert is a classic in the history of surrealist films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A favorite among cinephiles and film scholars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistakes, this film directly satirizes and criticizes the Catholic church that Bunuel found himself at odds with. While quite worth viewing, the film is not appropriate for children, nor is it a typical narrative adventure. The film can be quite funny at times, pointing out facets of the church and religion which can be perhaps contradictory. While it seems ridiculous, it so happens that people actually did get on top of pillars and prophesize/sermonize, the irony being that the people were being looked down upon by the pillar prophets. Not all viewers will appreciate the cutting humor or satire of the film. In the film the devil is represented by a woman. The woman who is Satan is often tempting Simon, topless, or is all of a sudden an old and undesirable hag of a woman, without missing a beat. The devil taunts Simon in humorous ways, at one point punting a lamb. While it felt that the film moved a smidge on the slow side, it is cut short as the director ran out of funds for the production. The ending is abrupt, but still resolves the plot, which is untraditional, yet intelligent and sophisticated. The film is not for the average audience, but is a favorite among film scholars and cinephiles. Younger film scholars should perhaps view the film multiple times to get the full effect of the film, as it requires full attention to catch the subtleties included in the plot. The film's title may present itself like a sword and sandal film, but is in fact completely unconventional in its execution. There are plenty of sandals in the film, few swords to be found except those used to form metaphors and satires of idiosyncrasies. For example, Simon, who is considered to be most holy, refrains from interaction with the public, and is withdrawn from people and overall temptation. However, it is quite ironic that he still retreats to the devil in the end, where he is transported to a club where people are dancing. While Simon is among people who are dancing in a trance like matter, devil present, Simon still continues to opt out of participation or interaction, yet he has technically given in to temptation anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>completely unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film started I had no idea where it was going, but I became quickly sucked into its fascinating plot line. It is truly a unique film, and I almost didn't even know what to think of it. Extremely surreal in its subtle religious message, it held my attention for its sadly short time span. It comes across something of a parable to me. You have a man who insists on being extremely sacrificial for God, and then you have the devil who continually comes to tempt him. He is almost a Jesus figure. Then, of course, things get very surreal and mixed up and he is lost to a world that he cannot control. It's almost as though Luis Bunuel is saying no one can stay truly pure in a society that constantly bombards its public with sin. He was obviously rather pessimistic about the state of the 60's. But it's very ingenious how he does about this. Simon is up on a pedestal for the entire film. He seemingly can't be touched. But what he doesn't realize is that just because he places himself out of the reach of the devil doesn't mean that "she" can't simply follow him up there. He separates himself physically but it's not enough to separate him emotionally. Personally I have more hope for human kind and the power that god has over us, but I certainly must respect how this director can translate a message on film into a true artistic statement. An idea like that takes true guts to go about making. It's a film that was destined from the start to make no money and fade quickly from the public eye. But it is also a gem of a film that will someday hopefully be rediscovered for a man of genius. One willing to go against the norm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simon of the Desert: Column Crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you hold firm religious convictions and spiritual sentiments you may find this movie offensive and sacrilegious. But if you're open to analyze and interpret a film that is unique, entertaining, surreal, and often times bizarre then watch Luis Bu?uel's Simon of the Desert. Indeed, one of the most striking influences in this film is the satanic influence from beginning to end. I don't mean this in the "there are hidden satanic messages embedded in this film that will make you take blood oaths, sacrifice goats, and commit to the life of a fallen angel" but consider that after 6 months, 6 weeks, and 6 days (number of the "satanic beast") Simon leaves his old column and accepts a newer, larger, taller, and more ostentatious column bequeathed by a wealthy townsman who was "inspired" by Simon's spiritual feat. Really think about this moment and the mistake Simon made in accepting the new column.Simon, as an ascetic, continually rejects "earthly pleasures" and material objects like adequate food, water, and rations throughout the film. Additionally, Simon seems to reject Satan's advances and temptations (played by a very attractive she-devil). While this may seem like a portrayal of Simon's spiritual strength throughout the film, know that Simon was ultimately doomed from the start by accepting the larger, newer column. It was 6 months, 6 weeks, and 6 days into his spiritual quest that Simon failed and gave into Satan's temptations by accepting the new column.By accepting the column Simon essentially accepted Satan, which is why he has no say in taking the journey to Hell at the end. Maybe Simon would have been saved if he recognized his folly and repented. However, he didn't, which is why Simon is doomed to Hell (the nightclub) at the end of the film. When Simon tells Satan he wants to go home, she tells him he can't. If you wanna know why, just go back to the beginning of the film when Simon gave into Satan's temptation by accepting the new column. So all in all, Simon should have taken advice from rapper Immortal Technique who suggests that "when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never because the dance with the devil might last you forever."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel's vision of Satan as a temptress is great entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Christians, today, go to church (some tithe), they say prayers (usually not enough of them), they try their best to be good Christians and live life like the bible and our preachers teach us to (but not all read the bible consistently or go to church consistently). Very few Christians, that I know of, fast. I think it is safe to say that nobody in the world is attempting something like Simon by standing on a column for almost a decade. With today's media, something like that would have already gained world wide attention and publicity.Everybody has temptations to deal with, but they are in the form of the world and the desires that are in the world. If anyone claimed that Satan was torturing them, they would probably be considered insane. Simon is so well disciplined he is not tempted in normal ways. The way Simon is set apart from other Christians makes it believable that it would take Satan himself to tempt Simon and cause him to stray. I think this makes for a very good movie. We get to see Luis Bunuel's version of Satan as a temptress. We also see how devoted Simon is. He treats everybody the same and rebukes even holy men.I think Satan is sent by God (or allowed by God) to tempt Simon because Simon has surpassed normal temptation. Therefore, temptation of a higher degree (for lack of better words) must come to Simon to test his perseverance and build his effectiveness as a Christian even further. This is the basic premise for making an effective Christian. They go through trials or hard times, but with the help of God (by trusting God and taking cover in God's refuge) they overcome, persist and persevere.I thought the ending was neat. Satan takes Simon on a journey that takes them to a club of some sort. Simon is being shown the world outside of his normal column and what it is becoming. The youth dancing to vulgar music. To the normal person the youth or the music do not seem vulgar. But, to Simon the whole scene stinks of the devil's schemes of subversion. And, the devil loves the revelry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simon Vs. The Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie seemed a bit weird and strange to me, overall I really enjoyed it. If it had not been for the comedic humor evenly placed throughout the film, I do not think I would have liked it as much. To me, the humor is what made the film stand out.Luis Bunuel is an amazing director full of ideas and symbolism. Throughout the film Simon is constantly being tempted by different things that symbolize the devil. Trying to stay true to God, Simon keeps trying to resist. The devil comes to Simon in many different forms, for example, as a sexy seductress and as an old haggish looking lady. All of the ways in which the devil tried to take over Simon seemed to be very eerie. The end of the movie is where I became confused, just when you think that Simon's prayers to God would not be answered, the film all of a sudden switches to a disco-like scene with everyone partying and dancing around. In this scene you can also tell that the devil never left because it is there with him yet again, but in a different form of another seductress. I took this as a parallel to life and how evil never truly escapes wherever you are. At first, this scene lost me but after thinking about it I began to realize maybe why Bunuel did this. Overall this film was great, as long as you do not hold your religious views to be very strict and serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one pillar or two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simón del desierto aka Simon of the Desert was a story about a pillar priest who stands on a pillar worshiping God and performing miracles while doing battle with the devil. The movie starts with him being transferred to a new pillar that is far grander than his previous one. After the switch, he performs a miracle giving a thief back his hands so that the thief can feed his children. Over the course of the movie, Simon is tempted by the devil in his various forms to come down from his pillar and join in on the temptations that the earth has to offer. Throughout the movie, Simon resists the devil at every turn. The end of the movie is interesting and slightly confusing. The scenes jump from Simon standing on the pillar in the middle of the desert to him in a Chicago nightclub talking to a beautiful woman. It is presumed that this woman is the devil and that Simon's resistance to temptation is wearing thin. This movie is yet another on that its meaning is lost on me. I get that Simon is fighting the devil and winning but with the ending just takes a left turn. Was Simon in the night club the whole time thinking back or was that just the way the devil. All in all this movie is good until you get to the end and it just throws you for a loop. I enjoyed the play between Simon and the devil and the little midget over the course of the movie. I would say that if I were Simon I would rather be in the night club with the hot blond than having to back out in the sun watching the goat herder and fighting the devil. What can I say pick your fights and know where you stand weather it on a pillar or in the night club.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simon of the Desert Luis Bu?uel, Mexico 1965, 45 min.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simón del desierto (Simon of the Desert Luis Bu?uel, Mexico 1965, 45 min.) was, if nothing else, an extremely entertaining film. Simon is an extreme religious man who secludes himself on top of a column to be close to God and further from the sins of the world. The film depicts the trails Simon must suffer to achieve this status of practical Sainthood. He hardly eats and drinks, he neglects his mother and other mortal relationships, he performs miracles but they are taken advantage of. Throughout this self-inflicted punishment the Devil, played by Silvia Pinal, is trying to seduce Simon. She seduces him with lust, food, drink, and promises of all that he desires.I am not going to lie when I was confused by the end of the film. I wasn't sure what the conclusion was supposed to entail. Simon and the Devil are at a Dance Club in some city in the future. Does this mean Simon succumbs to the Devil, that his hell is now where he is now? Perhaps it was another way the Devil tries to make him falter to sins by taking him to a perfect example of sins of the flesh and pleasure.Other than that confusion at the end I really enjoyed the film. The film was riddled with humor as long as the audience isn't offended. One of the best parts was when a peasant is miraculously given his hands back, then in the next moment uses them to abusive his children. The story definitely makes a satirical statement on Christianity. The concept twist of a biblical story was interesting, the characters were unique, and the story had a good pace considering its images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simon del Desierto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon del Desierto was a very different movie to me. Interesting though. I found many parts funny. Comedy is always good to have in film. It also relayed a neat message. This man stands on this pillar for days, weeks, even months just barely eating and drinking only taking in enough to survive. He is trying to be as close to God as possible. To be sinless for the most part. But as he is up on his pillar praying and fasting and just trying to lead the people to do a Jesus would he is constantly being tempted by the devil. The devil reveals himself to the man in many forms. Coming once as a seductive woman trying to get into his thoughts and make him surrender himself to her but he prays to get this devil away from him and his prayer is answered and the devil turns into its true form which was a dirty, nasty, old hag lady. The devil never stops though coming up with different plans of making this man mess up all he is working for. He even posses one of the other clergy men and puts poison into the man on the pillars food but he is caught again and the pillar man orders the devil leave the man and he is cast out of that guys body in and exorcist kind of manner. It is very creepy. But then there comes a time when it seems like his prayers were not answered and all of the sudden he is on a skyscraper in like New York at a party sipping on a drink and the devil is there with him in the form of another attractive lady. That is the part in where it kind of lost me but over all this movie was pretty interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tempted by the Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon of the Desert is hilarious, as long as you don't take your religious views too seriously. Director and star, Luis Bunuel, is famous for saying, "Thank God I'm still an atheist!" The film is a wicked satire on the idea of devout Christians. Bunuel plays Saint Simeon Stylites, a devoted aesthetic in the 4th century who spends six years, six months, and six days standing on a pillar in the middle of the desert to prove his devotion to God. He is often visited by the local villagers, who praise him for his devotion. However, he also is visited by the devil, disguised as a beautiful woman played by Silvia Pinal.In the opening scene, he is visited by his followers. My favorite part is when one man, who lost his hands in a farming accident, begs him for new hands. When he gets his hands back, the first thing he does is slap one of his children for marveling at the miracle. There are other scenes that poke fun at the idea of a "miracle" and the power of God and worship.The ending of the film is fascinating. After numerous visits by the devil, in which she tries to seduce him off the pillar even by removing her clothing, she takes him captive and then end up in a 1960's dance club to expose him to the pleasures and evils of the world. In the club, the camera pans across the dance floor where the dancers perform the latest dance, the "radioactive flesh." The humor of the idea of a "stylite" who practices extreme religious practices for self denial emphasizes Bunuel's moral code, "Men are only merely human." Overall, this film is a funny short, and in spite of being hastily finished, came together very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, weird ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Simon of the desert I watched for my film history class, and I got to say it was a crazy acid trip. I enjoyed the experience as a whole, but was just confused with the ending. I felt they jumped the shark with the ending. I just didn't get it. The whole idea and movie was well done. The movie is trying to be serious but continuously pokes fun at the whole concept of Simon's devotedness to god. There is a little person who attends the sheep, the healed man shrugs off the miracle and goes on living his life as if nothing happens, the devil is just too funny, and the ending is people dancing out of their mind. The ending is what killed the movie for me. I didn't understand if he was in hell with the devil or what? He was devote to god and sent to hell in the end, which just didn't make sense to me. The time period confused me as well. One would think they are in a pre-modern time, but Simon is pretty cool with the idea of being in a New York nightclub, just sitting there smoking, chilling. The devil was freaking hilarious in tempting Simon. I loved the disguises and the "ugly" naked true form of the devil as the old woman. The casket scene was well done. This movie is good, but just leaves me wondering a lot about a lot of unanswered questions about it. I felt they should have done the movie justice and gave some closure, or at least answer some questions on a DVD special about it and the meaning behind some of the stuff they did. But everyone is going to have to answer their own question and ideas about the movie when they watch it. It's worth watching, just confusing with questions that bother you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Half of a Film Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon of the Desert is a brilliant film. I am in the minority for sure. But I live in the minority as I find little gems like this much more worth while than any mainstream movie. The director Luis Bunuel found fame early with his short film Un chien andalou, but Simon isn't that in the least. Simon finds the director much more subdued, there are no shocking scenes of violence to behold, rather he uses a moving camera and some brilliant cinematography to get his point across. First it should be noted that this can be taken as an atheist film, but not being an atheist I find it that Luis didn't want to alienate his audience and straddles a line where both sides of the "argument" could appreciate it. Simon is a religious zealot more or less, we are introduced to him as he is standing atop a pillar, a place he has been going on six years. Why is he on the pillar? To praise God of course, and in doing so spark the faith in the townspeople around him. But the townspeople aren't as pure as dear Simon and while praising him, the townspeople are worth mocking for their ignorance. Besides the folks around him, Simon is met with the greater problem of the devil. Incarnated in a beautiful woman, Simon is tempted to give up on his practice and therefore God. This is where Bunuel balances the line so well. At one point Simon chooses to further glorify God by standing on one foot on top of the pillar, one that seems noble and above all a middle finger to Satan. But really when looking at Simon atop that pillar, on one leg, Bunuel is mocking him. Standing on one leg is completely pointless to his cause as he gets no extra "help" from God and the devil returns. That is the message of the film, man glorifies God for what? There are no real signs that God is with Simon, although he prays to him and in the end the Devil ultimately wins. Why do something so stressful for so long if the end result is that you lose? Buneuel questions this but in doing so paints a picture of an extremely pious man that could be the poster child for any fundamentalist Christian movement. I find myself somewhere in the middle. As a devout Catholic, Simon's courage is respectable, never giving into the devil. But I can see the opposition on Bunuel's side, what is the point of it all?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luis Bu?uel's Short Masterwork Against Christianity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon of the Desert is one of the best movies I've seen by Luís Bu?uel. It's also one of his most interesting and mature attacks on Christianity. Surprisingly the movie is based on a true story. It's worth noticing that in order to finally make a good movie on Christianity that didn't amount to childish provocation, Bu?uel had to rely on real life and not on his overpraised imagination.The story of Saint Simeon Stylites is that of a man who lived 39 years atop a narrow pillar, leaving on little food and reverently praying to God for many hours. He's a symbol of devotion, but also of the fanaticism and spite for the human, physical world, that characterizes the worst in Christianity. And in such fanatical behavior there is even a hint of arrogance and vanity.It is this aspect of the Saint's personality that Bu?uel captures so clearly and so shows what a sterile, humorless, anti-life creature a true Christian really is.Tempting Simon is the devil, played by the sexy Silvia Pinal; his goal is to bring Simon back to the world of earthly sensations and pleasures, to show him what fun he's missing by wasting his life atop the pillar. He tempts him many times and under many guises. Whether he succeeds or not must remain a mystery, but the ending is one of the strangest twists I've ever seen in a movie and honors Bu?uel's stand as one of cinema's true surrealists.Simon of the Desert is a short movie, just over forty minutes. Bu?uel wanted to make a longer movie but the producer ran out of money halfway through and he had to rewrite the ending. I'm not sure whether that wasn't a blessing. A longer movie probably couldn't stand the narrative, it'd become repetitive and dull. Instead as it exists today it's a concentrated work of madness and humor, and a better masterpiece than many feature-length movies.</fullReview>

They are almost all funny (maybe not "Land without Bread"), but this one is marvelously sharp and satirical. It is typically irreverent and anti- clerical, with a "no-holds-barred" bravado."Simon of the Desert" is famous for being short --- they ran out of money and had to truncate it. This actually may have improved it, brevity being the soul of wit. The other overtly funny film is "Susana," perhaps his most commercial and accessible work.---Mark</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That Luis Bunuel was a sarcastic madman. That is why I love his films so much!!! "Simon of the Desert" was filmed in Mexico and is in Spanish. The film concerns a sort of spiritual prophet named Simon. He could be symbolic of Christ, except for the fact he's very prideful. He stands on a tower in the desert, and people come to worship him and follow his every word. Too bad Simon doesn't follow his own teachings. In one scene when he's supposed to be fasting, he secretly eats some food. Bad Simon! Then the film becomes comical as a female devil comes in disguise to tempt Simon. She takes on various forms, including a little girl who sings songs mocking him. Later she wants to show him the sin of man. Which is a NYC music club with rock &amp; roll and dancing. (that's not sinful) The film is very short at about a 50 minute running time. So if your into surrealism or satire, "Simon of the Desert" is a film you should definitely see. You can definitely see it's influence on Monty Python's "the Life of Brian" and "El Topo".</fullReview>

This is one of those films that envelopes the senses and for the duration of its story makes you forget there is an outside world.

		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to see an actual film print of this movie while enrolled in a Latin American film course at CU Boulder. Bunuel was a filmmaker who enjoyed poking at his audiences - one example of this is in his faux-documentary "Land Without Bread." In "Land Without Bread" he pushes the audience to laugh at the misfortunes of others (some versions), whereas in "Simon of the Desert" he pokes at his Catholic heritage.This film may not be for everyone (especially those who attribute perceived budget to quality of story-telling...ahem). It is a hilarious criticism of religious fanaticism - a elitist man standing, for weeks on end, on a pilar in the middle of the desert in a desperate attempt to 'be closer to his god.' This is film that you can think about; therefore, those people looking to vegetate and be distracted by flickering lights for a couple hours should leave this one on the shelf - preserve the VHS tape (as it is unfortunately not available on DVD) for those who might enjoy it.So, what will it take for this man to be tempted away from his god? Where does his weakness lie? Excellent film from an outstanding director!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel lost in the desert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon of the desert is a film directed by Luis Bunuel in 1965. The movie is about a man (Simon) who stands atop a Romanesque column trying to get closer to God. While atop the tower Simon is tempted to get down by random people and the devil. This movie was painful to watch, Simon of the desert is by far the most pretentious, self satisfied movie I've ever seen, as nearly all critiques on religion are. I think about halfway through, the movie realizes that its being boring and brings out its big guns, Silvia Pinal as the devil. Silvia does everything she can to shock the audience but sadly for the movie this also comes off as bland and contrived. The movie finally puts itself out of its own misery by ending abruptly in a nightclub which I was told after seeing the movie was supposed to be hell which is strange because i was sure that the whole movie took place in hell. There are plenty of good films that deal with religion humorously i would recommend , Montey Python's The life of Brian, Bedazzeled or Bruce almighty over this film any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Choppy but ultimately redeeming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bunuel's troubled production depicts the life of Simon, 4th century Stylite. Simon's pious suffering in the name of God is treated with irreverence and instead the content of his character is examined. Simon lives in a dismal world where Jesus never appears but Satan's temptations are frequent. His poor mother lives a life like his, but is ignored by the world; he is literally put on a pedestal and looked to for fake miracles, which both monks and people do not take seriously. It seems that for all his lauded attempts to cut himself off from the world, and his otherworldly mindset, he is still very much wracked by its diseases and hardships, an interesting point that would be more interesting if it were fully explored rather than so lamely mocked. As it is, the jokes were shooting fish in a barrel. The movie ends abruptly (the production ran out of money) when Simon is abducted by Satan on a plane ride to 1960s America. I spoil the ending because the contrast is striking: the devil becomes a modern-day woman, trying to coax him into dancing, and Simon becomes a gruff hipster, smoking tobacco and making wry, intellectual comments while simultaneously trying to distance himself from temptation. This clever-- if hurried-- ending puts an interesting light on a film that is otherwise difficult to take seriously.</fullReview>

However, it is the sudden and brief conclusion which turns around the movie entirely and reveals its startling and thoughtful take on what may be the true character of Simon. The ending is also highly open to interpretation, particularly on the perspective with which to regard the question of who Simon is.Short, strange, and intriguing, this movie excels at what it sets out to do.</fullReview>

It concerns Simon who is a buffoonish and sanctimonious man who sits atop his "column" out in the desert. If anything, we gain more anger towards Simon because of his immutable methods of "holier than thou attitude". He is nothing but an anachronism that is unwilling to change. The guise of the devil comes along in many forms attempting to indulge Simon in his own corruption. The film suddenly ends on a strange note in reference to the future as Simon seems to have been won out by Lucifer in one of the most whimsical features of Bunuel's long career.</fullReview>

Some of the scenes reminded me of Monty Python's Life of Brian. Throughout the film Simon is visited and tempted by Satan, who masquerades as a beautiful blonde woman.

The individual vision that tapeworm Bu?uel on the clergy, hell, the devil, the temptations, is something that do not leave of astonishment. That continuous exaltation of the monk, immediately afterwards to ruin it, of funny form, single is comparable to certain films of Woody Allen (it looks like, but it does not surpass it), where also the religious subject treats. After to read this, run to get a copy. After to write it, the only that I feel is desire to see it again. Already there am lost the account of the times that the sight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally creative idea that ultimately falls flat at the conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really appreciated the fact that this movie tried so hard to be different. Think about it: the plot is all about an ascetic that stands on top of a pillar in the desert for years and is tempted by the devil. This is just plain weird and deserves an 'A' for originality. Although his encounters with pilgrims and different incarnations of the Devil are very entertaining and interesting in a Surrealistic way, the end of the film will be for some a triumph of Absurdism (the director's trademark) but others will feel the film just abruptly ends in a very dissatisfying manner. I fall in the latter category. Instead of seeing the "non-ending" as great, it looks sloppy and unsatisfying--which I'm pretty sure was the director's intent. So, I would recommend this film only to those that can appreciate the weird and are definitely searching for something different. As for me, I'm glad I saw it once but that's really enough. If I want a weird film, I would much rather see HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS or MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. I know that makes me low-brow, but so be it.By the way--a word of caution: this film is sure to offend many religious people as Bu?uel was pretty contemptuous of organized religion. This, plus some very brief nudity make it a film that you wouldn't want to show the kids.ANOTHER "By the way"--the videotape of this film was terrible--featuring a washed out print and white captioning that, at times, was almost impossible to read. So, if possible, do NOT get the Video Latino brand of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and different - will leave you smiling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film by this director that I have seen so maybe I have a lot more to learn, from what I have read it seems that way anyway. Let me comment on this one for now as it was really enjoyable and so different from anything I've seen before. The movie at first sucks you in with the well crafted atmosphere of days of old...biblical times. Very convincing and reminded me of some of those old movies that sometimes come on the BBC a la Sunday afternoon that no one bothers to watch and go on for about 4 hours. Without giving the story away, as there isn't that much to it, I will just say that all is not what it may seem. The main story of the religious man standing atop a column, resisting Satan and all her temptations is a generic tale but is done here with a very unique slant. I recommend this film! Leaves you smiling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a movie for Gabriel Shear Fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It happens all the time: People with no talent find themselves obliged to play God and decide for other people what they should or should not see! Playing critic-which in itself is a shameful occupation- is one thing and looking at films out of context another.Most critics write so that they can apply for a job with Islamic Republics popping up everywhere. Simon Of the Desert should be looked at -and criticized-within the body of work of it's maker. If this film doesn't do anything for it's viewer, it does one thing: Ignite the imagination! And if that's not enough then one should join the ranks of Gabriel Shear fans to get satisfaction! As for Gabriel Shear...His fans know who they are!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No sheep were harmed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No animals were hurt in the making of this low-budget motion picture - except a kicked sheep, who had died days later from its injuries. The actress Silvia Pinal who committed this atrocity, quite fittingly in the role of Satan, has apologized to the families of the sheep for kicking it to so cruelly, expressing her regret for having listened to Bunuel's directorial instructions to "kick it as hard as one would kick a non-Communist", and her charm has worked for a while. Up till now, that is. Now, decades later, the sheep's families and all their members (all 1,498 of them) have decided to sue the Bunuel estate for damages for their unjustly slayed relative. All of the world's sheep, including the politically strongest New Zealand sheep, have united to support the Beh-behs in their fight for legal and moral justice - all except the sheep who enjoy Bunuel's overrated movies, naively believing that they're watching meaningful, clever "art".How many times do I have to play the Grand Wise Man to all these deluded and pretentious "art-movie" fans? STOP LYING TO YOURSELVES THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND LOVE MOVIES LIKE THIS, AS A WAY TO DEAL WITH YOUR INFERIORITY COMPLEX.If you feel your intelligence isn't what you want it to be, or if you feel you have failed in life in any way, deal with it head on, instead of shoving your collective heads into the movie-land sand like some silly ostrich.SOTD is a watchable oddity, nothing more. A very good premise; but a wasted chance; much could have been made out of the ascetic-sitting-on-a-large-pencil idea. It might have been revolutionary in its attacks on the Church back when it was made, but the film is now dated, seeming like a pitiful, insufficient prelude to REAL religious satire, something brilliant like Monty Python's "Life of Brian". I find it appalling, hilarious, and even frightening that some people found this movie hysterically funny. There were only one or two moments that came close to making me... chuckle? Grin? Move my upper lip about a millimeter? Perhaps two? If this is supposed to be funny, then I guess it must be brilliantly intellectual, too - at least to the numbers of film-critic and film-student sheep that infest this sad world.As an atheist, I'm all for the Church being satirized - but in a clever, funny way, not like this. Besides, as I already mentioned in my "Viridiana" review, when an attack on religion comes from a Marxist - of all people - then the effect (if there is one in the first place) is ruined, because that would be what is called "hypocrisy": a Utopia-believing Marxist CANNOT mock religious belief. Utopia is decidedly similar to Heaven, don't you think? Bunuel's God is a certain Marx. You might have heard of him. He is almost universally loved by Hollywood and Euro-trash directors and actors.I found out that Bunuel ran out of money (reminding me of a certain chubby overrated American director with O.W. initials) while making SOTD, hence stuck that rushed, absurd ending onto the movie. So that's most probably why this is considered a short film, whereas in fact it is an incomplete feature-length film. That he ran out of money may be an explanation for the stupid, dull ending, but it is in no way an excuse. All I care about is the end-result on the screen. And it is average, nothing more. Perhaps Bunuel running out of money was a blessing in disguise, at least for the viewer. Something tells me that watching 90 minutes of this would have been worse.Tell you what... I vow to stand on one leg, like the ascetic Simon, for the rest of my life if someone shows me a Bunuel movie which justifies his ridiculously hyped up, inflated reputation.The movie features Silvia Pinel, whom I hadn't seen before. A rare beauty. That's what female movie stars used to look like before the 90s. Now we have Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Aniston, and Cameron Diaz... Pathetic.Sick and tired of Euro-trash "classics", i.e. bad, overrated dramas? E-mail me if you want to read my totally altered subtitles of Ingmar Bergman's "Autumn Sonata", "Cries &amp; Whispers", or "Passion Of Anne", but also the non-Bergman "Der Untergang".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simon is a monk in Spain who stands on a column in the middle of a desert praying for six years. The devil in the form of an old woman tries to tempt him to come down, but he does not give in and leave his column. In the end the devil takes Simon off the column and transports him to a BlackMass -a disco in New York. This movie was obviously shot on a low budget, but that is not its biggest flaw. The acting is all right, but the plot is too short even for such a short movie (45 minutes and they have to waste time!). The movie is utterly without humor, secondary characters, or anything interesting. I would not recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me put it this way: when my teacher placed this video into the VHS player he said "Today you will watch the worst movie ever made." He had told us all year that we would be watching 'the worst movie ever made' and then last week he showed it to us. I'm currently stuck writing a review about the movie for his class. and now I'm repeating myself because IMDb.com says my review is to short: Let me put it this way: when my teacher placed this video into the VHS player he said "Today you will watch the worst movie ever made."
