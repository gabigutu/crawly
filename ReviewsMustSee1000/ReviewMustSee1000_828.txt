		<shortDescription>Quintessential early Scorsese, and one of De Niro's most convincing and varied roles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time that Robert De Niro appears up-close in Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets is to the tune of the Rolling Stones' Jumpin' Jack Flash. It's from this point forward that the movie leaves the realm of being a 'good film' and becomes 'one of the greatest films of all time.' Simply put, the energy of Mean Streets is fantastic. De Niro's flamboyant entrance is one of many iconic moments in the film, which has influenced just about every crime film made since ? for good reason.And yet ironically Mean Streets is rarely acknowledged as the masterpiece that it is, perhaps because a number of people actually forget about it. Everyone remembers Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and GoodFellas in particular, but Scorsese's breakthrough remains one of his most important and honest pieces of work, given little recognition apart from the praise by movie critics who do remember it.Harvey Keitel, giving one of his most realistic and three-dimensional performances of all-time, plays the lonely and worried Charlie, a 20-something New York City Catholic who is haunted by his friend, Johnny Boy (De Niro), the local loner who has to jump off the sides of streets in order to dodge the local Mafia thugs he owes money to.Mean Streets has been accused of lacking a point, and one critic calls it 'too real,' but I'd take this over most recent films any day of the week. Mean Streets doesn't have a dynamic arc like most motion pictures do ? sure, there's the rising action leading up to the climax, but it doesn't move from one frame to another trying to figure out the easiest way to end the movie while managing to stress all its points in such a manner so blatant that a four-year-old could pick up the themes.It respects its audience enough to study its characters in such a way that they are given ten times as much depth as those seen in modern films released through Hollywood. As Johnny Boy, De Niro paints the ultimate portrait of a typical street loner ? a dumb kid who 'borrows money from everyone and never pays them back.' Charlie, much smarter and wiser, takes Johnny under his wing and tries to help him get a job, so that he can pay back what he owes to a local kingpin. However, Johnny is so irresponsible and stupid that he doesn't show up for work and begins fighting with the mob ? leading up to an inescapable conclusion that features some very ancient themes colliding together. It's the classic tale of redemption and escaping one's past, and if the film has a point it is that some people can't change and you'll get what's coming to you, even if you've got other people helping you out.The film does have its technical flaws, such as poor dubbing, inconsistency, and the occasional goof. It's a raw movie, filmed on a low budget by a young and far more na?ve Martin Scorsese. But all his typical elements are in place, to be expanded upon later in his career.Keitel and De Niro are superb, particularly De Niro who shows great range very early on in his career. Almost unrecognizable in shabby clothing, hats and a scrawny figure to boot, this is a role that would typically be more suitable for Christopher Walken or other charismatic character actors ? but De Niro pulls off the role with intense talent, proving once again that he can handle any type of role. He's known for his psychotic roles, but in Mean Streets, he plays the opposite of Travis Bickle. Johnny Boy isn't unstable or psychopathic ? he's just wild and stupid.Keitel channels all the thoughtful consciousness of an older child, considering Johnny Boy to be a brother of sorts. He feels that if he fails Johnny, he will somehow fail himself.Mean Streets is a careful character study that never resorts to cardboard cutout caricatures or the standard clichés of the genre. Dialogue does not exist to move action forward towards the next adrenaline-packed sequence; Mean Streets focuses on its inhabitants with such strong emotional power that it's impossible not to be caught up in its grasp. A true classic from start to finish, and undeniably a very moving film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scorsese original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that I love the most about watching the old classics is when you can so clearly see the beginnings of what later became such trademarks of a director, actor, even a genre. Martin Scorsese begins a long line of films about the gangs of New York with Mean Streets, a gritty look at the underside of New York City that foreshadowed much of the same stark realism portrayed in Taxi Driver a few years later. It reminds me of the minimalist realism of films like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing, another urban classic.Robert DeNiro plays Johnny Boy, the fast talking kid who owes money all over town and never seems to care to pay anyone back. We meet other characters who owe people money, and their apologies at not being able to pay are genuine, they realize that they're not going to get late fees added to their debt or Last Notices, they're putting their lives on the line. There is genuine fear on their side and genuine malice on the side of the people they owe money to, but Johnny Boy just doesn't seem to care.Harvey Keitel plays Charlie Cappa, who is constantly trying to get Johnny Boy to shape up and pay off what he owes, knowing the danger that he is in and frustrated at Johnny's lack of interest or care in the fact that he owes so many people so much money. Johnny and Charlie live in the same environment but completely different worlds. Johnny holds himself in and laughs everything off, occasionally venting his frustration in quick bursts of violence, Charlie is much more contained but is tormented spiritually. While Johnny gets himself into endless debt with people that collect by any means necessary, Charlie goes to confession and holds his fingers over flames to remind himself of the dangers of the afterlife should he mess up in this one. Catholicism is a major character in this film.The movie is set in New York City in the late 1960s, where Scorsese grew up in presumably something of a similar environment. Something must have gone differently, since he ended up one of the most famous directors in the world rather than dead like so many characters in his movies do, but he creates this environment in Mean Streets that gives an incredible view into the dangers of the life that so many people lived and continue to live there. I've never even been to New York, but having seen so many of Scorsese's films I think I can understand why the environment could have had such an impact on him that it dominated most of his career as a filmmaker.There are some classic scenes in this movie that would have been much more widely quoted were it not for the even more quotable lines from Taxi Driver. Mean Streets, for example, is where you find the classic speech by Robert DeNiro, I'll call it the "I borrow money from everybody so I owe everybody money so I can't borrow money no more so I borrow money from you because you're the only jerkoff around here that I can borrow money without paying back!" speech. I love that one, especially the expression on his face, he's having such a great time.But considering the world that he lives in, it's almost understandable the way he cares so little about placing himself in danger. In a life as bleak and unpromising as the one that is portrayed in this movie, it is to be expected that someone will display passive suicidal behavior. Johnny knows he's never going to go to college, he's never going to be a doctor or a businessman or drive a nice car, he's going to grow up working menial jobs and live an obscure and meaningless life, in his eyes, and that's what the movie's about.Charlie seems to have similar feelings, looking to the Catholic Church not only as a means of salvation and spiritual fulfillment but for meaning as well. Granted, that is a very common goal for people getting involved with religion of any kind, but even more in Charlie's case. He is certainly the level-headed one between him and Johnny, but his future is not a whole lot brighter. Regardless of how much more responsible Charlie is than Johnny or how hard he tries to get Johnny to straighten out and pay off his debts, they both live in the same world, and so do their debtors. It is a world that is described in the lyrics of one of the songs in the movie ?"Have you ever had a wish sandwich? It's the kind where you take two pieces of bread and wish you had some meat."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must for Scorcese/De Niro fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been overshadowed with all the praise heaped on other Martin Scorcese/Robert De Niro films, but this is a classic which is as good as Casino or Goodfellas. It's more rough around the edges and less tightly plotted than those films, but less cold hearted, and De Niro and Keitel are amazing in these early roles. The sense of tension and danger towards the end, when the situation is spinning out of control, is done perfectly. You can see the influence of this in the films of Danny Boyle and especially Quentin Tarantino. A must for Scorcese/De Niro fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redemption on the Lower East Side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets has all the characteristics we have come to associate with Scorsese - the fluid camerawork, the expressionistic lighting, the sudden explosions of violence, the eclectic soundtrack. In later films, he took cinema to new heights with the flowering of his technical skills and the broadening of his material, but Mean Streets remains unsurpassed for the emotional intensity which only a young director, passionate about film and intent on making a personal statement, could achieve.The theme of the film is contained in the famous first line 'You don't make up for your sins in church; you do it in the streets' (a Scorsese voice-over). An extended preface which delineates the nature of the film and its characters before the narrative begins includes brief cameo scenes introducing the four protagonists (a much copied device: see, for example, Trainspotting).Scorsese's alter-ego is played as in the earlier 'Who's That Knocking At My Door?' by Harvey Keitel, giving the performance of his young life. He is Charlie, a junior member of a Mafia family who collects debts and runs numbers, but who also has aspirations to sainthood. The other key figure is his anarchic friend, Johnny Boy, played with ferocious energy by de Niro.Charlie is introduced coming out of confession, dissatisfied with his penance. Reciting words doesn't mean anything to him and he can't believe that forgiveness could come so easily. Deliberately burning his hand in a candle flame is a more effective reminder of the pain of hell. The camera follows Charlie from the altar into Tony's bar, a red-lit inferno, and when Johnny Boy comes in, to the tune of Jumping Jack Flash, Charlie recognises that this is the form his penance will take. Johnny Boy is the cross he must bear. 'You send me this, Lord' he says resignedly.Johnny Boy's irresponsibility and impulsiveness make him everything Charlie, with his controlled, anxious, guilt-ridden persona, is not. The argument which follows in the back room about Johnny Boy's debts deserves its reputation as one of the great scenes in seventies cinema.Charlie's life moves in well worn, claustrophobic circles. Hardly anyone outside his immediate circle appears in the film and other ethnic groups are viewed with suspicion. The characters seldom appear outdoors or in daylight. Charlie inhabits a world of bars, pool halls and cinemas. In the one scene he appears in sunlight, he looks ill at ease. The suit and heavy overcoat he wears (reflecting his Mafiosi ambitions) look distinctly out of place on a beach. It's significant that in this scene Teresa, his girlfriend, scorns his small-time gangsterism and challenges him to join her in moving away to a new life. But Charlie is trapped by his desire to please his uncle.Scorsese has said that his choice in adolescence lay between becoming a priest and becoming a gangster and that he failed on both counts. Mean Streets allows him to explore that choice to devastating effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well acted and stylish film which is let down by a poor script.Keitel is great in the lead and De Niro steals a lot of scenes as the out of control friend but the good cast are wasted.Nothing much happens. A little action and violence but that is it. It is a slight character study of a nice guy living in a bad place but that wasn't enough to sustain my interest.I was expecting a lot having heard the name and read some of then comments on this site as well as seeing the quality of the cast and I was extremely disappointed.I was bored throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>early Scorsese masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets was a brilliant early film by Martin Scorsese. It was his first ever collaboration with Robert DeNiro. Their very successful partnership has produced some of the best movies ever made: Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino. It also helped launch Harvey Keitel to stardom.Keitel as Charlie and DeNiro as Johnny Boy deliver great performances. Scorsese's direction is strong. Even close to 30 years ago, these three men show the talent which would eventually place them among the very best in the business. Scorsese uses a great selection of popular music in Mean Streets and that has become a trademark of his.Mean Streets easily ranks with Scorsese's best. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Streets - "I f*uck you right where you breathe" Directed by Martin Scorsese (1973)Mean Streets came out in 1973 after Scorsese almost had the script under development in a decade. This is one of his first personal movies, describing the raw environment in the streets of Little Italy in NYC. We follow Charlie in the leading role and the bunch of guys around him. The hustler Johnny Boy owes a lot of money to the loan shark Tony and doesn't make his payments to him. Charlie now tries to work out a deal with Tony and is trying to get Johnny Boy to pull himself together, even though this looks like an impossible mission.Scorsese's first motion picture Who's That Knocking at My Door and Mean Streets have many resemblances and contain the typical trademarks that Scorsese is now well known for. He almost always makes a character study of the life of lonely men, who are trying to get the best out of their situation in the asphalt jungle. Hustling, working, drinking, taking drugs etc. are very typical things to do for the persons appearing in his movies.Mean Streets is photographed mostly with a hand hold camera, which helps create a raw look that fits pretty good to this environment. Also the movie doesn't contain an actual score. Actually songs from the director's personal music collection do work as the background music. The plot is this picture is only secondary. This is like many of Scorsese's other movie primarily a character driven story with a raw environment description.The movie marks the start of one of the greatest director/actor collaborations ever! The role of Johnny Boy was Robert De Niro's role in a Scorsese picture, and later on he went to bigger leading roles under the director, which gave them both the reputation that they have today. Also this is Harvey Keitel's second leading role in a Scorsese picture, but after this movie Keitel and De Niro kind switched roles (see Taxi Driver).This movie is not just a good movie - It also is the movie which helped form the foundation of Martin Scorsese's later pictures.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Most Directors This Would Be Their Peak... For Scorsese It's a START!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEAN STREETS (4+ outta 5 stars)Maybe the film doesn't look like so much these days... since most of the story techniques, film stylings and intense performances have been re-done and over-done to the point of cliche... but when I first saw this movie... WHAM! I was blown away! And, now having seen it some half a dozen or more times, I still find it riveting... the dialogue, the camerawork, the way music is utilized... just brilliant! Martin Scorsese directs the first big, big film for Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro... they all did great work here... and, incredibly, got even BETTER as years went by. Keitel plays the good Catholic who feels the need to look out for crazy psycho punk Johnny Boy (DeNiro) who is in debt to every loan shark in town... and shows no signs of paying any of them back. Fabulous quotes galore... most of them laden with profanity: "I f*** you right where you breathe!" "What's a mook?" "You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bulls*** and you know it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scorsese Template</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorsese's first film, the interesting catastrophe "Boxcar Bertha," marked his birth as a director, but it was with his second feature, "Mean Streets" that we witnessed the birth of an artist. Most of "Mean Streets" is slightly unfocused with a simplistic plot based around a lot of machismo grandstanding and long bouts of boring dialog (occasionally made interesting by DeNiro's off-kilter star-making turn as Johnny-Boy), with spats of visceral violence (far less gory here than in later Scorcese pics), and a visual bravado that seems slightly less disciplined but no less entertaining than your standard Scorsese crime flick.Despite its drawbacks (mainly due to youth and inexperience), the template was set. The opening credits (done to the tune of "Be My Baby") suck you right into the film, and the rest of the movie is peppered with Scorsese's loving treatment of popular music that would later become one of his most endearing hallmarks. The basic premise featuring Harvey Keitel as Charlie (the young hood with a heart of gold and conflicted internally by the religion of the Church and the religion of the Streets), Robert DeNiro as Johnny-Boy (the equally loved and hated loose-canon brother figure), and Amy Robinson as Theresa (the woman our hero wants to put on a pedestal as a saint but often treats like a whore), is a trifecta of archetypes we see repeated again and again in Scorsese's films (most obviously in "Casino" with the DeNiro-Pesci-Stone characters, and most subversively in "The Last Temptation of Christ" with Jesus-Judas-Mary Magdalene). The religious iconography, the brotherhood of crooks, the attraction to the gangster lifestyle, the keen eye for depicting violence in artistic and startling ways...these are displayed here in "Mean Streets" in their rawest form.Though flawed in many ways, "Mean Streets" set the stage and laid the the template for the type of film Scorsese would perfect seventeen years later with "Goodfellas." This heralded the arrival of a new talent and a new genre, and the world of film has thankfully never been the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take A U-Turn On This Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched a number of (director) Martin Scorecese's profane/violent crime films - some good, some bad - his first entry here is very different from the rest in one crucial aspect: it's boring!! Love him or hate him, you can't say that about his other films.This film just doesn't have much life to it. Yes, there is some action but something is missing, perhaps characters that one could care about. After a while, I found I just did not care what happened...period. I canned it with 40 minutes to go. A dozen years later, I gave it another shot, and it was still just as boring and unappealing.The only interesting facet was to see such young-and-skinny well-known actors like Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Otherwise, these "mean streets" are nothing but a dead end, so turn around and head in another direction. Don't waste your gas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed with Mean Streets. I'm a big fan of this type of film and many of Scorceses other movies, but this one was boring. The story...what story? The characters? I didn't really care what happened to any of them. The "Mean" Streets weren't all that mean. Fine film-making? Perhaps, but I had to fight to keep my eyes open for the final twenty minutes. Like The Aviator, I think Mean Streets was way too light on the entertainment value (suspense, drama, intrigue, humor) to put it on the same level as Goodfellas, Casino, Cape Fear or Taxi Driver. I'd take The Pope of Greenwich Village over Mean Streets any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-hyped Borefest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little while ago I decided to watch Mean Streets based on the fact that it was directed by Martin Scorsese and it was his first collaboration with Robert De Niro who both many later works together and separately (which need no mentioning) stand out as classics. Harvey Kietel is also worth a watch too. I'm a fan of "gangster" movies not primarily beyond of the usual violence that is included but the portrayal of "the way of life/politics" which usually provides thoughtful and provoking entertainment.Unfortunately this wasn't one of them.The story follows small-time hoodlum (Kietel) whose religious principals affect his conscience while collecting debts and doing other menial hoodlum activities. These activities although menial should be easy enough to pursue but Mr Smallt-time Hoodlum is distracted by his loose cannon friend (De Niro) a reckless show-boy gambler running a heavy debt with other mobsters whose patience is wearing very thin.What follows is an epic bore-fest trying to disguise itself as social commentary and character studying. In truth it's just a plodding over-hyped melodrama which raises above criticism because of its director and cast.Don't be fooled and avoid.</fullReview>

The characters tend to drone on and an and to be honest, it put me to sleep a bit.Only recommended if you are a die hard fan of either scorcese, keitel or deniro...if you are looking for a gangster/mob character study you'd be better off with GoodFellas, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, misunderstood, under-appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people hated this film, they didn't see a point in it, they didn't understand why it ends the way it does. They got frustrated, gave it bad reviews, wrote it off. When I don't understand something, I generally watch it again... and again until I do understand it. This is a fantastic film, let me explain why. The music is great. Perfectly fits the time period and setting, I dunno how much they had to pay in royalties for the songs in this film, but I love em'.The camera work is fantastic. There's a scene where the camera gives you charlie's viewpoint, stumbling, wobbling across the bar, lights flashing, people dancing, music blaring, then zooms out to his smiling happy face. Yeah, I know, its not the beginning to Citizen Kane, but its a great scene none-the-less, my favorite in the film. Then there's the filming of the street festival and the overall way which New York is captured so perfectly. It feels like you are really in the city, the movie has that gritty feeling to it.The dialogue is perfect, many of it is ad libbed by Deniro and Keitel. This is the beginning of ad libbed dialogue for deniro, "You talking' to me"? There's a scene where Keitel confronts Deniro outside the bar to ask him about his debt, the exchange is perfect, it could never have been written and its executed beautifully.The acting is also fantastic throughout.So, great acting, great filmwork and great dialogue all come together to create a wonderfully realistic film.Now, the end of the movie, maybe you didn't understand it, so I'll explain the film. I'll try not to spoil the ending.OK, so Charlie does some bad things, he works for the mob after all, and he wants to repent for his sins, so, after going to church and then later seeing jonny boy in a bar he thinks that God has asked him to repent for his sins on the streets, by helping out Jonny Boy. He doesn't believe that saying a few hail mary's or confessing washes away one's sins. So enter the walking train wreck that is Jonny Boy.Now, what type of person is Jonny Boy? He has no sense of responsibility, he does not answer to anyone, he does not obey any rules, he never does what is expected of him.Hmm, so what type of person is Charlie? There are several scenes in the film that let you know what type of person charlie is. The statement Charlie loves everybody and everybody loves Charlie almost sums it up. Charlie wants to please everyone. But his life is full of conflict. You can't be in the mob and be religious, it just doesn't work that way. You can't hang out with guys who are racist and date an African American. These are just a few examples, but suffice to stay that Charlie wants everyone to like him, the local mob boss, his friends, his God, but he also wants to be happy and do the things he wants to do. There is conflict in all of this. Some of the other people that charlie wants to please, eg., God and the mob boss, have conflicting agendas. Some of the people that charlie wants to please conflict with what he personally wants to do with his life, eg. he is embarrassed to be dating the epileptic because he thinks it shows weakness to his friends, but he loves her and she makes him happy.You cannot please everyone. The irony of this film, and this is a little spoiler, is that while charlie is trying to save jonny boy, he should take a few lessons from him. Jonny Boy does whatever he wants without thinking about who he might upset, or disappoint. Charlie is the complete opposite. Yeah, Jonny Boy is destructive and his life is falling apart, but the point is that the two of them represent two opposite extremes. This is why the end of the film is tragic, its the lesson that you can't make everyone happy, that life is full of conflict. How we deal with conflicts in our lives, the decisions we make, they sum up who we are as human beings, they shape our lives.So there are many reasons why this film is great. I watch it every once in awhile and it really is one of my favorite films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>really disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I see this particular film getting high marks, I have to sit here and wonder if it's simply because "Mean Streets" is a Scorsese movie with DeNiro and Keitel as stars. I rented this as a supplement to some other Scorsese movies I saw in a college class about gangster films, and I had fairly high expectations. I was falsely built up.Where is the plot? Can someone please please tell me this? I thought there was a beginning to a plot when Charlie went to the boss and was told to stay away from Johnny Boy and Teresa so he could get his restaurant. But, just like everything else in the flick, that all kinda fell apart when Johnny predictably started acting the fool again. Charlie mentions at the start of the movie that he atones for his sins on the streets, and that is the only reason I can really think of for him to try to protect Johnny Boy, who was obviously doomed from the start. One of the most recognizable conventions of the gangster film is the young, disrespectful street thug getting whacked for said lack of respect. It's obvious from the very beginning that Johnny Boy is either going to die or get severely hurt for his actions, and the rest of the movie is just an exercise in how to bring Johnny to an end, which could have been done in ten minutes and saved me an hour and a half.My main beef with this movie is just serious lack of a plot line.I feel I've been hard on it, so I have to say that I did like the scene setups (the bar brawl especially, I hope it was intended to be comical because I was LMAO) and way the camera moved around the street. The street-level view lends a lot to the feel of authenticity. If there is one thing this movie does well, it's portraying an authentic feeling of being on the streets of NYC. The thugs on the streets of NYC, however, are not always that interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you endlessly watch a total screw-up borrow from the mob, annoy the only friend he has, and basically wreck his life without wanting to run away from it all? When the screw-up is played by young Robert DeNiro you are fascinated, you don't want to turn away. MEAN STREETS was not the debut of both Martin Scorcese or his stars Harvey Kietel and Robert deNiro. They struggled in the field for some time. This is the film that told the world, new head-honchos have arrived on the screen! MEAN STREETS tells of low-rent street hoods in Little Italy. Harvey Kietel plays the one hood whose a voice of reason, who doesn't mess up all the time, who is smart enough to avoid trouble. When DeNiro's Johnny Boy is first seen here, he is playing infantile tricks, and is telling his friend how he can't go in half the stores around him because he owes everybody money. Martin Scorcese uses a gritty documentary-shooting style to unfold his movie. It remains probably the best film of 1973 (But 1973 was not one of the best years for movies.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A barrage of artistic overtures and general indulgence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Martin Scorsese kicked around the indie circuit and second-unit work out in Hollywood before breaking through as a director with this melodrama set in New York's "Little Italy" district. Harvey Keitel plays a struggling Catholic trying to keep clean, and the character is most likely a highly personal one based on Scorsese in his early days (or someone very close to him). Intelligently-made film about desperate characters living on the edge isn't especially profound, though it is intrinsically exciting in a show-offy way. Scorsese, who also penned the screenplay with Mardik Martin from Scorsese' original treatment, proves to have an uncanny knack for kick-starting a scene using pop and rock music to its best advantage, and, in his now-characteristic way, he intermingles all his violent, tough-talking characters with the stunning assurance of a technical veteran. Keitel's performance is adept and multi-shaded, though Robert De Niro doesn't quite make that initial strong impression. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tethered Camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Scorsese is a talented man, no question. This is - I believe - his purest film, the one that is the least constrained by external conventions and pressures - the one that echoes through everything that follows.There are lots of basic philosophies in approaching filmmaking. I continue to be amazed at how radically they differ and how comfortably they are accommodated in film. That leaves us to sort out which one fits who we are or want to be. After all, we as viewers owe it to the filmmakers to be a skilled in viewing as they are in their arts.Scorsese is an Italian storyteller. That's where the characters are everything. All life and motion in the universe comes not from a nature, an environment, a metaphysic, but from people. They create situations, the environment springing from their eyes rather than the other way around. An Italian storyteller himself gets in your face and never relents, following you down the street, poking your shoulder with two fingers. There's a threat of violence in his eye, and this permeates all that is created. Sex is a story. Death is a story. Crime is a story.An Italian filmmaker attaches his camera to the characters by a string. It moves as they do. There is no disembodied observer as with most other filmmakers, this observer is an invisible character who tags along - because there are no entities other than characters in his world.What you get is a certain honesty, directly descended from `The Bicycle Thief.' What you also get is an inordinately heavy reliance on the actor who selves both as narrator and the observed. (`Taxi Driver' would take this to the extreme with no scene not being something observed or imagined by DeNiro's man.) But in the scheme of powerful filmmaking, that's pretty thing gravy. That's why I was particularly interested in `Gangs,' which can be seen as `Mean Streets' with architecture and situation outside any character. Weinstein (the dope) forced Scorsese to more of a story, less political drama and muted chaos. Everything in between these two films is uninteresting.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There`s Such A Thing As Being Too Realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might sound ridiculous but it wasn`t until 1991 that I got into De Niro , Keitel and Scorsese in a big way . I`d just seen the classic TAXI DRIVER and eagerly got my dad to tape MEAN STREETS off Sky television . Unfortunately I thought I`d either given my dad a bad tape or the video hadn`t been tuned into the TV station properly since the picture quality was very poor and everything was filmed in a sickly red colour and that`s just the bits I could make out because for most of the movie the contrast was terrible with everything being dimly lit . It wasn`t until a couple of nights ago when I saw MEAN STREETS on network TV that I realised that the poor picture quality wasn`t anything to do with duff videotapes or out of tune video recorders - It was down to the fact that the original print suffers from some terrible lighting and cinematography that gives the impression that the movie was made on 8mm by a bunch of twelve year old boysThat`s bad enough but what brings the film down ( And I noticed this on first viewing in 1991 ) is that Scorsese has forgotten to write a plot to his screenplay . I think Martin Scorsese is god where making movies is concerned but not even he can escape criticism by making a movie that goes nowhere . For the most part MEAN STREETS resembles those Harry Endfield characters The Scousers with New York accents " You alright Johnny Boy ? " " You asking me if I`m alright ? " " Yeah I am . What the f*** you gonna do about it ? " It`s like this all the way through the running time up until the last ten minutes when Marty finally realises he`s got to introduce an incident in order to finish the film The acting from Harvey Keitel is totally convincing while De Niro is superb ( Something that can`t be said for most of his recent performances ) but by writing a low concept hyper realistic screenplay Scorsese has effectively ruined the movie in its conception . Ask yourself this : If the driving force behind the movie wasn`t Martin Scorsese would you have regarded MEAN STREETS so highly ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Streets is literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is pathetic and the ad-libbed dialog is clumsy and forced. It is an embarrassment. I am astounded that many reviewers rated this movie highly, but I also see that they are the same people who call movies "films", in an effort to portray some type of artistic pseudo-intelligence. If sucky was a word, it would fit this "film". This is not an indictment of the director or actors. They went on to brilliant performances. But the fact remains that Mean Streets is an amateurish mess that is best forgotten. In fact, if later works by Scorcese, De Niro and Keitel were not so strong, this train wreck would not be under discussion as even mediocre. It's far below that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting debut picture, but nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face facts here. If Mr Scorsese hadn't gone to do masterful pieces like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, none of the comments here would be giving this film glowing praise.Perhaps I was expecting too much when I sat down to watch Marty Scorsese's debut feature, but I found it difficult to sit through all 103 minutes and was becoming bored and restless after the first 20. What little plot there is doesn't appear to go anywhere fast and the relationships between the primary characters are not explored in any depth and don't advance at any point.That being said, when I looked at the film from the point of view of Marty's first full-length feature film, you can see all the elements of what he perfects in those excellent films later on... From all the grit and ad lib dialogue in Raging Bull to the unconventional camera movement that we see in Taxi Driver, they all have their beginnings here in Mean Streets. But as you might expect for a debut feature, they're rather harsh and uneven here... Like an uncut diamond.In summary, it's a curious piece if you're a die-hard fan of Scorsese and/or Bob De Niro and/or Keitel, or you're a filmmaker (like me) who wants to see how successful directors started out. But if you're a mainstream movie-goer, I doubt you'd be impressed with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful dark atmosphere, but overall disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese has made some brilliant movies in his life, but unfortunately this isn't one of them. I can't really call it bad, because the direction and the cinematography just drip with pure talent, but I have some major problems with the plot. Mainly, where the hell is it? The story doesn't just move at a slow pace, it appears to go in incredibly tiring loops. It starts of with Johnny Boy (a solid Robert DeNiro) owing a whole bunch of crooks money, which is a pretty riveting starting point. What does he do about it? What do the crooks do about it? Nothing, and that goes on for two hours. The whole movie appears to be Harvey Keitel endlessly saying he has to pay his debts, to which he refuses, to which he asks it again half an hour later, to which he like, makes up an excuse and goes to the movies, and all of it feels so redundant. The movie finally gets to the point in the end, but that doesn't really save it. It shows the sadness of the bad neighbourhoods in New York wonderfully, but that's really all I can say about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does have engrossing characterization, like all Scorcese films. Scorcese's trademark role characters, street-savvy dialogue, and slo-mo entry film techniques make it interesting to compare vs. his much later high budget films. The relationship between Harvey Keitel &amp; Robert De Niro, and the motley crew of the local bar is intriguing, but thats where the positives end. The plot line is a joke and leaves you scratching your head multiple times. And the end leaves no real takeaways or hard decisions from any of the characters. This film's 7.X rating is clearly due solely to the Scorcese name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first true Scorsese movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is a 1973 American film directed and co-written by Martin Scorsese. It is well known as the first film by Scorsese that caught the critics' eye as well as being the movie where both De Niro and Keitel gave their breakthrough performances. It also marks the first collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro, that until now has produced eight feature films. The movie takes part in the streets of Little Italy, where Charlie(Keitel),a devout catholic, tries to move up into the mafia hierarchy by collecting debts for his uncle Giovanni,the local capo while at the same time he tries to protect his flamboyant but irresponsible friend Johnny Boy(De Niro) who owes money to many loan sharks and to maintain his relationship with Johnny Boy's cousin Teresa. The plot revolves around these main characters and moves forward only by following Johnny Boy's trouble with Michael, a loaner who wants his money back. The use of the camera is wonderful as Scorcese adapts its movement depending on the persons taking part in each scene. The acting is very good, especially from De Niro and Keitel but the film's thin plot makes it boring at some points and that is the film's drawback. Despite that, Mean Streets is a classic movie and the one that marked the arrival of one of the best Hollywood directors, Martin Scorsese!My rating 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets, you do it at home.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is directed by Martin Scorsese who also co-writes the screenplay with Mardik Martin. It stars Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, David Proval, Amy Robinson, Richard Romanus and Cesare Danova. Plot finds Keitel as Charlie, a young Italian-American crook trying to work his way up the New York Mafia scene. But his way is blocked by Catholic guilt and his obligation to take care of loose cannon pal Jonny Boy (De Niro), who is in debt to hoods and doesn't seem to care.A film of significant firsts. It would begin the Scorsese/De Niro relationship that served cinema so well and it laid the foundation for Scorsese's hoodlum filmic empire. Viewing Mean Streets now is an odd experience, for although there are some great things to sample, the piece undeniably seminal in the history of American cinema, it also plays as a pretty straight forward film. There are no surprises in store, the trajectory of characterisations runs true and goes exactly where you expect it too. Had I personally watched it upon release in 1973 I'm sure I would have been a bit more awed, but it very much feels over-rated now, with some critical appraisals of it appearing to pump it up more because of its importance than for any narrative quality.As Scorsese goes for gritty realism, the story at the core lacks vibrancy. It's only when De Niro (jumping-bean) as borderline nutter Jonny Boy is doing his nutter Jonny Boy thing, does the picture actually perk up. The roll call of characters aren't engaging since they aren't fleshed out, the girl characters are badly written and the key bar-room brawl is very unconvincing. On the outside the picture is ace, opening our eyes to a scuzzy Little Italy, Scorsese a master at portraying an environment he knows so well, but it's all polish with no actual substance underneath. Tech credits are high, camera work, lighting and sound-tracking, all carry the hallmarks of future classics, but these things ultimately avert your gaze from the simplicity walking the streets down below.Raw and decidedly honest film making, but weighted down by desperately trying to pulse with religious musings, Mean Streets could have been the masterpiece some have made it out to be. It's not, it has weaknesses that we shouldn't be blind too, even if it does showcase some incredible talents that were about to enter the annals of cinema history. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gratest indie film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mean Streets," simply put, is the greatest independent film ever made. At the very least, it pioneered what modern audiences have come to associate with the best of indie cinema, and what, by the late '90s, has become so essential to our perception of so-called "hip" movies that the once daring and exhilarating techniques are now mostly used as frustrating cliches. The picture itself, made in 1973, is most famous for kick-starting three major careers. Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro later collaborated as a director/actor team on four more masterpieces: "Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull" "The King of Comedy" and "Goodfellas." Harvey Keitel, in the leading role, went on to play other memorable characters, like "Pulp Fiction"'s Mr. Wolf. Cast as Charlie , a small-time, young gangster in New York's Little Italy, Keitel struggles to make sense of his Catholic background and help his troubled friend (DeNiro) stay out of the powerful Mafia players' way. What seems to be a familiar scenario, used as far back as the classic Bogart/Cagney vehicles, gets an unusually complex treatment from Scorsese. A conventional, linear plot structure with big speeches and witty one-liners from main characters is abandoned for a grittier, naturalistic approach. The film consists of a series of telling episodes, related only through their participants. "Mean Streets" has much more in common with the works of Italian Neo-realism or French New Wave, rather than a typical gangster drama. Its unorthodox, original, yet unpretentious camera work gives the film an unprecedented vitality that young filmmakers have attempted to recreate for decades. Now commonplace shots, such as a subtitled introduction of a particular character, a fight sequence tracked through the four corners of a room in a single take, a swaying hand-held camera to create the sense of an alcohol-induced stupor, have all been popularized through this movie, a veritable Bible of dynamic cinematography. Another revolutionary aspect of "Mean Streets" is the virtual lack of a script. Most of the key scenes were almost fully improvised, thus sounding far more authentic than the old-style, theatrical delivery used in most American films up to that time. The actors' speech is so profanity-ridden that no screenwriter of the time could have possibly doctored anything even close. De Niro's flamboyant turn as a youth on the edge of sanity is unlike anything before. In fact,the swear-fests of later crime movies (and indie classics like "Clerks") owe a direct debt to his extraordinary performance as Johnny Boy. One of Scorcese's most groundbraking achievements was his incorporation of popular songs into the soundtrack. All of the icluded music originates elsewhere- Italian traditional recordings (Opera arias, Folk tunes) and for the most part, glorious, irresistable Rock'n'Roll of the early 60's (Motown, the Stones, Girl Groups, DooWop).The easily identifiable hits serve as atmospheric settings, adding an extra, personal dimension to any given scene. George Lucas' "American Graffiti", released in the same year, operated by the same principle, establishing a tradition that seems to expand with every coming year. As it is often the case with true independent cinema, "Mean Streets" was ignored at the box office, despite an underground acclaim which helped launch not only the great talents behind it, but an entire school of filmmaking.</fullReview>

I know those films were made after. But maybe I was expecting maybe a little too much. Robert and Harvey make a great pair together in this film. Before there was Joe there was Harvey.

		<fullReview>It's Martin Scorsese's early film and it's choppy and a little meandering, but it stands as his introduction to a subculture he was to describe in greater detail over the next twenty years or so, and he does it with flair.A bunch of the boys were hanging around in the Mulberry Street Saloon. Or somewhere. They all know one another. They give each other hugs and they celebrate the return of one of their own from Vietnam. It's full of ritual, and the dialog is evocative if repetitious."What's wrong wit chou?" "Hah? What's wrong wit CHOU?" "Waddaya mean?" "Whaddaya mean, 'whaddaya mean'?" The speech sometimes is strained but never difficult to understand. Medial consonants get elided. "Nothing" becomes "nun." "Business" is "biness." Sometimes -- let's face facts -- the dialog sounds improvised and fake. But the streets, the bars, the restaurants, the apartments with the crucifixes on the wall may be rich with friends, but they can turn mean too, because the bonhomie is conditional on the observance of the ritual code. You have to be a man of your word, a man of honor who pays his debts.Robert De Niro, as Johnny Boy, doesn't pay his debts. Not only that, but he goes out of his way to publicly humiliate the respectable man to whom he owes three thousand dollars, calling him a masturbator, laughing that no one else would be stupid enough to lend him, Johnny Boy, so much money. De Niro is totally pazzo, more than at the end of "Taxi Driver." Harvey Keitel is the sensible but self-sacrificing nephew of one of the local "businessmen." With Keitel, saving Johnny Boy is almost a religious duty. His hero is St. Francis, whose feast day is celebrated with the blessings of reckless animals like Johnny Boy.Keitel has a girl friend too, Johnny Boy's cousin. Like many of these intrigues, it's supposed to be kept secret but of course it never does and it leads to challenges and mano a mano conflict. There are a lot of fist fights in "Mean Streets" as well as a couple of shootings.There are some clumsy shots and a few camera tricks that don't work, but it's good that the film received critical plaudits because Scorsese was to go on and do some truly splendid and highly personalized work in the years to come. Well, I ought to mention that there are a few non sequiturs too. For instance, I don't know how you get from Little Italy in Manhattan to Greenwood Lake, New Jersey, by way of Brooklyn, New York. I think this is known as anatopism, which is to space as anachronism is to time. But then this is Scorsese's world. He put it together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel are fantastic in Mean streets. I'm not a huge Robert De Niro fan as every time i see him act, i just think to myself that he Robert De Niro trying to be somebody. This is not the case in mean Streets for me. Instead he plays a kid who is young and stupid named Johnny boy. His performance is brilliant and is most likely one of his best. Keitel plays Charlie who looks out for Johhny. The opening line of the film basically tells you everything you would want to know about Charlie.The film is gritty and shot in a documentary style with several tracking shots being carried out hand held. It takes the film 45 minutes to give you a clear plot and a clear understanding on what going to unfold. The last 20 minutes is directed perfectly with a palpable sense of suspense and is clearly the best ending you can give to this film. One negative would be that in the first half there literally no set pieces . Not a lot happens but saying this you get a clear understanding and fully engaged with the characters which makes the last 20 minutes outstanding.It not the best film that Scorese has ever made but it clear by watching this that Mean Streets was his main starting point to his successful career</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A look at life in NY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mean Streets', the earliest Scorsese film people have heard of, is the result of an on-form film maker, telling a personal story.One thing to immediately note about 'Mean Streets' is the performance of our two leads, Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro, both looking young and are full of energy. They deliver the goods, big time. They are both so watchable and make up at least half of the movie's appeal. In fact, 'Mean Streets' is an inherently watchable movie overall, helped by some fine dialogue and Scorsese's trademark energetic and involving camera-work. The main draw is the antics of the characters and their relationships rather than a high-stakes narrative. Dramatic things happen but don't relate intrinsically to the central plot: that of De Niro's character Johnny Boy, his debts to clubs, bars and old pals along with his long-suffering buddy Charlie (Keitel).In comparison to other Scorsese films (which is inevitably going to happen if this is not your first Scorsese), it is very low on scale and as mentioned before, low on stakes. This is no gangster epic or psychological portrait but simply a 2 hour window into the streets of New York. It is certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I didn't get the point. Then I watched again,again and fell in love with it. Mean Streets is somewhat hard to follow at first but the second time you see it, you realize this a great movie.You get to see the beginning of Scorsese's trademarks, like the wall to wall music, the classic rock Scorsese so frequently uses, narration by the main character, the Scorses style close up shots and the first teaming with Robert DeNiro.DeNiro plays a crazy neighborhood kid named Johnny Boy, who is in big time debt to smalltime mafioso's. Harvey Keitel plays Charlie an upcoming crook in Little Italy who feels to make up for his sins he needs to help Johnny get a job so he can pay off his gambling debts. What makes it more frustrating for Charlie is that Johnny doesn't take his help and puts off paying up, until the inevitable happens.Mean Streets was Scorses's, DeNiro, and I would have to say Keitel's breakthrough film. DeNiro shows like usual he can play any role and Keitel's inner conflict in this movie is spectacular. When people think of Scorses they think of Goodfellas and Raging Bull,well Mean Streets is the movie that set the mold for his style,which people forget.</fullReview>

If you ask me, I think Scorsese's movies suck a lot of the time.Containing some really badly-staged violence (with minimal bloodshed) and idiotic dialogue (punctuated by lots of dead-air moments conveniently masked by its rock music soundtrack), Mean Streets' biggest and most damaging deficit was actor Robert De Niro.As the asinine, Johnny Boy character, De Niro's annoyingly quirky mannerisms, along with his sickening fingernail chewing, really got on my nerves, big-time.All-in-all - I think Mean Streets was a movie strictly meant for the likes of mooks.

Why? because there's something deeply rooted in your mind, a conservative instinct that makes you root for the very things that makes you feel guilty your whole life ... you have a weakness, wanna get rid of it, but this is what you are, it's in you, in your heart, not in your mind, because mind can be softened by what happens inside your heart, but when the weakness is in your heart, you're doomed, man! I'm this guy, I'm Charlie, the weakness is Johnny Boy, it's the Streets, and the pain in your heart, feels like a pain in the ass! Marty's masterpiece is an impressive work in black and red, black like the stink and the nastiness of a world where you have to show balls bigger than your ego if you wanna be respected, and red like the stuff you're ready to get dropped from your body, to earn this very respect ... black like soul, like your soul, when it's supposed to be clean for your Family, for people you love and yet you know the evil stuff can't stop tormenting you, because this is your true nature, or what your nature invites you to feel ... black like the sheep you are, black like a leather jacket, black like the street, and red like the lost innocence.Your soul is a raped virgin, in the sheets of your life, and I spelled sheet the wrong way, God gave you innocence and -God forgive my blasphemy- viciously put temptation in front of you, you wanna be good, for God but you can't, this very failure is your own, it makes you what you are, like it or not ... Charlie is the way he is, he can't be otherwise, because he's torn between God, purity, white, Teresa, and friends, black, scum, Johnny Boy ... he gave his heart to the girl he loves, but his soul is still doomed ... Marty, whatever made you feel this way, some guys feel the same almost 40 years after! Where was I ... yes, black, like the beautiful stripper in Tony's joint, so beautiful, but Charlie almost feels guilty to have feelings for her, is it a matter of skin? or race? or is it because she's no white, white like the virginity guys in the neighborhood expect for their girls ... is color an excuse, an alibi to highlight the very idea that in this nasty world, girls are either virgins or whores? unfortunately, that's the way it is, that's the way of Charlie, of the neighborhood, of the whole Mediterraneen mindset, including mine ... I didn't love Mean Streets, I felt it ...You love a girl like Teresa, but you're trapped in the Mediterranean code of friendship, you feel like you owe something to guys you spend most of your time with, that's true, because this is what manhood is all about, a big bullshit enveloped in a sense of honor ... there is a scene where Charlie cleans his hands then watch himself in the mirror, what does he see ... nothing, the whole emptiness of a life that means nothing because something is clearly missing, he's naked, he's empty, hell, even when he dates the Black girl, he's afraid of being seen ... what's wrong with him? well, that's what manhood is all about, meanness combined with street-wisdom, which means a big bullshit enveloped with honor. De Niro is excellent, it's his best performance ever, Keitel was like a mirror for every average guy who tries to show courage when he feels fear, charisma instead of discomfort, trying to show he handles everything when he's totally losing control. And Scorsese, what can I say, man, you're a genius,because you made a guys movie that feels like the most anti-guys movie ever made. You make me feel guilty for so many things now, I don't know how I can redeem myself, am I taking this too seriously? Probably. But this is what your film is about, this feeling that slowly kills us until God put us in the path of deliverance.There are two kinds of deliverance, the one in Charlie's dream, he cums blood for God's sake, sorry for mixing the dirty and the Holy, but his dream couldn't have been more significant, he needs to get rid of the bad blood, blood, blood is violence (no, not a cliché, this is what red has always been about) violence is redemption, the other kind of deliverance is ... wait, it's violence, Charlie's dream was more significant than what I've thought. Everything is violence, the guiltier you feel, the more violence it will need to get you rid of this ... why God? I guess, that's the way it is ... the film illustrates its introducing line : "You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets." Is religion a bunch of good words with no substance? Maybe. But isn't manhood the same thing? or not? isn't manhood in this ability to get rid of all the stuff that makes you pretend to be a man, instead of being a man? Wait, is this movie existential ... hey? Maybe. Damn you Marty, you genius ...Let me now walk, with my feeling of carrying a steady cam on me, and walking around totally drunk by the greatness of a movie, as refreshing as ten cups of wines in a summer night, let me wonder what is a "rubber sandwich" and praying in the deepest of my mind, how God will make me redeem myself. My spirit floats in a Tarantella where my soul is hooked to a Rolling Stone's song... I scream, I sing, I hope this will be over, soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve and a half years ago I posted a lukewarm review of this movie on the IMDb. Not only was it somewhat unfair to Mean Streets, which is much better film than I'd previously believed, but it also failed to take into account context.Scorsese (and not "Scorcese" as I had it in 2000) hadn't really done a proper movie before this. There's a handful of shorts, which are genuinely quirky and charming, then there's his first feature with Harvey Keitel, though it was begun as a student project. Follow this up with the director working to order in the adequate but missable exploitation flick "Boxcar Bertha" and Mean Streets is, to all intents and purposes, his first professional work.What's surprising is that after presenting such a personal vision on screen and clearly having his own voice, he then discards screen writing for 17 years. With star Ellen Burstyn selecting him as a director for the likable project "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore", he becomes a man lensing other people's words, and seems content with that. His results for the rest of the 70s were varied - while not a terrible movie, Robert DeNiro playing his most obnoxious character in a two-and-a-half hour musical with Lisa Minelli isn't something the world particularly needed to see. Yet Taxi Driver, his first collaboration with writer Paul Schrader, is arguably the greatest film he ever made.Ultimately Mean Streets exists as more than a starting point to a very fine body of work. It exists in its own right a tightly edited, almost documentary-style depiction of criminal life, with Scorsese's key theme of Catholic guilt. A worthy first serious entry in his body of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ELECTRIFYING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible plot spoilersMartin Scorsese's second or third film (I'm not sure which) is most definitely one of his best, if not his best even compared to the likes of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. It all began after Boxcar Bertha, a small exploitation flick with David Carridine(who also has a small part in this film). The movie was frankly rubbish with only hints of Scorsese genius present. After being advised by John Millius and John Cassavetes to do something more personal, he did.The film is virtually plot less, revolving around Charlie's (Harvey Keitel) life in Little Italy as a small time hood, hindered by his eccentric cousin Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro, in one of his (unusually) raw and outgoing performances). The real aesthetic behind this picture is the religion incorporated into it. As a child Martin Scorsese wanted to be a priest (as I said, personal). But that is not the reason to watch this. Martin Scorsese's use of music and camera-work is simply outstanding and revolutionary. The opening scene in which Harvey Keitel wakes up in the night, looks in the mirror and then lays back onto his pillow, cutting in twice on his face to the opening three beats of "Be My Baby" (possible homage by Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill, cutting in twice on O-Ren Ishii's face with the three beats in the Battle Without Honor or Humanity montage), sets the tone of the film in what's to come in the way of music and camera-work. After a short scene in a church with Keitel, we cut to Tony's bar, the camera dolls up to the end bar with Keitel holding a shot of liquor with that voice-over playing, in slow motion with the Stones' "Tell Me(Your Coming Back)" kicking in at just the right time, it's just...ELECTRIFYING. It has been said that Scorsese sourced all of the music from his own record collection (cool!) If weren't for Mean Streets, there would be no soundtracks from various artists in films. Of course with a film that has no plot there's bound to be some dull bits, but are instantly forgiven because of the way the film is set up, it makes sense to have those dull bits to contrast with the electrifying bits. I mean can you imagine a film that has all of the excellent components I have mentioned above and not be an assault on the senses? It just works.Thelma Schoonmaker, Martin Scorsese's current editor for many of (if not all of) his films in the last 20, 30 years, has said in interviews that it is Scorsese that should be credited for the editing in Raging Bull and Goodfellas. It's not hard to see why she would say this as the editing in Mean Streets is on par with that of most of all of Scorsese's other films.As you will have probably already guessed, this film is brilliant, but many films are brilliant, what makes it special is that it was made on a budget of 100,000 dollars, with the cast being paid nothing and starting a beautiful between De Niro and Scorsese. It just goes to show how far religion, encouragement and music can go.94%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched this mess of a film some years back and seeing so many positive reviews on here I decided to watch again thinking maybe I missed something. Nope. Didn't miss a thing. Great actors and a great director don't necessarily make a great movie. This is a springboard for all of them to move on to better projects, nothing more.Every film and/or book must have characters you care about. Well, at least one character. But I couldn't manage to give a hoot about a single character during the entire movie. Not one.And what's with so much music? Scorsese didn't seem to know whether he wanted to make a movie with a story or merely throw a non-ending series of songs together. The final result was nothing but a jumbled mess.At least all the actors and director went on to produce much better works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. I was expecting something great considering it was Scorsese, DeNiro and Keitel. While the acting and direction were very good (plus an awesome soundtrack, with a good mix of song styles), the movie basically had no plot, and bored the hell out of me. At about the one hour mark it was clear that no fascinating story would emerge. The final violent sequence was cool, but could not make up for an hour and a half of nothing. The movie itself was well crafted, but the script (I don't mean dialogue) was terrible. How could somebody write that and think, this is a complete movie. No inciting incident to grab your interest (other than the cool characters), virtually no rising action, and I hesitate to call the final sequence a climax, because what is it a climax of? Taxi Driver and Goodfellas are way better. For all of you who think this is a great movie, what do you call The Godfather (made the previous year), the greatest human achievement in history? Because, just as a movie it is at least a thousand times better than Mean Streets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A totally boring film, coupled with a weak story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally when writing a review, I will give a brief overview for the film that I've watched. However, I'm finding this difficult with Mean Streets because the story was so weak that I'm at a loss as to what the point of the film was? I'll give it a try anyway...I think the main problem is that I was mislead by the plot summary and when I read that it was about a small time hood trying to succeed on the mean streets of Little Italy, I thought it would be about an 'outsider' trying to get accepted within the firm. Instead of that, we get Johnny Boy (De Niro) who is already in a firm who seems to go out of his way to deliberately upset everyone. The struggle that Johnny Boy faces is that he has no conscience and no morals and doesn't care about anyone but himself. The problem is that we never learn why he behaves like this. This is never explained and the audience are just expected to accept it. This automatically put a slight downer on the film for me as Johnny Boy was an unlikeable character.I was also a little surprised by some of the music that was chosen in this film. At one point, there was a fight scene with 'Please Mr Postman' playing in the background. Then later in the film, there was some really silly music playing in the background for what was supposed to be a tense scene thus removing all the tension. What was all that about? Was Scorsese on drugs when he came up with this? Character development was also poor meaning that ultimately there weren't any characters that I could connect to.I could have perhaps slightly forgiven the odd choice of music and the lack of character development if the film had even been moderately interesting, but it wasn't. In fact, it is probably one of the most boring films I've ever sat through. There seemed to be a lot of chat, but with very little plot development.The only very minor positives to this film are that the acting was generally OK and the direction was also good.I'm shocked that this is by the same man who brought us great films such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas etc. Scorsese is a talented man, but Mean Streets was truly dreadful. I can only put this mess down to Scorsese suffering from a temporary lapse in sanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The films of Martin Scorsese: The Mean Streets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mean Streets (1973) is the quintessential gritty urban drama. Forget about Goodfellas, this is where it all began. Scorsese filmed this movie with a street level attitude. The acting, writing and directing have never been better (before or since). I feel that it's a realistic look at the lower level Mafia. These guys are the ones that make the system work. Without their blood and sweat, the system would never run properly. These characters are flesh and blood instead of cartoon characters that are highly exaggerated.Harvey Keitel stars as Charlie, a low level mafia kid who wants to rise above his rank. He's a conflicted guy who's all hopped up on Roman Catholicism. Feeling guilty all the time, feel always feel like he must repent for something. His running buddy is a low life named Johnny (Robert DeNiro). Johnny's always getting into trouble a he enjoys giving the wise guys headaches. He's just a nut job that does dirty work for the local mafioso. But as Charlie tries to rise up the ranks, the harder it is to control Johnny. There relationship raises some questions. Can Charlie keep Johnny in check? Will his hard work ever be noticed by the neighborhood godfather? All these questions and more will be answered when you watch MEAN STREETS!!!Highest recommendation possible. It's one of the essentials!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average early Scorsese flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was above average but not up to par with some of Scorsese's later works. Its an important movie in cinema history because it starts the collaboration between Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese and some of the traits in this movie would be perfected in his later works. The performances by Harvey Kietel and De Niro are excellent and very convincing in the roles that they are given. Kietel plays as a guilt ridden person who is trying to rise up in the Mafia while trying to handle relationships between his friends, his girlfriend payed by Amy Robinson, and his gambling and in debt friend Johnny Boy played brilliantly by De Niro. What I liked about this movie were the performances and the dark gritty feel that this movie gave off. What I didn't like was the story because it didn't seem to go anywhere and it didn't make a point which made the movie boring and dragging at times. And I also didn't like the way the movie ended. I would only recommend this movie to hardcore Scorsese fans and especially those who want to see his earlier work and young Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in their earlier roles. 7 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorcsese's early mob movie, and a warm up for Goodfella's stars Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro as Charlie and Johnny Boy, two friends with ambition to rise in the New York Mafia. Charlie is a very confused young man, as he attends a local Catholic church regularly, despite his criminal activities. The director's strict religious upbringing is evident throughout; with shots of crucifixes and statues of saints, used as the predominant background to the story. Charlie collects debts for Giovanni, a capo, and is secretly dating Johnny Boy's cousin Teresa, who has epilepsy. Johnny has a gambling problem, and owes money to loan sharks. The two end up in a confrontation at a bar with a bookie looking to collect from John. They get into a car to escape the bad situation, and are chased by the loan shark and his associates. It turns into a standard shootout, with a predictable ending.Scorcese always ponders the meaning of life, with predominantly Catholic overtones. I was also raised in the church, and I can respect the beautiful and iconic symbolism of the denomination ; it makes for great visuals. Mean Streets is gritty, and Keitel and De Niro are a hell of a pairing. Martin's work is never boring and alway's thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expertly crafted but the story lacks punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mean Streets" is mainly remembered as Martin Scorsese's first great film. It stars Harvey Keitel as a small-time hood trying to make his way in New York's Little Italy. Things aren't going too smoothly, though, mainly because of vouching for his unreliable friend Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro).Martin Scorsese's directorial prowess is unquestionably the main draw here. The film is steeped in Scorsese's style and is remarkably refined even at this early point in his career. One typically trademark scene is the slow-motion intro of Johnny Boy to the music of the Rolling Stones' "Jumpin' Jack Flash".The acting is solid with Keitel, De Niro and company delivering performances that feel authentic. The only performance that I didn't really care for was Amy Robinson, as Keitel's girlfriend Teresa.The story isn't necessarily a bad one but I felt that it didn't really accomplish much. The film's theme, which is stated right away, gives an insight into Charlie's motivations but it doesn't seem to me that much is done with the idea. Also, the activities of a small-time hood may have been accurately shown but I felt that they just weren't that interesting.Watch this for the excellent direction by Scorsese but don't expect a film that's as enthralling as "GoodFellas" or as fascinating as "Raging Bull".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family Business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) It's hard for tough guy outside but soft touch inside Charlie Cappa, Havey Keitel, to make it big in the family business as an up and coming Mafioso with his involvement with both crazy Johnny Boy Civello, Robert De Niro, and his high strung and epileptic cousin Teresa Ronchelli, Amy Robinson. Told by his uncle Mafia Don Glovanni,Cesane Donova,to stay away from Johnny Boy and Teresa for his own good and the good of the Cappa family Charlie was up to his ears with both of them. Charlie gets stuck by vouching for Johnny Boy to get a loan of some $1,3000.00 from mob Shylock Tony Devenazo, David Proval. He's also in love with Teresa ,epilepsy and all, which in the end caused Charlie more suffering and headaches then even he, a very guilt-ridden young Catholic man, could have imagined even in his wildest nightmare.Johnny Boy who was delinquent in paying Tony the money that he owed him was now starting to get more and more crazier in his actions where he wasn't showing up to his job at the docks as a loader. Even worse Johnny Boy was openly flaunting his screwing of loan-shark Tony Devenazo out of the money that he loaned him. That made Tony's patience with Johnny Boy, as well as Charlie, reach its limits. Charlie's relationship with Teresa was also getting out of hand with a desperate Johnny Boy, wanting to get Charlie to pay off his debts, slyly threatening him in revealing the news of his unwanted romance to his Uncle Don Glovanni. If Uncle Don he ever found out all this he would not only cut Charlie off from all family business ventures with Charlie desperately wanting to run one of his restaurants but even having him kicked out of the mob family, the Cappa's, all together! with that, being a hoodlum and mobster.Trying to get Johnny Boy to at least attempt to pay back his debt to a very angry Tony has him start to lose it, getting even more crazier then he already is, since he just can't cope with the pressures that he and only he put on himself. Cousin Teresa is so upset over both her precious Johnny Boy possibly getting his brains beat in by Tony's goons and Charlie breaking up with her that she suffers a major epileptic attack that almost kills her.In a final effort, after he made a complete jerk of himself, to save Johnny Boy from the fate that awaits him in welching on his loan-shark payments Charlie tries to hide him out in the suburbs until the heat blows over. It's then when Cahrlie is ambushed by Tony &amp; Co. as he Johnny Boy and Teresa were driving off the Brooklyn Bridge exit. With that the final curtain rang down on this modern day "Romeo &amp; Juliet" Shakespearian tragedy as "Mean Streets" came to it's bloody as well as very predicable conclusion.Eerily filmed on the mean streets of New York City and in garish color "Mean Streets" was a forerunner to many future movies that its director Martin Scorsese made over the last 30 or so years together with it's two main stars, virtually unknowns at the time, Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Shockingly realistic and hard hitting the movie "Mean Streets" in many ways even outdid Mafia classics like "The Godfather" films and "Goodfellas", also directed by Scorsese. The films raw power and authenticity in that it was made on a shoe string budget more then made up "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" tens of millions of dollar budget, with major stars in them, to make!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favourite Scorsese flick, favourite deniro flick, favourite mob flick, favourite on pretty much every category it enters.The opening sequence will forever be ingrained on my mind: "You don't make up for your sins in church, you do it on the streets, you do it at home, the rest is bull**** and you know it." Followed by the home movies of the gang you will come to meet with "Be My Baby" by the Ronettes playing in the background.You're introduced to the characters and it's pretty difficult not to fall in love from the outset. The film is about 90 percent ingrained in my memory completely. Yes, there are that many memorable scenes.It's not so fast paced and the plot is a very simple and small one. The important thing in this film is the character. The film is enjoyable as it takes you through the characters' actions. This film is enjoyable from the moment the music starts playing to the final confrontation which, unlike most character based films, is a fantastic ending to the film.Sure Goodfellas had the great story and the fast paced action and thrills set over a long period of time. Sure the Godfather was a grand epic saga of three films which became a household name. But Mean Streets feels like good old fashioned film making.As Charlie himself says: "Let's go da movies!" Maybe in this day and age of sequels and remakes and remake sequels, there may be a shining light. Another film with the charm of this one, the film, that I believe, opened up the 70's film-making renaissance, which arguably ended in 1983 with Raging Bull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's most personal film even though he never really knew the character of Johnny Boy himself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the more accomplished Goodfellas and Casino you could argue that this is far from Scorsese's greatest film. However, one cannot overlook the fact that it is a very good film compared to other films by young directors. Scorsese really was part of the great directors who emerged in the 70's, right along side Coppola, Spielberg and Lucas.Harvey Keitel's character, Charlie was Scorsese's alter ego and for a while Scorsese even wanted to enter the priesthood. Charlie is torn between a life on the streets and his religion. He wants to be a saint but he can't tear himself away from carnality and most of all crime. Therefore, he chooses to be friends with Johnny Boy even though he knows that it will get him in trouble. Johnny Boy, played by De Niro, is a buffoon and a ticking bomb ready to go off every minute. His sister, Teresa, is also Charlie's girlfriend and she is the cataclyst that will later tear Charlie and Johnny Boy apart.The performances by the three leads, Keitel, De Niro and Amy Robinson are very good but the film belongs to Scorsese and after you've seen it you feel exhilarated. Like most of his films there is wall-to-wall music and it gives it a certain ambiance that is Scorsese's signature. He used it again in Goodfellas and Casino. Like so many of the 70's directors he has stumbled in later films but every film he has made cannot be ignored and has some good qualities, even the rather disappointing Gangs of New York. Though I haven't seen The Aviator yet, it will be one of the best films I will see this year I am sure.</fullReview>

Deniro gives one of the best performances of the 70's. Harvey Keitel gives one of the worst performance I have ever seen. The only scenes Keitel was good in were the scenes with Deniro. I think Harvey Keitel gave his best performance in Taxi Driver. But Deniro just tore this movie apart.

This was also great because of it's raw realism. Many people have said that this is the only movie to truly portray the Lower East Side.The acting is what makes this movie. Harvey Keitel does an outstanding job as a level headed gangster who tries to keep things in order. Then there is Johnny Boy (one of De Niro's best performances), a low life thug, who is mentally unbalanced and doesn't give a damn about anyone. Charlie is always trying to help Johnny Boy and keep him out of trouble, but when his debt collectors come after him, things get messy.A great movie that marked the beginning of Martin Scorsese's career. This is not a very well known movie, probably because it was not the style of gangster movie as the Godfather, but more realistic, but I think it deserves a lot more recognition. I think that anyone who likes gangster movies or Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, or Harvey Keitel, because this is truly a great piece of cinema. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keitel and DeNiro: what a pair!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny how they started off as great actors, and still are even today!!! This movie seems so stylish, so polite, and so naive.....with the strange traits of loyalty among hoods that our politicians couldn't BEGIN to emulate!!!The violence builds all through the movie, so that when it actually happens you have been ready for it and just wondered when. The whole cast is excellent, and the juxtaposition of the church's revelry with Keitel's character reminds you of a time when the influence of the church actually made a difference in the way people lived their lives. Today, the preacher has to take a poll before he can come out against sin. And Lord forbid, if he should take the 'wrong' stance...forget what the gentle Jesus might have done!!Of course, they have to have the homosexual to ridicule in here, so maybe we've come a little further along the way toward acknowledging people's differences. Excellent movie; see it back to back with 'Taxi Driver' and then jump to 'Great Expectations' for a de Niro festival of your own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elsuive as character study, but captures a mood and milieu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extremely comprehensive movie remains elusive as a character study but certainly captures an overall mood and milieu - often through very short snippets of incident sketching the strange mix of self-indulgence, grandstanding, violence and dealmaking, with the parallel warped notion of responsibility and respect for family and elders, all overladen by the fact that they're such inherent small-timers (as exemplified by the scene when they take two kids for $20). The influence of Catholicism and ritual is pervasive but hard to initially grasp - Keitel's testing of himself by holding a hand to the flame; his almost perverse loyalty to De Niro through everything; his colourful relationship with Teresa (essentially loyal despite her epilepsy) - clearly a search for stability, even for some idea of family: it's an environment that spawns moments of great intimacy hand in hand with vast alienation - the camarderie and the violence are equally vivid. De Niro's performance though almost seems too mannered, too ingratiating to create an eccentric portrayal of waywardness. It's the epitome of an early work - less thematically accomplished and more stylistically ragged than the more mature films, and all the more appealing to some because of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scorcese's style virtually intact from the off. Superb acting from De Niro and Keitel. The pool-hall brawl scene, the scene where De Niro explains to Keitel why he missed a payment and the scene where Keitel is drunk are all worth watching the film for on their own. Paper-thin plot (getting involved with crime can get out of hand and not be very good for you), but draws you along so that you don't notice until it's all over. 'Goodfellas' is much better (and so is 'Casino' for that matter), but this is an important stepping-stone in the history of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull, disappointing movie, though with hints of Scorsese's greatness to come.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having an appreciation for so much of Scorsese's better-known films and believing that most artists/musicians/directors' best work is the earliest work, I expected perhaps too much of this movie. Instead, I found it ponderous, poorly edited, an uninteresting plot with even less interesting characters, DeNiro's excepted.While Scorsese captures the New York City of the early 70s well, Harvey Keitel's talents are largely untapped, and I found myself wondering why there was no apparent movement in the plot 45 minutes into this film. With DeNiro's standout performance being that of a completely unlikeable character, the final climax of the film left me, well, uncaring and glad the credits were rolling.Watch this if you're a Scorsese fan and want to say you've seen all of his flicks. Otherwise, don't bother spending two hours you can't get back watching this snoozefest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Di Niro steals the show here as a crazed dim-wit who owes just about everyone money from gambling and has an inability to pay off his debts. He is protected by friend Harvey Keitel, an aspiring hood with a big-time gangster for an uncle, Cesare Danova, in probably one of the latter's last films.The action takes place in little Italy and gives us the feeling of the period of time involved.I wish this could have been more a character study, though attempts are made to provide this. Martin Scorsese, who directed, tries to provide this and appears at the end of the film in the shooting scene in the car.The film may be criticized for providing the stereotypes at that time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody And Acclaimed But Predictable And One-Note Contemporary Gangster Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie is a small-time loan shark in New York City, angling to improve his status. His weak spot is his volatile friend Johnny Boy, who has debts all over town. Should Charlie look out for his buddy or cut himself loose before Johnny's sins catch up with him ?This was the young Scorsese's make-or-break picture; he'd been working on exploitation films for Roger Corman in Hollywood but decided to return to New York to do Serious Drama. A brave move artistically, and the result is a cult classic depiction of modern-day gangsters and hustlers with the first of the much-celebrated psycho DeNiro performances. The cast are all good, but Keitel and DeNiro are both outstanding, perhaps the definitive Italian-American macho-hoodlum-goodtime players, constantly pushing each other, idiot grinning, acting like kids and boosting their self-image. It has many stylish moments, like the much-copied slow-motion moves in the bar or the ingenious shot where they strapped the camera to a drunk Keitel. However, the big weakness for me is the plotting, which is almost an afterthought - crazy guy borrows money and doesn't pay it back so a mobster shoots him - it's really just an excuse to examine the characters and that's not enough for a movie. Charlie and Johnny Boy are interesting, but not that interesting. For me, Taxi Driver is a much better film because it's an equally intense character study (which a much subtler and more effective DeNiro performance) but it also has a brilliant story which winds up and up towards its explosive finale. Still, this is an effective low-budget slice-of-life drama and is the young (he was thirty) Scorsese's influential calling-card movie. Many of the exteriors were shot in the Little Italy neighbourhood of Manhattan where he grew up, and he also provides the dogmatic, effective voice-over narration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rough and ready by comparison with later work but still engaging, stylish, energetic and roundly well delivered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie may be small time but the authority and standing of his Uncle Giovanni in the community of Little Italy offers him the chance to become more than just a local hustler. One of the things he should be careful of is the company he keeps and who he stands with. Unfortunately Charlie is very protective of his cousin Johnny Boy, who seems determined to borrow as much money as possible, gamble it away and not pay it back and also in a relationship with Johnny's relation Teresa. While the fun and energy of the street life continues, dark consequences of all these things threaten Charlie and those around him.It has been years since I saw this film and I noticed that I had last watched it before I started reviewing. As a result I watched it again yesterday to refresh my memory. Seeing it with older eyes is an impressive experience because I appreciate what Scorsese has gone on to do and found it fascinating to look back on this, one of his earliest films. The plot is a mash of characters and events that come together to create a sense of place that is convincingly done; the overall narrative focuses on Charlie, in particular where his relationships are taking him but this aspect ebbs and flows with the events. It is funny, violent, personal and engaging, only a few aspects come over as weak. The script flows like real dialogue, producing the different moods of each scene and also being memorable and rough.The style and direction of the film are impressive and it is interesting to see the influence Scorsese had with this and his other films. The techniques employed here will ring bells with anyone who watches modern cinema and television with more than a passing interest, Sopranos in particular owes him a debt. Here we have the slow-motions, chest-mounted camera (I'm sure there is a proper name for it), impressive use of music and so on that we have come to be used to with Scorsese and one cannot help be impressed by how well developed these ideas were at an early stage in his career. Of course along with stylistic constants, several of the cast would become regulars. Keitel is the heart of the film for me and, although his opportunities in the script are surprisingly limited, I felt he did well with the themes handed to him. De Niro of course catches the eye more because of what was to come but also because he has the more energetic character. Robinson didn't make much of an impression on me but the support cast features early turns from faces such as Proval, Romanus, Argo and others.Mean Streets might be a bit rough and ready when placed next to the polished films that Scorsese would go on to do but it does not take away from its strengths to look back at it. So much of Scorsese's style and calling cards are in place even at this early stage and his film convincingly creates the streets and characters of the place. The main players involved have done better films since this one but it is still strong, stylish and interesting and definitely worth a look for anyone who has since any other Scorsese films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The REAL 70's landmark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I decided to watch MEAN STREETS a few weeks ago, I read many reviews from critics and IMDb users, saying that this movie is "AVERAGE", and not one of Scorsese's best, but an "ok" film.I caught the last 20 minutes of it on TV years ago, but I was just growing up back then, and flipped through channels trying to find cartoons, I never knew who Scorsese was(shameful, hey I was like 12!) After watching it, I just flipped through channels again.Now at age 16, I just about bought it at rogers video, but it wasn't in stock, so I just rented it to see if i even liked it first.After watching it the first time through, I was uplifted. After watching it for a week straight, I couldn't stop. I was sad to have to return it. To me, this film is many things. It reminds me of me and my friends, sometimes loose cannons. We get into arguments, sometimes we fight, sometimes we talk it over without pulling punches. This film was about friendship and betrayal. I remember that I owed money to a friend once, I never payed him back, it was 40 dollars. After two months, I got a broken nose. Mean Streets to me was just so realistic, and for its budget, It was so well done. This movie gave birth to Scorsese's real talents, this film let him express the world to us, as seen through his eyes. Knowing the film was based on Marty's life, I was really excited to see it, and I was very happy to see myself connect to him the way I did, and maybe you did too.From the first time I saw Robert as "Johnny Boy" in this film, blowing up a mailbox, I told myself, "This is the c00lest dude ever" and even though his character was unlikable to many, he is my favorite Di Nero character to date. Johnny Boy really reminds me of me sometimes.This film is criticized by people a lot, saying that it is "pointless, and random" and I say its anything but. And people who say the bar fight scene was too "fake" I still disagree, it was a great fight scene, especially when Di Nero breaks the pool stick and goes nuts on everybody, never gonna see that anywhere else anymore, trust me.SPOILERS*********DO NOT read the next 4-5 lines!!The last scene with the car crash, I loved the way Marty sped up the frame rate when it just hit the fire hydrant, and the music ends, just beautiful! one of my fa scenes! and i was shocked by Di Nero's reaction to getting ****. END OF SPOILERS!--Mean Streets, my 2nd favorite Scorsese movie, Taxi Driver being Numero Uno. 10/10 Recommended for any fans of Scorsese and great actors like Di Nero and Keitel, a true American classic from one of the greatest directors and best actors around! VOTE IT TO THE TOP 250!</fullReview>

Along with a musical score that really added dimension to the film, I got to see some over the top acting by Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, and superb direction by Martin Scorsese.I know that Scorses used some techniques that were original for the time as I have not seen them before. They really worked well.I have to admit that I was looking for something along the lines of Goodfellas and was surprised that there was only one shootout in the film, but I won't complain as the story of Keitel's character and his struggle to work it out with his religion, his girlfriend, and her crazy cousin (De Niro) without getting in trouble with the Mob was brilliant.The only criticism of the movie I have is the ending.

		<shortDescription>An interesting start for Scorsese, but a mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening with a projector showing a home video of the characters in the streets of Little Itlay, New York and ending with a violent drive - by attack, 'Mean Streets' chronicles the violent and often dark life of Charlie (Harvey Keitel) as he tries to make something of himself but is ultimately pulled down by the cruel setting.Charlie is a kind but sometimes too kind man who more or less works the streets of Little Italy. He rarely does anything too big, and hangs out at a bar owned by Tony (David Proval). The main boss in his area is Michael (Richard Romanus), an intelligent but ultimately violent man. Charlie's uncle, Giovanni (Cesare Danova) is also a crime boss but Charlie pays him a lot of respect and does his best to satisfy both him and his uncle. The love interest in the story is Teresa (Amy Robinson), an attractive but often harsh woman who Charlie loves but argues with. The main trouble for Charlie is Johnny (Robert De Niro), Teresa's cousin who's a degenerate. He owes money to everyone in the neighborhood, especially Michael and constantly tries to dodge those who he owes money to. Charlie and Johnny are buddies, and perhaps Charlie is the only buddy Johnny has but it drags Charlie (and Teresa) down in the end. Johnny owes Michael $3,000 but constantly doesn't pay and tries to sneak around with some help from Charlie. The main relationship of the film is between Johnny and Charlie, as it displays the true nature of his character. Charlie is also extremely religious, and often seeks God for strength and forgiveness.Martin Scorsese is often known for his gangster pictures, and 'Mean Streets' is one of his first major films, and in part his breakthrough. Through his screenplay with Mardik Martin, Scorsese shapes the rough and troubling world of Little Italy. The dialog is not quite verbose, it contains a raw style that Scorsese has since not used. His later films (Goodfellas) were much more stylish, but 'Mean Streets' is violent, brutal, and at times hard to watch. The language between characters sounds realistic and often slang is used. This adds to the realistic effect of the film. Scorsese as a director gives the film a documentary like feel, using hand-held very much and at times closing up very close on the characters to detail their expressions. His direction is uncompromising as these characters get torn up by the violent criminal world and by their own foolishness. Scorsese's direction for actors proves well here as he leads Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro into fine performances. This was De Niro's debut in a Scorsese film, and he went on to appear in most of Scorsese's films including some of his most renowned works (Raging Bull). Johnny is just plain unlikeable, but De Niro gives the performance a real feel, as does Keitel for the kindhearted Charlie who only wishes to help Johnny. However, the film's pacing is off and it at times is just plain dull. As mentioned, his later films are more stylish but even 'Taxi Driver' which was made on a limited budget has more appeal than 'Mean Streets' which at times seems to lose focus and in turn loses some of its ability to grip the viewer. Despite its running time of 1 hour 40 minutes, it feels much longer.'Mean Streets' is not a bad film, and its a very important film to see Scorsese's style as a director early on in his career. He later went on to make some very fantastic motion pictures such as 'Taxi Driver' and 'Goodfellas', and still continues to direct today movies like 'Gangs of New York' that encompass some of the elements of 'Mean Streets'. Overall, its a solid effort with some fine performances and good direction but the end result turns out to be mediocrity.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martin Scorsese's First Epic Masterpiece And One Of The Best Film's Of The 70's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am "J.M.S." and I have to say that I absolutely love this movie. I just don't know why this film isn't in the AFI top 100 films of all time and it's not even on the IMBD's top 250. "Mean Streets" was an independent project by Martin Scorsese in 1973. That didn't stop it from winning awards and especially for Robert DeNiro who got three for Best Supporting actor from three companies. However, the Academies never gave it credit and it is still a gem and recognized by many directors today. This was also Scorsese's first teaming with Robert DeNiro!(Spoilers ahead!!!, but read on...) This film is about the first generation Italian-Americans living in New York's "Little Italy". Here, we are treated to the story of Charlie (played by Harvey Keitel in one of his best performances) as a man who tries to climb the ranks of the Mafia alongside his Uncle, who is the boss. As he ascends to the top he is somewhat tempted by religion. It frightens him to die and go to hell as he tries to imagine what hell's flames must feel like, as he touches the fire that he sees around him to get an idea (candles, stove, etc.). He is also in love with a woman ,Amy, whom his Mafia bosses consider unsuitable because she suffers from epilepsy and her cousin is the biggest jerk in town. He is the romantic, funny, and crazy Johnny Boy (played with amazing talent by Robert DeNiro in one of his top roles ever!). Johnny Boy owes money to almost every mob guy in town . Johnny Boy is also best friends with Charlie, and Charlie seems to not stop hanging out with Johnny because he feels sorry for him as he were his little brother, even though Johnny is hated. Johnny's character is a scummy one, but his personality makes him likable since he just wants to have fun. At times we see that he doesn't care about himself and does foolish things (like blowing up mailboxes and dancing outside the street while in danger of being killed instead of running away) and then there are moments where he stops to thinks about the stupidities he has done (when he rests on the tombs scene). Also great performance by David Proval as Tony, the shy, happy, and smiling bar owner who is also Charlie and Johnny's pal; and Richard Romanus as Michael, the gangster who wants his money from Johnny Boy and seems to never get the respect he wants due to his pathetic ineptness.The music is awesome with 50's 60's and 70's artists. The intro song by the Ronnettes "Be My Baby" which is one of the best songs of all time, is great and in the intro there is a film strip playing the main character moments (Similar to the intro that the show "The Wonder Years" imitated years later). There is a lot of band playing due to the San Gennaro festival in little Italy.Here are the top Scenes:1.) The Intro.2.) Charlie and Johnny Boy's conversation about owing money to Michael!3.) The poolroom battle is a classic as well as the word `Mook'. Also , Tony cracks me up with the line "F*** YA'S ALL!", well, he says it funny...4.) The bar scenes with the Opera songs add beauty and power to the film.5.) The scene where Charlie and Johnny hop in a car alongside an annoying homosexual named Sammy, who starts shouting sexual obscenities out of the car's window at the men he sees. You can just feel the embarrassment of Johnny and Charlie being in a car with this guy. Also, Charlie's scene with his girlfriend is funny.6.) Charlie's fight with Johnny boy on what to do about the money that Johnny owes. Later on Johnny opposes Michael in a hilarious and great scene. That's all I can say, you've got to watch this!7.) This is the Best scene in the film. It's like a magical fantasy or something. Charlie is at a party and he gets so drunk that the camera begins to shake around his face, creating a drunken and high atmosphere. The best part however comes next when a crazed soldier comes back from the war and at the party, he begins to brutally beat a nice girl that he sees dancing with another guy for no reason. Charlie then takes her to his room and there, the girl seems to not utter a word and keeps her eyes closed. Her behavior is a mystery which adds to the film's masterpiece, then Charlie begins to dance with her while a sweet song is playing. Then she falls asleep in his arms and he lays her on a small bed for her to rest. That scene is so beautiful that it is enough to check out this movie alone, and is one of the best scenes of all time.9.) The ending. There is an opera band singing and as we see Charlie fall to his demise, the music makes it a powerful and depressing moment. As Amy, is injured and Johnny is killed (we don't see him die but I can imagine he did, it makes the story better). The scene also goes back to show what the other characters are doing at that time). Then we see Michael in a car with regret and then we a see a building and a woman pull down a curtain and then the movie stops. All in all, a remarkable and memorable ending.Robert DeNiro shines more than anyone, and Harvey Keitel is amazing as the lead character and together they are an awesome duo. Probably better than any other duo any of these great actors ever had. Get this film now and see why it is the epic that it is!

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's Breakthrough Feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets(1973) begins with a voice over of the main protagonist and goes into the opening credits. The opening credits have a family home movie feel to it. That's one of the things that is enjoyable about the film. It has a documentary feel to it. The opening credits is memorable because of the song "Be My Baby" in it. Would be the first of many colorful opening credits in a Martin Scorsese picture.Mean Streets(1973) is a classic in independant Cinema. Its a guideline for people who want to make films on their own. Major influence for a whole generations of future film makers who would use similar motifs as this film. Mean Streets for some unknown reason didn't get nominated for any Ocsars at the Academy Awards for 1973. Mean Streets(1973) is the ultimate anti-Hollywood feature film.The cinematography is both breath taking and outstanding. One scene where the camera work stands out is when De Niro walks towards Keitel in slow motion with two women by his side. The director shows in this movie why he is great when it comes to imaginative and creative uses of the camera. The slow motion shot as well as the flowing moment of the camera would become a Scorsese trademark. Mean Streets(1973) is made of some good use by the grittiness of the cinematography.The theme of guilt plays an important role in the lives of the main character, Charlie. This theme was first explored in the director's debut called Who's That Knocking At My Door(1968). The theme of guilt would become one of the major motifs in the career of Martin Scorsese. The way that guilt is presented is almost autobiograpical. Some of the main characters feelings of guilt is probably based on the director's own take on the theme of guilt that he has felt in his life.This was the first great film in the long and illustrious career of the great Robert De Niro. It was as the romantic Johnny Boy in Mean Streets (1973) that the actor made his mark in the cinema. He plays a character not unlike the ones played by Joe Pesce in both Raging Bull(1980), Goodfellas(1990) as well as Casino(1995). Robert De Niro showed here that he had presence as an actor. Mean Streets(1973) would be the beginning of a fruitful working relationship between actor and director.Was the film that brought recognization to the name of Martin Scorsese. Mean Streets(1973) was made at the sugestion of fellow filmmaker, John Cassavettes. Mean Streets(1973) was the start of a short but daring period that would end with the lousy box office results of New York, New York(1977). The movie showed that there was a new talent on the rise in Hollywood at that time. Martin Scorsese has moved on to other masterpieces since making The pic.Mean Streets(1973) differs from The Godfather(1973) in many ways. First, the former deals with mid level mafia while the latter deals upper level mafia. Second, Mean Streets takes a much more realistic apporach to life as a gangster. Third, The Godfather(1972) gives a romanticized look at the world organized crime. Finally, Mean Streets(1973) is somewhat based on the director's growing experiences in New York's Little Italy.Harvey Keitel is torn between loving and feeling repulsion for Johnny Boy's cousin Teresa because of her medical condition. The Madonna-Whore complex is another big motif in Mean Streets(1973). This motif would appear more explicitly in Taxi Driver(1976) and Raging Bull(1980). This theme first appeared in the film, Who's That Knocking at my Door(1968) and has been in every Scorsese film since. The Madonna-Whore complex also affects his feelings for a black dancer that he has a cruse on.Harvey Keitel is memorable in the role of Charlie. He's one of the best actors in Non Hollywood films. Has appeared in daring films such as Blue Collar(1978) and Bad Lieutient(1992). Keitel shows in this film that he is not afraid of tackling difficult roles that most actors would not take. He gives his greatest performance as the main character, Charlie.Martin Scorsese makes great use of pop music in this film. The music and the film's visuals make a perfect couple. My favorite scene in the film is when Johnny Boy tells off Michael who he owns money to with a funny line. Another favorite scene is the pool hall fight in the middle of the film. Mean Streets(1973) finishes on a note of redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The seeds of greatness are here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorsese's first personal movie is a gangster epic that has all the hallmarks of the director's tour-de-force style that would reappear later in his career: from the fresh tracking shots to the unnerving camera angles, particularly one sequence where a camera is strapped to Keitel and the viewer takes part as he stumbles into a drunken stupor. The only real difference between this film and later offerings like GOODFELLAS is the budget, which at this stage in Scorsese's career wasn't great. Nevertheless the director crafts a plot-heavy epic which really puts across a picture of life in the big city, possibly more so than his second collaboration with De Niro, TAXI DRIVER.The film is quite slow-paced, which may be off-putting to some, and there isn't a great deal of the director's trademark violence to punctuate the more mundane moments as in his later movies ? aside from the powerhouse climax, in which the red paint flows leaving the viewer feeling as if they've been punched in the face. Keitel is fantastic in the leading role and brings a real compassion to the part of the guy whose love for his friends gets him into serious trouble. However, as might be guessed, De Niro steals all his scenes here, as a small-time psycho who likes nothing better than to shoot his revolver from rooftops and beat up strangers on the street. De Niro is twitchy and deranged and scarily believable in this part, yet sympathetic at the same time too. He infuses his character with dynamism whilst at the same time invoking fear at the inescapable consequences of his actions. So, there you have mean streets: a typical enough gangster epic, infused with the energy of its young director and two stars, with enough originality, charisma, and hard-knuckle realism to make it a more than worthwhile watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Crime Drama!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Amy Robinson, David Proval and Richard Romanus star in Martin Scorsese's 1973 crime drama. This takes place in New York City where we meet Charlie (Keitel), a religious, small-time hood who tries helping others before himself including his in-debt, slacker pal, Johnny aka Johnny-Boy (De Niro) who owes money to loan shark, Michael (Romanus) which puts him in a tough spot. Robinson plays Johnny's cousin, Teresa who Charlie is romantically involved with and Proval (The Shawshank Redemption) plays Charlie's other pal, Tony who is a bartender. Scorsese also narrates and makes an appearance in the film. This is a good crime drama that kind of follows in the footsteps of "The Godfather" and Keitel &amp; De Niro are great in it as usual. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me start off by saying that I pretty much adore Martin Scorsese and his works, however Mean Streets ... is not his best film. Don't get me wrong It is a great movie but compared to things like Raging Bull and Hugo, It doesn't live up to the mark. Harvey Kietel and Robert De Niro do however work perfectly together on screen as two young and upcoming gangsters in little Italy, the chemistry between the two actors on screen is never in question during the film. De Niro plays a cocky young man in a ton of trouble with loan sharks, Keitel plays the opposite gangster that is also young but thinking somewhat maturely. It just works so well. Mind you, Mean Streets is a film that somewhat focuses on the acting and the direction rather than the plot unfortunately, but on the same hand it's kind of semi biographical about Scorsese's early years. So in conclusion to that, Mean Streets is well done in the casting, well directed but In terms of the plot department It could've done somewhat better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of a master !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Martin Scorsese had made a few movies before Mean Streets, this was the film that brought him critical acclaim for the first time in a big way and this was the film that showcased the birth of a master with a unique sense of style and cinematic language. The screenplay for Mean Streets written by Scorsese and Mardik Martin was based on a story idea by Scorsese himself. He really wanted to make a film about the life that he himself was very familiar with coming from an Italian-American neighbourhood. The film certainly feels very personal and has to be a cinematic reflection of his early life and experiences.I think a comparison between Mean Streets and two other Scorsese gangster films namely Goodfellas and Casino is interesting. While all the three do come under the bracket of gangster films, but I think Mean Streets is significantly distinct from Goodfellas and Casino in the way it is structured. Goodfellas is very tightly structured and the narrative always moves in a very specific direction. Mean Streets on the other hand is very loosely structured. The screenplay doesn't have a lot happening in it and the narrative is very episodic in nature. Scorsese uses this loose and episodic narrative structure to his benefit as it helps him to really pay attention to and develop the characters that make up the film. Charlie and Johnny Boy's relationship serves as the backbone of the film, but in reality Mean Streets is Charlie's story. The film is about him, his insecurity, his religious ideas, his friends, his neighbourhood, his family and last but by no means least, his guilt. Although Scorsese introduces all the boys of the neighbourhood i.e. Charlie, Tony, Michael and Tony with their own individual scenes that established them as the guys we will follow, but in reality we actually get inside the mind of only Charlie. Charlie is a fascinating character. Right from the first shot of the film, we get to be aware of the fact that he is a devout Christian and he really fears the prospect of having to pay for all the sins of crime that he has committed. Unlike his other friends, he is respectful of people and has a heart. He is respectful of the lord, but wants to serve penance in his own way which is to help the wild and slightly dimwitted Johnny Boy. He wants to save Johnny Boy and in turn get saved himself by God. He actually confronts many instances where he can choose what he wants and what is good for him, but we see him repeatedly choosing the opposite. He is attracted to the black dancer, but the collective racism of his friends prevents him from approaching her. He can get together with Teresa, leave this life and this neighbourhood, but he doesn't and cites the prospect of owning a restaurant which his uncle dangled in front of him as the reason to not go away. Like his other friends in the locality, Charlie is also plagued by a firm sense of insecurity. He knows that the life he leads is not ideal and he knew as a devout Christian that he will pay, but he is fearful of going out of this neighbourhood and going somewhere where he is not a big-shot. So he in his mind manipulates things to satisfy himself that by doing good for Johnny Boy, he is serving his penance without having to leave this life. So although in an explicit sense the bond between Charlie and Johnny looks pure with a firm foundation of brotherhood, in a way Charlie does all he does for Johnny mainly because of selfish reasons and his personal desire to serve penance and get 'saved'. Ironically it's this desperation to save Johnny Boy that brings Charlie down. These complexities in Charlie work majorly because Scorsese in his storytelling doesn't judge Charlie. He is presented as a normal person with flaws.Even at such an early stage in his career, we can see Scorsese experimenting extensively here with new and fresh ideas and techniques for the time. There are so many examples of fantastic filmmaking like the super 8 footage during the opening credits with the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby', the long Steadicam shot when Charlie enters the bar dancing with the Rolling Stones' 'Tell Me' playing at the back, Johnny Boy's entrance in the film with 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' playing, etc. I also love how Scorsese shoots all the scenes in Tony's bar in striking red neon light giving the bar a hellish look. I don't think the film is flawless. The editing in a few scenes is a bit choppy which is expected from a young filmmaker. There is an extended scene in the bar where a Vietnam Veteran is given a party. I thought that scene went on for a little too long and became a little too flashy and self-indulgent. Apart from that, the film is brilliantly directed.All the actors perform well but clearly the headliners are Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Keitel is absolutely brilliant in expressing the inner guilt and the complex and sometimes conflicting emotions distressing him along with his desperation to help out Johnny Boy. Robert De Niro in his first of many collaborations with Scorsese is absolutely dynamite as Johnny Boy. The manic eccentricity that De Niro gives to the character is highly impressive. Mean Streets isn't about the plot. It's about the characters and mainly about Charlie. It's about a character who is well aware of the fact that the life he leads is not ideal. But just like the boys in Fellini's 'I Vitelloni', the fear of exploring the unknown prevents him from abandoning the life he knows to pursue something new. Mean Streets gives us an glimpse of the beginning of one of the greatest filmmaking careers in all of film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A amazing movie that talk about friends, family, business, and conflicts over religion.Scorsese capture in a excellent way the New York of that time and also start to show the world what he could do, and Robert De Niro give one of his best performances in his career at a time when few people know who he was, his performance as Johnny Boy opened doors for his upcoming films. Harvel Keitel also give a very good performance as a man in conflict with his attitudes, his work and the prejudices of the time. One of the best films of the 70's and a masterpiece of cinema with one of the best director and actor of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you find yourself frustrated that even as Johnny Boy keeps messing up Charlie still keep embracing and protecting him, Scorsese has succeeded. In more ways than one this is the rougher, meaner prototype of Goodfellas - but instead of glamourising the gangster lifestyle Scorsese plays it for what it is, and doesn't evoke any unnecessary personal growth. We see Charlie's catholic roots long before they thrust him into moral ambiguity and conflict, and we can immediately tell he has the a sort of intense responsibility for the members of his family that drive him to increasingly wave away their transgressions or faults. Even as they drive to what seems to be certain death, they are like a little family on a road-trip, laughing and joking with each other in the car as if nothing was wrong in the world. Scorsese has drawn on his own experiences of growing up in Little Italy to provide a rich canvas of characters and quarrels that unfold naturally within this world. While Goodfellas was immaculately structured with even freeze-frames to highlight define moments in the narrative, Mean Streets is polar opposite, with incidents and periods of inactivity peppering the anxious survival of Charlie's family and his aspirations in the Mafia. Fights might break out while you watch a show at the club. A man at the urinal might be shot in the back without notice. These acts of brutality and violence are heralded by an operatic score that gradually normalises their graphic nature. The real scare for Charlie is his off-cuff friend Johnny Boy, who makes his initial entrance into a hazy, crimson lit bar on the backdrop of The Rolling Stones' Jumpin' Jack Flash. The moment is magnified in the slow motion and Scorsese pushes into to the wary Keitel as if to say 'look here, trouble comes'. If his Catholicism hadn't already been compromised, it was now. Then he disappears for a good part of an hour and all we hear are whispers of his increasingly erratic behaviour, dodging loan sharks and spurning the lowly job that Charlie had worked so hard to get him. He finds him drunken on the roof and firing off shots into the night, and the piercing sound of the bullets is so effective because the rest of the soundtrack is silent - each pull of the trigger further ramps up the anxiety of Charlie desperately trying to reign him in. Keitel is so key; his increasing anger and indignation at each of Johnny Boy's missteps is underscored by this shame and regret as if it was all his fault. There is a scene where they trade blows on the staircase and where they finally come to blows, but like fighting brothers it all becomes okay the next day. And we see that although Charlie is not afraid to let the profanities fly, he knows that a little slap is going too far. He is like a father that spanks their child but immediately regrets it. He mouths off at Teresa, then right away looks as if he needs to run off and place his palm over a flame. His tough guy persona doesn't have any heart to it. There's a sort of awareness of the cinematic gangster that Scorsese shows with the handling of these characters. Whilst they fire guns and hustle guys all day long, they back away and up onto furniture to avoid getting near a caged lion. As Charlie becomes enchanted with the epileptic Teresa, he refrains from saying those three words because they represent sin and weakness and his uncle would forbid it. She replies with more smarts than expected: "Your reputation's safe", but it doesn't ever drag into self-conscious or affectionate territory. He knows, and she knows, that Mean Streets is all about reputation, and how it is undercut by other ideas like love and loyalty and family. They are not easily reconciled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much To It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like I have to keep in mind this is one of Scorsese's earliest films since this film was such a bore to me. I thought I would be intrigued with what the film would have in store for me after the intro to the film before the credits. Harvey Keitel's voice-over which ties redeeming sins in with his life on the "mean streets."After the credits we are introduced to the four main characters of the film via titles. Robert De Niro plays a goof ball gangster who is unreliable and is often late on payments. This sets up a few fights/confrontations really well, so Johnny Boy can be viewed as a driving force of the film.Other than this, the film just kind of plays out however the plot seems fit. Keitel's character has a "secret" romance that doesn't seem to go anywhere important, and shows tension in his character's life. Ultimately, Keitel and De Niro manage to make enemies out of friends and end up in trouble at the film's finale. This is honestly all I can take away from the film; there isn't really a story and I don't connect with any characters. It has a nice aesthetic but that is about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is he worth the bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never clear at just why Harvey Keitel was putting himself out on a limb for Robert DeNiro in Mean Streets. Sure he's taken with DeNiro's cousin Amy Robinson still I'm not sure he was worth the effort. Keitel is a small time hood in Manhattan's Little Italy who's not really into it. DeNiro is another small time hood but he's completely and psychotically out of control. He's borrowed a few grand from local loan shark Robert Romanus and Romanus wants his money. Now during the climax scene DeNiro does ask a relevant question, why after he has borrowed and stiffed everyone in the neighborhood would you lend him any money?In fact Keitel is all that's standing between DeNiro and gangster retribution. Is it all worth it even for Amy Robinson who is an epileptic and for some reason Keitel's uncle Cesare Danova thinks that disqualifies her as a potential bride.The story is a bit muddled but the characters especially Keitel and DeNiro are unforgettable. Mean Streets made the career of both of them and of director Martin Scorsese. Keitel has become a valued character player and DeNiro a star with an astonishing variety of roles. In fact next to John Ford/John Wayne, Martin Scorsese/Robert DeNiro is probably the most successful director/player combination in film history. This must have been a labor of love since Martin Scorsese grew up in Little Italy grown a lot smaller since he was a kid there. No doubt Keitel, DeNiro and the rest are drawn from characters he knew. His mom Catherine Scorsese also makes an appearance as she does in many of her son's works.I don't think Mean Streets ranks up there with Casino, The Departed, The Aviator and Goodfellas, but it's an interesting work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambition, Loyalty &amp; Religious Guilt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mean Streets" is a gritty, low-budget drama that tells the story of a young man whose loyalties to his friend, his girlfriend and his religion all become incompatible with his career in organised crime. The action takes place in New York City's Little Italy where a group of small-time mobsters do a great deal of posturing as they attempt to prove to themselves and others that they've got what it takes to become important and powerful in their own neighbourhood and inevitably, their dealings with each other often become very unpredictable and volatile.Charlie (Harvey Keitel) is an essentially decent guy and a devout Cathloic who works as a collector for his uncle Giovanni (Cesare Danova) who's the local Mafia boss. Charlie's committed to his career but is also tormented by the guilt that he feels because his work and his religious beliefs are totally irreconcilable. His anguish over this conflict is profound but he's also troubled by the fact that his uncle disapproves of his long-time friend Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) and his girlfriend Teresa (Amy Robinson) and his uncle's feelings are so strong that he's made it clear to Charlie that unless he's prepared to distance himself from both Johnny Boy and Teresa, he won't get promoted to a more important role in his organisation.Johnny Boy is a reckless gambler who owes money to numerous loan sharks who are getting very impatient with his lack of concern about paying off his debts. Charlie's inclination to protect his friend regularly makes his own life difficult and frustratingly, Johnny Boy doesn't have the intelligence to take the good advice that Charlie gives him. Teresa is Johnny Boy's cousin and Giovanni disapproves of her because she's an epileptic and he interprets that as meaning that she's "sick in the head".Local loan shark Michael (Richard Romanus) is a low-level operator with delusions of grandeur who's desperate to collect what he's owed by Johnny Boy. When he asks for his money to be repaid, Johnny Boy's stupid, hot-headed reaction causes Michael's patience to reach breaking point and this precipitates a sequence of events that eventually culminate in the action that brings this story to its violent conclusion."Mean Streets" is notable for being the movie that brought the talents of Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel to a mass audience and also won them a great deal of critical acclaim. The movie's most striking quality is its authenticity which is mainly attributable to the fact that Scorsese (who wrote the screenplay with Mardik Martin) based so many of the incidents and characters on actual events that he knew about involving people that he grew up with in Little Italy. The interactions between De Niro and Keitel are also a highlight of the movie because their exchanges are often electric and display vividly how incredibly talented these guys were, even as inexperienced actors.The pop songs and Italian music that feature on the soundtrack are so resonant of the time in which the action is set and the culture of characters that they add immeasurably to the realism of the entire piece in a way that an original score couldn't possibly have achieved. The sheer intensity of this movie and its preoccupations with issues of ambition, loyalty and religious guilt are real strong points and make it both fascinating to watch and very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you know what the Queen said?? 'If I had balls I'd be a King.'....... Obviously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is a good early example of Martin Scorsese being an auteur, for his first New York based film he gives us a classic example of his art.You can tell his BA and MA have really paid off, he shows examples of French new wave cinema techniques and also Italian neorealism combined with his own now well known style to create a film that was not only gritty but funny.This was Martin Scorsese's third feature film and we can see he has already got a style in mind for his career, we have the bar tracking shot, voice overs, strong red lighting, religious background for the main character and also a heavy soundtrack all these elements can be seen in his 1990 film Goodfellas. Also he starts this picture with old home movie footage for the main character (played excellently by Harvey Keitel) which is similar to the cut scenes in Raging Bull.This was Robert De Niro's first film with Scorsese yet you can see a partnership would soon blossom, He plays the character Johnny Boy a care free yet out of control young street tough that owes money all over the neighbourhood, You feel for his character even when you know his actions are going to get him in trouble, In his introduction to the film he is seen blowing up a mailbox for no other reason then he found it funny.If you haven't seen this picture I would recommend it. The characters are believable and the narrative is simple yet deep, you get swept along for the journey into 1970's New York.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Arrival of Martin Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese had lead behind a magnificent achievement in his work. His work is compelled with images, sounds and characters that are worth watching and listening to. But in 1973, Scorsese open up a new kind of cinema. One that is filled with style and a hard look at a world that's more real than anything you could've imagined. Mean Streets was the name of his feature and sure enough, the movie packs a punch. The movie takes place in Little Italy, a small Italian neighborhood section in New York City, where two men leads different lives. Charlie, played by Harvey Keitel, is a honest man, who's careful about his decisions in life and those who care for him. However, Charlie teeters on the balance between losing respect with his fellow friends and his life. He's deeply religious and is characterizes as being a Catholic. He even test this theory by putting his hand over a open flame, playing with it. The other young man is Johnny, played by Robert De Niro. Johnny, unlike Charlie, is a irresponsible clown. He's the kind of guy that worth getting beaten up for his foolish and sometimes, dangerous actions. In the opening scenes of this movie, Johnny blows up a mailboxes, not even caring for those who's lives are in danger. He isn't deeply religious. Instead, Johnny is more of a smart-aleck, who's behavior is much more diminishing than Charlie. Both men differ in personalities. But, their connection with the neighborhood mobsters isn't anything similar or odd. Two men who have nothing in common but a will to seek different jobs. Martin Scorsese directs this film in the way it was meant to be seen. His world is like walking into a dream. The constant blaring of record albums echo throughout the movie, creating a dream sequence for the watchful. The world pulsates with songs from the Rolling Stones and other music groups that were around during that era. This was Hollywood as it was. Scorsese is an exception to the rule. His story-telling is very vivid and very well-told that we forget that all of it is being played for history-making. He definitely knows what the streets are and what the streets can do to people like Charlie and Johnny. It's a violent, gritty world in this ghetto, and even the strong will survive unless he can survive the harsh reality of the streets. One will build confidence on what and who he is. One will crack up and spiral out of control. Mean Streets is probably one of Scorsese's best works ever. In fact, it ranks up there with Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and The Departed. Those films were pure classics at their finest. But, Mean Streets is the one that started it all. Too bad it wasn't a blockbuster. This is one of the best films of 1973. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's 'Mean Streets' has Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel on the top of their game from early in their respective careers.An often overlooked film, there is much to enjoy for anybody interested in the first collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro.Make no mistake about it though - whilst De Niro is captivating in his role as Johnny, it is Harvey Keitel's Charlie that holds the film together. De Niro disappears for lengthy periods. His character - a loudmouth who owes money to everybody left right and centre with no intention of paying it back - is all the better for it. You an tell they had a lot of fun filming this. There are also strong performances from supporting cast such as Richard Romanus as Michael.With most great film makers the evidence is there in their early films and Scorsese is no different. There is some fantastic camera action going on here. There are also some well choreographed set pieces where everybody knows where they are meant to be at the precise second they need to be, all in one fluid shot with very few camera cuts or edits. The soundtrack and the lighting also really adds to the style and feel of this film.This probably won't be for everybody however. There is little story going on - just the everyday hustle of a few small time crooks. This is in many ways is the complete opposite of the style of 'Goodfellas' and 'The Soprano's' and certainly nothing like 'The Godfather'. The biggest concerns going on are small time loan sharking business and stolen goods. Ideas are picked up then discarded shortly after.So, watch if you're interested in seeing a master film maker at work with strong lead roles who would all go on to be part of some of the most important films of all time. See them before they became stars, in no small part due to this collaboration.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mean Streets" has been called Martin Scorsese's first masterpiece and rightfully so it is. Picking up where "Who's That Knocking at My Door?" left off; the film is not a sequel but a more complex and better version than his debut film.Wild and brash wise guy Charlie is climbing the ranks of the local mob collecting debts, while struggling with his Catholic beliefs and flinty boss Giovanni. Charlie occupies his days drifting the streets of New York and nights spending time with his best friend Johnny Boy who constantly ends up in trouble. When Johnny Boy is unable to pay his mounting debts, Charlie becomes caught in a dilemma by choosing between protecting his friend and succumbing to his life of crime.This is a more faster, superb and electrifying film than "Who's That Knocking" thanks to a more polished Hollywood feel without eliminating the raw, stylish touches of his feature debut. Harvey Keitel's performance as Charlie is a more confident variation of J.R. with his tailor-made suits and likable but foolhardy nature. Robert De Niro's skirt-chasing, party-loving Johnny Boy is something that we don't see often except for "Midnight Run" and the "Fockers" trilogy. Johnny Boy is a stark contrast to the psychotic, dangerous characters that would be associated in his later collaborations with Scorsese. Keitel and De Niro headline a collection of memorable supporting actors featuring David Proval, Amy Robinson, Richard Romanus, Cesare Danova, Victor Argo, David &amp; Robert Carradine and Scorsese himself in an uncredited cameo at the end of the film.Characterized by extended one-takes, witty improvised dialog, grim unpredictable violence, hand-held camera-work and a hell-of-a soundtrack, "Mean Streets" is the aggressive filmmaker's first work of art: an all-American, or should I say an Italian-American masterpiece of doomed machismo and religious guilt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good directorial debut, but maybe not exactly what I was after</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Martin Scorsese, a newcomer at the time of its release, must be credited for his direction taken with this crime film considering the year earlier brought to us the greatest crime film ever created, which is portrayed as a big and epic mafia film. However, Mean Streets is the complete opposite of Mean Streets. It has a low budget, has a small scoped story and takes crime films back a few years. Even with all the changes, Mean Streets is a rather enjoyable film by master filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who would later go on to make far greater films.This is where Mean Streets is separated from other crime masterpieces such as The Godfather Parts I &amp; II, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas and even other crime films such as the absurd Scarface. The story is such a shorter part of the story that the essential focus isn't always around the story but more so the characters. Here is where I have one of my issues. Whilst the story is told early on about Johnny Boy (Robert de Niro) owing money to many people in the streets and how he is basically a con, the story come to a point in the middle of the film with Harvey Keitel's Charlie and Teresa, Johnny's cousin which is all about romance which completely threw me away from the story. Not that romance is a bad thing, in fact it works perfectly in The Godfather but here, it felt as if the entire focus suddenly shifted which made my attention shift. From here, the story becomes less relevant until towards which is a rather pity considering that by the end of the film, the story folds up beautifully. It is truly a pity that a little more focus wasn't spent on the basic story.In one of his earliest films, Robert de Niro truly delivers a great performance as a semi psychotic teenaged man with a tendency to go off towards others and a tendency towards violence. De Niro completely embodies the character of Johnny Boy and is a rather pity that he didn't receive the role of Sonny in The Godfather in the previous year. The following year, De Niro keeps up his fantastic acting as Vito in The Godfather Part II and then as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. From Mean Streets, De Niro became an acting legend. Twenty years before Reservoir Dogs, Harvey Keitel starred in Scorsese's Mean Streets as an uncertain and much more friendly and thought provoking man by the name of Charlie, who throughout the film sticks up for Johnny and for others. Keitel too, delivers a fantastic performance. The rest of the cast all give good performances each being able to act to Scorsese's writing. De Niro shows strength, power, greed, violence and even corruption from an innocent boy to a thief. Keitel perfectly brings to the table what crime life can do to people and is used to separate others from him being able to illustrate what life is like for those who are involved in everyday crime.By now, Martin Scorsese is a masterful director but back then, he wasn't a name. In Mean Streets, whilst definitely providing a good premise and some fantastic actors, as well as an engaging script (just like all his other films), Mean Streets is easily his weakest film I've seen (I have not seen Hugo and his more recent work) Whilst a very interesting first act, the second act of this film falls underwater with the third act having to rise from the water which it eventually does. However, when viewed as one piece, Mean Streets can be a little tiring, a little messy and a little tough to relate to, especially when a love story is rather suddenly introduced and is eventually one of the central focuses. Whilst a definite good film with great performances, Mean Streets didn't meet my expectations but is nevertheless, a film that I enjoyed even though it can be a little messy as one film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Underrated,Overlooked Classic From Martin Scorsese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is an excellent,underrated and very overlooked film from Martin Scorsese and is not only a classic of the gangster genre,but also a classic of cinema in general and is one of the best films of the 1970s. Filled with great direction,excellent acting and a unforgettable soundtrack,Mean Streets is Martin Scorsese at his best.Set in the New York section of Little Italy,Mean Streets tells the story of Charlie(Harvey Keitel),a small-time Hood who is trying to rise in the ranks of the Mafia,while at the same time trying to defend and protect his friend troublemaker Johnny Boy(Robert De Niro)who borrows money and owns loan sharks.Released in 1973,Mean Streets is a classic film that sadly is not widely known to a lot of people but is known to movie buffs and Scorsese fans. It is also known for introducing us to one of the greatest director/actor team duos in film history in the form of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. One of the reasons Mean Streets is a great film is because Martin Scorsese takes the great genre that is the Gangster film and makes a personal story giving viewers a gritty and violent world where you do not make for your sins in the church but in the streets and at home where you either deal with guns,death or family. MS was a new kind of gangster film that was radically different from Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather which was released the year before which was more epic and romantic but it seems unfair to compare the two films because where The Godfather is more epic Mean Streets is dirty and rough. Mean Streets was a precursor to other Scorsese Mob and Gangster classics like Goodfellas,Casino,The Departed and Gangs Of New York because when you watch the film you feel like Scorsese saw and lived in this world and it feels realistic. It's interesting that Mean Streets was released the same year as George Lucas' classic American Graffiti,a film that depicts growing up in Southern California in the 1960s. While there is no similarities between the two films in terms of genre both are alike in terms of style and how they use music. Also where Lucas has characters and the neighborhood he grew up in,Scorsese does the same here depicting characters and a world he once knew so in some ways Mean Streets is a Coming Of Age Film,but where American Graffiti was a film about a bunch of teenagers holding onto the last grasps of teenage life Mean Streets is about a group of youths trying to survive a violent world. This is Martin Scorsese's own American Graffiti. The screenplay Co-Written by Scorsese is memorable and filled with natural dialog which makes the film's main characters feel real and from the streets. The characters Charlie and Johnny Boy are classic characters from Scorsese because both are truly different. Charlie is a character that is full of guilt and confusion because Charlie wants to rise up in the ranks of the Mafia but there are things and people all around him that prevent him from doing that whether it's the guilt of doing things he does not want to do or the confusion of helping Johnny Boy. Johnny Boy is a great and fascinating character because he's a troublemaker and does not care who knows it or not and despite Charlie wanting to help him Johnny Boy keeps borrowing money and does not change for anybody. But both Charlie and Johnny Boy are both complex characters who are trying to find themselves. The ending of the film is a great one because it's so shocking and surprising and doesn't answer a lot of questions about what happened to the characters and allows us as the viewers to fill in the blanks.The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Harvey Keitel is powerful and brilliant as Charlie,with Keitel bringing a complexity and depth to the role. Robert De Niro is excellent,unforgettable and at his best as Johnny Boy,with De Niro bringing charisma and intensity to the role an also has great chemistry with Keitel. An iconic breakthrough performance from De Niro. David Provel is great as Tony,a bar owner and friend of Charlie and Johnny Boy. Amy Robinson does a good job as Theresa,Charlie's girlfriend and Johnny Boy's Cousin. Richard Romanus is wonderful as Michael,a low level hood. Cesare Danova is fantastic as Giovonni,a local gangster who is Charlie's uncle. Also lookout for cameos from David Carradine(Drunk)and Robert Carradine(Boy With Gun).The direction by Martin Scorsese is excellent with Scorsese always moving the camera and using great camera and beautiful style. Great direction by Scorsese.The soundtrack in the film is amazing with songs from The Rolling Stones(Jumpin' Jack Flash,Tell Me),Cream(Steppin' Out),The Miracles(Mickey's Monkey),The Chips(Rubber Biscuit),The Ronettes(Be My Baby),Johnny Ace(Pledging My Love),The Marvelettes(Please Mr. Postman)and more. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro,Harvey Keitel,Gangster Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Mean Street,an underrated and overlooked classic of cinema that you can watch over and over. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's Candy Store</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a Kid let loose in a Candy Store Scorsese feeds his love and appetite for Movies with this groundbreaking pastiche of camera tricks and peppery dialog. It was quite a sight to behold in 1973. There was hardly anything like this and the opening of Independent Film acceptance utilized by young and energetic Directors gave this Dynamo a place to realize his Dreams and showcase his raw talent.This is a surprisingly rich Film for its budget restraints. But no amount of monetary restrictions could keep this Ateur from delivering a jam packed Picture with so much energy that it almost burns the screen. Two outstanding lead performances with a manipulator at the helm drives this gritty, reality based Feature. There is so much attrition here that it lays bare for all to reflect upon and wonder at the kinetic life these Mean Streets offered to the ground level inhabitants.If there are flaws it is in excessive verbosity. There are times when the ad libbing is a bit irritating and some of the Script seems over written. However it is all so grandly presented with so many innovative techniques and Pop Culture awareness that this is nothing less than the breaking barriers success that was the intent of the Creator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mean Streets Marks The Arrival Of Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is a crime film that stars Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. The plot examines the daily struggles of a wannabe hood to keep his morals straight on the streets of Little Italy.David Proval,Amy Robinson,Richard Romanus and Cesare Danova play key supporting roles.It was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Scorsese and Mardik Martin.Driven equally by his wish to become a respectable gangster like his uncle and his desire to live his life like St. Francis, Charlie takes on his energetically unhinged friend Johnny Boy as his own personal penance, intervening to get Johnny Boy to pay off a debt to the local loan shark Michael. Despite his promises to his epileptic girlfriend Teresa that they will move out of Little Italy once he strengthens his position in his uncle's world, Charlie's involvement with Johnny Boy further ensnares him in the neighborhood. When Johnny Boy decides to mouth off to Michael rather than pay him, Charlie, Johnny Boy, and Teresa try to flee Michael's murderous anger, forcing Charlie to realize that the rules of the streets do not mesh with absolution.In countless ways, right down to the detail of modern TV crime shows, Mean Streets is one of the source points of modern movies.It features an attention-grabbing performances by Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. Also,combining documentary-style realism; kinetic editing and camera movement; and expressionistic lighting, angles, and film speed, Scorsese presents an intimate picture of the trivial incidents and latent violence of Charlie's and Johnny Boy's world, ritualistically unfolding their experiences rather than simply explaining what motivates them. Overall,it is a powerful tale of urban sin and guilt that marks Scorsese's arrival as an important cinematic voice particularly in gangster films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro begin with a bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is a film that is constantly overshadowed by Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, GoodFellas, and rightly so because it is technically not as good as those but is must be respected for the fact that it practically made the careers of three great names in film, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese and Harvey Keitel. Mean Streets follows the story of Charlie (Harvey Keitel) and his two brothers Micahel and Tony. They meet Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) who is the guy who is in debt to every loan shark in town. Then the story goes on from there. The film is told with a spot of narration here and there but it is mainly pure dialogue. I must say that I did find that although the film is only 2 hours it does feel a bit draggy at times and that is why I did not give it a 10/10. The acting in this film was quite simply superb. Robert De Niro gives one of the best performances of his career as the flamboyant Johnny Boy and Harvey Keitel gives what is probably his career best as Charlie. Not often credited with this movie as much as they should are the roles of Charlie's two brothers, Tony and Michael. I think that these two do not quite compare to the acting of Robert De Niro but certainly do a wonderful and under credited job in my opinion. The other thing that was particularly noticeable about Mean Streets was the costume design, particularly on Johnny Boy who dresses exactly how you would expect a character of his personality to dress. Charlie, Michael and Tony also dress very appropriate to character and very much feed the fact that they mean business. This was Martin Scorsese's breakthrough as a director and I can perfectly see why. I hear you ask, why not Boxcar Bertha, well here is the answer, the camera angles, the telling of the story, everything mounts up to what is possibly Martin Scorsese's finest job as a director. As in many films of Scorsese's there is a lot of popular music played and I found that this little add on was very enjoyable and added to the 70s New York mood of the film and I think that it was not overdone, like it maybe was slightly in Casino. I thought that the movie captured the spirit of New York very well and seeing as Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro both grew up in New York, in the same neighbourhood in fact, they obviously had a special connection with the setting of the film. For any gangster or crime genre lover this is a definite must see and includes some unforgettable performances and a directorial masterclass on the side, BRAVO 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in the film is terrific. Keitel and De Niro are standouts, and their verbal interplay takes on almost Abbott And Costello-like humor. Robinson, Romanus, Proval and Danova are also quite good. Romanus really nails the wannabe who's not as tough nor smart as he thinks he is- just look at the scene where he stoops to rippi goff two suburban burnouts out of $20 for fireworks. The film evinces a cinema verité aesthetic, so the cinematography by Kent L. Wakefield is not as important as the superlative editing by Sidney Levin. But, the most important aspect of the film was how it brought already popular music into modern filmmaking, and wove it in seamlessly, as if it had been composed specifically for the film. Scorsese's always been one of the best directors in the world at effectively deploying music. But, it's the overall style that Scorsese created that is important, because, whereas poseurs like Jean-Luc Godard merely aped Hollywood noir, and tried to use their low budgets to claim novelty, Scorsese really does do something without precedent- in noir, in John Cassavetes films, or in gangster films. He creates a stylized realism that was absent in noir, affected in Godard, formative in early Cassavetes, and unreal in gangster films. Only Cassavetes' later The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, are as effective in realistically portraying most mobsters; as often inept bumblers whose idiocy, even more than their ethical corruption, leads to their downfall.There are, of course, aside from the classic scenes mentioned, some interesting cameos; such as Jeannie Bell, as Diane, the black stripper Charlie lusts for. Her prior claim to fame was as the second Playboy magazine centerfold Playmate, and the first black cover model. Then there is the bizarre scene with the Carradine brothers, wherein Robert shoots and kills a drunken David in Tony's bar. It's funny, but pointless, except that it's the sort of pointless violence that happens in that sort of world. There's also a classic scene, after the killing, where Michael, Charlie, and Johnny Boy end up in a car with two queers that flame. It's a hilarious sequence. There is also a possible cameo by Scorsese as Michael's shooter, in the car, in the final scenes. Scorsese did this in some of his early films, but never followed in Alfred Hitchcock's tradition.Mean Streets is not as polished a film as Scorsese's later great films, like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King Of Comedy, After Hours, nor Goodfellas, but it is every bit as good, in its raw sensibilities. One only hopes that, now that he got his 'Honorary' Oscar for the merely solid The Departed, Marty from the nabe will return to his roots, and make some films where he cannot have every whim of his indulged. It worked once. It can work again. If not, then American cinema lovers will be left with a tarnished legacy for one of its most original and brilliant filmmakers. Mean Streets is proof of that claim. Here's hoping Scorsese can finally find his way home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scorsese Staple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This opening line provides the backbone to the multi-layered 1973 Martin Scorsese film "Mean Streets". Within the first line of this film you are given a small taste of the complexities that are prevalent within the story. From the church to the home to the streets you live within each and you seek forgiveness for your sins through your actions not by merely confessing your sins to a priest. This ideology is what plagues "Charlie" the protagonist of "Mean Streets" played convincingly by Harvey Keitel.Charlie is a young adult living in the Little Italy section of New York who has aspirations of being a restaurateur but is constantly confronted with obligations that only complicate his route to business success and religious piety. The nephew of local mafia boss "Giovanni", played by Cesare Danova, Charlie is forbidden by his uncle to hold the company of his buddy, local delinquent "Johnny Boy" (Robert DeNiro) because of his instability, and Johnny Boy's sister, the woman he loves "Teresa"(Amy Robinson), because she is an epileptic or as his uncle puts it she is "sick in the head". If Charlie is to disobey his uncle's request than this would mean the end of Charlie's dream to run his own restaurant. While attempting to obey his uncle Charlie is now at a personal crossroads. Does Charlie do as his uncle says and achieve his dream or does he commit himself to his Christian beliefs, that were set forth by St. Francis of Assisi, and achieve moral and religious piety.I think we all know that "Mean Streets" is a must see and it is most definitely a Scorsese staple that cannot be ignored by any movie goer. If you have seen Goodfellas" and have not seen "Mean Streets" than I suggest you rent or buy "Mean Streets" immediately because this film is like the beautifully dysfunctional parent of "Goodfellas". DeNiro and Keitel are incredible and you can see the early on-screen chemistry that was revisited in another Scorsese classic "Taxi Driver". In a way it's as if "Mean Streets" and "Taxi Driver" spent a night of drugging, drinking and screwing and gave birth to their dysfunctional masterpiece "Goodfellas".A film comprised of gangster violence, small time gangster humor, glorified Mafia practices and beliefs, a touch of gangster style love, an amazing soundtrack and good old-fashioned 70&#x2032;s T&amp;A against a religious backdrop, this is quintessential Scorsese that must be seen by all.

		<shortDescription>It's gritty... But good!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has a very raw edge to it like many films of the era, I guess it was either an effort to make it feel more realistic or they just didn't have the budget to make it any better (my money's on the former). Although the editing is not as slick as in Scorsese's latter works and some of the scenes seem a bit chaotic, I still really enjoyed this one. I think it is as much for the performances of both De Niro and Keitel as for the way the thing is put together. I must also mention the score, an interesting mix of Italian opera and popular songs of the day makes for some entertaining themes throughout. Over all, although it's gritty and a little rough at the edges, a highly enjoyable watch?

		<shortDescription>Good Film, But Over-hyped!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is not a bad film at all. It is a good film, a classic Martin Scorcese film. But I did not get into this movie as I do with the other Scorcese films. I thought this movie was boring at times. Despite being somewhat boring, this picture accurately depicts what it's like to grow up in Little Italy in New York City. As critic Roger Ebert states, it's like Scorcese lived this picture, which he essentially did.This is about two guys named Charlie and Johnny Boy. Charlie is a guy who is rising in the mafia and Johnny Boy is a small-time gangster who owes people lots of money.The acting is brilliant. Robert De Niro, in his first pairing with Scorcese, shows why he is a star. Harvey Keitel impressed me as well.Overall, this is an example of a true American film. Even though I found it boring, I see why people find this a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same. I rate this film 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I guess you could safely say that things haven't gone so well tonight."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard good things about Scorsese's first film and there are some impressively positive reviews for the picture on the IMDb, but man, I can't figure out the movie they were talking about. Things started out well enough when the movie kick started with the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby', but then started going South with a sort of 'day in the life' sensibility that just meandered along with characters I came to care nothing about. Which is kind of ironic because Keitel and DeNiro both gave strong performances, although Keitel's Charlie too often looked like he was beside himself in the presence of mobster Michael (Richard Romanus). Having seen more than my share of gangster flicks, I'd have to conclude that DeNiro's Johnny Boy wasn't written very realistically, since everyone knows you don't mess with the Family's money, and Johnny was messing with the Family's money all over the place. The one time I really perked up was when Charlie said he was heading out to Greenwood Lake, which is two towns over from where I live. He also said what you see in my summary line above. I think he nailed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Not the Best Work of Scorsese or DeNiro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small-time hood struggles to succeed on the "mean streets" of Little Italy.This is not DeNiro's best work or Scorsese's best work, though it is the first time they worked together, so that should be worth something. Harvey Keitel, meanwhile, is pretty amazing, and I wish he appeared in more films.I love that Roger Corman offered money to Scorsese to make this an all-black film. I love it because of Corman's involvement. In truth, the story is told best as an Italian story, and it is semi-autobiographical, so this is the only real way Scorsese could tell it. And it works.A must-see for Scorsese and DeNiro fans, and a good piece of work, but far from either of their best... more of a piece of film history than a great film in itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is to mob films what "American Graffiti" is to college: none of the guys, twenty-somethings hanging around New York, are in the mafia (like in director Martin Scorsese's latter GOODFELLAS), but might be on their way.Harvey Keitel plays Charlie, the title character that lives to know everyone. His uncle is a Mafioso and Charlie only sees the inner-workings like a kid staring through a peephole.David Proval is Tony, a friendly but tough dude who owns the local hangout bar, providing an essential base.Robert Romanus is Michael, the only character with real potential at becoming a mobster. And Robert DeNiro, as a freewheeling, very troublesome small-time hood, Johnny, becomes Michael's thesis: the longer Johnny owes, the tougher Michael gets.And the only real "plot" is that Charlie (Keitel) will do anything to keep helping Johnny out of the hole; but Johnny likes the hole just fine? leading to an inevitable, and intense, climax: enveloping this as one of the greatest indie films of the seventies, and Martin Scorsese's first real thrust as a groundbreaking filmmaker.</fullReview>

The first film in which director Martin Scorsese announced himself as a major talent; discovered the partly autobiographical subject matter that has served him so well; used pop music to blistering effect; and crucially, collaborated with Robert De Niro, whose bombastic Johnny Boy is an unforgettable screen character. In 1997, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accomplished, promising start to Scorsese's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets" was the first mafia-related movie he directed and as such, it establishes many of the elements which have come to characterize his film-making over the past 35 years. The story is that of Charlie (Harvey Keitel in an iconic performance) as a mid-level Mafia hood who is struggling with many issues in various aspects of his life. He has a promising relationship with a young woman Teresa (Amy Robinson who brings her character to wonderfully feisty life) who wants him to move in with her at a house uptown. She has epilepsy which complicates her health and she is the cousin of a wild young mobster named Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro in an accomplished, manic performance at delightful odds with many of the controlled, in control roles for which he has gained such worldwide acclaim which foretold the wonderful career he would have) who has gotten into serious financial debt to a volatile, impatient hood named Tony (David Proval, excellent as a mobster who oozes menace, but, in typical movie mobster fashion, hardly disguises it as genuine concern) and who seems to have little idea or intent of how to re-pay the debts. Charlie's decency compels him to look out for Little Jonny and this altruism draws him into Jonny's volatile orbit. Additionally, Charlie's uncle is a prominent mafia don and so some of Charlie's friends attempt to capitalize on this connection to a powerful mob boss. Last and certainly not least, Charlie has a very reflective, philosophical side and has reservations about the violence and crimes in which he is engaged and this leads him to reflect on what he thinks is God's attitude toward the behavior of mobsters running wild in the streets as he is.All these elements come to a boil in Charlie's life during the course of this movie, and it seems plausible to think that this film is quite reflective of some of Scorsese's thoughts about the course his life would take. Scorsese grew up in Little Italy and considered entering the priesthood and so this film may be somewhat autobiographical. Charlie's religious thoughts offer a prelude to the movie and establish that this isn't just the same ol' same ol' mob movie.Charlie's attempt to move along in his relationship, to help Jonny, to advance his career and remain in the good books of his uncle and to resolve his reservations about his career make for fascinating character development and examination and Scorsese has created some fantastic characters whose edges overlap and sometimes clash and create the narrative drive which makes this movie great. The attempts of the young men to protect themselves, to do what they need to do to survive, and the uniqueness of the characters makes this a riveting movie. I have read comments that there is no plot in this film but the fact that such viewers do not see the efforts of Charlie to attempt to keep all the aspects of his life in balance shows they miss the point of the film. Great performances, fascinating characters, and such characters' development makes the film very entertaining. The rawness and graininess of the film speak to the fact that Scorsese made the film on a very small budget, but the newness and innovativeness of Scorsese's straight-forward depiction of mobsters and his willingness to show the graphic violence in which they sometimes engage make this film a bracing dose of realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>realism writ large</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mean Streets" is a movie about realism. On every level, this movie is going for a realistic feel. The camera walks with the characters, it tilts left when they look left, it wobbles as they walk through a crowd, it is locked a foot from their face as they wonder around drunkenly. The camera takes you there, it makes you a spectator, often taking you closer than you feel comfortable going, but that's all a part of the realism.The music, too, veers away from the typical cinematic choices of the day to heighten the realism, famously doing so by carefully choosing popular music soundtrack. As with the camera work, the goal is to take away the familiar cues that you're watching a carefully directed, safe, tame movie and make you feel like you're right there in the bar, the street, or the car.The story itself, perhaps most of all, shuns typical film constructions in favor of realism. Many have remarked that the story doesn't have a point, but it is much more the case that the story doesn't fit into the cliché drama-building mold we see in most movies. Instead, it tells a story that, aside from the extremely dramatic conclusion, could be an episode from your life or mine. Tension between friends gradually mounts, romances are intertwined, things get out of hand. It doesn't happen in a carefully sequenced, coherent storyline, that's just Hollywood. In real life, as in Mean Streets, it builds in a clumsy, confusing way with a dozen inexplicable, sometimes wreckless but ultimately unavoidable decisions on the part of many people gradually taking you somewhere you don't see you're going until you're there.Ultimately, Mean Streets is nothing if not realistic. Or at least, realistic enough to make its point. This is a realistic story, filmed in an intentionally realistic way. Yes, it lacks a clear point. Yes, the characters don't grow in any expected way. No, the supposed moral about making up for your sins "on the street" isn't illustrated in any coherent way. A conventional movie would have done the opposite of those three things, but that's what one could argue would make a conventional movie a fake depiction. Real life events rarely, if ever, have a clear point and moral to the story, and people rarely, if ever, develop in a coherent character arc the way a writer would draw it up. Real life is a lot closer to "Mean Streets" than to "The Godfather".It's natural that "Mean Streets" is baffling if you're expecting something that conforms to the conventions of fiction, because it's intentionally trying to avoid doing that. You have to want something else out of a movie to enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wish I could have seen this when it was new. Maybe not as much as sometimes wishing I had been around for Beatlemania, but maybe then I could know why some people choose this over "GoodFellas" and everything else. But I can't. Sometimes that's the problem with these cornerstone movies. Even if they didn't know they would transform the culture, the immediate effect becomes the most crucial. When a later generation sees this, they can only know the initial impact and influence as a matter of record, not the euphoria it caused. The best movies transcend this handicap and continue to engage on most levels, whereas the things that stand out for me about this film are ramshackle plotting, improvisation that doesn't always work, and an aimlessness that would become uncharacteristic of Scorsese. I was exposed to "GoodFellas," "Casino," and "The Departed" long before, and I prefer all of them. Not just because they have more stylistic finesse, but because everything about their stories is more fully formed; they're less dependent on the novelty of a particular environment or posture. In those later pictures, Scorsese found more interesting ways to express similar ideas, and had learned how to do it better than most. I still want to recommend this, not as entertainment, but as anecdote. For one thing, the director's deeply rooted Catholicism is more overtly expressed here than it would be in his future crime stories, and that's a useful point of reference. Everything else... The pop-rock score, the dynamic tracking of the camera (I was surprised to see it more active here than in "Taxi Driver"), De Niro and Keitel doing what they'd be good at for the rest of their careers... None of that has any impact now.End of story, if you still haven't dipped into Scorsese's oeuvre, maybe this is where you should start. Or, start with "Boxcar Bertha" and then here. Either way, maybe you'd have a better chance of enjoying it than I had.Rating: 3 (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie had an influence on many other famous crime movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that Martin Scorsese had an influence on Quentin Tarantino movies, but I noticed that many other nowadays crime movies (like Guy Ritchie movies) are influenced by movies like Mean Streets. Actually Mean Streets is one of the best crime movies I've seen although it's not about serious gangsters but about a youth from streets. I liked the soundtrack very much, every track fit perfectly in this movie (the bar fight looked pretty weird because song called "Please Mr. Postman" was playing during the fight and to me that was one of the most memorable moments from this movie). Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro both did great. Actually Robert De Niro's role was pretty different from his other movies because usually he plays serious persons and in this movie he played a crazy kid who is always getting himself in to trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The directing of Martin Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese is the man and the master behind Mean Streets (1973).It shows us the people of New York City's Little Italy.There's Harvey Keitel playing Charlie and Robert De Niro playing Johnny Boy.They're cousins with different kind of personalities.Other actors seen are David Proval (Tony DeVienazo) and Amy Robinson (Teresa Ronchelli).David Carradine appears playing Drunk.This movie is a near masterpiece.The way Scorsese directs...And the ending hits like a thousand volts.It's also very well written.The things they say in this movie...It all really sounds good.And let's not forget the music.The songs picked for this movie are just right.And there's plenty of music.There are The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, The Marvelettes etc.It all really sounds good.This movie works.It really works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You notice two things about this movie. The music and the heat. Scorsese's use of contemporaneous rock and pop music really gives the already zippy film a kick and simultaneously subverts a lot of the assumptions one is tempted to make. But music or no, this film is positively filthy with raw energy.Key to this is the unhinged performance of Robert de Niro - one can see so many films of his where disingenuous bonhomie barely manages to conceal and amplify menace and feral rage. Here he's crowbarred the familiar into the attitude of an unreconstructed adolescent. It's gripping. Keitel's character is almost exactly the opposite, a visionary, hyper-moral, modern Italian-American almost absent-mindedly fighting a battle against the claustrophobic reality of 70s Manhattan. A great - surprisingly compassionate - double act. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"? you do it in the streets". Mean Streets was Scorcese's first picture where he had control. Cheap and simple, but for the first time you can see his talent really starting to blossom.Mean Streets is one of the earliest examples I can think of of the kind of archetypal young director independent DIY film. Using locations, situations and characters from his own doorstep, casting unknown actors, friends and family members and adopting a neo-realist style, it is an incredibly personal and almost home movie-ish piece.What distinguishes Mean Streets is Scorcese's cinematic intelligence and inventiveness. Sure, it was a cheap production, but ideas cost nothing, and Mean Streets is full of them. The screenplay is magnificent, containing some of my all time favourite dialogue. The "What's a mook?" exchange at the pool hall, for example, or Johnny telling Michael "it's a good ten dollars" are indescribably funny, and very quotable. In spite of the neo-realist episodic nature of the plot, it is well structured, getting gradually more intense and darker in tone as the film wears on.Scorcese's pictures nearly always have some kind of covert religious element to them, and in Mean Streets it is particularly prominent. This is in many ways a film about Catholic guilt. The voice-over narrative is not like the story telling in a book ? it is Charlie's inner monologue, which he addresses to God. The compulsion to do the right thing and evade hell is always on his mind, but somewhere deep inside he knows he is doomed to failure, and is forever trying to get a grasp in his mind of the pain of hell ? that's why he several times puts his hand in the fire.Mean Streets is also a story about the younger and older generations in Little Italy. Johnny represents the extreme side of the youth ? he's reckless, na?ve and generally doesn't give a damn. Charlie's uncle represents a more serious and respectable world, but also with a darker, more dangerous edge, because Giovanni and Mario are Mafiosi. Charlie wants to reconcile the younger and older generations, the traditional and the radical. He fails partly because he wants to remain loyal to everyone, and also because he's never prepared to stick his neck out quite far enough. As far as these themes go, Mean Streets also harks back strongly to film noir.Theresa's part in the story is also particularly well thought out. It seems unusual at first that she is suddenly introduced forty-five minutes into the picture, but really til then she is being kept her a secret from us, just like Charlie is keeping his relationship with her secret from his friends. Partly he wants to protect her ? he doesn't want her to become a moll ? and partly he can't face up to his family and friends who might not think they are suitable for each other. In the end Theresa ? a more or less innocent figure ? is dragged into the criminal underworld as well, making Charlie's downfall all the more complete.The ideas in Mean Streets are also strong on a technical level. Scorcese does what he can with colour to create symbolism ? for example the low-key red lighting in Tony's bar is a reminder of the Hell that Charlie dreads. The camera moves and editing are done with incredible confidence, demonstrating the fondness for lengthy tracking shots that would become a Scorcese trademark. Some of the movement is unnecessary and showy, but this is typical of a young director trying to make his mark.The music in this picture is one of its greatest strengths. Scorcese wasn't the first to stitch together a soundtrack from pre-recorded material, but he was the first to really make a coherent, working score from it. Just as he contrasts the younger and older generations, he contrasts American pop songs with Italian folk music. Not only is this used to get the right atmosphere for different scenes, it gives greater meaning to certain aspects of the story. For example, the scene where a mob hit is carried out in the toilets takes place in the bar, where until now we have only heard modern songs. But this scene is set to a traditional Italian piece, hinting that this kind of killing is part of the world of mafia and vendetta.The only major problem I have with Mean Streets is in its neo-realist style, which I'm not at all fond of. The meandering storyline and frequent diversions into normality which characterise realist cinema seem to delight high-brow critics, but for me and for many viewers it can be just boring. As Frank Capra said, dullness is the greatest sin in film-making. Mean Streets has enough plot and attention grabbing set-pieces to keep it entertaining for the most part, but some stretches are very tedious.To sum up - out of the simplest of ingredients, Scorcese has managed to weave together something incredibly coherent and cinematic. However, for all its intensity and freshness, for pure enjoyment it's not quite up to the standard of his later works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For A Scorsese Fan, It Is Flawed Gold and For Others It Is A Reminder Of The Masterpieces That Were To Come Later In Scorsese's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese was a director who was taking control and shaping '70s cinema. With the likes of his masterpiece Taxi Driver, the romantic drama Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore and the early '72 "exploitation" flick Boxcar Bertha. These are just some of the films that have made Scorsese the legendary director he is today. Mean Streets marks many important changing points for Scorsese's career. It marks the first De Niro and Scorsese pairing, it marks some of the latter elements of what is to come in Scorsese's career, the trademark Scorsese style and the film that launched the man's career.Mean Streets follows the lives of a group of small-time hoodlums in New York ("Little Italy"). The film follows characters that are alike, yet all have their differences. The main character Charlie (Harvey Keitel) is struggling to juggle his love-life, friendships and religious upbringing with the low-life crime he has become surrounded by.For what is a very interesting premise one of the biggest flaws with Mean Streets is the fairly loose story, where scenes feels unconnected and at other times maybe slightly unnecessary. Yet, Mean Streets deserves the critical acclaim and cult success because it is a remarkable piece of '70s film-making literature and for being a film that launched the careers of some of American cinema's legends.Mean Streets is a vibrant and ostentatious example of '70s cinema. The character introduction for Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) is pure cinematic perfection and remains one of the finest scenes of all-time. The highly memorable scene shows Johnny Boy walking into the bar surrounded by women (the bar is the center set-piece for the film), accompanied by The Rolling Stones' "Jumping Jack Flash", a slow-motion shot, with wonderful red lighting and that amazing jealous stare from Charlie (Harvey Keitel). There is no doubting it being the most important scene in the film. The scene boasts the energetic talent of De Niro, who remains the finest actor to ever grace celluloid and also displays the excellence of Scorsese, who remains one of the finest directors to have graced celluloid.For a film with so much authenticity, energy and fierce originality it slyly covers up the gaping flaws in the narrative structure. The characters are amazing, a Scorsese trait is to have some of the most dimensional, accurate and creative characters in film. The direction is fantastic; Mean Streets has the distinctive Scorsese tone to it and perfectly sums up the lives of the hoodlums. The acting is majestically forceful; the characters are deep and multi-layered. Harvey Keitel gives the performance of the film, summing up his Catholic guilt, representing how Scorsese nearly became a priest. This makes Mean Streets a film that is very personal to Scorsese.Trademark Scorsese, delivering some outstanding film-making and deserving the critical acclaim it stills gets today. Mean Streets is gritty film-making at its best and a film that has become one of the most influential films in modern cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a milestone in the gangster movies history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mean Streets' is a milestone in the history of the gangster movies, a film at the crossroads and a symbol of the continuity of the genre. On one side it is taking influences from the Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson gangster movies of the 30s and from the French film noir of the 50s. It actually does quote from them, because one of the passion of the heroes in the film is ... going to the movies and watching gangster films. On the other hand it opens or almost the series of films in the genre directed by Martin Scorsese and/or acted by Robert De Niro. The religious themes that will show up in many of the later films of Scorsese are already here.The film survives well the 30 plus years since its release. Maybe the most stringent technical problem is the red camera filter in the night clubs scenes, which at least in my copy was too strong, but otherwise the hand-hold camera makes wonders and gives to the film an authenticity seldom encountered in other films from that period. Acting is wonderful, not only De Niro's but also Harvey Keitel is wonderful pairing with De Niro in this poignant troubled youth and friendship movie in the wild streets of the Little Italy of the 70s.Very worth watching, and not only for the historic interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 'die hard' De Niro fan to use the words of another poster. 'Mean Streets' is a brilliant and engaging character study. A study in contrasts between Charlie and Johnny Boy. I like the 'feel' of this film. That 'rough around the edges' feel that is evoked from the gritty streets of NYC. It captures that in this film and the feelings of the two main characters. Charlie and Johnny Boy.Of course my favourite being Robert De Niro as Johnny Boy Chivello. Early De Niro or as I like to say 'vintage De Niro' We see that spark and edginess in his early roles like 'Taxi Driver' and of course here in 'Mean Streets'. As I've read elsewhere and have actually heard people say this. One of Robert De Niro's 'gifts' is his ability to essentially take unlikable characters and have a person feel an 'affection' perhaps, or to 'root' for them in some way. This concept is illustrated here in 'Mean Streets'.It is fun and 'engaging' to watch Robert De Niro as Johnny Boy in a highly energetic and sometimes frantic portrayal. There are also 'gems' of dialogue.I would recommend this film and say it's a MUST for any De Niro fan but also any Keitel fans as well....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hard-hitting Scorcese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film Robert De Niro made with Martin Scorcese, and also Scorcese's first independent project. Made with a stunningly low budget, it's the hard-hitting realization of a young director's dream to send out his message. The very first line of the movie is said by Charlie, a small-time hood with aspirations of saintliness: "You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it." This is the theme for the rest of the movie. Charlie's own redemption in Little Italy starts with Johnny Boy, his slightly insane friend who he believes is his cross to bear. Throughout the movie he keeps looking out for Johnny Boy (played by De Niro) while tension gradually builds towards the shocking ending. Johnny Boy and Charlie have an interesting relationship--while Charlie is always restrained and controlled, even to a neurotic degree (he practices holding his hand over a flame to remind himself of the horrors of Hell) Johnny Boy has nothing really wrong with him apart from the fact that he sincerely doesn't give a damn about what happens to him. Johnny's intro to the movie is him throwing a bomb into a mailbox and running away...you can predict what the rest of it is like. Ultimately heartbreaking, this study of love and responsibility on the mean streets of New York is a key examination of what adulthood means, ultimately, and how actions affect other people around us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this movie is the first partnering of Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorsese. It is also the second time that Scorsese is working with Harvey Kietel. This movie is basically a story of the streets, there is nothing special about what's in it but thats whats special about the movie. Martin Scorsese captured a story that is common to everyone, but he's the one who did it. Robert DeNiro's performance is genius and is one of the only times he plays a character such as this, Kietel is also top notch. Best moment would definitely have to be the opening credits of super 8 footage played over The Ronettes Be My Baby. This is a film, not a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time since I was actually waiting to rent it or see it on TV but all I can say is that this was a pretty well made early Scorcese film. The acting to say the most was very good and Robert DeNiro who is my favorite actor, was terrific as the bum and trouble making "Johnny Boy." Harvey Keitel, being one of his first movies, did really well. The soundtrack which was picked out by Martin Scorcese was very good and mostly all of those rock and roll songs are one of my favorites. The movie can get kind of boring at times though. I thought there was going to be a lot of action and powerful scenes but there wasn't much of that which I kind of was expecting. So not everything was stimulating in the movie and had slow scenes. Overall, a good Scorcese film to start out in his career but this movie is not like Taxi Driver or Goodfellas which are one of my favorites.Hedeen's Outlook: 7.5/10 *** B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Mr. Scorcese's early 70's films that put him on the map with a shredding performance by Robert Deniro and a calm and heartfelt one by Harvey Keitel. Little Italy was never more alive than in this tribute to the "old neighborhood" in the 60's. Comic, tragic, and ultimately a dead end for these young dudes. A 9 out of 10. Best performance - Deniro with Keitel a close second.Sometimes using a hand-held camera, he darts around corners to shove it in someone's face at the wrong time. I'm glad John Cassavetes advised Scorsese to make a film that meant something to him. Great 60's music and realistic script (Mardik Martin &amp; Martin Scorsese) and an enjoyable supporting group that you wouldn't invite to a country club. Cesare Danova has style has Charlie's uncle.

		<fullReview>"Mean Streets" was a good movie. I'm not sure if I am writing a spoiler in this review because you might get the whole idea of the movie out of the review. Starring Harvey Keitel, Amy Robinson, and the legendary Robert De Niro. Keitel plays small-time hood Charlie Cappa, and he wants to be involved with his uncle Giovanni's(Cesare Danova) mob. Robinson is Teresa, Charlies epileptic girlfriend who is not accepted by Charlies family and she is also related to Johnny Boy(De Niro) who is on the run from a loanshark named Michael(Richard Romanus). It might seem violent because of the title but it isn't because it is the mean characters that make it a mean street and its more of a look on life of the characters. The drama is intense and well done. If their was academy award nominations (but it didn't get any nods) I would nominate 6 awards for Best Picture, Director, Actors(De Niro and Keitel), Screenplay, Supporting Actor(Danova),and Supporting Actress(Robinson). Although if their was more action I would of given the film a 10 but instead a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All great directors have their early, not so classic works. Some of what would later make then famous and acknowledged geniuses may be on display, but the film as a whole proves lackluster. For Martin Scorsese, who would later bring us Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas, his early stab is Mean Streets. While not his first film, and hardly what I would consider a bad film, it is easily several rungs beneath his recognized classics and does not hold up too well after thirty years of age.Mean Streets, like many of Scorsese's films, is set in the rough and tumble underbelly of New York City. It focuses on a group of friends who are peripherally attached to the Mafia or are just loan sharks and hustlers. Charlie (Harvey Keitel) is the central character in this piece. The film largely follows his day to day existence, working his way up his Uncle's mafia organization, getting in trouble with his friends, and trying desperately to help his buddy Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro), a screw-up who owes money to another friend of Charlie's, Michael (Richard Romanus), and is quickly burning away the loan shark's patience.This is not exactly a plot driven picture. In truth, very few of Scorsese's films have hinged on an intricate plot, but this one is almost exclusively a "slice-of-life" story of its' characters. Their isn't much in the way of goals or purpose, other than to get through another day of their average routine. That arguably makes the film more realistic, but it also causes it seem somewhat meandering. It doesn't really move towards anything, although one subplot thread involving Johnny Boy's debts does provide some direction for the film. Some scenes don't seem to add up to much, feeling as if we are watching material filmed just to pad out the running length of the film, and overall it proves to be somewhat under-involving.Stylistically, you can see many of Scorsese's visual and auditory trademarks already in place in this film. We are treated to shots of an individual walking down a long bar in slow motion, accompanied by rock and roll classics (then contemporaries), much like in Goodfellas. Scorsese punctuates several major emotional beats in his film with songs, and it works well here as it does in later films where he applies the same approach. There are also several editing tricks utilized at times during the film that are not quite as successful, such as when Charlie is on the bed with a lover and we are treated to quick edits of the two engaging in conversation that proves to be just distracting.Also like future Scorsese films, Mean Streets is filled with characters that are surrounded by a sense of doom or malaise. The character of Johnny Boy is the most obvious example. As played by DeNiro, Johhny Boy is living on borrowed time, getting through one day after the other, seemingly oblivious or unconcerned about the hole his is digging for himself with the loan shark Michael. He is an young adult who has never stopped being an adolescent. Charlie seems to move throughout his day with a sense of despondent inevitability, knowing that he is on a course that won't take him much of anywhere, but yet still going through the motions. The other characters don't make much of an impression, frankly. They fill out the frame, but they are not characters that will stick in your memory.For someone who thinks Scorsese has made some other, brilliant films, Mean Streets is something of a letdown. I expected a film with a little more substance to it based on what he had produced later, but we all should remember that you have to crawl before you can walk, and even as underwhelming as Mean Streets is, you can see Martin Scorsese crawling to greatness later on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The breakthrough movie for De Niro, Keitel and Scorsese, a classic tale of small time hoods, family, violence and the shadow of religion in New York's Little Italy As far as making an entrance goes, it takes some beating. Johnny Boy (De Niro) saunters into the bar in slow motion, a girl on each arm, as The Stones' 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' kicks in on the jukebox. So marks the official arrival of one of US cinema's greatest actors, and possibly its greatest director too in the form of Martin Scorsese. Scorsese's previous features were the prototype New York Italian American tale Who's That Knocking At My Door? (1968) and the Roger Corman produced Boxcar Bertha (1972). With Mean Streets his directorial personality really comes to the fore. The story of tested loyalties and destructive Catholic guilt among a group of small-time hoodlums in Little Italy with an unforgettable 60s pop soundtrack, it is a simple blueprint that would be copied by lesser directors who could never dream of bettering it. Keitel, as Charlie, a tortured soul trying to keep it all together, and an electric, jittery, possessed and demented De Niro put in unsurpassable and believably human performances that kick-started their careers. Scorsese didn't make up for your sins in church. He did it at the movies ...</fullReview>

DeNiro was absolutely great. Johnny (DeNiro's character) is just so shameless in everything he does, that from the very first scene of the movie, you can tell he's loads of trouble. Keitel does an outstanding job too. Being relatively young (23), much of Keitel's work I have seen has been much later in his life. I didn't even think Harvey Keitel was ever young. He seems like the kind of guy that was born an old man. I now know why he's a great actor though.

		<fullReview>There's elements of style here that Scorcese would later perfect in Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Casino. The use of music in the soundtrack for this film is particularly effective even though the plot is ill-defined and meanders too much. Too many scenes don't advance the story or tell us anything new about the characters. DeNiro and Keitel are both great in this film but their interaction is somehow less than the sum of its parts. I simply didn't find their relationship very believable...it's never explained WHY Charlie would continue to stick by Johnny Boy when he's such a loser with no respect for any of his friends. It's pretty obvious Johnny's spoiling to get whacked, and for a guy who seems to have as much going for him as Charlie does you'd think he'd leave Johnny to his fate. In summary it's interesting as a sort of prototype Scorcese film but nowhere near as good as his 70s masterpiece Taxi Driver or his later work. I give it 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't blown away by Scorsese's first gangster film with De Niro. From what I had read about it I expected it to be a lot more than it was so in a way I finished watching the film I little disappointed. That doesn't make Mean Streets a bad film though. I think the problem that could be wrong with it was how much it was dated. The whole film on a scale is quite poorly done but the story was intriguing built up with really good performances. De Niro isn't that much apart of the film really, his wild ways are always on the topic of conversation but not much of him till towards the end. Music has a big part to play with Scorsese films as he knows how to put together a cracking soundtrack. The opening scene where we see all the characters doing different things with The Ronettes Be My baby playing in the back is just pure Scorsese. Like in Goodfellas he can always pick a great tune and make it sound great with the scene in play. It was good to see a young Robert Carrindine playing a young and dark assassin and must have been good to kill off his own real life brother in the movie.I do think this movie is very good but not brilliant. I believe it has some good key scenes but nothing that will change my life. I think if I saw it when it was released in the early seventies then I would be going on about it just as much as everybody else is but unfortunately I watched Goodfellas first and expected something quite similar in Mean Streets and I did in a way but not better. I think Scorsese is the greatest director in the world but for somebody who has just started watching his films and want to see his best work then I would stick with Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas because watching Mean Streets might put them off. It wouldn't put me off but I could understand if it did. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early Scorsese-De Niro Classic---7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After this role, Robert De Niro would go on to win two Oscars and countless nominations. However, i find it amazing how one of the most praised directors ever has never won an Oscar, even after directing some of the best movies of all time. The people know he is great so that's all that matters. Mean Streets is his breakthrough film and his first of many legendary pairings with Robert De Niro. It follows a group of Manhattan hoods, led by Harvey Keitel's Charlie, who want to become big shots. De Niro is fantastic as crazy trouble-maker Johny Boy Civello. Many gangster movie greats make appearances such as David Proval. If you love gangster movies, check out Mean Streets. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breakthrough film for Scorsese, DeNiro, and Keitel is gritty urban slice of life. Keitel is a guilt-racked petty racketeer trying to protect crazy, reckless friend DeNiro from loansharks. Film has edgy nervous energy, great acting, and terrific use of pop music, all the trademarks of a Scorsese flick. Rated R.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mean Streets - * * * * (out of * * * *)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We know New York today as a clean, friendly environment, despite the terrorist attacks of September 11th. More than a generation ago, New York was a journey to the seedier sides of life. XXX-rated films, prostitutes, drug dealers, and other dirty symbols were all over the City That Never Sleeps, and our mementos of the seedier New York exist in a few films. An exceptional example of this is Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets.The film is set in Little Italy, and takes place in the early 70's, when the film was released (1973 to be exact). The central character is Charlie (Harvey Keitel), a hood struggling to make it on the `mean streets' of Little Italy. His friends, Tony (David Proval) and Michael (Richard Romanus) are small-time crooks, the latter of who is introduced stealing electronics. Charlie's best friend, Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro, in his star-making role), is quite a crook. He blows up mailboxes, curses like a sailor (as do the rest of the people in the film), and reacts violently to things. Together, the quartet of crooks struggles to make it on the dirty streets of Little Italy.Mean Streets is a solid, outstanding obscurity that was praised by many critics that never got the recognition it deserved. Though it received a National Society of Film Critics award for Best Supporting Actor (Robert DeNiro) and a Writer's Guild nomination for Best Original Screenplay (Drama), no Oscars or Golden Globes were won, and the New York Critics' Circle ignored New Yorker Scorsese's portrait of events he saw happen. Still, Mean Streets is a film that needs to be viewed by more people, and especially if people are a fan of Scorsese's work, should give the film a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Scorsese's first really important movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mean streets" is much more than an average crime film, it's a very interesting pre-Taxi driver, pre-Raging bull, pre-Goodfellas, pre-everything work from 31 old lad called Martin Scorsese. Although it's certainly not among his finest achievements (just think of all what Scorsese came up with later on) it's a stylish, powerful and peculiar flick from a man who became one of the biggest director geniuses of our time. Robert De Niro shines as Johnny Boy. When I look at his performance I can't stop wondering where did that incredible actor come from. He's just so amazing it lefts me speechless. Harvey Keitel is most likely having his first perfect role as Charlie. If you haven't seen "Mean streets" but all the more significant Scorsese movies are already familiar to you search this brilliant film out and enjoy. "Mean streets" has already a strong touch of genius in it and it's safe to say it was probably the first movie that showed what kind of a new miracle maker was about to enter Hollywood. It would be nice to know how many times Quentin Tarantino watched this film when he wrote "Reservoir dogs". Fantastic movie and as close to a perfection as can be. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, entertaining film from Scorsese, DeNiro, and Keitel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you have three of Hollywood's true talents in a film together, it's sure to be memorable. Martin Scorsese is a superb director who takes chances and along with Robert Altman deserves to win an Oscar for direction. Robert DeNiro can make any movie better, even today he has that screen presence and ability that blows away all these young poseurs. Harvey Keitel is still an underated talent who can do it all. These three men have a bond, collaborating in a number of films throughout their history.Mean Streets, made in 1973, is a superb recounting of Scorsese's childhood in Brooklyn. A dark, gritty, street movie about lower-class Mafiaosos as well as an ongoing festival that frames the story.Keitel is Charlie, one of those in the lower reaches of the Mafia. He has a relationship with a woman named Teresa (Amy Robinson), who has a cousin named Johnny Boy(Robert DeNiro). Johnny Boy (who doesn't have both oars in the water) owes a huge amount to a Mafia loan shark, but he refuses to pay it or make any effort in doing so. Johnny Boy also uses Charlie to get money so he can indulge in guns, prostitution, and alcohol. Charlie is then forced to either break off his relationship with Johnny Boy and his cousin or take their side.Mean Streets is gritty in its filming. It's not a brightly lit, eye-candy experience. It's dark, foreboding, and represents an urban nightmare. Although Keitel has a bigger role and delivers a fine performance, it is DeNiro who owns the film as the the crazy man. His quick talking conning, his Ed Nortonesque silliness, and his facial expressions are priceless. Amy Robinson does a superb job as the epileptic Teresa, who is devoted to Charlie. Scorsese's direction is perfectly done and his script sizzles. The soundtrack is brilliant, with a mix of 50's hits, late 60's, and early 70's, sprinkled with some Italian songs. One fight scene in a bar is set to The Marvelettes "Please Mr. Postman". DeNiro's character is in the fight, and one look at his face and his dancing around and taunting shows how really into the role he was. There's even a scene in which David Carradine, playing a drunk, is shot by his brother Robert four times, yet he still doesn't fall and starts brawling with him in the bar. like a crazed Rasputin. He takes two more shots, but still doesn't go down and continues to choke his brother out until he is whipped head first into a car. What a scene that was!Overall, this film is superb. It's not for everyone, but if you're serious about cinema, this is one to see. I think even "The Sopranos" got some ideas from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A starmaking turn for De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is the groundbreaking 1973 film starring Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Keitel plays the role of Charlie...the son of a mobster, while De Niro plays the role of Johnny Boy...a hoodlum who's in debt to everyone in the neighborhood. De Niro's performance in this film is pure electric as he practically steals each scene that he is in...I personally believe that his performance in this movie was key in him getting the part of young Don Corleone in The Godfather Part 2. Keitel does his usual good performance in this film as does David Proval (you might have seen him in season 2 of HBO's The Soprano's) who plays the role of Tony as well as Richard Romanus (occasionally on The Soprano's) who portrays Michael...the small time hood.There are plenty of good scenes in this film...here are some to name a few.1. The bar room fight with pool cues2. A confrontation between Johnny Boy, Michael &amp; 10 dollars (really love this scene)3. And a lovely father &amp; son scene with David &amp; Robert CarradineI wished that there would have been more after the ending, but Mean Streets is a very good film anyway. If you're a fan of De Niro or Scorsese (who directed the film by the way), you should not miss out on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant De Niro...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help myself, I love De Niro's movies from the 70s. He's such an outstanding talent. He gives another brilliant performance in this somewhat strange flick. Apparently all of the happenings are taken from Scorsese's 'childhood' in Little Italy.I believe the first 20/25 minutes of the film is tremendous. When it comes to doing these kind of roles; crazy ones, De Niro is one of the best. After the introduction and opening scenes the movie dies a bit, to then resurrect again from time to time.*spoiler* Comparing this one to films done today, obviousley there are a lot of things that could have been done better, but hardly the soundtrack, which is superbly selected (especially the scene when Keitel comes into the 'red-lighted' joint having a dance with a stripper as well as the fight on the pool tables!)It hit me that at one stage De Niro is not in the film for say 20 minutes or so, and that is when the movie becomes a little bit dull. That's not how it should be, but Harvey Kaitel is doing more than an alright role who tried to sort everything out for his buddies, while Amy Robinson is not bad at all either. *end of spoiler*I can definitely recommend this piece of work, not a real big story (which is really only positive), just what life can be like for people in New York, London or wherever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Streets is DeNiro's first collaboration with Scorsese. It involves the followings of four friends who lead lives in crime. Charlie is greatly played by Harvey Keitel and he is the most likable character because of his Catholic morals. DeNiro by far carries the picture as Johnny Boy, the fast talking in debt hustler who is always getting into trouble. This is a strong film and stands the test of time. The Jumping Jack flash scene with DeNiro is as good as it gets. Great direction and acting. ****</fullReview>

This is my fourth favorite Scorsese picture behind GoodFellas, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, which are all masterpieces, and now this. Robert De Niro is fantastic as Johnny Boy and Harvey Keitel as Charlie. Do yourself an enormous favor and view this film.

		<shortDescription>Scorcese's calling card</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt compelled to contribute something having read "Flamcam"'s view that some of the filming of Mean Streets was a little "sloppy". This could not be further from the truth. Mean Streets is filled with stylistic touches which were to go on to not only form an important part of Scorcese's portfolio but also influence countless film-makers. To take a few examples - Scorcese's introduction of the chief characters with the use of freeze frame and captions is a device being used today by film-makers attempting to keep their films "hip" and modern - Tarantino and Guy Ritchie especially. It says something of Mean Streets that a film made nearly 30 years ago is imitated in an attempt to make a film seem fresh.Films such as Goodfellas (with the long running tracking shot of Liotta working his way through a club) and Casino (with the swooping shots of Pesci and De Niro in the Nevada desert) demonstrate Scorcese's indulgent camerawork and the beginnings of this can be clearly seen in moments of Mean Streets - the shot closing in on Keitel as he sits at the bar watching Johnny Boy (to the sound of Jumping Jack Flash) immediately grabs the viewer as being incredibly fresh and, as such, offsets against the seediness and dark of Little Italy. Similarly, the long-shot taken right in front of Keitel's face as he stumbles drunkenly through the bar was copied almost shot for shot by Ritchie in the "fresh", "innovative" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. And then there is the dialogue. Scorcese's script pre-empted Tarantino by two decades and remains as fresh, funny and powerful today as it did on its release. The involvement of the greatest screen actor of his generation (De Niro)with the director who has coaxed his best performances should alert people to the quality that will be found in Mean Streets. It doesn't disappoint. From its dialogue, to its visual style, Mean Streets has grabbed the attention of not only audiences but also film-makers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A formula often imitated, but never duplicated with success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorcese's third feature film (after his first independent experiment, and his little stint with Roger Corman) is the true beginning of his film career. The New York City middle-lower class Italian-American drama was to become his strongest forte (this film, along with Raging Bull and Goodfellas are arguably his most recongized films - along with Taxi Driver), and in Mean Streets this is proven. The themes of catholicism and catholic guilt, the life of organized crime, the spurts of sudden violence, the 60's rock-n-roll soundtrack, and the overlapping dialogue are all here in fine form. The story rings with truth, the characters are genuine and exciting, yet there is no overacting or in-your-face cinematic gimmickery, nor cheap tricks. Often imitated but never duplicated, one viewing of "Mean Streets" will make any Tarantino flick look like a pale imitation (and most independent crime flicks an imitation of this imitation). Scorcese understands his subject and characters in a way no one else has so far shown. Keitel and Deniro are in their finest form. "Mean Streets" was initially supposed to be funded by exploitation meister Roger Corman, who wanted it to conform to the nudity-every-ten-pages rule, but Marty decided to get it made independently, which ultimately dragged out the process. Like Stanley Kubrick, Marty hardly made any money off of his third picture. In Marty's case, this was because the Rolling Stones' royalties ate up most of the box office (and had he tried to do the same today, it's likely he would still be in debt). </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Third times the charm as the saying goes. In Martin Scorsese's third feature length film. This is one of his best and also sets the foundation for his becoming one of the most respected directors in film making. It also highlighted the incredible acting ability of Robert De Niro. A look at New York's Little Italy during a more gritty period in it's history. Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro turn in the best performances of the bunch, but everyone in the cast does a fine job. The film contains one of the best soundtracks in movie history with music by the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton to name a just a couple. Although their is some odd camera work the film is very realistic and fast paced. Some other great films by Martin Scorses are "Goodfellas," "Casino," and the "Color of Money" just to name a few of his best. The film is about a small group of characters. Tony and Michael own the bar were all the friends hang out. Charlie (Keitel) is a small time hood trying to collect unpaid debts for his uncle. Johnny Boy (De Niro) is an aggressive trouble maker and owes everyone money but can't repay his debts. For some reason or another Charlie puts up with all Johnny Boy's blank excuses and even seems to feel sorry for him at times. I highly recommend this film although I felt the ending could have been a little more well defined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first scene of Mean Streets, it becomes evident that something is haunting Charlie (Harvey Keitel). The conflict between Charlie's life on the street and that of his religion becomes more and more intense as the movie continues. The film makes use of original styles of shooting and uses of light, foreshadowing some of the techniques that would soon make its director one of Hollywood's most revered. In fact, Mean Streets can be thought of as a type of prequel to the brilliant Goodfellas. Lean back and enjoy the great performances by Keitel's Charlie, Amy Robinson's Teresa, and Robert Deniro's slightly insane Johnny Boy. While these performances are spectacular, be sure to pay attention to Scorsese's use of mise-en-scene. A gripping film from beginning to end, Mean Streets shows how powerful a low budget film made with passion can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest with you, I think De Niro have made some much better movies than this one. Even though I had seen "Taxi driver", "Raging bull", "Goodfellas", "Cape Fear", and "Casino" before watching "Mean streets", I was expecting much more out of this movie. Perhaps I didn't keep in mind the fact that this was the first De Niro-Scorsese movie and was probably expecting a movie having the same content as the great "Taxi driver". Maybe Scorsese didn't get into his brutal violence right away because De Niro was an actor who he was just only discovering. I don't have all the answers but I was rather disappointed.  Johnny Boy (De Niro) lives in a small neighborhood in New-York that is controlled by the neighborhood "boss" Tony (David Proval). The only problem with Johnny Boy is that he has a very big debt toward Tony but doesn't have the money to pay him back. So he tries to avoid Tony as much as he can. But in a neighborhood where everyone knows everyone, it's hard to avoid someone to who you money. So Johnny Boy's best friend Charlie (Harvey Keitel) has to straiten out matters with Tony to help Johnny stay alive. Charlie is a very responsible kid who has many obligations and tries to full-fill all of them as soon as it's possible for him to do so. But still, in a neighborhood like that one, you would either have to pay or leave to not get killed by the "boss" because he's bound to find you sooner or later and then, there aren't any excuses. It's as simple as a bullet or two in the head and that's it as far as the "boss" is concerned. Business has been taken care of. The movie is a semi-autobiography of Scorsese's childhood which might explain the fact that there isn't as much violence as in other Scorsese movies. However, the movie leads to a rather predictable ending with a gruesome murder. The acting is very good, especially Harvey Keitel who delivers one of his best roles ever. But the direction and script seem to lack that magic touch that the other Scorsese-De Niro movies have. It's a lot slower than "Goodfellas" and really doesn't rank up there in that category that has Scorsese's best movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Streets is a coming of age story about things you must do and people you must leave behind in order to be considered a man. It is a beautifully self conscious movie. Charlie (Harvey Keitel)plays a small time hood on the way up in Little Italy. He is very Catholic but wants to pay for his sins his way. Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro) is a man who refuses to be accountable, almost socio-pathic. You see his reckless behavior in the opening sequence of the film when he blows up a mail box just for fun. Charlie sees in Johnny his mission. Charlie will 'save ' Johnny. In return Charlie will redeem himself.Mean Streets is about paybacks, paying up, balancing the big tab against the little tab "so it balances off." It's about f***ng with the infinite, it's like film noir except there's color bleeding off each frame. There are great drunken scenes here. You can taste the Scotch, you can feel the room spinning. You can see the inevitable doom creeping up next to you in a car on the highway. Mean Streets is one of the best movies ever made. Great rock n roll. Check out the scene when Johnny Boy first appears in the bar...slow motion and Jumpin Jack Flash playing. This is a great movie, I gotta say that again, this is a great movie. Johnny Boy Staggers down the alley, Charlie on his knees, his uncle watches the end of a movie on the TV The curtain closes. The End. As Charlie says, "Thank you Lord...."</fullReview>

This film is Scorsese's first major film, and some might attribute the sloppy camerawork to that, but the camera-work is deliberate, and gives the film a feeling of reality, an almost documentary quality, which is one of Scorsese's trademarks. The plot is almost non-existent, the film is a collection of random events, which together, show the randomness and violence of life in Little Italy. Many of Charlie's voice-overs are done by an uncredited Scorsese, giving the film an autobiographical quality. While very different than many of his later films, this still stands out as one of his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean streets was Scorsese's second major film. (I think). This was written and directed by Scorsese. It is supposed to be sort of a biography , all the things that Scorsese saw or experienced while growing up in Little Italy. It stars Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Great music and filming. May seem a little sloppy but it was made 25 years ago. During the San Gennaro feast (which I attended after seeing this movie) events unfold as Johnny boy ( De Niro) gets out of hand and Charlie ( Harvey Keitel) tries to keep him out of trouble. Listen close for the first words of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief study of human nature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A journey in the life of a man, Charlie, who's very thorn between his religious beliefs and desire to do good on the world in order to help others, and his job being part of a mafia gang. Through all the movie we can see how he feels sadden and disturbed by watching how the people are so violent with one an other, only thinking on self benefit or revenge, and truly watching how the streets are really mean, specially on the kind of work he is in, the mafia. However, he tries to help others, even if that means not caring about self happiness, but for him what's important and his life goal, is to help others survive in such a toxic society, where it seems that everyone is against everyone; so he takes care somehow of Johnny Boy (Robert de Niro), a very young an rebel guy whose also on this mafia business, but doesn't have the same perspectives as Charlie, and gets him into a lot of troubles, even making him doubt if there's any hope to help others, or if they're never going to change.A true Scorcesse masterpiece, not only for the photography and plot, but also the acting is sublime, specially the one delivered by De Niro and Keitel, a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's early crime epic is one to remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely not being like an usual crime-drama and those expecting at typical Scorsese classic are also wrong to do so. It's one of the earliest movies out of his career and perhaps you should see this movie more as a test-case for his future crime epics. In that regard alone this movie is already being an interesting and significant watch.For me, it's definitely being understandable why someone wouldn't like this movie. It isn't necessarily following a main plot line, which perhaps lets the movie feel a bit messy and simplistic. And that could be even more so the case for you since the movie of course isn't being a very slick or expensive looking one. I however feel this is actually being one of the movie its greatest strengths.Because it isn't really following a main story the movie feels more like a raw and realistic one instead. It's just about a couple of simple and average guys, trying to make it in the world of crime, in Little Italy. They are small fish and the movie is also focusing on the smaller things. It doesn't ever attempts to be more than it in fact truly is and you could say that the movie is being a very humble and honest made movie, with a notable true love and passion for the genre as well.I hear everybody talking about Robert De Niro's performance and character in this movie but to me the true heart and center of this movie was Harvey Keitel. He's also really the one main character in this movie and his story lines are being the most important ones for the progress of it. Think everybody is talking about De Niro because he is the bigger star now and has a long history with Scorsese, which all started out with this movie but honestly, the best performance of the movie is being given by Keitel! Not saying that De Niro is bad of course in this. On the contrary! But he's getting enough attention for it already, while Keitel is being the one that gets to shine the most in this.It's also a movie with some definitely great and powerful moments in it. The movie manages to become an affective one with some of its emotions and developments. Some moments and setups more or less got used later on by Scorsese again, for some of his far better known movies. Scorsese fans shall most likely marvel at this movie and notice great little touches and story approaches in it, for which Scorsese later on would get known and recognized for.A great little crime movie, though not just for everybody.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Scorsese film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is characterised by Scorsese's intense style with lots of energy and emotion which makes it a joy to watch. The film at the time was completely original in terms of this energetic style of camera work, passionate acting and also the style of narrative is not often told as well. All this contribute to a stunningly original social-realist film. Characters are capable of spontaneously fighting at any time.The concept is another reason why it is such a successful film, as the overall idea with the protagonist Charlie is that he is the equivalent of a St. in his world but on the Mean Streets he is transformed by his sinful surroundings and engulfed by this culture as he battles to protect his out of control fellow gang member Johnny Boy and trying to survive as a small time hood in the hostile world.This was Scorsese's first great film and began arguably the most successful collaboration in film between Him and De Niro who gave a stunning performance of a character who is nearly the exactly opposite of Charlie as he is completely out of control and the guilt-ridden performance add to a pioneering which I would advise to watch at least twice before completely judging it.It can be considered as a great film and in my opinion ranks as a must see film as it has been preserved by the AFI as culturally and historically significant. Well worth a watch by any movie fan and certainly Martin Scorsese fans should watch this gritty stunner that has inspired many films and "La Haine" was largely inspired by this dramatic classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisited after a four decade absence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is an irritating mess of a film. I watched the first half of it forty years ago and walked out of the movie theater with irate contempt. Having been a diligent film buff for the past four decades, I recently reproached myself for my youthful impatience and let myself be seduced by the rave reviews of critics such as Roger Ebert. I rented the DVD version from a video library. This time I sat through all of it (don't ask me how I managed that) and I concluded that back in 1972 I had been way too generous in suffering those 45 minutes before exiting from the theater. The average porno movie has more of a script than this piece of mental chewing gum. The characters are unsympathetic. The acting is embarrassingly bad and the directing is worse. Is the film a legitimate time capsule of real life in Little Italy? I don't think so. If a character like Jonny Boy behaved like such an irresponsible jerk, he might have survived for a while in a hippie commune back then, but he wouldn't have survived 2 minutes on the streets of New York. What I don't get is why Scorsese let this embarrassment stay as a skeleton in his closet. With all the money his later movies made at the box office, he could easily have bought out the rights to this movie, buried it, destroyed all copies and forever after vehemently denied he ever made the film in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This low-budget film looks at the lives of two-bit gamblers and small-time criminals in New York's Little Italy. While it is gritty and full of energy, there is hardly a plot and the characters are neither interesting nor likable. Keitel plays the only character worth caring about, the nephew of a crime boss who dreams of owning a restaurant. De Niro is OK as a self-centered, irresponsible jerk whom Keitel takes under his wing. In his third feature film, Scorsese shows many of the stylistic elements that would mark his later films, but he lacks a compelling script to turn this into anything more than a notable apprentice work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Is a Highway.......You May Not Want to Ride It All Night Long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of eight partnerships (at the present time) for writer/director Martin Scorsese and all-world actor Robert DeNiro took place with the bleak, dark and sometimes even down-right dull "Mean Streets" in 1973. DeNiro is not the main focus though. Instead it is Little Italy's Harvey Keitel as he gets torn with dilemmas in every direction as a small-time hood trying to protect DeNiro from cronies around the neighborhood that he is in debt to. Keitel also finds love with DeNiro's cousin (Amy Robinson), but romantic connections are not even smart in their world of crime. Keitel, strangely seeming out of place here, finally discovers that leaving the only home he has ever known may be the best option for himself, DeNiro and Robinson. "Mean Streets" starts off as a poor man's "GoodFellas" with witty dialogue and an intriguing premise, but then loses its way when it gets to the heart of its story. DeNiro is not around enough to make an impression and Keitel just cannot carry the heavy weight on his own. Everyone else is just seen in the venture. "Mean Streets" plays more like an early-1970s exploitation flick than a cohesive cinematic unit. Scorsese's screenplay flounders around and his direction is difficult to figure out. Extremely dark cinematography makes the film feel like a black hole that ends up being a long and winding abyss of uninteresting ideas and concepts. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's startling breakthrough could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brutal, realistic, raw.... and a bit plotless, Martin Scorsese's MEAN STREETS was the director's first critically acclaimed film that,thanks the flaws of a weak plot and a slow pace, eventually led the way for his greater films, such as TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, and GOODFELLAS, which all featured Robert DeNiro. And wouldn't you know, DeNiro was in MEAN STREETS as well! In his first starring vehicle, DeNiro stars as Johnny, an irresponsible young punk in New York City's Little Italy who wastes both the money and trust of his best friend Charlie (Harvey Keitel, who also had his debut role here). Fans of intelligent, character-driven dramas will have a kick out of MEANSTREETS, but fans who prefer a faster pace and a more livelier plot shouldn't park their car here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scorcese's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing such intense Scorcese works like "Goodfellas" I was expecting to see an equally intense drama when about to watch "Mean Streets." This is one of his early, early works and it's not bad. Not bad at all. The acting is terrific. It's great to watch Bobby D and Keitel without wrinkles...LOL. If anybody has seen "A Bronx Tale" Bobby looks exactly like Lillo Brancato, who played his son, in this movie. As far as I know the two of them are not blood-related. But I wouldn't be surprised if they were. Keitel gets a much bigger role, and has more of an opportunity to flaunt his acting chops, so he was pretty much the star of the show, though Bobby D was terrific as well in his supporting role. You can spot many of the Scorcese trademarks. In one of the opening scenes, we have a shot in which the camera dollies past the regulars at a seedy strip bar, which was also used in the famous shot in "Goodfellas." Scorcese really knows how to bring his audience INTO the movie. Some may criticize a few of the shaky camera movements. Sure, it was made in 1973, but even if it was made in present day I wouldn't protest. It's none of that gratuitous, headache-inducing camerawork that "supposedly" gave the "Blair Witch Project" a sleek documentary style. This is the kind of camerawork that gives us an explicit point of view. It makes us feel as if we are the ones walking down the sidewalks, walking into a bar, walking into an apartment building, etc. You FEEL like you're IN LITTLE ITALY!!! And I also have to add that I love the soundtrack! It contains some of the best oldies. For some reason, Scorcese has great taste when it comes to choosing music for his films. That's another element I found in "Goodfellas." The music doesn't only make you tap your feet, but also accentuates the mood of each situation. After a great opening, "Mean Streets" starts to me-ander. Plus, it gets repetitive. Count how many bar fights were featured in this gritty drama. It's no doubt that the film is portrayed with dead-on realism, in a way that simply screams "Scorcese." He's always had knack for these types of gritty, urban dramas and I can't say he failed in the visual department. I just felt the script could've been stronger and meatier, with better material for these well-drawn-out characters to fiddle around with. "Mean Streets" is quite impressive, but definitely not one of Scorcese's best. It doesn't possess the emotional intensity of "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas" and "Bringing Out the Dead."My score: 6 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is some real life experiences in this film, about a group of guy who grew up in little Italy in New York, and this makes the film fasinating. Some of the story is just too weired not to be made up. Johnny the boy, played by De Nero is too crazy and owes everyone money. This guy has gotta be real. With the conversations about women, religion, and the crazy personal behaviors of the characters the viewer finds himself listening to story from a good friend. What puts this film over the top is the details, for example when Harvey De Nero and friends get into a fight in a pool hall you can tell they watch not to rip their suits when they stand on the table, and fight of the bad guys with cues, probably because its the only suit they own. You will have to watch this film a few time, but it grows on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll probably stand out as a sore thumb when I say this, but I didn't like this film.  The plot was really frail, so I really can't remember what it was about, other than the fact Robert Romanus played the bad guy, Harvey Kietel is a con-artist who wants to go straight and his best friend, played by Robert DeNiro, is always getting into trouble. Judging from the date this appears to be one of Scorcese's first films. A landmark it is not. When you think of a landmark film you think of it with memorable characters (which this film didn't have) excellent cinematography (which was crudely done here) and fine performances (here, medicore at best) and memorable lines (The only lines I can remember is Kietel's character cussing at his girlfriend, continuously for no reason.) "Mean Streets'" only landmark is its name, and the fact Martin Scorcese directed it. It's an unremarkable effort which definitely isn't representative of his *superior* later films.</fullReview>

These 3 slimy, 2-bit crooks are certainly the stupidest trio of stooges that you're ever gonna encounter. But the trouble with the likes of these dimwitted stooges (unlike the original Stooges - Curly, Larry &amp; Moe) is that their antics aren't in the least bit entertaining nor at all funny (not even marginally) They're just plain stupid.Throughout this Crime-Drama's 2-hour running time, the violence absolutely sucked, big-time. And there wasn't a single, likable character in the whole lot of these NYC criminal lowlifes.Besides the complaints that I've just made above - Mean Streets also lost itself some serious points for the blatant product placement of Marlboro cigarettes. Yes. I do realize that this was a movie from the reckless 1970s, but, all the same, cigarette endorsements in movies just sucks, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sets the table for better Scorsese films to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certain directors are so revered that a film's status is elevated simply by having that famous director's name attached. Martin Scorsese is undoubtedly one of those guys. Which means a movie like Mean Streets ends up getting much more credit than it deserves. Scorsese made it, it's gotta be great. Not really. Even great directors make bad movies. You can see Mean Streets as a template for future Scorsese works of genius. Hints of what was to come throughout the great director's career are present in this film. The visual style, the types of characters and stories which interested him, the seeds of future greatness are there. But those little glimpses into Scorsese's future can't cover up the fact that this is a rather mundane film, sorely lacking in the drama and explosiveness we have by now come to expect from him. Mean Streets represents a rather stuttering start to a great career.The film takes a look at some small-time New York City mafia hoods. Really small-time. I mean really, really small-time. The impression these guys give off is that of a bunch of guys who just watched a mob movie and decided they'd like to try that but they really don't know how. One of their operations is a fireworks scam in which they barely clear enough money to go to the movies. When they get in fights they seem more interested in not wrinkling their shirts than they are in actually hitting the other guy. The supposed big drama of the film involves one of the hoods owing another hood a meager sum of money. The two trade insults and that's about it. The one guy who's looking to get paid goes to the deadbeat's epileptic cousin and knocks her loaf of bread on the floor. Oooooooooh, tough guy. By the way all the mafia types generally shun the epileptic girl because these dopes apparently equate epilepsy with the plague. They seem to think she's a completely non-functional human being when the truth is she's got her life pulled together a heck of a lot better than any of them do. One of them, the supposed hero of the film, secretly dates the girl. But he'd like to date this black woman he knows. Can't do that though because apparently the only thing worse than being seen with an epileptic is being seen with a black woman. Honestly, everybody in this movie is an idiot.Harvey Keitel plays Charlie, the devoutly Catholic, deeply conflicted "hero". Charlie likes to think he's above the fray, smarter than the rest of the hoods. Well, considering the brain-dead nature of those around him that's not a very high standard. Charlie tries to stay above it but he gets dragged down right into it. This is largely because of his loyalty to Johnny Boy, the aforementioned deadbeat. Johnny Boy is the idiot of all idiots. Where he goes, trouble follows. Robert De Niro plays the part and does a good job being convincing as a guy whose brain is clearly not firing on all cylinders. There's really nothing bad to say about Keitel and De Niro's performances in the two lead roles. And Amy Robinson holds her own playing Teresa, Johnny Boy's cousin and Charlie's lover. But nobody else makes much of an impression at all. The story, what little story there is, disappoints. There's very little of consequence going on to hold your attention. The characters are small-time hoods and it makes for a small-time movie. People have so much respect for Scorsese. And well they should. But that doesn't mean you can't point out that one of his movies just isn't that good. Mean Streets serves as a jumping-off point for Scorsese. He'd go on to bigger and better things. Much, much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising but aimless early film from Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his early feature Mean Streets, Martin Scorsese situated himself as a chronicler of the lives of urban scumbags, small time crooks, and entry level gangsters. He captures these people in their natural settings: poorly lit bars, crummy apartments, and the backstreets that give the film its title. One of the most striking (and famously influential) aspects of this film is the use of popular music instead of the more typical orchestral score. 1960s pop music is ubiquitous in the film; unfortunately it is so heavily used that it does more to distract from the atmosphere than add to it. I suppose the upbeat music is used ironically to suggest the immature mental state of the thugs who often find themselves over their heads in the shady world they inhabit but the lack of subtlety makes it seem clumsy rather than clever.Stylistically the film is quite similar to Scorsese's later work: he favors extended tracking shots to introduce locations and he tends to show action scenes from the perspective of an uninvolved observer rather than a participant, a tactic which makes the proceedings seem oddly immediate in spite of the detached viewpoint. Unfortunately, Scorsese also chooses an episodic plot structure which slows the film to a snail's pace and fails to involve the viewer in the lives of the characters. In spite of his considerable skills as a director, Scorsese is ultimately not that good at telling stories and this film is the strong evidence of that. Also, Scorsese is overly sympathetic to his low life characters; he seems to be suggesting that these are decent people who find themselves in bad situations but he does little to show this.Scorsese has expressed his admiration for Federico Fellini's film I Vitellonni and it's clear that this film was greatly influenced by that one. While I don't consider that film to be among Fellini's best, Mean Streets is a comparatively weak work. The ennui of Fellini's characters is more clearly expressed and altogether more convincing. In spite of all the time that is spent with a few characters in Mean Streets I never really felt like I knew much about them or their (lack of?) motivations. By the time the main storyline of Mean Streets comes together in the last few minutes of the film it felt too late if not entirely too little. Still, this is an early film that showcases the promise that would eventually come to fruition with films like Taxi Driver and my personal favorite The King of Comedy and as such it is of some interest.</fullReview>

Funny dialogue (De Niro: `What am I in coffee and cake land, here?'), improvisatory feel throughout and fine camera work mingled with a retro 1960s jukebox soundtrack and always the threat of unsurpressed violence (lotsa fights!). My favorite scene is when Keitel and his boys go to the local bookie in a pool hall and get into not one but two scuffles (`Mook? Pregnant pause: `I'll give ya Mook!') Look sharp for David and Robert Carradine in an unbelievable bar shooting, Scorsese's mother helping Keitel's epileptic girlfriend Robinson and Scorsese himself as an assassin (and yes that's him in the beginning moments as Keitel's voice over'd conscience).

Are these the only gangsters in film history who didn't carry guns?Unfortunately for "Mean Streets", the bar has been raised in the three decades since this film was made. But fortunately, one of the key directors who raised that bar was Scorsese.I think film buffs just hear how "great" this is, and they jump on with the bandwagon. It really doesn't hold up to films that have come out since, including most subsequent Scorsese pictures.One final thought: This film has probably been romanticized (maybe by Scorsese) as "autobiographical."

		<fullReview>I really hated it. There is NO plot here. It's just a few days in the lives of these idealistic go-alongs with Harvey Keitel having the most screen time. Yeah, I saw the spiffy DVD with a macho, young DeNiro on the back and thought "Hey, this might be cool. Mean Streets, huh? Scorsese? Okay, I'll bite. It's probably pretty good." Yeah - as good as a big face rash on photo op day. DeNiro is SUPPORTING actor. The best thing in the whole movie was when he blew up the mailbox. While they were at it, too bad nobody threw the script and screenplay in there.Scorsese's [randomly experimentational] direction was moody and lost all novelty after a short while. So did the overly saturated "song system" stream-lined through you'd think they forgot to turn off the radio while they filmed. Watching a movie should be fun, whether it's perverted fun or bloodlust fun, wallowing fun, emotional pitfall or escapist fun - you should still have a good time while you melt away your life in front of the little glowing screen that solves all your problems for just a little while. But Mean Streets? Stale and depressing. Afterwards, I felt like I died (which, in terms of living, defeats the entire purpose, now doesn't it). I'm not saying I wanted a sunshiny, happily-ever-after marshmallow ending. I'm just saying the WHOLE thing was sad and lonely. Everything was so tormented, the part where they walked into the cemetery, the mood actually lightened up.Mean Streets could have gone on for hours and hours. But OOPS lookee here, the 2 hour mark is coming up, so it's time to shut down Hollywood. Let's go for a big, completely unpredictable splashy ending to prove we're still macho (justifying all of our girlie, mushy romantic moments) and wam bam there we go. Aren't we clever?Scorsese did Goodfellas. So what? What the hell does Goodfellas have to do with Mean Streets? You know it's a bad movie when a filmmaker's future work is name-dropped to justify past work. Maybe I'm overanalyzing. Mean Streets just wasn't my style. I'm sure some conformists out there liked it because 1970s American Cinema History dictates Scorsese is ONE of the FEW, and since he's friends with Spielberg, Lucas and Coppola (our honorary demi-gods, let's face it, these people are practically our fathers) so to be critically popular we sell the product. Almost without thought, we sell the merchandise, scared to death to look at it hard enough to realize what it AIN'T. But I'll do us all the favor and call it as I see it ::: Mean Streets needs to be closed down for repairs. Divert your traffic elsewhere. For the love of Spielberg, take a DETOUR.I'll be over at Cafe Fellini on 23rd and 4th.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting film, very real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is classic Scorsese. It's so real you almost forget you're watching a film. A great example of this is the fight scenes, they're not Hollywood fights, they're like a real life bar fight and this really does add to the grittiness. There are a few scenes which are just so iconic. The soundtrack is fantastic and the way that they play the exact opposite of what you want to hear really catches you off guard, whereas in most films you can tell when something's going to happen because the music changes, this doesn't happen in Mean Streets and makes the entire thing feel so much more real. The characters are brilliant although I feel they could have elaborated on Charlie's uncle a bit more. De Niro as the uncontrollable, arrogant good-for-nothing and Keitel as his attempted saviour works a treat and both deliver fantastic performances. You can tell that Scorsese has grown up in and around this kind of life and the whole thing is believable as a result of this. If you're looking for an all gun's blazing action you'll be disappointed. If you like realistic character studies, then you'll adore Mean Streets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro walks into the bar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie (Harvey Keitel) is a low level hood working for his uncle Giovanni (Cesare Danova) collecting debts. Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) is his crazy friend. Charlie is secretly dating Johnny Boy's cousin Teresa (Amy Robinson). Johnny Boy is reckless and owes gambling debts. Tony (David Proval) and Michael (Richard Romanus) are fellow hoods who run the bar. Michael demands Johnny Boy pay up his debts which leads to a confrontation.The moment that Robert De Niro walks into the bar with "Jumpin' Jack Flash" playing is pure cinematic magic. Harvey Keitel gives a good performance. It's a twisted world where he is conflicted about his version of sins. De Niro is amazing. Quite frankly, it needs more De Niro. This movie sets the new bar for the American crime drama. Scorsese brings a new intensity to the urban gangster movie. I do wish he concentrate solely on Keitel and De Niro and make this a two person film. Nobody else in the movie is quite as charismatic as those two. Actress Amy Robinson can't reach their level. It does feel a little scattered sometimes. However the movie is simply an American original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another 70's film that gets high marks due to the all-star cast in their youth. Deniro is refreshingly good, but outside of Deniro's performance, this movie is boring, slow moving, unrealistic, and has spotty acting among the rest of the cast. And that is not even addressing the technical flaws among other things. The fight scene in the beginning is one of the worst shot and is comically bad on a level that you don't even see in student films. It's clear that critics and reviewers give this film a pass on all it's flaws simply due to Scorsese/Keitel/Deniro. I can get past many of the technical flaws from the shaky and out of focus camera, to the poor dialogue, but I can't get past the uncaptivating story. Any mob film needs a feel of realism, and Mean Streets is severely lacking in that area.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw and aesthetic work of a true auteur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, when I really started taking a interest in film, Mean Streets was one of the first Scorsese films I watched. I thought it had some interesting elements but I didn't really like it. Now, after having seen (and liked) a large part of Scorsese's work, I watched it again. I suddenly realised its greatness. It might just be my favourite Scorsese film.The reason for this turnaround is probably because I now have a different way of watching and thinking about film. Therefore, what impresses me now about Mean Streets is its unique style. The plot is perhaps nothing special: small-time hood Charlie (Harvey Keitel) struggles to make ends meet in New York with his dim-witted friend Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro), who owes money all over town. The setting is often at their friend Tony (David Proval)'s bar. But, as Marty's work has taught me over time, plot is less important than story. The camera-work, the music, the cinematography, it just works. The film's raw energy is ubiquitous: in one of the great frenetic scenes in the film, 'Please Mr. Postman' plays during a bar brawl between Charlie's clique and people who owe them money . The shaky camera follows Johnny Boy as he frantically defends himself. Scorsese masterfully plays with lighting and point of view to convey the characters' emotional state. In another legendary scene, Charlie holds his hand in a flame. This scene shows how Scorsese makes you ask questions about guilt, about religion, as he has done throughout all of his films. He gives you slow-motion, you think in slow-motion; every detail matters. The film and Charlie's character especially give us an interesting discussion about Catholicism and religion in general("You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is BS and you know it.). For all of the above, for the red colour inside Tony's bar, for the scene with "Be my Baby", for the close-up shot following a drunk Harvey Keitel, for the pure energy of the film, Martin Scorsese should be recognised as a true auteur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mean Streets (1973): A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's 1973 film 'Mean Streets', is one of his most stylish, energetic and enjoyable films to date. After it's initial release, the director has created a collection of incredible films that can justifiably be called some of the best ever made. It first hit theaters just over 40 years ago, but still manages to feel fresh and authentic. The film has a lot to offer, most notably: One of Robert De Niro's earliest performances, the forging of Martin Scorsese's trademark directing techniques and style, a director's understanding of his work, a dynamic soundtrack and a master taking charge of his art. I mentioned previously that this is a film by a director who completely understands his work. He tells the story with knowledge and detail that we can't help but admire. My favorite character, and I think that most viewers will agree with me, is Robert De Niro's 'Johnny Boy'. The minute this character walks onto the screen, calmly from around the corner, and places an explosive into a post box, the audience knows that they will love him. He then runs down the street towards the camera, the post box explodes, and he takes cover behind another corner. As he looks back at the post box, he smiles. For me, this scene perfectly captures the entire meaning of the film. It encapsulates the adrenaline and excitement that lures these men into this life, the life of a gangster. This film is all about the romanticism of the mob, and the affect this idea had on Italian-Americans living in New York's Little Italy. In short, this film is a fine achievement, in cinema, and in a career full of many incredible works. Martin Scorsese's 'Mean Streets' is a must see, I urge everyone who loves movies to see it.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drama with a lot of good acting involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is a drama from a director who just knows how to make a film and contain all the elements it should have. This film is no different to Scorsese's others and although this is considered his early work, it is no way a film that isn't near his best. With it's street setting of New York and the brilliant acting and actors involved, this turns out to be a film that although I sometimes feel is overrated, it still a very good film, and here below is why I think it is that.The story is a short one but tells the tale of street mob life in the 70's with a kind of chill and ease that means the film is never loud or too serious, but delves into the inner workings of a part of the criminal underworld. The story does slow just a little towards the end but still maintains a presence where you feel deeply involved and this could be one of those films where the camera angles are from your own perspective as if you are there.Harvey Keitel is brilliant here, if the film would have been just a little better I feel, he could have won awards and nominations for his role. Robert De Niro is an actor who never seems to not be around in different decades, and yet again he shows up this time as a young man with serious anger issues who which Keitel guides him through some lessons in life. I liked Richard Romanus in this one and his easy attitude and calm demeanour(well mostly) is greatly appreciated in the tempo of this movie.Martin Scorsese directs and writes this very well, he just seems to know how to not just write engaging dialogue and scenes that usually end up boring being actually entertaining, but also how to move his actors around the camera to get a beautifully acted sequence. The soundtrack with this is pretty neat, it works well in scenes and provides if anything a mood setting for certain scenes, Scorsese really knew how to use music to his advantage in this movie.The main criticism for this film is mostly from the way it is very slow, a lot of talking and not a whole lot goes on, great drama yes but I felt to be a bit better, it needed ever more drama and maybe possibly some intense fights. By what I say I mean no disrespect to this movie it is very good, but it just is sometimes a little slow and especially with the ending or middle to end, it slows significantly down going for the finish.Scorsese fans should love it, it contains elements we are so used to from him and of course who else but Robert De Niro stars in it. I think that although it is based on Italian American mobsters, fans of films like that may not like it the same way they love others, it doesn't contain action much and the crime at a few times is kept at a very low level indeed, still a great piece of crime drama for anyone who likes it.I found this to be Safely a Very Good movie, it starts off great and never really fades until the middle of the end but it goes to show that if a film like this that fades still is very good, it is a film you should see. Enjoy Scorsese here and you should be rewarded with his bountiful skill, not his best in my opinion but some do think it is so go with that, but I tell you don't listen to what others say and think it is all good, watch it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A debt in Little Italy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is a raw film which would raised at the time eyebrows and heckles in equal measures and showed off the embryonic talents of then rising director Martin Scorsese. He borrows his filmmaking influences such as Powell &amp; Pressburger's Black Narcissus but as Michael Powell once remarked to him, 'there is just too much red lighting dear boy!'However I first watched this film almost twenty years after its release and found the film hard going. Its nice to see a young Keitel and De Niro showing off their acting chops but the film felt boring and its style had been copied by other directors since that time.Seeing the film again recently I can appreciate Scorsese trying to being a new energy to New York set films in a way that young British film makers did in the early 1960s with the kitchen sink dramas showing a rawness and verve to working class Britain.Here is tale of low life hoods in little Italy. Keitel's Charlie mixes religious guilt with working for his Uncle who is a mobster and looking after his friend, Johnny Boy (De Niro) who is both psychotic and an idiot. Keitel has a girlfriend, Teresa who is Johnny's cousin and an epileptic but his relationship with her is furtive because his uncle disapproves of her because of her epilepsy. At one point he wants to date a black woman and again loses his nerve because of what people might think.De Niro is a live-wire as Johnny Boy, pulling stupid stunts, getting involve in fights and generally being a jerk. He and Al Pacino were playing these kind of characters in theatres off Broadway for many years so they had a grounding on these New York street kids.Richard Romanus and David Proval round up the main players who are more astute, determined and likely to succeed as they know Johnny Boy will just drag everybody down but Charlie does not see it.Things come to a head because Johnny Boy owes money and is unable to pay it back and unwilling to pay it back. That is very much it plot wise. Until then its a slice of life drama as we see a microcosm of Little Italy society. Its a film that dazzles with its technical style which is typically Scorsese. However it also lacks heart which in my opinion something Scorsese will show in his later films as it leaves you cold.</fullReview>

It isn't now! The characters in this film are Italian mobsters on the mean streets. The movie has a flawed script but great acting by Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro. This film showed Little Italy, an Italian American neighborhood. Sadly, the neighborhood is probably not the same. There is still the annual San Gennaro festival. The streets have remained the same but the residents have changed. They've moved or died. Scorsese grew up in this neighborhood. He is obviously cares so much. This film is a slice of history back when New York City had the crime families.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The breakthrough film for the young Martin Scorsese may not be as technically slick as his later efforts, and may not have a very meaty story - it is kind of episodic - but it's hard to deny how vividly he creates characters and establishes milieus, all with the help of a talented cast. This marked his historic first teaming with Robert De Niro, and it was clear from the start how well filmmaker and actor could work together.It's a somewhat autobiographical tale of life in NYC's Little Italy, with small time gangster Charlie (Harvey Keitel) having to tolerate, on a regular basis, his aimless, irresponsible buddy Johnny Boy (De Niro), a deep in debt loser who'll drop bombs in mailboxes for kicks. Charlie also has a girlfriend, Teresa (Amy Robinson), who's deemed unfit by his family because she suffers from epilepsy. He could have the opportunity to run a restaurant for his uncle Giovanni (Cesare Danova), but is required to do something about the Johnny Boy and Teresa situations as a condition.Other friends in Charlies' life are bar owner Tony (David Proval) and mobster Michael (Richard Romanus); Michael is one of those to whom Johnny Boy owes money. Michael tries to be patient, but it remains to be seen if the reckless Johnny Boy will ever grow up.With Scorsese making typically eclectic choices for his soundtrack, he totally draws the audience into this world. The actors are superb, with De Niro and Keitel nicely contrasting each other. Other familiar faces include Victor Argo, George Memmoli, Jeannie Bell, David *and* Robert Carradine (as a drunk and a punk kid who tussle in one of the films' most memorable sequences), and Harry Northup.Scorsese keeps things matter of fact without taking them too far into melodrama, but shows an impressive flair for violence in the downbeat ending.Any lover of NYC crime stories would be well advised to check out "Mean Streets"; while serious film buffs admire it, it's still not quite as popular as some of the directors' later works.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese jump-starts his career here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two less than stellar productions as a director, Martin Scorsese emerged fully formed as one of the premier American filmmakers of a new generation. The American New Wave has begun, along with Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas and Bogdanovich. While each of those directors made their unique mark during the 1970s, Scorsese's came in 1973 with Mean Streets, a most sensational and provocative film depicting what Scorsese saw as the two paths set before him as a young man in New York: gangster or priest.As with Who's That Knocking at My Door, Harvey Keitel embodies the Scorsese character in Charlie, a successful hustler for his Mafia uncle torn between his Catholic beliefs and the pressure of success on the streets. He is constantly going back and forth between what he feels he should do and what is much easier to do. Herein lies the true theme and conflict in the film, a theme explored again and again by Scorsese. Keitel is such a likable screen presence that it is difficult for the audience to invoke much regret towards him, despite the clear mistakes he makes throughout the story.The biggest one is the relationship he maintains with Johnny Boy, a compulsive, hot-tempered street thug who is way over his head in debt to nearly everyone in the neighborhood. He is also Charlie's best friend and his girlfriend's brother. Robert De Niro plays Johnny in his first of many roles for Scorsese, and it is so rare to see both a director and star emerge as great as they are in just one film. Clearly, there was chemistry between the two and the fact that De Niro dominates every scene he is in only foreshadows the greatness he would later embody.As mentioned before, the main theme is Catholic guilt and the attempt to correlate that with human desires and emotions. Scorsese uses fluid camera work, harsh lighting and intense performances to drive his message through, even if the story at times feels slightly off kilter. Still, this is a remarkable film, one that clearly foreshadows Scorsese's next collaboration with De Niro and Keitel and would be hailed as one of the greatest of all American films: Taxi Driver. Here is the starting point, and it is a marvelous show as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Streets is the first personal film from Martin Scorsese. It's not especially plot-driven; instead it's a series of scenes interconnected by a group of common characters who live in New York's Little Italy. The primary narrative thrust such as it is concerns a low-level gangster called Charlie (Harvey Keitel) and his loyalty to his wayward friend Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro). This loose-cannon of a friend owes a minor Mafia boss some money but seeing as he has no personal responsibility he shows complete indifference to paying this debt off. This scenario puts his friend Charlie in a severely compromised situation. The loose narrative framework is basically a means for Scorsese to present a string of episodes that give us a feel for the characters and their surroundings. And this he certainly achieves. There is a rawness to the presentation which fits the story very well. There's loads of shaky hand-held camera work. The profanity-ridden, often improvised, dialogue is frequently barely audible. This is not slick polished cinema. It's rough around the edges. However, this serves the movie well, as this isn't a film about high-flyers. The characters in Mean Streets are at best minor players in the New York organised crime scene, this is borne out when they go to some trouble to cheat some youngsters out of $20 and actually seem to consider it some kind of reasonable result. This movie is quite far removed from the crime world depicted in Scorsese's later classics Goodfellas and Casino. It's strictly a view from the street level. Of hoods who are near the bottom of the organised crime world.The narrative and characters are often sketched out by random events - the scene with the lion cub being a good example. These little isolated vignettes combine together to form an overall picture of these people and the world they exist in. Mean Streets is an excellent moving photograph of the Lower East Side of the early 70's; a great time-capsule of those times and that place. You really get a feel for that world. This sense of reality is important and things are never overly stylized. Whenever the numerous fights break out, for example, they are never presented as anything other than messy and uncoordinated like real bar-room brawls.Scorsese uses music in a way that would become one of his trademarks. Perhaps his greatest single use of it is when the character Johnny Boy is introduced in slow motion, bathed in red light to the Rolling Stones Jumping Jack Flash. A truly definitive Scorsese moment. And a great introduction to Robert De Niro. While Harvey Keitel gives a great performance too, it's the young De Niro who particularly stands out. Scorsese has always been a great director of actors, and his relationship with De Niro in particular would go on to be one of the great director-actor collaborations. This is where it all started and it's not hard to see the chemistry.Mean Streets isn't Scorsese's best film but it's the first one where his true voice was heard. It shows his skill at combining gritty dramatics with a muscular narrative. It's an excellent showcase too for De Niro and Keitel and naturally comes recommended for anyone at all interested in 70's cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Break-Through but Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to go with the middle-of-the-road reviewers here. Scorsese is a gifted director and you should definitely see this movie, but Mean Streets, his break-through 1973 film financed on spec by Francis Ford Coppola, is a low-budget, low-production values, plot less piece of cinema verite that celebrates what used to be Little Italy in lower Manhattan, just as Marty celebrates the Bronx of roughly the same period. I suspect that Mean Streets was intended to ride the coat-tails of Coppola's Godfather I, released the previous year, and Godfather II, then in production, but it has not aged as well.Still, De Niro gives an extraordinarily entertaining performance as a fun loving low life in hock to the Mob. Harvey Keitel is O.K. as a stand-in for Scorsese himself in what is admittedly the director's memoir of his youth. In the first half of the film, the dialog, especially that between De Niro and Keitel, is in the tradition of great screwball comedy. Later Keitel's uncle corrects his understanding of Mafia ethics, and there is a brief long shot of Keitel observing a zonked out line chef sneezing and smoking a cigarette over a pot of pasta. As script and image, these scenes typify Scorsese at his high and low comedy best.There is also a fine sense of period here, from wardrobe to score, but the plot is mostly missing in action, and the characters (including the love interest played by Amy Robinson and even De Niro) are undeveloped or made to act in ways that flow from nothing. For example, a big point is made of the fact that Robinson's character is an epileptic, and at one point she even has a seizure on a staircase, but unless the purpose is to illustrate Keitel abandoning her in a time of need or the use of period first aid techniques on a staircase, it was lost on me. De Niro is a great impromptu actor. Keitel is not.There are gratuitous if pleasant uses of nudity, the familiar Feast of San Gennaro, the Italian language, and unconvincing violence, the last of these a part of the low production values. The last half of the film is not well edited. When Scorsese waxes poetic, as in use of Catholic imagery and a graveyard at night, the poetry rings false. Some rental discs come with a short, informative, but truncated selection of scenes and voice-over by Scorsese and Robinson, and a grainy making-of-the-movie short with a ponderous, March of Time-like voice-over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Streets {dir. Martin Scorsese, 1973} (****/****)Before this second viewing, the praise for Mean Streets had always alluded me. I viewed it as a good work by a great director (Scorsese) who still had his best films ahead of him. Indeed, Scorsese would go on to make great films later, such as GoodFellas and Raging Bull, but now I see Mean Streets as a film that belongs in that esteemed company. The film is a thinly plotted view into the lives of small time hoodlums in early-1970's New York City. A fairly tiresome presence, but the films roots are in Martin Scorsese's own past and it is that personal insight that makes Mean Streets something truly special. Also of note, this film is the first pairing of legendary actor director combination Robert DeNiro and Scorsese. DeNiro plays the violate and headstrong Johny-Boy. It is a performance of such malevolent and volcanic charisma that I think it ranks among Jake LaMotta as one of DeNiro's most sharply observed and well played characters.</fullReview>

I've always been a fan of Scorsese films but never ventured further back than taxi driver before I bought this on DVD in sale. I have to admit I'm quite surprised the average rating is not above 8, whilst Mean Streets isn't as polished as some of Scorsese's later work it has an energy to it that is up there with his best. DeNiro is just brilliant in this film but Keitel deserves as much praise for his portrayal of a Charlie who is forever caught between his strict catholic morality and the lifestyles of the people he is surrounded with. This film still seems fresh and innovative today and some of the scenes perfectly blend exciting on screen action with sweet 1960s pop music (particuarly the early on pool room brawl!) It was interesting to read about the production of this film in easy riders and raging bulls and it appears that several mistakes were made during its release which lead to it not being the major success it should of been. This film was years ahead of its time and its almost impossible to imagine some of the energetic "cool" gangster films subsequent to this without the influence of Mean Streets (Pulp Fiction and Scorcese's own Goodfellas in particular) This film is a must see especially with anyone with a thirst for gangster films with believable characters and some great seemingly improvised dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that is very problematic. It is not that old but the action is set in quite an older period, yet Robert de Niro looks like a young actor just out of drama school trying to imitate his mentor Robert de Niro himself, an older version of himself in a way. The film has little depth actually. We all know you must not play with the law of the street that the bad boys of the underworld are imposing onto those who are dumb enough not to be blind and what's more who want to have their share of the cake they have not contributed to kneading, baking and glazing. The real point is that a few thousand dollars become a monumental debt when the borrower becomes dumb enough to pretend in the lender's face and in front of quite a few witnesses he will never pay back because the lender is a dumb idiot. The end is signed in that declaration. Death. And death again and again on two innocent acolytes. The film has essentially one interest: the young de Niro and how he is already building his artistic texture, a texture he will never lose nor change.

		<shortDescription>Engrossing and interesting film studying young criminals and their mentality, from a director on the verge of greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always enjoyed Martin Scorsese's films, principally because I like the genre of crime he dips in and out of. But part of the reason I cannot love Scorsese's films is because he doesn't really specialise in telling a tail of thieves or murderers or conforming to conventional noir attributes. Some might see this as a good thing, if not close to genius that he can take a genre and give it his own stamp of ingenuity as he tells a tale about people in situations, often realistic and involving. Casino and Gangs of New York share their themes of crime on a large scale but I cannot ever really come to love these films, principally because of the look; the polish they carry and the huge cast that draw people in. I've always maintained that crime and gritty thrillers that can fall into the noir genre look best when low grade, dirty and inexpensive. For a while it seems Scorsese made these sorts of films but it's only because he was not the name he is now back in the early 1970s. Taxi Driver is one of my favourite films of all time and principally because it fits the ideation of a visually grotty look complete with location shot equally so. Yes, it could be seen to fall into the crime genre, any film with the typical conventions that are guns, gun runners, pimps and their loose girls could be placed into the genre but there is no concrete evidence that it wants to be considered so. Taxi Driver could be read into as a study of mental illness following a past tragedy (the Vietnam War) or even a study of isolation as it builds into obsession.But Mean Streets now seems to be where it all began for Scorsese and co. and it's an impressive manner in which to kick start a career. Mean Streets is very a down to Earth film, shot on ground level for most of the time in locations we like to see guys and characters like these inhabit. The film borrows from the neo-realism movement in the sense it takes people, some of whom might not even be actors, and places them in a film that is not propelled by a plot of sorts more so characters' desire to hang about and do what it is they deem worthy of their time.Similarly to Taxi Driver, this film doesn't necessarily demand a placement within a genre. Mean Streets revolves around people of a criminal nature doing activity of a criminal sort but the real studies are far more advanced. The principal characters that drive this fate fuelled film may be acting out what we expect them to do ie; get drunk, do some dealing, attempt to maintain a relationship with someone of the opposite sex, maintain friendships and generally interact with other seedy individuals in the world they live. But Charlie (Keitel) and Johnny Boy (De Niro) are given personas rather than rendered caricatures in a genre piece. Charlie represents a superego figure of sorts, a reasonable and cool minded individual who you get the feeling just wants to survive on the streets of Little Italy. Contrasted to Johnny Boy, Charlie is the nicest guy you'll ever meet. As a character, Johnny Boy is the ego Charlie must calm ? an unhinged and random individual who, even when faced with the threat of danger and his life can only smile and enjoy himself ? best summed up during the pool hall fight. It is Johnny Boy's ego Charlie must act as the counterbalance to, for both their sakes. As an on screen friendship, Charlie and Johnny Boy's never really gets to that point in which you could class it as anything other than pretty good but the emphasis is more on the study of the two in terms of psychology and the struggle with psychology in a 'mans' world that is very prejudice and unforgiving whilst retaining an atmosphere that is close knit. My immediate thoughts of comparison veered toward John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men in which two individuals (George and Lenny) attempt to get by in harsh times under close knit, male dominated spaces.But Of Mice and Men's study was tilted much more away from an aggressive mentality and more-so towards a childlike innocence, possessed by a monster of a man. Mean Streets is more of a study suited to the urban streets rather than the rural farmland setting and it works well. Charlie's struggles to follow his heart or his mind make for an interesting battle since there is no clear cut antagonist from which to derive much of a power struggle. But Mean Streets is the sort of film in which there will be a gun fired in a bar and later on, characters will speak to other characters whom weren't there about what happened, retaining that sense of drama and surprise.As a study of a person trying to get by in a world he perhaps isn't really suited for, Mean Streets works well. If it feels too long then it's because there are a lot of other scenes that accompany Charlie's day by day life, most of which show Scorsese implanting his own style, that feel a little out of place; indeed scenes like the brawl which is rectified very quickly. That said, Mean Streets is never uninteresting and retains that allure simply because it's an early Scorsese divulge into that world of the criminal and of the gangster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Scorsese masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorsese and De Niro became an unstoppable director/actor team after this movie and when you see the acting and directing in this film you can clearly understand why. Not to mention Harvey Keitel's brilliant and deep lead performance as Charlie. It's clear that the chemistry between De Niro and Keitel is not to be matched by any other two actors of their time. Besides the outstanding acting Scorsese innovates film making in many superb scenes, such as the "private party" scene and the famous "bar scene", not to mention the intro. The film is right up there with Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas. It's is a must see for fans of Scorsese, 70's film making, and just general movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the qualities of a great movie, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes us to an Italian neighborhood of New York City and follows the daily life of Charlie (Harvey Keitel). We are all products of our natures and our environments and Charlie is by nature a decent guy trying to survive in a pretty tough environment. Emotions are on the surface and can erupt on the slightest provocation, and pass just as quickly. The young men in this movie are about thirty years old, but they have the emotional maturity of teenagers.At the heart of this film are Charlie's relationships with his friend Johnny Boy (a young Robert De Niro) and with the Catholic church. Johnny is quite out of control - he lives for the moment with no care or thought for the consequences of his actions. He has run up gambling debts that his creditors are getting serious about and he thinks (as much as he does think about the future) that Charlie is going to bail him out through his contacts with the mob. Most of us have known people like Johnny - they can be spontaneous, charming, entertaining and make us envious of their carefree nature - but they can be incredibly frustrating. In the case of someone like Johnny, most people would just give up on him, but to Charlie's credit he sticks with him and tries to talk sense to him. This speaks volumes about Charlie's good nature.Perhaps more interesting is Charlie's relationship with the Church. He worries about burning in hell to the point of holding his hand in candle flames just to get a taste. Or is it to pay penance to ward off the ultimate flames? How does Charlie resolve his life of petty crime with the Church? It would appear mainly by way of conflict and anguish, but not overwhelmingly so.This is an early example of Scorsese's consummate skill as a director. The lighting, camera angles, pop music soundtrack and action keep you engaged.The story has a realistic feel which I assume comes from its being somewhat autobiographical, since Scorsese grew up in this neighborhood. For those who did not grow up there, this movie is like visiting a foreign country and the culture shock is not insignificant.In spite of all the remarkable qualities I found that this movie lacked that indefinable quality that involves me to the level of feeling it is more than good.</fullReview>

This movie is very personal to Marty. I reckon the most anyway. That line said by the big M himself "You make up for your sins on the street not in church" has to be the best line in any of his films. Its great. The ending screws me a bit, who died who survived its a bit bad so that's why this wouldn't get a 10. But hey, an 8 is just as good. This film is a must for any budding Scorsese fans as it was his first step into becoming the most legendary director of the last 50 years. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Scorsese, Fresh DeNiro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some might find Scorsese's work on Mean Streets quite different from that of his other films. However, what makes this movie work, is that it is as gripping as it is real. Life in the time of this movie was as tough as Scorsese portrays it. Not every mafia man is exactly happy. Gambling has caught everyone in debt, and people face tough choices in life.It is not odd to find that not everyone is happy with their lives. After all, how worse can it be? Try having even your best friends wanting to kill you. Such is the case of Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro in one of his greatest roles), who is childish, destructive, and at a point some shrinks might call at the edge of lunacy. He owes many people money, the local mob boss hates him, and hes a danger to society.Charlie (Keitel, also a good performance) is a very religious Catholic man. He spends most of his time contemplating his religion and his sins as well as staring into the fires thinking of hell. He's a very complex character (yet Johnny Boy still remains the best), and what happens is that he is forced to be a mafioso because his uncle is the local boss (and hates Johnny), and even though he doesn't bring in much he still continues. He watches out for Johnny Boy but even himself has to come to a decision of whether he is going to kill him or not or even send him away, via his uncle's requests.There are also other characters, who even not as great as Charlie and Johnny, still manage to capture our attention, and we try to get into their head as we realize, like Charlie and Johnny, they are trying to survive.As for the plot, (which Scorsese makes a joke about in The Departed) there is none. That is part of Scorsese's genius, he does not have to give you a whole plot but a story. The story is of friends growing up on Little Italy trying to survive. It's so simple its great.Scorsese's directing is great with including great camera angles, lighting, and some memorable scenes. The pool scene is a particular favorite of mine, its such a messy fight that, it almost symbolizes the how the characters are. Messy but willing to get it done. Another great scene is in which Keitel gets drunk filmed in a way that makes even me woozy.Yet still in the end, the movie has its meaning. No matter what, every life has its consequences. Charlie and Johnny Boy become outcasts of the life they once lived. And though it was tough, it was all they had to keep them going. Welcome to the Mean Streets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets saw its theatrical release in early in 1973. Directed by a young bearded director by the name of Martin Scorcese, the film featured a then unknown Robert Deniro as well as a young, clean cut Harvey Keitel. The film was based on Scorcese's experiences growing up in New York's 'Little Italy' in the early sixties. Scorcese would spend hours with fellow scriptwriter Mardik Martin in a parked car, observing his old neighborhood for any ideas to add to a movie he was planning to make called,' Season of the witch'. This film would later become Mean Streets. It revolves around Charlie (Keitel), a catholic man trying to work his way up the mob hierarchy. Unfortunately, he is also in love with a woman (Amy Robinson) who is epileptic which is a big no-no in the mob world. Just to make matters worse for Charlie, he also sticks his neck out for Johnny Boy (Deniro) who is highly in debt to a loan shark named Michael. As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that Johnny Boy has no intentions on repaying Michael back anytime soon. Take all of this, blend it together with a smooth 60's soundtrack and you have the fabric that makes up Mean Streets. The film was originally planned to be produced by Roger Corman on one condition; Corman wanted all black actors! Obviously this didn't work out and another producer was brought in. When viewing Mean Streets, you can't help but notice the extensive use of the steady cam! At one point in the film, Keitel is actually wearing a steadycam-esqu brace on his body while "Rubber Biscuit" by The Chips plays vigorously in the background. Scorcese actually received some criticism from friend and fellow filmmaker Michael Powell since Powell argued that many of the steady cam shots were too jerky and should have been replaced with dolly shots instead. In some cases it's easy to see Powell's point, but for the most part I actually prefer the jarring feeling that the steady cam brings to the picture. The pacing of Mean Streets relies heavily on this disconcerted feeling and I feel the constant use of the steady cam helps to employ this-although I do feel bad for whoever the steady cam operator is?ouch! A lot of these early camera shots would later influence filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino and would have a profound influence on Scorcese's own movie, 'Casino'. The acting in Mean Streets is excellent throughout. Keitel is spot on as Charlie and Deniro's 'Johnny Boy' is a great introduction to his often-copied method style of acting. In one scene, Deniro actually got into a live argument with Richard Romanus who portrayed the loan shark Michael. The two had been in an argument for the majority of the 25-day shoot so Scorcese, ever the entrepreneur, played off on this with sound results! The editing throughout the movie works parallel with many of the off angle camera shots. It does works out well in the end though. This was one of the few Scorcese pictures to not have Thelma Schoonmaker as editor. Rather, Scorcese employed a young Sidney Levin for the job. Music also plays a pivotal role in Mean Streets. It features music from the 60's including a few early Rolling Stones tracks to boot. One final tidbit worth mentioning about this film has to be the enlivening quotes! We hear Johnny Boy's,"It's a good twenty dollars!" rant to Charlie's, "You know Joey Clams?" argument. The subtextural humour is always present and adds a subtle flair to an otherwise perfect sophomore film from Martin Scorcese.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorcese's "Mean Streets" feels like the best student movie ever made. It's like a dry-run for "Taxi Driver" and "Goodfellas" and all those other more densely plotted, grander movies that followed. And it is one of the cinema's greatest pieces of personal movie-making. Virtually plot less, it conveys a fly-on-the-wall observational sense of what it was like to be a wide-boy in Little Italy when Scorcese was growing up and, although fictional, it feels like autobiography, (Scorcese wrote the original story and co-scripted the film with Mardik Martin).It follows the exploits of Charlie and Johnny Boy and Michael and Tony. They don't seem to work for a living though Tony does run a bar and Charlie puts the screws on his uncle's debtors and Michael is well-dressed and can dish out $2000 loans, (though he isn't above fleecing a couple of green kids hustling drugs out of $20). Though Charlie is the pivotal character, (and Harvey Keitel plays him superbly), it is Johnny Boy who is central to the film's action. A dangerously unstable sociopath he is first seen blowing up a mail box for kicks. He is like Charlie's slower kid brother and it's up to Charlie to look out for him. This was the film and the part that really introduced Robert De Niro to the world and he's magnificent. There's an intuitive, improvisatory feel to his acting that gives the movie a buzz. You can get high just watching him; he gives off the same kind of excitement that Brando did in "Streetcar" and James Dean did in "East of Eden". It is probable that both he and Scorcese have surpassed their work on this film but even that is open to debate.</fullReview>

It seemed I missed the whole point of the film, because nothing really happened, only at the end.I do think De Niro did an excellent job. You really begin to hate Johnny Boy, because he does all those stupid things. Keitel also played Charlie well, you really saw he didn't like it, and wanted to get out.Overall, I thought this film was OK, but certainly not the best of Scorscese. After all the comments I read, and the actors, I thought this would be a masterpiece. But I don't think you can say this film is wonderful, it's just good. I have seen better films, like Raging Bull, and Goodfellas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't pay for sins in church. You pay for them on the streets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes you do. Stark words straight from the beginning of the film... and exceptional acting from another, and the first masterpiece from the Scorsese and DeNiro partnership. It is a brilliant portrayal of the harsh reality of the NY streets and the squeeze that was administered to all levels of society. Johnny Boy played by DeNiro is in debt to a bunch of wiseguys who don't want to wait no more. Harvey Kietel is his accomplice trying to win him time and dignity by trying to help him with it, but of course on the mean streets of NY the underdog rarely comes through. Memorable scenes punctuate the film, from conversation in a church yard, a brawl in a pool hall to the final car crash and demise of Johnny and his pals... It is a blunt and unsparing crime film and one that is often (in my opinion) underrated and unseen in the midst of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas which are better films, but seem to diminish the attention that Mean Streets deserves. It is a great film, and it will undoubtedly go down in history. You'd better watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You do not make up for your sins in church!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS ****Excellent***Good **Fair *Poor The whole idea behind "Mean Streets" is that just because you go to church every Sunday doesn't mean God forgives your sins. And, going to confession doesn't count either. It's what you do in your everyday life that counts. God watches you in your everyday life and keeps a record of what you do. That is basically the message Martin Scorsese is trying to get across. In a way I sort of agree with him.Before Scorsese decided to become a filmmaker he thought about becoming a priest. So, because of that fact we can conclude that religion is a big part of his life. And a big part of this film as well. As an early effort he is making something a little more personal, since his previous film, Boxcar Bertha, didn't really do anything.I applaud the film for being what it is and I love every moment in this film. And I especially love the scene in which Harvey Keital places his hand on the surface of a small fire. The character knows he is a sinner and wants to know if he can handle the flames of hell.RATING: 4 STARS (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand why some people would dislike mean streets due to it's lack of plot and structure should they have watched the movie only once. It is, however, the same as passing comment on good music after only listening to it once. Impossible to judge, in my opinion.Scorsese plays heavily on his childhood in content, introducing the audience to his world through the eyes of four local hoods. There is none of the morals of it's contemporary mafia based film, The Godfather... and none of the thrills and wealth portrayed later by Scorsese in 'Goodfellas'. It is a real world where gun crime is unusual and shocking and violence is sporadic and adrenalin fueled.The cogs that keep the film moving forward are that of Charlie's questionable faith and his desire to prove himself by helping Johnny Boy free himself from a mountain of debt he has built up with Michael, a small time shark. The centre point for the scenario is a bar owned by Tony, and the four players weave in and out of each others lives with tensions getting more serious and a downfall becoming more inevitable as the film progresses.I believe that taste is accountable for most things, and quality comes to a lesser extent. To me, this film has something that I cannot put my finger on that makes it shine brightly. As mentioned before, it demands multiple viewings, but give it a chance... and watch it on the big screen if you're lucky enough to have it shown locally, and you might well discover a film that you cannot live without, just as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To criticize Mean Streets is to spit directly into a very strong wind.Here, let me put my goggles on. I am not a Scorsese-phile. I recognize him as a technically brilliant director, but I often want to bathe after seeing one of his films. His work screams "Technical Expertise!", but I find his stories ugly and dispiriting. Watching Joe Pesci stab the poor guy in the trunk in Goodfellas made me sick, DeNiro turning a flophouse into a combat zone in Taxi Driver appalled me (even when I was 18 and in love with movie violence), and the startling murder of a drunken David Carradine in Mean Streets deflated me.I've seen lots of violence in movies, but the sort of relentlessly bloody downers Scorsese puts out overwhelms the artistic brilliance of his work. I know Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro and all the rest of the cast of Mean Streets are collectively and individually superb. I just didn't care about them. Mix the visuals and the music and the sharp dialogue and the late Pauline Kael (or is she?), one of my favorite writers, raved about Mean Streets. I can't. I feel more than dirty, I feel, well, icky.Now, watch. As a complete hypocrite, I'll sit down and watch The Godfather or No. 2 and ooze praise about Coppola's work. The difference is in the characters. Those movies are brilliant, technically expert, and visually breathtaking, but I care about Pacino, Caan, Shire, Brando, Cazale, Keaton, and all the rest. They all seemed like real people.The folks in Scorcese's movies just seem so despicable, so dead already and Mean Streets is a walking corpse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>mean Streets is the 'story' of a group of streetwise characters in new York, and that's about it. There's no real plot or 'direction' to the movie and both the director and leading cast members have (thankfully) gone on to make far better films. The main reasons I just couldn't get into this movie are the grainy photography, poor sound and rotten lighting. I eventually switched over and watched one of John Wayne's early films, twice as old as mean Streets and twice as 'crisp'. I'm sure mean Streets had a low budget but does that have to be SO obvious? The film feels 'cheap' throughout and that makes it (very) hard to hold a viewer's interest. It is interesting to see stars at the beginning of their careers, but that's about all to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Mean Streets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultimately, Mean Streets felt like a slightly uneven film, although still a good one. The film reached a certain quality level where to pick it apart becomes more enjoyable than obvious, and thus the problems I ultimately had with the movie fall more into personal taste issues and less into 'giant gaping plot holes of s**t' issues.First admission: I'm not a big fan of Martin Scorsese. I should be, but his films have proven to be more work to sit through than they really ought to be. This doesn't make them bad films, and Scorsese is good as a director in the sense that he doesn't fall into the traps other directors do, be it egotism (Smith, M. Night), self-indulgence (Lynch, Stone) or just plain lazy stupid fuckery (Lucas). From that sense, good for Scorsese.So Mean Streets feels like a Scorsese film, which can be a mixed bag. In this case you have some strong points that include clever filming and good use of dialogue to music or music to dialogue. These are good things, and the use of sound effects is nicely put together. Sounds like a tiny compliment, but SFX in films with action (particularly with gunfire) is often dismal.The acting is uneven. You have some strong performances on the top, then fallaway to more cardboard characters. The acting isn't bad, but often lacks a spark that really rounds out a cast. Far worse is the problem where the "undercard" is out-acting the people on top, so this film gets the priorities correct. But at times it takes away from the impact of scenes because the smaller actor just don't seem to have that extra "spark". This is constrasted by good character writing, that doesn't always come across in the acting. There were elements of colorful characters that reminded me of the diversity of some Coen Brothers projects, but without the spark of acting that really brings the characters to life.The plot was solid, if somewhat straight forward. This isn't a bad thing; the problem with many modern films is a jumble of a plot designed to be trendy and complex that results in a clusterfuck of a movie that nobody really enjoys watching. Mean Streets has a straight-road plot that serves its purpose. The ending scene seems a bit obvious in coming, but that isn't a bad thing either. Sometimes movies need to go in the direction the viewer expects, or it comes off as having needless swerves. A viewer could watch the movie and enjoy the journey rather than trying to wonder where it was going and figure out what the next step would be.A good film, although not a great film. Time has hurt Mean Streets, as the production suffers with modern technology and techniques. Time does this to most films, and it isn't something to directly insult the film for. The genre has been played to death (often by Scorsese himself) and Mean Streets likely seems fresher to people who haven't seen dozens of similar projects... but this too isn't the fault of the film, merely the context to enjoy the film best in.</fullReview>

As soon as you think a plot might be emerging from the ongoing monotony and argumentative shouting that passes for a 'screenplay', a brass band interrupts everything with a selection of tunes from the album 'Fifty Of Your Favorite Stereotypical Italian Marching Songs' and you're lost again. And why 'pointless'? Well, if there IS one, it certainly disguises itself well. Now you can call me a no-good, intellectually bankrupt moron with the insight of a whelk (what?? Outrageous!!

		<fullReview>Usually when one reviews a movie they just saw, they don't immediately mention the soundtrack or the score, but in this case, the soundtrack is forcibly at the forefront of one's mind after watching Mean Streets, even several days after. Scorsese's films, especially his gangster movies and generally later movies, are typically scored with an eclectic and constant jukebox of a soundtrack, playing under scenes of dialogue and over jump-cut-loaded montages. It adds an enormous amount of charm to them. Mean Streets uses music differently. It has an overpopulated, blaring, nonstop soundtrack, and actually serves as a sort of narrator. There are a few scenes wherein the music adds a particular amount of charm in a way that it hasn't done in Scorsese films quite the same since. For instance, in the first scene where Keitel sees De Niro, or in the wonderful sequence wherein the camera is mounted to Keitel in a closeup as he stumbles drunkenly, or during the bloody climax.There are several moments in Mean Streets that prove Scorsese very early on to be a wonderful filmmaker because of the chances he takes. So many elements waver on the borderline between messy and realistically effective, a lot of them involving the purposely sloppy and attention-drawing editing, replete with uneven reverse cuts, abrupt cutaways, and rocky captions and spotting. Taking the great chance of being too technically choppy and disheveled, that grungy, fast-paced, sleek, squalidly elegant style of his muscles through.Though I'm not a die-hard fan of Keitel's, there are some films where I find him very likable, this being one of them. He understands the fine line between the sympathy towards his character's amiability and the atrocity of his flaws. De Niro, who no matter how powerful he can potentially be cannot help but always take advantage of the extroverted nature of any of the characters he plays and inflate them into swaggering, brash hotshot wiseguys, is always incredibly infectious and entertaining. David Proval and Richard Romanus are diamonds in the ruff in Mean Streets, both affecting completely different kinds of sympathy as characters. The doosey is Amy Robinson, who aside from not absorbing the audience even in any contrast to the rest of the cast, speaks with an accent that eludes to a region far far far away from the iconic, atmospheric New York that the film focuses on so feelingly.This film is a landmark in film because on a filmmaker's mind it has great influence. In 1973, no movies had such intense editing and shooting style, and no movies had such an aggressive and loud rock soundtrack. The movie doesn't truly have a plot. There are points when it seems as if the story is languishing in time, but the movie is about the atmosphere of surroundings, the self-inexplicable provocations of the characters, and the way these people feel their way through life. It's a cinematic impressionist painting, or a stream-of- consciousness narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice early Scorsese film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mean Streets' is considered to be one of the great movies by Martin Scorsese and in most ways I agree with that. Personally I think it is not as good as 'Taxi Driver', 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull' or even 'Casino' but I think that has to do with the time it was made. Like in the movies above Robert De Niro stars together with Harvey Keitel who is also a Scorsese favorite.Keitel is Charlie who works for his uncle. He makes sure people pay the money they owe but he is way to nice to do a job like that. One of his friends is Johnny Boy (De Niro). Johnny Boy owes money to Michael (Richard Romanus) and Charlie keeps promising to Michael that Johnny will pay. Johnny is a real trouble maker as we see in the first scene where he blows up something on a street corner. Just for fun.The movie takes place in the streets and in a bar owned by Tony (David Proval). Many of the key scenes play in this bar. The movie is very dark and only when Charlie is with a girl named Teresa (Amy Robinson) the movie allows itself to show us some light. By his uncle Charlie is not allowed to see Teresa, because she has epilepsy, and he is not allowed to see Johnny Boy because the kid is no good. The uncle, of course, is right but Charlie thinks it is his duty to take care of Johnny.Not much is really happening. We just see these people in Little Italy. The stories we have is Charlie and Teresa, Charlie and Johnny and Johnny who owes money. For Scorsese this is enough to make a very interesting movie with a nice visual style. His camera takes things the way they are, best scene in a bar fight where it follows the characters in messy shots. Things like this should not be choreographed perfectly, or at least they are not supposed to look like that. An interesting early movie by great director Scorsese with nice performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of all thing's '70's, of Robert DeNiro, of Harvey Keitel, of Independent Film...but this movie was the most boring thing I've seen in a while! The film goes absolutely nowhere as it takes us to its not-unforseen conclusion. As much as I like gritty crime dramas, this film was just a bunch of inane, barely audible (or understandable) dialogue mumbled or screamed between characters. Yes, Scorcese is a great director (a bit full of himself at times), but this is not one of his best, better, or good ones. I guess everyone has to start somewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently rented this movie from Blockbuster because I love Martin Scorsese films. I had found out about it from looking at Scorsese's filmography on this site. When I saw it, I enjoyed it. The ending was abrupt yet sufficient. Let's just say this: The movie got the point across. The part of the film that I found most interesting was the cinematography. There was this great seen where Harvey Keitel's character was sliding down the bar tabletop. The point of view in which the scene was shot, and the music to go along with it was great! I don't necessarily recommend this film to all viewers but to every die hard Scorsese fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Scorsese First Masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great fan of Martin Scorsese as a Director and I think with any doubt that he is the Best American Director. He is a Master on Urban themes (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Bringing out the Dead).Mean Streets was one of the first Scorsese's movies and one of the best. In this movie he invented the shot that the actor is the one who carries the camera. This movie is an example of live in the city and the struggle with friends that by some reason become foes. This are themes that occurs to anybody.The perfect thing about this movie is that Scorsese is introducing to the audience the tipe of character he is good in, the anti-hero(As he will immortalize in Taxi driver). Harvey Keitel's character 'Charlie' isn't trying to get clean, instead of that he is trying to get to the top. The characters are so 'human'(Scorsese wrote the screenplay, maybe this is an adapted 'True Story'). Robert de Niro is spectacular with the portrait of the immature, insecure and irresponsible 'Johnny Boy'.Martin Scorsese is THE ALL TIME BEST DIRECTOR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On sight, one may look at this film and think that it was a dismal attempt to better the Godfather (seeing that the Godfather was made a year earlier). However, there is alot more going on here than just a bunch of thugs causing trouble in new york. No, that is not Scorsese's style. There are REAL characters here. People who actually have deep rooted emotional issues that they do not know how to resolve. I will not give this films plot away, but i will tell you this. If you have a short attention span, need explosions, killings and action, avoid this film at all costs. If you can apreciate character development, perfect camera work and superior directing, watch this movie. This film has the potential to have you thinking for hours. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, if not great film; it's a bit too slow going at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so excited to see this film. I heard acres of praise for this film. Did it live up to my expectations? Yes and no. Mean Streets is certainly a worthwhile investment. Despite the fact that it looks to be in New York, it takes place in Los Angeles for many portions of the film. Scorsese did a splendid job of creating some New York Atmosphere. Harvey Keitel is the key as to why this kept my interest for the most part. The subtle nuances he would create throughout the film were a treat to watch, and not many people can do emotional scenes like Keitel can. He was fantastic as per usual. Robert DeNiro was very good as the shady, money bumming friend. His character was meant to be disparaging and that's exactly what it was, but I enjoyed the banter and the chemistry between him and Keitel. My only complaint is DeNiro's character disappears for lengthy stretches in the film. The poolhall scene is an absolute classic. There is nothing fancy about it, but the way it was shot and the intensity surrounding it; really makes it a memorable scene, and it's most definitely my favorite in the film. On the downside of things; The pacing lags a bit too often for my liking. Not to say my interest waned, but it was a bit draggy and it brings the film down a few notches. Scorsese would correct this flaw with one of the greatest films in the history of cinema; Goodfellas. Final Thoughts: This is a good but not a great film. It's too slow going to be the classic it was going for, but it does have many moments that are special. Despite that DeNiro disappears a bit too much for my liking; watching him and Keitel work together was a pleasure to watch. It's an interesting, if flawed film. Worth a look for sure7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely my favorite Scorsese film of all time. Hands Down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Goodfellas, The Departed and Taxi Driver--you know, those Scorsese classics everyone keeps talking about--I decided to take a look at any other films Scorsese made. And it turns out that behind those landmark classics he made, there are films that have been overlooked on purpose just because. And Mean Streets is included in that list. So, out of curiosity, I decided to watch Mean Streets, since I kept hearing and reading that it's a gem and the film influenced modern Hollywood and TV.When I first heard the narrator's words "You don't make up your sins in church; you do it in the streets, you do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it.", I knew I was going to a watch one hell of a movie! It's pretty much Catholicism meeting the Italian Mafia but to the sense that at times, it doesn't get into the Bible-Thumper preaching heavily-positive messaged mode seen in some Christian films but it certainly doesn't fall into the clichéd gangster movies of today just only seen as released straight to DVD. It's a realistic film of one man's internal struggle between his gangster duties and his pious Catholicism and how he must apply his beliefs to his daily lifestyle. As a Roman Catholic, I can relate to this story well and it seemed believable. That's why "Mean Streets" is my favorite Scorsese movie of all time.Scorsese really nailed it with Mean Streets! From Harvey Keitel's and Robert De Niro's classic-buddy love-hate relationship, to the dichotomous music between rock music and Italian Opera, to the symbolic lightning in numerous scenes, this is where a legend was born. You won't regret watching this movie.Oh sure, I don't mind Goodfellas, the Departed, Casino and Raging Bull; I just find Mean Streets indelible. The story in this movie is highly original and timeless.Finally, this movie just proves to the viewer that the world is not full of rainbows and is sin-free; it's full of mean streets.</fullReview>

From start to end, the cult-classic manages to arrest your attention &amp; leaves you in awe. The characters, the entire set-up, are so wonderfully executed, that it's truly hard to point out any flaw whatsoever. Scorsese's Direction &amp; Screenplay are epic, he has handled both the departments with flourish. Cinematography is perfect. Editing &amp; Art Design are worth a mention. Performance-Wise: Bobby De Niro is Terrific, As Always. The Screen Legend plays his part flawlessly, proving once again, that he is amongst the Greatest Actors of all-times. As the protagonist, Harvey Keitel is electrifying. This truly is his finest performance to date. Amy Robinson is top-notch. David Proval is impressive, while Richard Romanus does well. Others lend good support. On the whole, A Winner All The Way, that truly ranks amongst the finest films of it's time. Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mean Streets" follows up-in-coming mafioso Charlie (Harvey Keitel)and his friends - irreverent Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro), loan shark Tony (David Proval) and girlfriend Teresa (Amy Robinson). Despite the warnings of both his friends and uncle Giovani (Cesare Danova), Charlie refuses to ditch Johnny Boy, believing that he can help him with his mounting debt and self-destructive behavior. Tony, however, grows increasingly impatient with Johnny Boy's refusal to repay his loan which now totals to $3,000 (which today would be the equivalent of just over $21,000).Upon watching this film, it became obvious that every aspect of it was meant to highlight its exceptional cast. Camera cuts are rare and tracking shots are common; very little interrupts the actors who, in turn, are given room to... well... act. The dialog adds a richness and emotional depth to the characters that few other films are capable of matching.Also of note is the film's astounding cinematography. Scorsese creates an immense Kane-esque depth through skillful use of both deep-focus and tracking shots. Combined, these techniques gives the audience an incredibly extensive understanding of the setting (notably in the scenes where 1) a character who's doing drugs is dragged from a bathroom stall and thrown out the door and, 2) when Charlie walks through a crowded restaurant, greeting friends and acquaintances along the way). Dim, natural lighting and enclosed, oft-revisited sets gives this film an incredible sense of intimacy.Fans of mafia movies, gritty, realistic violence, Scorsese and (bleh!) Tarantino will find little to dislike in this jarring history of violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Streets is yet another brilliant film by Scorsese. The plot itself isn't that far off from what one has come to expect from Scorsese, yet I felt that this film felt more experimental, especially with some of the music, editing, and shots. The music choices are amazing.... some of the best music choices I have seen in any film. The editing like I mentioned is completely gripping. The cinematography is masterful and has a certain edgeness and roughness not seen in later Scorsese pics. Harvey Keitel (who coincidentally I just saw for the first time the day before in From Dusk Till Dawn) is pretty great. Like always though, DeNiro steals the show and again makes what is a string picture event stronger. Completely recommended, and surprised it isn't as popular as Taxi Driver and Goodfellas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above-average modern day noir film, not one of Scorsese's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Streets is the story of four young men growing up in New York's Little Italy. The film takes us through the life journey of these four men. The lives of these men, so close at the beginning of the film, diverge as they adapt to their environment. This film has many strengths, and few weaknesses. Primarily, the direction in this movie is wonderful. At the time rookie director Martin Scorsese shoots the film in the poor degraded districts of New York. Scorsese showed a dark, rejected New York City that he uses in many other of his famous works like Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York. This subject is shown through dark, ominous camera-work and degenerate, low-life characters. Scenes like the many scenes that take place in their bar show the dark, gloomy side to New York that the audience has never seen before. The red, dark lights help set the mood that will be reflected throughout most of the movie; a ominous, depressing tone. Also, the acting in this movie is phenomenal. Harvey Keitel plays Charlie, a promising young entrepreneur with hopes of making a name for himself. Charlie is caught in the dilemma of choosing between helping an old friend (Johnny Boy), stealing away the girl of his dreams from her unruly uncle (Teresa), or looking ahead towards the future and taking ownership of a restaurant given to him by hid uncle Giovanni. Keitel plays this role perfectly, showing the overall aplomb of a "wise guy", while still getting involved in the true romance scenes with Theresa. This role was pivotal in launching Keitel's career, and it greatly helped him gain recognition to star in the wide array of films he participated in. Also, Robert De Niro plays Johnny Boy, the hotheaded street thug with a love for money, sex, and drugs. Johnny Boy spends what little money e collects paying off debtors for the many mistakes he has made in the past. He turn the work of turning his life around over to Charlie, who grudgingly accepts this responsibility. De Niro's acing in this movie rival his great performances in movies such as Goodfellas, Casino, and Taxi Driver. He plays the character of Johnny Boy to perfection, giving an account of the life of a degenerate failed gangster. De Niro plays a bum, a role that he would almost never replicate in the future of his acting career. Although there are many good things about Mean Streets, there are also some bad things. For one, from start to finish the story doesn't seem to go anywhere. The characters of Charlie and Johnny Boy develop somewhat throughout the movie, but at the end of the movie there is a feeling that they are at the same point they started. Also, the main gang of characters (Johnny Boy, Charlie, Tony, and Michael) seem somewhat pathetic compared to the hardcore gangsters in most De Niro movies. I realize that the point of the movie is to show the low- lives of New York City and the everyday struggles they face, but the fight in the pool hall is pathetic. Overall, this movie is above-average, but is certainly not another one of Scorsese's masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's first masterpiece: a unique and unsettling vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mean Streets" was a little low-budget 1973 movie directed by some guy named Martin Scorsese and starring the little up-and-coming actor Robert de Niro. Though it's often overshadowed by his later works (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas), "Mean Streets" was really Scorsese's first masterpiece and truly deserves credit of its own.As to being forgotten, one thing that the movie has going against it is the fact that it doesn't have much of a discernible plot: Johnny Boy owes some money and is being chased by loan sharks, and his friend Charlie is trying to protect him. That's about it. Both are haunted and driven by the vicious streets of Little Italy and must cope with the sins that surviving in a place like that demand. However, rather than showing us a progression towards a certain path, Scorsese pinpoints each of the characters as they are - just living life and doing what they must to get by. It is told as a series of vignettes (similar to Fellini's "Amarcord," also made the same year), not necessarily building on one another, but digging deeper into the characters, revealing the ambitions and limits of both Johnny Boy and Charlie.A major theme of the movie is the contrast between the immoral successful life of the mob and the pious life of the Church - a duality that plagues Charlie. Scorsese colors this contrast with claustrophobic shots of Manhattan, filling even the darkest alleys with Catholic imagery. These images perhaps express the director's own feelings of the futility of living in Little Italy, a feeling that manifests in Charlie, and drives Johnny Boy just short of insane. It's a portrayal of an impossible lifestyle, and represented with dialogue and demeanor that is now iconic to Scorsese productions: this movie pretty much defined the cinematic portrayal of Italian-Americans.Finally, there is Scorsese's directing itself, whose technical skill is more than anyone could ask for from a novice director. His blend of follow-shots, short shots, tracking shots, and slow-motion shots (and whatever else you can think of) give an immersion that wouldn't otherwise be possible with the uninvolving plot. Of course, being a low-budget movie from the 1970s, it has it's technical problems (bad dubbing especially), but Scorsese unique camera-work and eye for detail overcome those limitations. Luckily, the success of this movie skyrocketed this nobody director to worldwide acclaim, and now 40 years later, Scorsese is considered one of the greatest American filmmakers of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pay attention if you want to be an Independent Film Maker. Mean Streets is true to movie making and the art of storytelling. For starters, the story is universal, the cast of characters the same. The Direction is not only perfect, but it tells the story. Many directors have no idea how to tell an audience the story by use of the camera. Here, we see true grit displayed before the camera because of the quality of the direction and the genius of the actors. Mean Streets has been copied by a handful of wanna be filmmakers. None of successfully made a better film or have come close to remastering it. Mean Streets is a movie far beyond and multi million dollar epic can top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although he'd already made two films prior to Mean Streets, it isn't entirely wrong to say this is where Martin Scorsese's career truly began. Fascinating as it may be, Who's That Knocking on My Door? is a flawed student film, while Boxcar Bertha, made as a favor to Roger Corman, is a guilty pleasure flick with little proper artistic value, hence the famous comment by John Cassavetes that Marty make a more personal film. That became Mean Streets, the first of his many masterpieces.Set in the Little Italy area where the director grew up, the movie follows the troubled life of Charlie (Who's That Knocking star Harvey Keitel), as he tries to reconcile his Catholic beliefs and his hoodlum activity, collecting protection money for his uncle. While his friends are confident in regards to the future, Charlie has to deal with his secret relationship with Teresa (Amy Robinson), a girl whose epilepsy causes him to keep her hidden, and the violent attitude of his cousin Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro), an impulsive young man with a penchant for big trouble.Mean Streets isn't just a personal movie, it's almost autobiographical. The opening voice-over, which is supposed to represent Charlie's thoughts, is actually spoken by Scorsese himself, who says: "You don't make up for yous sins in church. You do it on the street. You do it at home. The rest is bullsh*t and you know it.". Given Marty's frequent recollections of how kids like him could choose between becoming priests or gangsters and he came close to choosing the clergy over the movies, it's obvious he knows what he's talking about as he walks on the streets of Little Italy capturing the raw energy and ugly, brutal violence that come with the characters' lifestyle (case in point: a brief appearance by Boxcar Bertha man David Carradine).The physical nastiness is matched by harsh, realistic dialogue and believable performances: Keitel and Robinson provide the emotional center, whereas De Niro, whose manic turn never gets over the top, embodies the full-blown insanity that stems from a life of crime. Charming yet threatening, he gives the title Mean Streets its full significance and excels in the first of eight collaborations with Scorsese.Stylish yet very real, Mean Streets is pure, undiluted Scorsese: violence, great acting, a gritty environment and a terrific soundtrack (check out De Niro's entrance). After two not entirely successful first steps into the world of film-making, this third attempt clearly shows America has been graced with a new, brilliant vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Streets (1973) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Martin Scorsese made his name with this raw, hard hitting look at the lower side of Little Italy. Charlie (Harvey Keitel), an up and coming hood is having to keep a constant eye on his friend Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro), a dimwit who owes money all over town and usually has his mouth getting him in trouble. While I don't considering this the masterpiece that a lot of people do, there's no doubt this is a highly impressive film that has some great performances, wonderful direction and a certain rawness that not too many films reach. The biggest problem I have with the film is that it goes on way too long and I feel there were plenty of scenes that could have been edited out and it wouldn't have cost the movie anything. The second half of the film is rather slow as we wait for what we know is going to happen but the ending packs on hell of a punch. The movie pretty much centers on Keitel's character and you can't help but see similarities to the one he played in Who's That Knocking at My Door. The two have questions about their place in life and the true meaning of religion but this here is something that would be asked in many of the director's future films. Keitel delivers another extremely strong performance and you can't help but believe everything his character does and says. Keitel was excellent at playing thinking characters meaning every time you look at him you can actually see him thinking and this is something not too many actors can do. As great as he is there's no doubt that the film belongs to DeNiro who really makes a terrific splash here. It's not just how much life he brings to the character but there are small scenes that some might overlook. One deals with the walk DeNiro uses as he's moving away from a mailbox that he's about to blow up. Next time you view the film just look at the walk DeNiro is doing. Another smaller sequence that gets overlooked is the incredible and crazy laugh DeNiro has during one scene involving a story about a priest. Amy Robinson also stands out in her supporting role as does David Provel and Richard Romanus. There have been countless films to deal with gangsters or low level hoods but not too many are as raw as this film. Scorsese has talked about being close to these types and it's easy to see here because of how personal the movie seems. With the incredible soundtrack, with several songs from The Rolling Stones, this is certainly an unforgettable, if flawed, movie. The fight in the pool hall is certainly the greatest scene in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mean Streets" is the film that put Martin Scorsese on the map and established him as a serious talent to watch.In many ways, Scorsese has simply been remaking the same story ever since this one, but I think that "Mean Streets" (along with much of his 1970s work) has a much grittier and authentic quality to it than the movies he's been making in the last couple of decades. "GoodFellas" and "The Departed" are certainly expert movies, and they're wildly enjoyable, but you can tell that Scorsese's primary motivation in these films was to entertain, while in his 1970s movies he was passionately driven to tell particular stories.Featuring soon-to-become Scorsese regulars Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel, both delivering top-notch performances.Grade: A</fullReview>

Having seen Scorcese's later films, I know that i'm in familiar territory. A gang of thugs get into heap loads of trouble and brawl and swear their way through the film. Martin Scorcese has picked some brilliant music for the film and the arguments are mainly all between the four friends. The main plot is somewhere along the lines of this; a smelly geezer shoots a drunk guy landing all the stars in deep trouble. So what do they do about it? They sit around, start rows and empty people's dustbins on the street. A terrific film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Charlie (Harvey Keitel) is a small time hood who collects debts for his uncle and has troubles addressing his Catholic guilt.He is a nice,reasonable character trying to survive in a sea of far meaner players.Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) is a borderline psychotic with serious responsibility issues who owes and keeps dodging a debt to Michael (Richard Romanus) a doddering and not awfully bright similar small time hood.Martin Scorsese's debut feature follows the lives and fortunes of these character's,as well as bewildered bar owner Tony (David Proval) who usually gets in at the centre of it all where these jokers are concerned,as everything builds up to end in tragedy.The story goes that this was not Scorsese's original choice for his debut feature,which was a project by the name of Boxcar Bertha,until legendary director David Cassevetes told him it was 'crap' and that he should go out and 'make something that comes from your heart.'And he seems to have taken this advice to heart,as there are numerous elements to this story that seem to have come,indeed,from the heart of this now legendary in his own right director.From the Little Italy setting of his own youth right through to one of his central character's dilemma's with his Catholic guilt (mirroring Scorsese's interest in religion and becoming a priest earlier in life),Mean Streets is obviously a project he could identify with immensely on a personal level and so make that glowering level of authenticity ever more prominent.This was Scorsese's debut feature,and you just get the impression from watching it that it couldn't have been made as good if he'd made it at any other stage of his career than right at the very beginning of it.Back when of course he'd only have had the most limited of budgets and the most unknown of actors (who this feature made a name of) this probably wouldn't have fared very well in mainstream cinema but as an art-house piece of work everything about it shines magnificently.The grainy lighting and heavy internally pitched dubbing allow you to absorb the true heart and soul of the movie without being distracted by anything else.It has no sound-track of it's own,but the 60s/70s melodies that play to it throughout really give the film an added sense of depth and atmosphere.Speaking of which,the story really reels you in.You see how these characters relate to each other on a personal level and no other gangster film gets you as involved and ingratiated with the characters as this one does.The movie's not without it's sour points.Lead stars De Niro and Keitel over-do it and lay it on a bit too thickly sometimes (De Niro especially!) but they were young and maturing actors at the time,and their eagerness really served them well in later years.Sometimes it's a bit hard to believe these guys really are actually criminals (as another reviewer noted,none of them carry guns!) and the supporting characters are pushed to the back of the proceedings a bit too much so they lose depth and relevance to the plot.So it's a mix of good and bad points,but it's certain that this is the film that launched a young and maturing director and two young and maturing actors to their present positions and,if nothing else,it should be intriguing viewing just to see what really got the ball rolling.****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bit of a landmark film as it was it was the first time director Martin Scorsese casted Robert De Niro, a collaboration that has continued in numerous films. It was also the second time he casted Harvey Keitel. Anyway, basically, set in the "mean streets" of New York City, the story follows small-time wise-guy community member Charlie (Keitel), with friends Tony (David Proval) and Michael (Richard Romanus), and most prominently, unreliable, near psychotic and to-be shunned friend Johnny Boy (De Niro). He also has a secret girlfriend, Teresa (Amy Robinson), Johnny Boy's cousin, who must also be shunned because of epilepsy. Charlie's uncle Giovanni (Cesare Danova) offers him a restaurant, and he is forced to choose between gaining power, love for Teresa, or protecting Johnny Boy. Also starring Victor Argo as Mario, Robert Carradine as Assassin, Jeannie Bell as Diane and David Carradine as Drunk, with narration by Scorsese himself. I will admit I did not pay full attention to this film, because it was a bit too chatty for my liking, but when it wasn't, it had great moments of violence, so it is worth watching. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie was better than the Godfather</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best mob movie ever made. The Godfather had a beautiful plot and beautiful cinematography. However, it was "Hollywoodized". It seemed more fantasia than reality. That's why "Mean Streets" was better. Mean Streets is about "regular guys". Really the only distraction to the movie was Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro). He was the out-of-control character. Everybody else was a "regular guy". They interacted with people. They got along for the most part. But there was always Johnny Boy. Johnny Boy was spoiled. He expected that he could borrow and borrow from the mob and never pay it back. De Niro was about 30 at the the time, but he was portraying someone in his late teens. De Niro perfectly captured the essence of a naive teen, who thinks that he is immortal. Keitel was brilliant as Charlie. He was always being polite and responsible. He was always looking out for his cousin, Johnny Boy, because that's what Italians still did. But, this was Manhattan - a "melting pot". The World was changing. There were hippies, drifters, junkies, gamblers, and all walks of life. I liked this aspect of the movie - you knew it was Manhattan. You could never tell how exactly was mafia, who was just an associate, and who was not Italian. Everybody was interacting with one another in a complex way. This is the best mob movie ever made. The great thing about it was that it wasn't really violent, like Good Fellas. Most of it was slow-paced. It was like watching a John Cassavettes film. The camera was rolling. It is only a the very end that there is violence. That makes the violence, for once in a film, more meaningful. In conclusion, there was a scene where I believe the actor was James Cromwell. At a mafia-owned bar, Cromwell plays a Vietnam Vet. He may not have even been Catholic. He was a vet. All of a sudden, you see that the mob was not just Italian, but also part of America. It was a brilliant scene. It was even more brilliant, because Cromwell's vet character was drunk and viciously attacked a woman. The movie showed that it wasn't just the mafia that could be dangerous. Joe patriotic soldier could also be dangerous when drunk. Ditto with the scene with John Carradine playing a drifter. You actually felt most sorry for Johnny Boy, because he was "mental". Everybody labeled him as a troublemaker from an early age. You knew that Johnny Boy was also the runt, and that he was looked down upon by society. He acted the way he did, because he was labeled as irresponsible. You can see that Scorsese is a deeply philosophical and intellectual individual. This movie should be shown to every "sociology class". It really gives a deep portrait life in Manhattan during the early 70s. It isn't pretty on the surface, but there are so many complex relations going on within the movie - whether mob or non-mob. All types of people are interacting in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's breakthrough - for Keitel and De Niro too (re-review 2007)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What hasn't been written about this film yet, as it's the breakthrough film (at least as history recalls) for Scorsese, Keitel and De Niro? Or how many would-be male actors haven't tried to completely an utterly emulate the two quintessential New York method actors/stars of the film? Here it remains though decades later, and if it were released today it would still be fresh, innovative, thought provoking, absorbing as moral fable and spot-on hilarious in its views on twenty-somethings in Little Italy. Luckily, Scorsese came first with this film, and it's one of the most influential post-modern films of the 70s.If there is anything else to report on, let it be known that it is very worthwhile to see it on the big-screen, with the visceral impact just the same as if seeing the Departed, if not more so for certain film-geeks. Such as: There's the pair of Scorsese's greatest scenes, when we first see Charlie and Johnny Boy meet at the bar (slow-motion tracking shots of Charlie as Jumpin Jack Flash pop on and Johnny walking with the two girls, still staggering in its awesomeness), and then when Charlie pushes Johnny to the back and there's a quasi Abbott &amp; Costello routine in figuring out what happened with the last payment due. Then there's the shot when Charlie is drunk off his ass, and the camera is strapped on to him in close-up (maybe one of the first, if not the first, ever done like that).And even more effective than on the small screen is the editing, which is the usual when seeing Scorsese in a theater, where sometimes it's just submliminal and strange, i.e. the jump cut when Charlie and Teresa are in the bedroom and Charlie does a hand movement of a gun with the sound of a bang following right then. And who doesn't want to whistle that San Genero festival music when getting out the theater? It also features one of the coolest bit parts of all time from David Carradine as a hammered sacrificial lamb at the bar.</fullReview>
