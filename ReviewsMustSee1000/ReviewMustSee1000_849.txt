		<shortDescription>Michael Caine - Intense, Brooding, Sympathetic, Questioning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why the studio satraps thought it necessary to embargo this film after 9/11, requiring persuasion on Michael Caine's part to get it to limited release now so as to qualify for Oscar nominations. The American role in Viet Nam is the subject of hundreds of books and countless articles - and not a few films. There is nothing unhealthy about the continuing debate and contrary to what some opine, I doubt American policy vis-a-vis Iraq has much lineal connection to the troubled saga of U.S. involvement in Indo-China, or its partial successor in hapless interest, the Republic of Viet Nam.The Graham Green story has been filmed before (1958) but this is a pungent, attention-grabbing version, filmed in various parts of Viet Nam. The sultry and grasping humidity of the land almost comes off the screen. The story takes place in 1952 as the inept and poorly led French stumble towards their ultimate debacle at Dien Bien Phu (anyone interested in this story should start and finish with Bernard Fall's remarkable account of the French Army's Super-Alamo).Caine, a Brit named Fowler, assures Brendan Fraser, a putative U.S. humanitarian officer named Pyle, that he is a "reporter," not a "correspondent." The difference to the easy-living Fowler is that the latter has a viewpoint, perhaps even a cause, while the former, as Sergeant Friday would say, only wants the facts.This film really belongs to Caine and Fraser but one other character, the stunning Do Thi Hai Yep, Fowler's live-in girlfriend, deserves mention. She lights up the screen with both her calculating passion for, first, Fowler and then Pyle. Her character is realistically complex: I knew a number of such women when I was an Army officer and although the phrase isn't used here, she's a perfect example of the desperately ambitious, beautiful mistress whose only long-term goal is to be taken to "The Land of the Big P.X."A series of experiences transform both Fowler and Pyle. Several of the scenes of violence are real enough but the music is intrusive. You don't hear music when people are dying around you. At least not performed by an orchestra.This is the third recent film in which Michael Caine distinguishes himself by the depth of his acting (the others being "The Cider House Rules" and "Last Orders"). Caine's Fowler leaves us wondering as to what his motives are as he slowly changes before us. There's no clear answer and room for argument. His Fowler is both disturbing and ingratiating.The audience in the East Village theater where I saw "The Quiet American" today clearly was made up of folks whose minds were settled as to U.S. involvement in Indo-China, never mind the later escalation in Viet Nam. Their grunts and laughs at certain points reflected their views. But the story told here is a faithful mirror of what in 1952 were complex questions in a scary world made scary by communism, not the liberal democracies. That mistakes of a grievous nature were made may be clear today but the road was ill-illuminated then. This film, and Caine's portrayal in particular, reflects the contemporary confusion and the unravelling of any hopes for a peaceful reunification of the two Viet Nams after the French defeat.I hope this film gets a very wide distribution after it finishes its two-week Oscar-qualifying run.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phillip Noyce achieves a remarkable triumph in his version of The Quiet American by staying true the Graham Greene's text. Christopher Hampton's adaptation of the book never strays away from the basic premise of the story. This film in someone else's hands would have probably evolved into a war epic. Noyce and Hampton stay focused on the two main characters, who, after all, are the key to the story.It's hard to think Thomas Fowler was not tailor made for Michael Caine. He was born to play this part. His characterization of this troubled soul is remarkable. Mr. Caine gets the essence of Fowler without any effort, or so it seems. He is a jaded man who understands the Viet Nam before the American involvement. He knows he can't go home again to a loveless marriage, one in which he will not be able to escape after having experienced things he never would have thought possible in starchy old London. Brendan Fraser is an actor with a lot of experience in the theater, even though his choices in films leave a lot to be desired. As he proved with Gods and Monsters, he can hold his own against a great British actor such as Ian McKellen, or on an equal footing with Michael Caine in this film. His take on Alden Pyle is as vicious, devious and sly as Graham Greene made him out to be. Mr. Fraser gets under the skin of Pyle with such flair in the creation of this enigmatic man. The rest of the cast is not up to the two principals, but it's the confrontation between Fowler and Pyle what really makes this a tremendous acting feast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Triangle of Love in the Beginning of the American Intervention in Vietnam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Saigon, 1951, Thomas Fowler (Michael Fowler) is an English journalist, married in England with a catholic woman, and in love with a Vietnamese girl, Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). Thomas meets Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) in a bar. Pyle is a doctor working in an aid mission, and pretty soon, he falls in love with Phuong. Pyle offers her what Thomas is not possible to give, i.e., a marriage and escape of Vietnam. Meanwhile, the political situation in Vietnam is boiling, with the French trying to get control again of the country, the communists trying to impose their system to the South, and the American secretly giving support to a third Vietnamese part. This romance is perfect: the outstanding performance of Michael Caine in the first plane, and Brendan Fraser (in his best role, since 'Gods and Monsters') and Do Thi Hai Yen are fantastic. The screenplay of Christopher Hampton, based in a novel of Graham Greene, is wonderful. And the direction of Phillip Noyce is magnificent, presenting the story in right doses of romance, drama, action and special effects. An overwhelming movie for all tastes. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Americano Quieto" ("The Quiet American")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine gives yet another outstanding performance in `The Quiet American,' Philip Noyce's 2002 adaptation of the Graham Greene Cold War novel (the first movie version was released in 1958). Set in 1952 Saigon, the film features Caine as Thomas Fowler, a world-weary British journalist who's been sent to Vietnam to cover the attempt by colonial French forces to hold back the communist insurgence from the North. But Fowler has a problem. Despite the fact that he is a reporter, he freely admits that this country exerts a sort of magical hold on him and that, in order to maintain that image, he must will himself to look beyond the ugliness and strife that are tearing the country apart. In fact, reporting is the last thing on Fowler's mind. He is even madly in love with a beautiful young Vietnamese girl who lives with him. When his publishers back in England threaten to call him back, Fowler realizes that he must become more actively engaged in the events around him if he hopes to be allowed to stay.One day he meets Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), an American eye specialist who falls in love with Fowler's girl. Even though they are drawn together by much that they have in common, Fowler and Pyle soon become rivals for the woman, though by the end, their conflict has broadened to include the issues of war vs. peace, truth vs. deception, and personal feelings vs. political expediency. `The Quiet American' is typical Greene in that it provides an intense personal drama played against the backdrop of geopolitical turmoil in an exotic setting. Both Caine and Fraser bring a quiet intensity to their scenes together. Caine, in particular, is brilliant at conveying the many moods of a man who wants to be left alone to live a simple life with the woman he loves but who knows that circumstances are conspiring to make such a life impossible. He is heartbreaking as he sees that ideal existence suddenly slipping away, with little he can do to stop it from happening. He also begins to see just how difficult it is to remain emotionally detached from the horrors happening around him once the atrocities begin to encroach on his world directly. Fowler also has to decide whether his final action is truly rooted in a humanitarian impulse or the product of wanting to eliminate a pesky rival from the field of competition.In addition to telling a fairly solid story, `The Quiet American' also provides a glimpse into the history of its region, particularly showing how the Americans ended up usurping the role of the French in that far off, alien country in the late ?50's and early ?60's. This is reflected in a wonderful coda that chronicles the steps leading up to this slow handoff of power and responsibility.But for all the film's various virtues, it is Caine's performance that is the real reason to catch `The Quiet American.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine Superb in Vietnamese Drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE QUIET AMERICAN, Phillip Noyce's adaptation of the Graham Greene novel, is among that small subgenre of films (THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY, UNDER FIRE, SALVADOR) where journalists, writing in war-torn countries, discover conspiracies that undermine everything they've come to accept as true. These films are inevitably controversial, as they deal with actual places and historical events, and they demand an open mind, as they often portray governments in a less-than-flattering light. While the revelations of the stories aren't always entirely true, each film of this group are well-crafted, and certainly thought-provoking.The film is told as a flashback, as the corpse of murdered American Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) is found, floating in the Mekong, in 1952. During the French police investigation, the story unfolds...Thomas Fowler (Oscar-nominated Michael Caine) is a veteran British journalist ("I prefer reporter," he jokes), writing in Saigon as the French fought the Communists in Indochina. Jaded and complacent, he only sporadically submits an article, devoting his time to a mildly hedonistic lifestyle, and his beloved mistress, beautiful young Phuong (portrayed by the stunning, if not overly talented Vietnamese actress, Do Thi Hai Yen). When young Pyle arrives, purportedly joining the American mission to treat eye disease among the Vietnamese, the older man is immediately impressed by his quiet, respectful, almost naive innocence. Introducing the American to Phuong, Pyle is immediately attracted to her, and, upon discovering Fowler already has a wife, in England, he begins wooing the girl, much to the chagrin of the reporter.As his paper is threatening to return Fowler to England, taking him away from Phuong, he announces he is involved in a major story in the north, and leaves to investigate reports of Communist activities. What he finds is a massacre, with responsibility denied by both sides. Joined by Pyle ("I didn't want to propose to Phuong behind your back"), the pair barely make it back alive. Although the 'official' story blames the Communists for the deaths, Fowler doesn't believe it, and begins investigating in earnest.A new military leader emerges, General Thé, opposed to both the French and the Communists, and Caine suspects his forces as the true perpetrators of the massacre. Visiting the elusive general's headquarters, he finds Pyle running a clinic, and the General apoplectic when he asks who is providing the arms and funds for his army. Again, with Pyle's assistance, he barely escapes with his life...and a growing suspicion that the United States is taking a less than neutral role in the intrigue...While the film's climax will come as a surprise to no one, and the 'love triangle' lacks much spark (other than from Caine, who is totally believable when he confesses that without Phuong he would "start to die"), the film is engrossing, throughout. Brendan Fraser, as the enigmatic title character, does a very credible job in a complex role, after a somewhat shaky first meeting with Caine. The lack of chemistry between him and Hai Yen could easily be explained away as a natural reticence from her character towards any man saying "I love you", in a society where sexual favors are easily purchased. She seems far more comfortable and believable in her scenes with Caine, despite their major age difference.Ultimately, the film is a triumph for Michael Caine, who again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation. As a man who goes from indifferent complacency to active participant by the film's climax, he is never less than superb. This is certainly one of the better films of 2002!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film more than I thought I would. Michael Caine (nominated for an Oscar for this role) plays a British journalist in Vietnam, durring the period before the French pulled out. The film follows his investigation of some atrosities his discovers, but treats that as a "B" story to the story of his relationship with a young vietnamese girl and his friendship with a mysterious American played by Brenden Fraser, who likes the same girl. Fraser is actualy quite good in this film, shedding his trademark goofieness from his more mainstream efforts. And Caine definitely captures your interest with his performance. The film kinda moves along slowly but it strangely held my attention and it does suck you in, especialy as they throw in some unexpected plot twists towards the end. GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good movie, close to the book. Recommended for everyone, especially for the ones who have read the book. Very very pictorial and beautiful, creates the atmosphere and impressions you'd have if you read the original story. The cast is wonderful; the actors' play is excellent. Besides, actor playing Fowler is from London, actor playing Pyle is American, so they look close to what the author of the book wanted them to be. Pyle, however, could be less bully-looking, in my opinion; I imagined him to be somewhat lighter, but I quickly forgot about it as the movie went on. The movie is built on contrasts: the contrasts between main characters, the contrasts of Vietnam, even the contrast in accents (I counted at least 5 different accents: British,American,french,strong/weak Chinese). Also, the movie is rather brief and is therefore quite dynamic, the time is not wasted in it. That's why it's only 3/2 hours long. This is the kind of movie that will not make you wait until it's finished. I highly recommend this movie for everyone with a taste for good movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but fascinating and well made none the less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1952. Siagon. English journalist Thomas Fowler lives a quiet life with his young mistress, Phuong and no intention to return to London. When the Times request he return he starts looking for stories to ensure he can stay. At the same time an idealistic young American arrives as part of a medical aid programme in the middle of the war between the French and the Communist forces in the North fighting for independence. The American, Pyle falls for Phuong and the two men discuss what can be done. However in any conflict it is impossible to stay neutral for long.As the film rather bluntly says, the plot here is the same story told twice. That of the Americans trying to protect a beautiful country/girl from an unpleasant future (unmarried or communism) even if it means taking her away from her older European master (France or Fowler). The two plots work well even if they have flaws. The tale of the two lovers is less well handed than the critical political stuff but is still good and slightly moving. The political comment is less sharp now than I imagine it was when Greene made it all those years ago, but it will still have impact as America's foreign policy prepares to take it into another conflict overseas in order to remove/keep out forces it feels are harmful to America.I assume that this is what Noyce wanted and he does it well. The alignment with the central love is not that well done, and this is shown by the fact that Pyle is given those lines to speak so clearly in case anyone missed it. The love story didn't work as well as it should partly because I needed more information ? for example Phuong's motives were never fully clear and her character was weakly developed throughout. However it didn't take too much away from the film as a total and I still enjoyed it very much.One of the main reasons was the direction. I have recently seen Noyce's Rabbit Proof Fence and he worked well there. Again here he directs well with the bigger landscape shots but also does well with more intimate or action shots. He also brings an excellent performance out of Caine. He should really get an Oscar for this but I suspect he won't as he got one a few years ago. Jaws The Revenge seems a very long time ago after seeing this film ? Caine is perfectly understated and you can see the emotion build rather than just appear. Fraser is also very good even if his character has to be damaged by having him explain things. Hai Yen is not as good. She is pretty and a nice gentle voice but I wanted her to have a better character ? with more she could have done more.Overall this film may get bad reviews in the US due to it's clear criticism of past American policy but it doesn't deserve it. The love story element of it may have it's flaws but the film works pretty well overall and the political drama side is strong enough to hold it together. The main problem for me was actually believing that an American could ever exist that is as polite and well spoken as Fraser portrays Pyle to be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made But Too Complex To Be Entirely Cinematic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story starts with the body of American Adrien Pyle , a medical specialist , being found in a river in Saigon . He has been stabbed to death and London Times journalist Thomas Fowler recounts to the authorities how he knew the man TQE is a very strange film to comment on simply because I get the feeling that it is based on a very complex political novel by Graham Greene and it's interesting to note how many people on this page have commentated on how well or how badly it has been adapted to screen . It's also interesting to note that it was filmed in the spring of 2001 when George Bush's " war on terrorism " had not happened which clouds the issue more . People on the message boards have written many political threads to tie in with this but it's very interesting that Greene's original novel was written several years before Lyndon B Johnson sent combat troops to South East Asia , so Greene is criticisng American foreign policy in general and an intelligent , cogent way , not so much jumping on the fashionable bandwagon with Michael Moore , John Pilger and George Monbiot so I guess for that he deserves some credit As a film what makes it so successful is with the casting . Michael Caine as we all know is a living legend and the fact that he has appeared in so many awful movies simply for the money while still retaining prestigious star quality speaks volumes for his talent and as you might expect in this type of role he's superb . What is even more amazing than Caine's performance is that of Brendan Fraser's as Adrien Pyle . I've just remembered how good he was in GODS AND MONSTERS and he's equally as good here as a man who's not what he seems to be . One can't help thinking how well he'd be regarded as an actor if he'd decided to skip THE MUMMY films which unfortunately seems to have prematurely killed his career . Certainly I wasn't reminded of Rick O'Connel while watching this Where the film falters is - Again - where it shows its literary roots . There's no way you can confuse a Graham Greene novel with a Harold Robbins one , but there's maybe too much of a romantic subplot which gets in the way of the real story and you find your self questioning as to what the main story . Is it the political one or the love triangle ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caine, Fraser Excel In This 'Sleeper'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well-acted beautifully-filmed movie that surprised me in good it was. It's one of those "sleepers," meaning a good movie that gets little notice.I found it interesting from the get-go with Michael Caine doing a superb job, one of the highlights of his distinguished career. Some have even called it his best performance. The same might be said of Brendan Fraser, too, someone who is more known for his lower-brow characters in far less-intelligent films. Those two and Do Thi Hai Yen complete the threesome who excel in the leads. The fact this film takes place in Vietnam and she is Vietnamese makes her all the more believable.The colors in this film are very pretty, interiors and exteriors. The only negative I had was the obvious political bias in here: Left Wing, of course,(are there any Right Wing-slanted films?) off the novel from the very Liberal Graham Greene. The movie paints an unflattering picture of the early days of America's involvement in Vietnam with Fraser playing "The Ugly American."Politics-aside, at least half the film is really a love story, as both male leads go after the same woman (Hai Yen). That has a strange ending, is all I will say. All the way through the movie builds in suspense and intrigue in both the politics and the romance. I've seen it twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. It's a well-made movie and one that could be enjoyed many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE QUIET American - Philip Noyce[FULL REVIEW - likely plot spoilers]'The Quiet American' is one of those rare films that, in a mostly unobtrusive way, actually makes you think about the morality of its characters and what they stand for.Based on a Graham Greene novel, the story set in 50's Vietnam homes in on the testy relationship between a Saigon-based London Times reporter Fowler (Michael Caine), and the newly-arrived 'Quiet American' Pyle (Brendan Fraser). Fowler's an unlikely protagonist - middle-aged and desperately trying to stay back in Vietnam with his opium pipe and his young mistress Phuong, he does his job with jaded resignation ("I'm just a reporter. I offer no point of view, I take no action, I don't get involved."). In comes Pyle, fresh-faced, friendly and eager to play the kindly Yankee medical corps Samaritan. The two strike up a casual friendship but that soon runs into dark waters when Pyle falls in love with Phuong. He initially backs off in chivalry but returns on learning that Fowler will not actually marry Phuong since he can't get a divorce from his wife in London. Phuong's own wishes in this regard are ambiguous and seem more related to her own security than love for either of them. This tangle of emotions is played out against the backdrop of a strife-ridden Vietnam being similarly drawn between the French and the Vietcong. Fowler in a bid to keep his Saigon post goes into more dangerous territory, trying to dig up the dirt on a third faction in the battle. But he, like the audience, gets more than he bargained for in a devious turn of events that culminates in startling carnage.The story raises pertinent questions about the motives of America in Vietnam and the events that led to the invasion of Vietnam - It was shelved from its intended 2001 release in the wake of 9/11. But it's also a gripping noir drama that gives you fleshed out characters instead of stereotypes. There are no obvious heroes or villains, and the greatest strength of the film is its sustained sense of ambiguity, right up to the brilliant end, which leaves you wondering about who the bad guys really are.Kudos to Noyce and Michael Caine for setting a new standard in anti-heroes with their gritty, uncompromising portrayal of Fowler. Brendan Fraser, shorn of his trademark goofy mannerisms, does a surprisingly good understated turn as Pyle. The period atmosphere and Christopher Doyle's stylish cinematography easily capture the turmoil of the characters and the setting. If anything I'd have liked the film to be longer, with greater exploration of the very interesting characters it deals with: Pyle in particular seems to have got a bit of the short shrift in the latter half of the film, and a deeper look at Phuong wouldn't have hurt either. But as it is, it's still an excellent emotional thriller, which in most part respects the intelligence of its audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have long told people who wanted to understand the Vietnam War to read Graham Greene's book. I was surprised by the synopsis calling this a book about a love triangle. At the risk of obscuring the power of this movie, I have to say it is a book about the futility of colonialism illustrated by a love triangle.As we try to do a better job of leaving Iraq than we did of Vietnam (and certainly a better job of leaving than of entering), this movie can remind us of the hell created by good intentions.On a different level - see this movie for the spine tingling scene of Caine and a sentry spending the night in a lookout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vietnam in the early 1950's was torn apart by civil war as the French, in a vain attempt to hold onto one of their most important colonial holdings, battled against a Communist independence movement. British reporter Thomas Folwer (Michael Caine) is a dedicated, if not detached, observer of events. However, despite a major war tearing apart the country around him, Thomas spends most of his attention on his young mistress Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). His life is one of simplicity and routine that even war doesn't seem able to change.However, that does change when a young and idealistic American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) arrives in Vietnam with the American aid mission. A man who is passionate about helping what he sees as a troubled country threatened by the evils of Communism, Alden finds himself suddenly obsessed with the young Phuong. Thomas, at first finding Alden at first rather amusing, is soon annoyed and troubled at the idea of having the American stealing away the woman he loves.There are several other issues that quickly begin to overwhelm Thomas and his otherwise comfortable life. His home office in London is demanding his return while his wife, the woman he is really married to, is refusing to give him a divorce so that he could marry Phuong. To answer the first problem he devises a plan to sneak into the actual war zone itself to discover a story that would allow him to stay in Vietnam longer. To deal with the second problem will take more thinking and consideration.The Quiet American, at first a slow movie despite the fact that Alden's eventual death is made clear in the beginning, soon becomes one of intrigue and political mystery. Thomas begins to suspect that there is more to Alden and his story of wanting to help the Vietnamese. A recent move by Vietnamese General Thé (Quang Hai) to gain political and military power has Thomas convinced that there is something else going on and his suspicion falls again on Alden.The only way to answer the question of who Alden really is, and where the moral ambiguity of the story and its characters begins, comes in the form of a terrorist attack which kills dozens of innocent civilians. Alden, instead of a simple and caring American out to help Vietnam, is in fact a CIA operative who is funding Thé who himself is responsible for the bombing. As with any crusader out to save the world, Alden believes that breaking a few of the proverbial eggs is acceptable if it will bring the greater good. Thomas, who claimed that he never got involved with the stories around him, now finds himself facing the question of not if but how he will become involved in order to stop the madness around him.A political and historical story of two men in the middle of a very confusing moral situation, The Quiet American is very much a reflection of today's current political and international crisis. However, it is also the story of about two friends who find themselves not only divided by political belief but also because of the love for a woman. Love, as both men discover, is also war. And as with any war, there are always casualties.8/10</fullReview>

Conservatives will hate it (too bad!) and the rest of us will be moved, and deeply troubled, by it's many implications. You might even shed a tear or two, like I did.Graham Greene, who's book this movie is adapted from is one of my heroes. He was a household name in the 60's and early 70's. And, he deserves to be one again! Haven't we learned a thing from Viet Nam? Or, are we Americans all suffering from amnesia? Pentagon Papers anyone? Remember the notorious "Domino Theory?" If we don't save Vietnam from Communism the whole of Asia will go down the drain, and then those blasted Commies will someday be knocking at our door! Oh, the grand "Big Lie" strikes again in the 2000's! Why did so many of us believe our Federal government would "never" mislead the public on the reasons for the Iraq War? But here we go again, repeating history. We are such fools, it's truly amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-inspiring adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this review having read the book by Graham Greene, but I'll try to comment on the adaptation without including spoilers for people who haven't read it and are about to see the film. Still, if you like to form your own opinion, I'd rather suggest that you stop reading and just watch the movie. It's really the kind of intelligent story that deserves your own private take on it, formed without previously consulting others on what it could be. 'The Quiet American' might leave you with some hard questions to ponder, like such films as 'Death and the Maiden' or 'The Pianist'.So, I found the adaptation very interesting and thoughtful. I wouldn't say the script is really completely true to the original text. It has changed the original's essence somewhat, and the interesting thing is that while it corrected something I found somewhat flawed in the novel, it did so only in getting something, that was a great thing in the book, somewhat flawed. On the one hand, Pyle's character is more realistic here, or at least I felt so, watching the movie. In the book he is just too naive at certain points. Here he's still an idealist, but shows a lot less naiveté than in the book. On the other hand, I think the way the characters interact as a result provides some cover-up of Fowler's character development (which was very much in the focus of Greene's novel). It's not that the changes Fowler goes through are denied. It's just that they receive less emphasis, less attention, and can thus be perceived less easily. For some, this might go down as presenting events from more of an anti-American point of view than the book. Anyway, if someone who hasn't yet read or seen 'The Quiet American' is still with me at this point: just go and judge for yourself when you already know what I could possibly be talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>they told us so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read that there was a version of "The Quiet American" made in the 1950s. Since the Vietnam War had not yet happened - at least not its really famous stages - that version could have been seen as a warning. Since this one came out long after the Vietnam War (in fact, shortly before the invasion of Iraq), it's both a warning and saying "I told you so".The obvious point is that this movie is not a war movie, but it's still a good look at what led up to the Vietnam War, as the young American agent (Brendan Fraser) comes in pretending to help the people but is actually coming to stir up trouble that the US can use as an excuse to invade. This may be the best role that he has ever done, to the extent that the movie would work equally well without the presence of a great actor like Michael Caine (no offense to Mr. Caine).So, it's certainly one that I recommend, as a warning about the dangers of militarism, even in its most minimal form. Also starring Rade Serbedzija and Tzi Ma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gut wrenchingly authentic look at the era - might be spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made me feel quite sick - not because it wasn't excellent, because it was, but because of the war it presaged. The characters, Fowler (played as ever brilliantly by Michael Caine) and Pyle (Brendan Fraser was a revelation here, - a young, less than idealistic intelligence officer, who looked and acted, right down to his mannerisms, like a tough, middle class American of that 1950s era, who was absolutely sure that he was in the right). The girl, beautiful and docile, is a mere foil for the men to vie over - anybody who thinks her character should be developed is in my opinion mistaken, they are not interested in her for her character,and she has no need of one in the context of this movie. The settings and cinematography are perfect. This is a wonderful movie, if only we didn't know what was coming next.There was some lip service paid to the Vietnam War right at the very end, which appears, naturally, neither in the original novel nor in the first movie made in 1958, but added a great deal to this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling, Powerful, and Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply an outstanding film. The film does a great job at bringing the important themes, characters, and events of the book to film in an entertaining and gripping manner. It successfully portrays its powerful messages and examination of human character.The cinematography, directing, scenery, etc., are all first rate. The visuals are beautiful and, combined with the overall highly skillful and artistic use of camera work, details, voices, sounds, etc., perfectly convey the atmosphere of Vietnam and the issues facing the characters. It successfully draws the viewer in to the point of almost smelling and feeling what's happening.The screenplay keeps the momentum going, slowing down just enough, and beautifully building the atmosphere and tension.The acting is magnificent. Caine, as usual, puts in a great performance and this is probably one of the best of his career. It's rather hard to swallow that he could get an academy award for Cider House Rules but not for this movie! In fact, Caine has never been fully recognized for any of his greatest roles, but then I have little real faith in the whole academy award thing anyway. Fraser is, as usual in dramas, also wonderful. This highlights once more the irony that despite the fact that he is usual known for comedies some of his greatest work and roles are in top-notch, artistic, and pretty heavy-hitting dramas. He is perfect as the apparently helpful and naive, but sinister, scheming American aid worker and his appearance, demeanor, and skills wonderfully convey both aspects of this character.In the end, this is utterly successful, powerful, compelling drama that is beautiful, grips the viewer, and presents complex, rich, and convincing characters who evoke strong emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Caine tour-de-force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Quiet American" tells of an eternal triangle which evolves amid the tropical backdrop of Vietnam during the end of the French War in Indochina in 1952. The triangle includes a British reporter (Caine), and American aid worker (Fraser), and a Vietnamese beauty (Do Thi Hai Yen). The film opens after the stabbing death of Fraser's character and spends the rest of the run explaining the circ's which led up to the killing. Caine carries the film on his back with a solid performance while Fraser is unconvincing and the local beauty is just so much window dressing. A moderately interesting drama, "The Quiet American" squeaks by as a three star watch thanks to Caine, good atmospherics, location shooting, and some intrigues. Coulda, shoulda been better but an okay watch for most, especially those who got their Vietnam history lessons from the nightly news broadcasts of the 60's. (B)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.It is part of the human condition to imagine ways in which the universe reflects that small vocabulary of happenings that forms our lives. Greene created something of an industry in writing stories that exploit this notion, stories where some moral dilemma is mirrored in huge political or natural tides. It is a simple, unsophisticated idea, but one that sometimes created spellbinding stories as he moved between levels.The effect was one of seamless integration, adding apparent new depth at each level. Never was the depth real, however. Never were there any actual new insights on the larger or personal dynamics. But we went along because of the sheer audacity of the idea and the skill by which it was exploited. Now along comes another film of one of his books, and another failure at this seamless integration. In the book, the forces that unfold are as fluid as the imagination can make them, but with film we are limited by what we can see.So we see war and intrigue. And we see a simple competition of two aliens for the attention of a woman, all with mutual exploitation in mind. Yes, there are a few metaphors (Vietnam as mistress to an aging Europe), but the cosmos of the personal is wholly unrelated to that of the political, except that each happens to be there. This completely drains the project of life and all we are left with is a workmanlike picture with professional but uninspired and unintegrated souls.One element of that workmanship was notable: the rhythm of Caine's delivery. Like any low class English actor of his generation, he is obsessed with subtle nuances in inflection and how that denotes social standing. Here he employs an amazingly effective trick: his timing is rushed a tiny amount, even when giving the voice-over narration. This is a well-established phenomenon in conversational pecking orders: the dominant speaker always has this aggressive timing. Fraser takes this and delays his timing to an equally subtle extent (but less consistently), making him the `quieter' of the two.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caine deserved the Oscar nomination...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and yet I didn't get the sense that he will win it come next week- his performance is compelling and believable enough to carry this film to even longer lengths than it ends at, but it's not exactly his very best (not like say Cider House Rules or Hannah and Her Sisters). He indeed gets inside the Graham Greene character of Thomas Fowler, reporter for the London Times in 1952 Saigon, who is also in love with a beautiful Vietnamese girl. Enter in Brendan Fraser's character of Pyle, some sort of medical personnel, who quite congenially befriends Fowler, only to also fall for his girl. This in the scope of the French against the communist Vietnamese, making the atmosphere war torn. While I have not read Greene's novel, it would seem that just from hearing Fowler's voice-over narration, brief and smart, the book is one of those that has the upper hand over the finished product of film. There is much merit to Noyce's adaptation, mainly due to Caine revealing depths on the nature of Fowler. And the love-triangle fused with the backdrop makes sense. It's Fraser who I though brings the film down in parts, for though he does what he can, he is severely overshadowed by the lead Brit. Not a great movie, but Caine fans will be delighted and Greene admirers should take a look as well. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish interpretation of Graham Greene's novel with legendary Caine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Quiet American" is one of those movies that shouldn't be missed because of many aspects. First, fans of Graham Greene won't be disappointed cause Phillip Noyce managed to create very stylish interpretation of Greene's novel. Second, the acting of Michael Caine in his old days is absolutely amazing. Third and most important, this is a very good movie; not a brilliant one but very good. Story is set in Saigon, Vietnam in 1952., where movie starts with a murder of a man who Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), older British reporter, knew very well. Story then goes back and we are introduced with Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen), beautiful and young Thomas mistress and young and idealistic American aid worker Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser). Alden falls in love with Phuong after their first meeting and tries to win her for himself. While Thomas and Alden 'fight' for Phoung, there is real war raging on streets of Saigon and in the area.This story is about love, which both Thomas and Alden feel about Phoung. Phuong is here an object, marionette that switch sides however her older sister wants to. What she feels? Certainly gratitude to Thomas because he put her away from ticket-dancer job and gave her home and financial independence. But is that all that Phuong feels? Is she in love with Thomas? Probably not cause she went to live with Alden, knowing that sooner or later she'll fall in love with him, because he's younger. On the war plan, Thomas discovers Alden's interference, that finally leads to betrayal and like in chess, removing an opponent. Beside very good directing of Noyce, all the prize goes to most of this crew for giving life to their characters. Michael Caine leads this cast, with no opponents really. Only Rade Serbedzija, in scenes in the beginning and at the end, as Inspector Vigot manages to act with Caine. Both of them aren't only screen, but excellent stage actors. Lot of people aren't aware of Serbedzija's career but he's just a perfect actor. Our second main actor, Brendan Fraser is what I didn't liked in every aspect. Fraser has this face and appearance to be Alden Pyle, book character. What Fraser lacks is serious roles. Here, in scene when all secrets are revealed (Alden and Thomas conversation in Thomas home, before Thomas opened the book), Fraser is blown off by Caine. Fraser made that scene funny to watch, because he cannot act that kind of serious roles when you got to show emotions, shout, stand for you beliefs (which is the point of Alden Pyle character). Beautiful Do Thi Hai Yen plays Phuong, and I must add that she does it very well. To conclude, watch this slow paced beauty because of capable direction coming from Phillip Noyce and brilliant acting coming from legendary Michael Caine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is good work. I came to it because i've recently re seen Minghella's Talented Mr.Ripley. This one had Mighella as an executive producer and, in fact, it has much of the strength in mood that he is often able to give his films. That mood is based on specific cultural environments. That environment is always en formed by strong musical notes (here is another, quite good soundtrack work).Here we have something particularly interesting: the initial shot. This is made of a still landscape shot over the river in Saigan. We get to see more than half the screen with river water, boats on it, houses, and bombs/explosions in a last plan. Than, suddenly, the camera moves down, and we find out a dead body inside a boat right below us. All this is completed with sounds from the explosions and the off voice narration by Caine, quite meaningful in its words to the whole development. The scene has (as most of the first scenes in films) the power to take us into the specific world of the film. One has to appreciate how remarkably economical this one is done.So now we have the mood, the environment, we have a war, a oriental society, and foreign folks involved. Now the cinematic theme (in straight relation to the story told): all this is made around "seeing". Every faction in this conflict (the historic war conflict and the dramatic conflict between our three protagonists) has its own particular way to See things and always makes the effort to bend the world to that vision. So we have the clear as water war situation. Communists, French, general The and the "third way" (americans). They See things their own way and more: they try to make people see the other factions the way they themselves see it. Check it: -the bombs one faction places in order to make people believe other faction did it;-Fraser's character who makes himself look like medical assistant (who incidentally heals an eye disease) while in fact moves his way in secret to create the things he wants people to see (and interpret in a specific way); -Diolacton, the product which is passed as being something to use in several products (among those it is supposed to strengthen eye glass wires!) but in fact is a compound used to produce bombs; Than we have our love triangle. Fraser (as a participant) and Caine (as a observer, a man who "Sees") link this story to the global environment. Phuong's vision is in fact her sister's vision: marrying the sister with an occidental man who can be married. Both men place their personal interests into trying to get the girl.All this construction is intelligent, the mood is well placed (and the first scene has lots to do with it), and the music is really powerful in driving emotions, almost replacing what in other pictures would be made through physical actions. The weak link here is Fraser. He is not the guy for the role which, here, was really important, as a pivot, as disestablishing element. I care about some of his works as a comedian, but he clearly doesn't know very well what to do here, and sometimes he even becomes funny when he's supposed to be intense (in a dramatic way). Caine is many times in other films just vapid and grabbed to his British posture as en former of his roles, but here he really understands the job, and delivers. He is the "quiet" actor, no Fraser.My evaluation: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than 1958 version; Greene closer to the truth than most commentators</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a much more faithful rendering of Greene's book than the 1958 version, which he disowned because it ignored his implied criticism of American involvement in frustrating the Geneva Accords, which had brought the French war to an end. In fact, Greene's book could be regarded as a thinly disguised historical account, and very valuable for that reason. Had it been honestly filmed in the first place it might have deterred misplaced American support for armed intervention in the 1960s. Many Americans still don't realize that the CIA advice to Eisenhower was that, had the elections mandated at Geneva been held, Ho Chi Minh might well have won 80% of the national vote. Eisenhower admitted that in vol. 1 of his memoirs, published in 1963 (and that date should resonate). The US set out to frustrate the holding of those elections (a strange way to promote democracy), and that is the background to Greene's book and this movie. The only false note (to the cognoscenti) is the casting of Caine, excellent though his performance is. The London Times and similar papers of that era would never have employed someone with a Cockney accent: in that era only true-blue Oxbridge types became foreign correspondents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great book, fair film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Greene's novels have been said to describe "Greeneland", a place defined by a certain blend of geography, Catholicsm and moral dilemma particular to the author. Greene's brilliant writing and characterisation give each book its own identity, but certain elements are recycled, albeit in different combinations. For example, the opposition of the doctor and the consul in 'The Honorary Consul' mirrors that of the journalist and the American in 'The Quiet American', although the doctor sleeps with the consul's girl and the American with the journalist's. Now, another recycled element has been retrospectively added into the mix: Michael Caine, who played the honorary consul in the film of that book, has now played Fowler (the journalist) in the latest of several film versions of 'The Quiet American'.'The Quiet American' is one of my favourite books, so it's hard for me to judge the film entirely independently. The rendering of the story is (apparently unlike the earlier films) largely true to the spirit of the book, although it appeared a little disjointed to my eyes, failing to convey a sense of the normal existence of the characters between the stand out events. There's also some slight dumbing down, characters ask questions that they should already know the answers to (so that the audience can be told); the plot (and Fowler's personal journey) are both a little simplified; and the character of Fowler is made a little less jaded than he is in the novel Still, Caine convinces in the role, as does Do Thi Han Yen as his enigmatic girlfriend Phuong. As the American, Brendan Fraser is a little brawnier than I was expecting, although his characterisation is in keeping with the novel. The ending of the book is also exchanged for a new twist that effectively acknowledges Greene's prescience in writing the story (it was actually composed in 1955, but it tells you most of what you need to know to understand the later stages of the Vietnam war, or even America's current neo-Conservative movement, intruding into Iraq with an ideology that appears barely evolved from York Harding's). I think, however, that the original ending made more sense, even if it reflected themes of more interest perhaps to Greene himself than the average modern viewer.Overall, the film just didn't grab me with the same power as the book, although it's hard to tell whether it might have done had I not read the novel first. But it's certainly a pretty straight and honourable attempt to put Greene's exquisite story, and surprisingly contemporary message, on screen. By all means watch this film; but read the book as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie Despite an Overrated Caine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trapped inside rheumy eyes, sagging jowls, and pot belly, Fowler (Caine) looks every inch the backwater journalist at the end of a not-very-distinguished rope. We understand his love-lorn desperation. Ditto his porcelain doll mistress, and her desperation to survive the shifting sands of colonial Vietnam. Alden Pyle (Fraser) too, looks every inch his OSS part, an idealistic frat-boy who took all the correct courses, saluted all the correct flags, and never learned a thing about the soul of subjugated peoples, at home or abroad. If these visuals are perfect, the lead performance is not. In short, Caine's Thomas Fowler has been wildly overpraised. In a part that cries out for civilized passion, he gives a lot of well-bred British civility, but very little passion. There are simply too many blank-eyed stares with not enough hint of the inner life that breeds conflicting emotions. Instead of interpreting the character, his scenes float on physical appearance and the richness of Greene's conception, a distinction too many folks have conflated. Thus the final act of betrayal, which should be the movie's payoff, is robbed of suspense and insight by a performance that fails to develop over time. I found myself wishing Bette Davis had directed his scenes.This is a good movie, but no unmitigated triumph. The Greenian complexities and ambiguities are mostly where they should be. However, unlike the novel's narrative, exposition here at times suffers from heavy-handed repetition as other reviewers have pointed out -- the overstated wet cement, for one. Nonetheless, there's enough depth to convey the basic brilliance of the book, which remains a powerful interweaving of personal and political treachery. (The reviewer who likens this novel to those of Henry James provides an ironical insight.)Too bad this second version was denied to viewers of the bowdlerized 1958 version. That way, the US might have been spared a bloody object lesson in the sort mass deception that now echoes across the shifting sands of Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and emotive political/drama /thriller set during Vietnam war with intervention of France and US</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining picture dealing with a central romance along with thrills , political details and warlike deeds about Vietnam war . A young naive American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) and a cynical older British journalist called Fowler (Michael Caine) disagree over politics in 1952 Vietnam and over a beautiful young native girl called Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen) . As a ¨quiet American¨ with dark secrets arrives in Saigon with his own plan to settle country's conflicts . As it's not clear whether Alden Pyle is just what he appears , as he seems to be an innocent Young American opposite the older, cynical Brit Thomas Fowler . Eventually Fowler must confront moral conflicts and the relationship between Pyle and him reaches some problems connected with a Vietnamese General , at the same time the war and a political upheaval take place . Interesting second rendition of the Graham Greene novel including a love triangle , emotion , wartime events and many other things . The picture relies heavily on the love triangle between the ironical British reporter , his enticing mistress and the strange quiet American , but it doesn't boring , neither tiring and nor dull . Michael Caine is good as a correspondent covering a conflict and finding himself becoming personally involved when he befriends an American who is not all that he seems to and also falling for a beautiful young Vietnamese , a mesmerizing Do Thi Hai . The movie has its touching moments found primarily in the superb performances from trio protagonist . The film ends with newspaper stories written by Thomas Fowler about Vietnam from 1954 to 1966. However the book on which the film was based was published in 1955, so these are mostly events which happened after the book came out . The US release of this movie was delayed for more than a year by the terrorist attacks on the USA of 11 September 2001. The producers were concerned that it would be seen as anti-American.Miramax had paid $5.5 million for the rights to distribute the movie in North America and some other territories, but then shelved it for a long time. Miramax even planned to send this movie to go straight-to-video. But Michael Caine successfully persuaded Miramax to screen this movie at 2002 Toronto International Film Festival; the movie received many good reviews at the Film Festival, so Miramax decided to release this movie in the United States theatrically . This handsomely mounted flick was well directed by Phillip Noyce , a successful Australian director who filmed Dead Calm (1989), starring Nicole Kidman, Sam Neill and Billy Zane , it brought Noyce to Hollywood, where he directed 6 films over the next decade, including Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and present danger (1994) starring Harrison Ford, and The bone collector (1999), starring Oscar winners Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.The first version with a very good cast such as Audie Murphy as the American , Michael Redgrave as Thomas Fowler , Claude Dauphin as Inspector Vigot , Giorgia Moll as Phuong Bruce Cabot as Bill Granger resulted to be more a killing mystery than the political/drama intented , while this last retelling turned to be more faithful to Graham Greene than Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1958 take on . In fact , in Europe, director-writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz was savagely attacked for his film's infidelity to the source novel by Graham Greene, not least by Greene himself. The screenplay essentially turns the novel inside-out, so that the blundering "quiet American", whose extreme naiveté causes tragedies .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caine and Fraser ooze with on screen presence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was at college I had to read the Graham Greene novel The Quiet American and then write an essay regarding colonialism within the literature. Due to this I despised the book, not because the story or writing weren't good but because I had to do an essay on something that really didn't interest me. Years later I have decided to watch the film version of that novel and I have to say it was much better than I remember. Like I said the book wasn't bad but after watching this film, which I thought was great, I am considering buying the book and re- reading it.The film is kept quite close to the book; which is good news for all of those who have read it. The story follows Thomas Fowler (Caine) who is an English journalist in Vietnam due to the war between the French colonialist and the communists of Vietnam. Since being there he has met a young Vietnamese woman who he can't marry due to still being married to a Catholic woman refusing a divorce. He really believes that he loves this woman despite the fact he knows most of these women are with wealthier older men to get themselves out of the country. Fowler's life begins to change though when he meets Alden Pyle (Fraser), an American medical worker who has been sent in to aid the Vietnamese. Although they become good friends, Pyle falls in love with Fowler's girl and as this is 1950's Vietnam he believes he should be able to declare his love and let her decide. Fowler then has to do all he can to keep his girl from a man with many more prospects than him. All of this is set in the beginning of the Vietnamese war and highlights a possible way to how the Americans became involved, which also ties in with this love triangle.Don't be fooled into thinking this is a love story. It may be at heart a love story but surrounding it around the war makes all the difference. There are plenty of political theories and themes' running through it and the love story is only really one half of the entire plot but the driving force behind it all. Caine and Fraser are brilliant in this film. Their chemistry is spot on and after reading the book these actors are exactly how you would expect them to be, they definitely done their homework. Other members of the cast also portray their roles well but it is the two leads who steal it. Caine seems to breeze through it with ease with it being a simple role for him, so most praise has to go to Fraser who has proved that he isn't just a comic actor and can take serious roles seriously. Both actors play their characters with hidden depth that seeps through as the story goes on, and we can clearly see a change in both their personalities by the end of the film. The setting is also beautiful. The cities of Vietnam look great despite war torn, and the graininess of the cinematography also adds to this. The war scenes are filmed well and they add to the depth of conflict and desperation which is shown throughout. War may be happening but our leads are more worried that love will keep them alive.The film kept me gripped till the end, and the final twenty minutes is intense when we finally understand what is happening. The music adds to this tension and the fast pace of the build up. This final act ironed out a few negatives that I had with the film and cleared them from view. One of these was that the beginning felt a little disjointed and expositional but the final act made me forget all about it. This was a film that I am surprised to have liked and I recommend it to those of you out their interested in this kind of plot line. Actually I recommend it to anyone who likes Michael Caine, and that must be everybody. Also don't be put off by the casting of Brendan Fraser, he is actually really good.4 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quality Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've decided to say very little about this movie, except that it's one of quiet quality - the story, the screenplay, the acting by all and the location work.Like its title, it does not and indeed doesn't need to shout out about its many fine qualities. The story is universal, 'old school' - in that there is actually one to be told and is portrayed in an intelligent manner by director Philip Noyce. Michael Caine's performance remains one his very best - subtle, vulnerable but still commanding and Brendan Fraser, so often type-casted into comedy and action 'matinee' style blockbusters that we are slightly surprised that he rises to this occasion nicely.For a film to teach us about human behaviour, history during a contentious and difficult time for many (Vietnam, of course) but not feel the need to ram actual war down our throats is refreshing. It might not be considered a classic, but good it is and should be on a to-see list if a quality intelligent drama and one that doesn't require endless to-ing and fro-ing and getting lost in over-elaborate plot-lines. Fans of Michael Caine should actually own it, as those who follow the excellent Grahame Greene and his cinematic adaptations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, wonderful Caine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in Saigon ten years ago when they had just finished filming this movie and some friends of mine, who permanently lived there at the time, had a small role in it. It was 2001, but the movie didn't came out that year 'cause, after 9/11, the production decided to delay the release of the film. Someone thought that it was anti-American since it could be seen as a criticism of American policy. I still don't understand why since the Iraq war wasn't begun yet and Graham Greene's original novel was written long before America decided to intervene in the Vietnam conflict. Greene's and movie's criticisms on American foreign policy are very general, besides the plot is more of a love story. It's settled in 1952 in Vietnam: Caine is an English journalist who looks for new stories to ensure he can continue his job in Saigon and his living there with a young mistress. He has no intention to come back to London and to his wife. It's the time of the French-communist fighting in the north of the country. A young American doctor arrives as a part of a medical team and falls in love with the journalist's mistress. The two men discuss about what would be better for the girl, but in love, as in war, everything is permitted and someone will meet a tragic end. Phillip Noyce does a good job and his adaptation is faithful to Greene's story. There isn't much action and the movie runs slowly, but never boring. The film's strength is the cast: Brendan Fraser and Do Thi Hai Yen are pretty good, but Michael Caine is simply terrific, he is perfect in his part, it seems his role was written especially for him. It's worth seeing the movie just for his performance. Caine is one of my favorite actors and since I was there at the time, my regret was I couldn't go on the set to meet him. After this movie The Quiet American became one of the most sold books by Saigon's street vendors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tones of "Blade Runner" and "Apocalypse Now" as the movie spirals down the rat hole of the war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a Graham Greene novel, this movie starts off with undertones of "Blade Runner" and "Apocalypse Now" before spiraling down the rat hole of CIA involvement in 1950s Vietnam.Starring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, this film works its quiet way along the twisted path of two men in love with the same woman, each seeking advantage over the other. The mistake of one man is to trust the other.We can take the movie as a metaphor. Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a British reporter who understands colonialism if not Vietnam. He sees the French losing their colonies in Indochina and reports it dispassionately. Fraser is Alden Pyle, a member of the American legation, bent on saving Vietnam for the Vietnamese. Fraser is young and ambitious. Fowler is old and experienced. The woman they love is the metaphor for how each sees the colony. The woman, Phuong, is played by Do Thi Hai Yen.The dialogue is excellent without being preachy. The movie starts at the end, then tells us the story in flashback. I was reminded of "Blade Runner" in the Asian setting and language, when we see what's going on without a clue to what it means. Much as Pyle felt, I'm sure, when he arrived in Saigon. There's a certain surrealism to some of the scenes, reminiscent of "Apocalypse Now," but soon the film settles into its own style, and I was caught up in the chivalry of Fowler and Pyle as they jousted for possession of Phuong/Vietnam. Looking at the movie about 1950s Vietnam, there's a certain nostalgic sadness, as we know now the inevitable end for the young upstart. As Pyle spouts his anti-communist, pro- American, heartfelt beliefs, we know Pyle lost. As we watch the movie, we see the jaded Fowler play the game to win. His victory isn't quite bitter sweet. Not because it isn't bitter, but because it isn't sweet.I haven't read the novel and take the movie on its own. Director Phillip Noyce and writers Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkan deserve great credit. This era is still an open wound for many Americans, and the writers have distilled the war into a play between two men. We can choose not to see the metaphor and to see the unfolding of a greater truth of human nature. Or perhaps the unraveling of humanity in a particular person who represents us all.NOTE: I now have read the novel (written in 1954 I think), and I recommend it highly. Don't read it till you've seen the movie, though. As with all novels v. movies, the characters are more fully developed in the book and the movie will seem shallow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quiet American: A Lesson in Fine Acting by Caine and Company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, two thoughts hit me, all the acting in this film is masterful and the second is that these are the types of thrillers Hollywood should make but fails to try to even find movies such as this a wide studio release and it way to become a hit. Some of the acting in this film is some of the best I have seen in a long while, Michael Caine gives what I think is his best performance since 1971's Get Carter and this along with The Cider House Rules rank among his best work. For his co-stars, Brendan Fraser gives his best performance at this point in his career. The plot itself does play a major part in this film but I could go for a plot less movie if it only had this type of acting, if a normal thriller or even romantic movie had this acting all the time, they could become major hits and critically praised. Not only for it's plot and acting, along with many other great things in this film, you must see "The Quiet American".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody needs a friend like Graham Greene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great adaptation of one of the best writers of all times. The foundation is strong: we have Greene's work as the main attraction, with Phillip Noyce as captain of the ship, Michael Caine superbly guiding us, and a terrific plot to fill our minds completely with oceans of emotions. The result is obvious and I am not delighted to say is one of the least commentated films ever judging its relevance.Pure cinematic gem! Everyone should own it on DVD, or at least have the privilege to watch it.Interestingly in 2002 the director had a good roll and he also directed his second best work after this one, Rabbit Proof Fence. Perhaps another reminder of what he has done is Dead Calm, with Nicole Kidman and Sam Neil being terrorized by Billy Zane in a new version of Polanski's, Knife in Water.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Estranged bedfellows fall in/out of love and war. The two halves of this film, political espionage and a love triangle offer little new on their own, but joined in unison here I felt worked well.With Graham Greene as its source, I anticipated a lean film. I admired his dedication to writing as a craft, allegedly one who hit the typewriter as a master athlete hits the gym. On a side note, I've recently read "The Comedians" (a take on Papa Doc era Haiti with a requisite trying triangle of love).I'm not a Greene thesis candidate, but it does seem in the books and movies I've seen, betrayal is never so much a surprise as it is a given. An anti-hero is presented to us, some sort of jaded burnt-out case. While he will swear no allegiance, no involvement; inevitably and inexorably he is drawn in. And often he's drawn in through a woman serving as a sort of beacon of purity.Well purity is a bit strong, but she's nowhere near as jaded as our hero. When he's with her, through something more than sex (but certainly including sex), redemption is found. But that redemption is in a precarious position. A writer with a Catholic block indeed!Well it works for me. I suspect most men will either love this or hate this, likely hinging upon if they fancy Do Thi Hai Yen as the love interest. Her halting English, and fallen "princess" in distress role may put others off. I found her the very essence of grace and enchantment.Sorry if that seems sexist, I just wonder if women might resent the fact that she is often seen as an adornment, even twirling before our eyes in one lovely dance sequence. If we can glean anything from her placid yet powerful beauty, it is in the subtitles between herself and her sister.More of those scenes would have been welcomed. However, it would be an entirely different film if we were allowed to drift away from Caine's/Fowler's strict perspective, and see the two sisters alone. Or see Fraser/Pyle alone with Hai Yen/Phuong. Their relationship hits an accelerator pedal during a voice-over that made some of the later set-up seem out of place to me.But again, I did enter the triangle with Fowler as my touchstone. Without that, you are left with a thriller that is not meant to be a thriller (indeed we are presented the deceased in the opening scene). Or you are left with the politics which alone will upset certain viewers as being painfully true or preposterous propaganda. The left and right drift further apart, more lies ahead on both sides...hopefully no more My Lai's. To Greene's great credit, he was committed to characters as complicated as the crises they are embroiled in.Anway, this garnered a 7/10out of me. It was lean, and moved along at a nice pace (and I tend to round up a bonus point for "exotic" settings)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting moral and ethical twists and turns worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Quiet American" is a solid movie with strong performances by Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser playing the two main roles. Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a late middle aged, well-mannered, British reporter living in Vietnam during the last days of the French fight against communism. Fraser plays a friendly young American doctor named Alden Pyle who cures infectious eye diseases and wants to help people. Overt Plot: Fowler and Pyle meet and become fast friends in a land of strangers. Fowler has a young mistress named Phuong whom he says he would like to marry her, but he cannot because his good catholic wife in England will not give him a divorce. Pyle sees Phuong with Fowler and later says to Fowler it was love at first sight. Fowler becomes jealous in a reserved British way that comes to a head when Phuong is persuaded by her sister to leave Fowler for Pyle. At the end the locals kill Pyle then Phuong and Fowler get back together. Fowler decides to stay in Vietnam as a reported for many years up to the mid-sixties.Secondary Plot:Fowler is a womanizing, opium smoking man who leads his mistress along promising that he going to stay in Vietnam and divorce his English wife. Pyle ends up being a ruthless CIA agent who really believes he is helping everyone in the long run by killing people. The "We had to burn the village to save the village" mentality. Tossed in the mix are several minor characters that prove the adage that "Foreigners bring suspicion on themselves and shame on their country."What I found interesting in the movie are the pragmatic and duplicitist twists that the movie takes. Although Fowler takes advantage of his mistress by lying, he protects her from exploitation and eventually comes around to really loving her and staying with her thus showing he has some virtues. Another example is when Fowler decides the "human" thing to do is turn Plye over to the Vietnamese to be killed though Pyle saved Fowlers life earlier. There are other examples that further make Fowler an antihero and Pyle a villain. The grayish moral and ethical choices made in this film are what I believe makes this film worth watching. The cinematography is also beautiful and the music score is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a god and the Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why it took me so long to realize that Michael Caine is a god. His intelligence always dominates the screen. I usually like Brendan Fraser, but he is so over-shadowed by Michael Caine, even though Caine is so much older. He still has it.Everyone should know that this film was held back by Miramax because of 9/11. They thought it would be a bad idea to release a film critical of U.S. government policy, even policy in the distant past. Maybe the government had a hand in this decision. This film presents in a concise manner the history of how the U.S. got involved in Vietnam. Other films that relate the U.S. history of over-throwing foreign governments, assassinating foreign leaders, and installing puppet regimes are: "JFK" (Oliver Stone), "Bowling for Columbine" (Michael Moore, whose publisher tried to withhold his book "Stupid White Men" after 9/11), and "Cover-Up" by the Christic Institute. The latter is about the CIA being behind the import of drugs to this country, and about the Republicans making a deal with the Iranians to delay the release of the hostages so that Carter wouldn't be re-elected (Carter had fired 700 CIA secret operatives, who got together to make sure one of their supporters got in the White House). See these films to see the role of the CIA and other covert operations agencies' power as the shadow government of the U.S.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films made in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Quiet American' is more than a movie-it's easily one of the best films made in years, thanks to director Phillip Noyce (`The Bone Collector'). He has crafted a motion picture with superb performances by Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, and along with beautiful cinematography, an enthralling score, and basically every aspect of filmmaking that made `The Quiet American' transcend itself above the average film. Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a British reporter living in Vietnam during the days of the French involvement to fight communism. Fowler has a mistress, quite younger than he, who is named Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). Although she would like to marry him, he is restrained by his marriage to a woman in England who won't give him a divorce because of her religious devotion. But Fowler's world turns upside down when an American named Alden Pyle (Fraser) turns up who is a doctor studying infectious disease in the area. Pyle meets Phuong and falls for her. As such, he confesses his love for her to Fowler, whose jealousy shows up only when Phuong is persuaded to leave Fowler for the younger and supposedly richer Pyle. It all leads to a conclusion that goes beyond the two men's obsession with the young, Vietnamese woman. One certainly can't complain about Noyce's direction-it's outstanding! The very opening of the film is a shot of Saigon at night. We see the city lights and get a feel that this could be paradise. Then we see tracer fire from the war that is going on outside of the city, with Caine's narration accompanied by a beautiful, yet eerie score by composer Craig Armstrong.Later scenes show Fowler in his bedroom with his girlfriend, Phuong, getting high on opium. The intriguing part of this scene rests in the dark colors-the way the candlelight glimmers on the objects of the room, the way the smoke flows from the pipe and from the mouths of the characters, evoking a very exotic feel. The battle scenes are genuinely intense, devoid of unnecessary gun fighting and violence, giving the audience a realistic taste of the carnage that both terrorism and war brings about. Caine and Fraser are equally convincing in their roles as two men in love with the same woman. Caine portrays his anger towards Fraser in a realistic, yet heated manor. His comments aren't riddled with useless vulgarities, but rather a well-mannered man who would prefer to discuss his anger, as opposed to physical violence. Rarely does Caine ever resort to vituperations, but holds his anger in, clearly expressed through his countenance. Fraser's portrayal of Pyle is more livid to Caine's Fowler about his love for Phuong. Fraser's stellar performance proves that the actor is truly gifted and has the ability to play the simple characters of big-budget cinema, and the more the complex characters of the independent realm. `They say there's a ghost in every house and if you keep the peace with him, he will remain quiet,' the last quote by Caine in the film. The quote properly defines why he never resorts to any true hatred for the Fraser's character, Pyle. By not coming off as infuriated towards Pyle, Fowler has the ability to save face and act dignified as a gentleman of his stature should-and just maybe, the avid Pyle would forget about Phuong. But the final quote holds more significance than just to the characters of the film. Perhaps director Noyce was trying to say a message about the American and French involvement in Vietnam. To break it down, the Cold War was mostly all smoke and mirrors-just a bunch of politicians building a nuclear stockpile that would be, thankfully, wasted. But perhaps, the ghost of the world was Vietnam and communism. If the U.S. and French had just kept the peace, regardless of the countries differing political views, both communists and democratic believers would have remained quiet, as well. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The politics of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quiet American had many delays in its release one of them after September 11. It was felt that the film was 'un-American' in the climate post 9/11. While the story is of a love triangle set in French colonial Vietnam the underlying politics are what grabbed me. The film makes statements on colonialism, communism and the reasons for US involvement that followed and the tactics of the CIA. I found the author and filmakers were not afraid to reveal that the CIA will often sell explosives and arms to militia and groups who are in opposition to their 'enemy'. However you can not control these groups and the explosives sold in this film were used in a car bomb that killed innocent vietnamese. The car bomb was then blamed on the communists, making them look bad. The reality that this does happen punched me in the face.I was shocked when someone told me that Ronald Reagan starred in the original and was not surprised to find this person mistaken. Audie Murphy and Michael Redgrave star in original version of this film. While I enjoyed the major plotline of the love triangle I found the subplots and other elements of the film to be honest and thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: Minor plot revealsWhen I went to see The Hours, the trailer for The Quiet American preceded its screening. At the conclusion of the trailer, the lady sitting in front of me leaned over to her friend and in reference to the film's title said "Isn't that an oxymoron?".It may very well be an oxymoron, and in fact in the movie "quiet" is used as an adjective to describe just how atypical an American the person in question is, but it is also a novel written by famous British writer (and possibly spy) Graham Greene (not to be confused with the Canadian Native actor).The movie stars Michael Caine as a British journalist, stationed in Vietnam in the early 50s as the colonial French government is losing its grip on control of the country to the communist nationals. Caine has found a comfortable existence in Vietnam, enjoying the pleasures of his opium and his mistress when it is disrupted by an American aid worker played by Brendan Fraser -- don't worry, this is the `Gods and Monsters' Brendan Fraser, not the `Encino Man' Brendan Fraser.Fraser's character quickly becomes enamoured with Caine's mistress, and sets out to rescue her from her circumstance as only an American can do. Somehow Caine and Fraser maintain this mutual camaraderie and respect for one another as they struggle within their love triangle, not unlike two poker players battling for the same big pot.As things begin to heat up within the love triangle, they also heat up within the political landscape of the country, and the personal struggles of the individual relationships become metaphors for the political struggles of the country. While The Quiet American is a piece of fiction, it is set against a very real historical backdrop. Graham Greene was very critical of US foreign policy, and this becomes evident as the film reveals the beginning of the CIA's involvement in Vietnam, which would serve as the pre-cursor to its involvement in the Vietnam War that would follow in the 60s.Anyone who has seen Bowling for Columbine will recall the long list of questionable support by the CIA of various political factions through the years in its effort to covertly affect foreign policy through third parties. The effects of this practice is brought to life in The Quiet American, and it's hard not to remember that Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were also prior "associates" of the CIA in furthering these objectives.But I digress ... even if you put the policital undertones of the film aside, The Quiet American stands up as a very good movie well worth seeing. Besides that it also has a Shar-pei in it. I gotta love any movie with a Shar-pei in it, even if it is out-of-place being owned by an American in Vietnam in the 1950s.Bottom line: 8/10</fullReview>

It brings to light a human aspect not normally shown, even to American veterans of the Vietnam war: the naive and misguided hopes of the American intelligence community present before U.S. Green Berets were dispatched to Vietnam to train allied troops in the 1950's. It's certainly the most relevant Vietnam film I've seen to contemporary American foreign policy, and echoes of motivations and feelings in The Quiet American can be seen in every American or British newspaper today. Caine is flawless, as usual, as the seemingly wise British journalist, and Fraser is the perfect choice for the idealistic, boyish, and awkward American medical worker who seeks his company in an increasingly frightening and dangerous French Indo-China.</fullReview>

Also --- One wonders about Pyle's relationship with the girl----At times he seems rather straight forward and honorable--- there is of course that one tiny scene when they are looking at postcards and one comes up for Niagra Falls----of course Pyle is married (Niagra Falls the honeymoomers retreat)----just like Fowler and of course--just like Fowler --he is not bringing the girl along when he leaves Vietnam. Fowler sending Pyle to his death doesn't seem as tortured as it should be for Fowler---after all Pyle saved his life and he would have put wrench (or at least tried) in Pyle's operations without having him killed-----but he is there to pick up the pieces with the girl in the end---I didn't find that ending quite as charming or heartwarming===as it is met to be----</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegant remake of Graham Greene novel has stunning relevance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[SPOILERS]Phillip Noyce's new version of Graham Greene's "The Quiet American" goes well beyond the 1955 book as a forceful and timely political statement. Though the themes are the same in the new movie, the book dealt more in ambiguities, casting great suspicion on the Americans' early involvement in Vietnam and its motives, while in Noyce's movie the suspicion turns to certainty. It's clear quite early on that the Americans are up to no good. This filming of Graham Greene's novel is a powerful reversal of the 1958 Hollywood adaptation by Joseph Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz's effort, made when US involvement in Vietnam was still in its early stages, was actually stage-managed by the CIA's Edward Lansdale (the force behind the events of the novel if not the original of Alden Pyle, Greene's young "quiet" American CIA man -- Brendan Fraser in the new movie). The 1958 movie made Greene's stand-in, Thomas Fowler, wind up as a basket case and turned the CIA man, Alden Pyle, into a hero. This time Graham Greene's original perceptions are restored -- and then some.Pyle is no innocent bumbler here, as he seems in the book. He may appear well meaning at first, but that soon turns out to be cover. The Pyle Brendan Fraser gives us is ruthless, dangerous, and well aware of what he is doing. When Pyle steals Fowler's Vietnamese mistress Phoung, and Fowler realizes what Fraser's purpose in the country is -- to move in a puppet regime and make it look like the communists are guilty of atrocities -- the jaded English newsman becomes so engaged that, as we eventually see in a series of flash-forwards of news pages, he will later become a crusading correspondent covering the dirty side of the US war in Vietnam.Noyce's "Quiet American" is a stunning effort in more ways than one.The movie begins with the two artists who, in collaboration with Noyce, have made it not only timely and political but also beautiful. The opening scene is a deep dark blue view of Saigon harbor at night with soft lights floating on it photographed by the wonderful cinematographer, Christopher Doyle. As we gaze upon this lovely image, we hear a voiceover from the book read by Michael Caine. The reading is fresh and arresting. A mature master of the art of cinematic underplaying, Caine never lets us sense anything weary or tired in the way he plays the weary, tired London Times correspondent, Thomas Fowler. In Doyle and Caine we have two movie men at the top of their game. Caine we know from dozens of fine performances. Noyce's fellow Australian Doyle we know especially from his stunning cinematography for Hong Kong "auteur" Wong Kar Wai. He also filmed "Rabbit Proof Fence." Phillip Noyce emerges from a creditable, but not so distinguished background. He directed a series of sometimes belligerent big-star Hollywood thrillers during the last decade, chiefly "Dead Calm" (1989), "The Saint" (1991) "Patriot Games" (1992), "Clear and Present Danger"(1994) and "The Bone Collector" (1999). He has revealed a much more personal and committed side with this film and the equally outspoken "Rabbit Proof Fence," the latter as much a denunciation of Australian colonialism and racism as "The Quiet American" is of the US brands of those commodities. You could hardly have predicted this turn from the earlier work. It's as if Noyce has decided to pay his dues; but maybe he had these bees in his bonnet all along. The screenplay is by the playwright Christopher Hampton, who wrote the screenplays, notably, for "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988) and "Total Eclipse" (1995).If you choose to remain human, someone says halfway through the movie, sooner or later you have to take sides, and that's what Fowler is forced to do and what the movie itself does. The new version doesn't erase Pyle's heroism. Again, he saves Fowler's life when they are caught in a watchtower in the north. But there is a self-righteous, threatening air about Fraser's version of Pyle, whereas the 1958 movie had him played by the charismatic war hero Audie Murphy -- and in that version, he IS the hero and the communists are the villains. In this one, the communists barely figure and Pyle gradually becomes so much the villain that we feel no pang when he is gone.The original story emerged from a shocking series of events Graham Greene observed while vacationing in Vietnam, which constitute the pivotal sequence of the present movie. As an informative article by H. Bruce Franklin in The Nation has recently explained, Greene was suspicious of the way a car bombing in a Saigon square was reported (by a CIA-collaborating New York Times reporter) as a "gruesome" act of "terrorism" by the Vietminh. The American press traced the violence to Ho Chi Minh, but the anti-communist warlord Trinh Minh Thé had actually claimed credit for it. How did "Life" magazine happen to have a photographer on the scene? Greene wondered who had supplied Thé with the explosives. His novel provided the answer: it was Alden Pyle -- i.e., the CIA. The movie makes clear that the brutal Thé is set up and funded by the US, as the US actually set up Ngo Dinh Diem, with young Pyle directing things behind the pose of being a medical attaché curing trachoma. The plastic he claims has been shipped in for eyeglass frames is for Thé's explosives. Pyle runs in directing a photo shoot of the hideous bombing in fluent Vietnamese because he planned the whole thing. The CIA is creating grounds for US entry into the war the French were losing, and pretending it's out to stop communism, when the real aim is control of the region. For "communism," read "WMD's," look at the planted evidence, and you've got a parallel picture of our current situation. Greene's 1955 novel was prophetic, and so is this new movie.The irony of the effort to suppress the movie in the US (as H. Bruce Franklin has pointed out) is that the way the release of Noyce's "The Quiet American" was delayed for political reasons from late 2001, when it was originally to come out, until Michael Caine forcibly used his influence to get it a two-week run in New York and L.A. the end of last year, and now a general US release, means that American audiences are seeing parallels between the start of one war and the push toward another that they wouldn't have grasped a year ago. Those of us who have been looking a little deeper lately into the history of American efforts abroad may find "The Quiet American" extremely relevant. But this is not a piece of agitprop. There's a quietude and elegance about it, enhanced by Caine's wonderfully composed, serene characterization and Christopher Doyle's stunning visuals. The big spaces of Fowler's flat stay with you, and the faces of Phoung (Do Thi Hai Yen) and her sister (Pham Thi Mai Hoa); the dance club; and above all, the square that's bombed and the helpless, maimed victims there. One supposes that the Vietnamese know how to stage that sort of thing. They've seen enough of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feast for the Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a visually gorgeous movie. I liked it a lot, particularly because of its stunning beauty and the fact that it took me to a time and exotic place I very rarely see: beautiful, colonial 1950's Southeast Asia. The art direction, cinematography, costumes, interiors and exteriors were gorgeous, not to mention the beauty of Phuong (the Vietnamese woman) and Brendan Fraser themselves. A visual feast.I didn't consider it an absolutely perfect movie while I was watching it, but I certainly was quite happy to follow along and be mesmerized by it.In terms of what wasn't absolutely perfection to me (you can skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the film; these are pretty minor): I had a bit of a hard time believing that two such intensive rivals for the same woman could be civil to each other, let alone be friends. Also, they often seemed to speak of her as if she were merely an object they coveted -- that is, without passion or realism. I also didn't quite "buy" the Englishman Fowler's final decision regarding the American, Pyle (I'm trying not to spoil anything here); his jumble of mixed motivations still didn't add up to a particularly realistic decision in my mind, given what the film had given us thus far. I also personally didn't like the fact that the opening scene gives away the end. This very quiet film would have been much more suspenseful without that information, in my opinion; yet others consider it valuable to the viewer's involvement while watching the film.I did like the mystery and the political intrigue. Also, the movie sheds its own quiet light on the beginnings of the Vietnam conflict, so that's quite nice. It gives a shrewd insight into the extent of the American involvement with, and instigation of, the beginnings of the conflict in Vietnam. Plus it's a movie that makes you think afterwards. Did Pyle's insinuation of himself between Phuong (who can symbolize Vietnam) and Fowler symbolize the American's insinuation into the politics and fate of Vietnam?In terms of Caine and Fraser, I definitely enjoyed both of them, although there was also a very tiny moment with each of them in which I lost my credulity. I don't know if this was due to acting, or the limits of the script, or the extremely quiet tone that the director set for the entire movie. The final speech by Fraser is delivered in a bit of a monotone, which was odd, but maybe that was to reveal that there were things he was hiding.But all in all, I was happy with Caine and Fraser. I really felt it when Caine discovers Phuong's things missing, and I really felt for Fraser when he was in trouble, so they definitely both got way under my skin. But my eyes were honestly all for Phuong, who I thought stole the show. Then again, we don't get to see many gorgeous, beautifully costumed Southeast Asian women on film.All in all, an enjoyable cinematic experience that was fulfilling and well worth my time. Visually stunning, enchantingly exotic, and historically incisive.</fullReview>

Filmmaker Philip Noyce's adaptation of Graham Greene's acclaimed novel of international intrigue set in Vietnam circa 1952 at the dawn of the imperialistic regime cum civil war about to outbreak focuses on a love triangle between a jaded yet complacent English journalist (Caine in one of his best performances), his native taxi dancer lover (Yen) and the titular newcomer (Fraser) which leads to a latent loss of innocence, betrayal of trust and a planned killing in its downward spiral a perfect metaphor for the nation's onslaught ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was kind of looking forward to this film because this was the last chance for my rentals to see a good movie. In 2005 and now in 2006, films have just been horrible. I recently watched The Constant Gardener and was beyond disappointed, so I think I was a little scared that this film was going to be the same, while I believe this was truly a decent film, the story and film just didn't do anything for me. The characters, I don't know wither who to love or hate and some of the plot felt hypocritical. Maybe I need to give it another chance, because I do know there is a great film in there somewhere. But over all, I would recommend it for your own personal experience.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming from an expert of the slow pace, one of the executive producers of 'The Quiet American' is Anthony Minghella, the director of 'The English Patient' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'. No doubt his influence, along with co-executive producer Sydney Pollack, make this a slow moving but well acted film. 'The Quiet American' shows just how far back the American involvement in the Vietnam actually went. Michael Caine is an English reporter in early 1950's Vietnam (French Indo-China) who meets with an American (Brendan Fraser) who may or may not be what he seems. They both compete for the affections of a Vietnamese girl but they try and walk a fine line in remaining friends throughout it all. This film has a well meaning script by Oscar winner Christopher Hampton ('Dangerous Liaisons' in 1988) and Robert Schenkkan based on the novel by Graham Greene. It also has sure footed direction by Phillip Noyce and Michael Caine is outstanding in one of his best performances as a philandering and drug experimenting Englishman whose aloof behaviour leads unintentionally into murder. As anti-American as it is, this movie was supposed to be released in the fall of 2001 but because of the events of September 11th in that year, the film was put off out of respect for the United States and rightfully so. 'The Quiet American' is a quiet film with moments of sizzle and I recommend seeing it for Michael Caine as this veteran actor only continues to get better and better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Moving But Superficial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the 1958 film of Greene's book, though I've heard that the American (played by Audie Murphy) is treated as more of a hero, which is not what Greene intended in his original work.This new film directed by the talented Philip Noyce is closer to the original work and benefits from Michael Caine's presence as an aging British journalist who fancies himself a mere observer in the escalating warfare between the French colonialists and the Communist forces who want them out. He soon finds out that it's not so easy to maintain a neutral stance.However, for the story to have its full impact, there needs to be a deep, palpable friendship between Caine's character and that of the title character (played by Brendan Fraser), who is not what he seems.Unfortunately, that bond doesn't come through in the film at all. Most of the time we're treated to the romantic triangle consisting of these two men and Caine's Vietnamese mistress. The actress who plays this role is very pretty, but also quite dull which makes the character obtuse rather than mysterious. She and Fraser set off nothing close to sparks and her behavior isn't always believable. The woman who plays her sister is far more interesting and has less screen time.The result of all this is that the tragic impact of Caine's actions near the end is muted and robs the film of the cumulative power of the story. The film is more interested in being a fast-moving quasi-thriller and it's pretty entertaining, if superficial, on that score.I noticed that the version that Miramax has released in the U.S. has been cut by 18 minutes from what was shown at the Toronto Film Festival back in 2001. I wonder if that's partly responsible for the problem I mention above, or if it really didn't make any difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light-years BETTER than the 1958 movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1958, Hollywood made Graham Greene's novel, "The Quiet American", into a movie. However, despite the title, the film had very, very little to do with Greene's book. His original story was about a CIA operative who came to French Indochina and naively thought that if the US backed a third force, one neither aligned with the Colonials or the Communists, then they could achieve peace and stability in the country. Greene's story is about his prediction that ultimately such a plan was doomed but instead of directly saying that, the story ultimately involved the operative, a British correspondent and a Vietnamese woman who both men loved. In the 1958 film, almost NONE of this was present and the message was completely reversed...that Vietnam NEEDED American involvement! The story was so changed and so corrupted that the film ended up being a total mess...and I hated it.Now with this 2002 version, Greene's original theme has been restored and the film is essentially the Greene story. Sure a few minor changes were made (such as the ending) but the overall story is something Greene would probably approve of if he was alive to see the picture.Instead of explaining the novel or the 2002 film, I'd like to concentrate on what I liked about the movie. Of course I appreciate that it is the original story. But I also really liked the acting, direction and music--all really looked good and make for a darned good tale. Overall, well worth seeing and despite Michael Caine being a bit too old for his part, a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) the journalist sees a village massacre attributed to the communists and mutters to himself "this doesn't make sense. communists don't kill villagers, it isn't in their interest." The film later implies that the American backed general running as an anti communist was responsible for the massacre. This of course flies in the face of the facts of the conflict. The communists were responsible for horrible massacres of villages of people. A close personal friend who was there for 4 years personally witnessed what the communists did to Vietnamese villagers, the butchery, people skinned alive and stuck to trees with bayonets, bombings and other torturous killings. This is yet one more Hollywood film of revisionist history painting a happy face on communism. Fowler betrays his American friend into communist hands at the end of the movie. He had to know they would kill him though the film portrays Fowler as believing nothing would happen to him. He appears to have second thoughts about having done so; this is the film's way of keeping the pro communist painted as a good guy. But Fowler's second thoughts are not enough to warn him that the communists were about to kidnap him. His American friend winds up dead, killed by the Fowler's communist sympathizing assistant.The film was well made, good acting and a good story, except for the pro communist slant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disquiet on the eastern front.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine adaptation of the Graham Greene novel I read several years ago, "The Quiet American" gradually and tellingly unfurls its twin stories of early anti-Communist American intervention in Vietnam and a triangular love story between Michael Caine's cynical middle-aged English Times reporter, Brendan Fraser as the young, good-looking quiet- spoken American aid worker and Do Thi Hai Yen as Caine's native mistress.The story is told from Caine's character's viewpoint, he the jaded "Our Man In Vietnam", happily separated from his British wife by his job and whose easy existence sees him require to wire in only a few stories a year while keeping his young and beautiful ex-courtesan Phuong as his obedient and uncomplaining lover only for his world to fall apart the minute Fraser enters the scene. Meanwhile, a renegade general attempts to violently carve out a third force in the country and these two strands come together with telling implications for the three main characters.The stories draw the viewer in completely although the inevitability of the ending is signalled with the murder in the opening minutes triggering a long flashback leading back up to the bloody climax. Caine is very good as the jilted writer gone-to-seed but who has found a reason for living in his can't-believe-his-luck liaison with the beautiful Phuong. Brendan Fraser is surprisingly good as the title character torn between his duty to his country, his love for Phuong and his regard for Caine. Thai Yen as Phuong imparts a calm stillness and indeed stoicism, content it seems to use her looks to her best advantage to find a love that will take her out of the bordello run by her protective older sister and convinces the viewer of her capacity to make two very different men love her to distraction.This well-crafted movie tellingly embodies Greene's identifiable themes of guilt, betrayal and honour, with its central characters all trying to escape their trapped existences but who find themselves moved by great events and petty jealousies. Atmospherically filmed and strongly acted, it is one of the superior adaptations of a Greene novel you could hope to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine film with great acting by Caine and Fraser; much of it filmed on location</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine and Brendon Fraser have careers that seem somewhat similar. Both are very fine actors, but both have acted in their fair share of real bombs. But, among the bombs have also been some very fine films, and this is one of them.Michael Caine is superb here as a journalist covering Viet Nam during the French colonial period prior to Dien Bien Phu; he was nominated for an Academy Award for this performance, and deservedly so. Brendan Fraser is also excellent as an undercover CIA agent. Fraser falls in love with Caine's Vietnamese mistress (the beautiful Do Thi Hai Yen). So we have a love triangle, as well as an international affairs triangle. The relationship between Caine and Fraser is interesting -- friendly but wary. To tell you more would ruin the film -- this is one film where it's best to figure out what is really happening as you go.It's difficult to find much to criticize here. If it looks "real", it's because much of it was filmed in Vietnam.So, savor a fine film with fine performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film requires more than one view to pick up subtleties in the stories. The parallel story of a British reporter, Thomas Fowler, brilliantly portrayed by Michael Caine, his mistress Phuong (Do Thi Ha Yen), and her predicament, as well the overall quagmire that was Indo-China, American interference, and later Vietnam.It is filmed with illusory, tropical backdrops to a scene of hundreds of recently murdered citizens, noted "probably killed by just another faction" by a fellow war correspondent of Fowler's.The sets are realistic without being overwrought (i.e. Platoon). The story has a soft side to Caine's character and his love for Phuong, and the desires of an older man to find final happiness, in a sense. He remarks to Brendan Fraser (Alden Pyle, a US intelligence agent, posing as a physician treating Trychoma), that if he were to lose Phuong it would be the end of his life. The problem is his British wife is Catholic and refuses divorce. This would not be a very valid reason these days. Caine is excellent, giving a voice over finessed view of war torn Vietnam, the tragedies of staged bombings, and his impressions of what "the story behind the story" here is. The visuals are trans formative, and we see a new dictator, General The (secretly being funded by US ), who interviews with Fowler about his visions for a "new Vietnam" Neither the French Colonialists nor the Communists can "fix " it. So what then?.It is nice that this is left as an open ended question leaving the audience to have to THINK. Graham Greene is an excellent author and one must read the book which this film encapsulates. Highly recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine may be one of the most imitable actors around today, but you can always rely on him to deliver a class performance. Here, as a newspaper foreign affairs reporter, he risks losing the love of his life to a flash Yank, and being forced to quit the country he loves due to budget cuts, and you can see his understated pain in every syllable. Who'd have thought Brendan Fraser could act so well too... as the titular character, he befriends Caine while stealing his girl right under his nose, at a time when women in Vietnam were valued about as much as cattle. ALWAYS beware of the Quiet ones...We then get an in-depth look at American international political agendas, as they seek to place the people THEY want in charge across the world... and they're prepared to go to any methods to achieve it. The particular attempt noted in this film was a disaster though, and lead to the Vietnam War. Oops. Though this is a fictitious tale, parts are rooted in reality... I'm sure. When will they learn to keep their noses out?! As for the rest, it's a well shot, thought-provoking drama with undertones of tragedy.... But for who? 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful rendition of a great Graham Greene story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Greene writes so convincingly that tend to forget that he is a novelist. That is, he writes fiction, not history. His fiction here is that that the US involvement in Vietnam was based upon a CIA operation to murder Saigon civilians and lay the blame on the communists. But, historically speaking, US operations in Vietnam were based upon Washington's calculated policy that had its origins in JFK's pre- presidential Catholic Church support of France's crumbling hold on its Indo-China empire. It was a doomed venture that ignored Vietnam's long fear of China. Here was a Buddhist country, ruled by a Catholic-French supported aristocracy, the brightest star of French pre-WWII imperialism, battling a basically nationalistic, Communist dominated revolution that looked fearfully over its shoulders at their traditional enemy, China, and took no solace from the fact that China was now controlled by a Communist dictatorship. The fact that the US had a treaty with Vietnam was a meaningless excuse because that treaty had been reached with a French/Catholic government which everyone knew was doomed by the post-WWII world-wide drive against imperialism. The CIA in Vietnam, as it had become when JFK chickened out on the US planned Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, was simply JFK supporters' whipping boy, an excuse for his errors. The whole misadventure was intended to forestall his defeat in the post Bay of Pigs presidential election. But as the philosopher said, "He who does not understand history is doomed to repeat it."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the formation years of the Vietkong London Times reporter Thomas Fowler (the masterful Michael Caine) identifies the body of American entrepreneur Alden Plye (a welcome retreat from comedic roles by Brendan Fraser). This scene initiates the movie, which then transports us several months back in time, when Fowler leads his idyllic life in exile with a Vietnamese lover Phoung (Do Thi Hai Yen), always having time to chill with a cup of tea and newspaper in the local café. Intent on staying after his publisher hints at recalling him to England due to lack of stories Fowler decides to venture north in search of stories. This has him come face to face with supposed Vietkong atrocities, which in Fowler's eyes seem somewhat suspicious. When confronting himself with a general from Ngô &#x110;?nh Di&#x1ec7;m's regime, he finds himself threatened by death only to be saved by the 'quiet American' Alden Pyle. Alden, a thoughtful and soft-spoken individual, quickly befriends Fowler, but the situation slowly starts to come undone, when both become romantically involved with Phuong.Written as a tale of deceit and an attempt to introduce the darkening fate of the Vietnamese civil war. Naturally simplified from the extremely complex story by famed novelist Graham Greene "The Quiet American" is still a very satisfying movie, despite the flawed necessity to straighten out the loops in comparison to the novel. Written and placed before the descent of American troops onto Vietnamese soil, Greene delivered a poignant and surprisingly accurate portrayal of the times, owed to the fact that Greene worked as a war correspondent in 1951-1954, thus offering first hand knowledge and giving the US government a controversial subversive role in the civil war. Revolutionary at the times the story resounds ever stronger as the dark dealing of the American government in the so-called Third World has been revealed.The backdrop of a love triangle serves as a device over which the story is told, but also one not without significance, as the English-man attempts to save the status quo, even if that means shaking hands with the devil (moral dilemmas replicate themselves on a grander scale). Cynical and egotistical he is confronted with American idealism, but one far from the perceived innocence it proclaims. Michael Caine performs with conviction, subtly nuancing the sarcastic reporter, set in his ways and governed by a cynical distance to the outside ongoings, however still emotionally affected when confronted directly with pain and blood. Oppositely him Fraser does well as the affectionate American who mixes ignorance with high flying ideals, albeit simultaneously being much more flawed than outside appearances suggest. The romantic subplot of the novel dashes to the front, making it the backbone of the story, which does help the movie's narrative, but weakens its effectiveness making the political misgivings take a backseat to the affairs of the heart.Naturally the symbolism can be ventured further into: The Englishman represents the ageing disenchanted and thus cynical Europe, which is sure to leave Vietnam (Phuong) to her own fate, despite the proclaimed intent to stay. As he is unable to cut ties from his homeland, another pretender vies for the heart of lover - the quiet American. Young, well-intentioned, but mindlessly brutal he promises to replace the Englishman as protector, but at the same time is carried by misguided ideals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quiet American Is A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quiet American is a film adaptation of Graham Greene's bestselling novel of the same title. This version of the novel in contrast to the 1958 version, depicted Greene's original ending and treatment of the principal American character, Pyle. Like the novel, the film illustrates Pyle's moral culpability in fostering intrigue within the South Vietnamese government. Going beyond Greene's original work, the film used a montage ending with superimposed images of American soldiers from the intervening decades of the Vietnam War.It features starred Michael Caine, Brendan Fraser, and Do Thi Hai Yen; and is directed by Phillip Noyce.Thomas Fowler is a British journalist who in 1952 is covering the early stages of the war in Indo-China for the London Times, not a demanding assignment since few in England are especially interested in the conflict. When not filing occasional reports, Fowler spends his time with Phuong, a beautiful woman who shares lovemaking and opium with Fowler and is willing to accept the fact the married journalist will never make her his wife. Fowler becomes friendly with Alden Pyle, a cheerful and articulate if seemingly na?ve American who is in Saigon as part of a medical mission. As Fowler and Pyle develop a closer friendship, Pyle is introduced to Phuong, and the American soon becomes infatuated with her. When Fowler's editors suggest he return to London, he responds by digging himself deeper in covering the war, and Pyle attempts to take Phuong away; she soon rejects him. Undaunted, Pyle continues with his work, but Fowler discovers that medical help is not what the American is bringing to Vietnam. Pyle is in fact a CIA operative who is helping to organize and finance a "Third Force" who will battle Ho Chi Min's forces as well as the French and their allies. Fowler also learns that Pyle is behind a series of bombings which are believed to have been carried out by Communist extremists, and faces the ugly fact that his American friend is in fact a terrorist killing in the name of Uncle Sam's political interests.This is a smart and literate effort that despite some weaknesses in overall conception has one undeniable virtue: There's not a single weak scene.Added to that,it has great performances especially Michael Caine, whose portrayal as an English reporter goaded out of his comfortable, opium-clouded, ex-pat lifestyle ranks among the very best of his career.And also,the subtle and penetrating film made to look effortless as nothing is forced or pushed, so much so that it's easy to overlook the extraordinary challenges posed by Graham Greene's novel and it manages to capture its spirit.Overall,it may be a not especially unusual mystery/thriller, but it's still a solid and entertaining one at that.Indeed,it is a masterpiece and a must-see!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid political and romantic thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phillip Noyce's The Quiet American plays into his wheelhouse as a political thriller, but the more interesting aspect of it (on paper) is the love story centered at the middle of it. It's adapted from the Graham Greene novel of the same name and it feels as though it comes from another era. Taking place in Saigon in 1952, on the brink of the Vietnam War, the whole thing has this intriguing neo-noir tone as it boils down in the Vietnamese heat. We center on Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), a British reporter living in Saigon with Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen), his extramarital lover, when an American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) comes into their lives and shakes everything up. The two begin a classic game of vying for Phuong's affection, with a country falling apart in the background.It's an interesting set up and I think that Noyce was able to establish the perfect tone for it, feeling like the kind of noir romantic thriller that would have come right out of the time period. The running time is brief, clocking in at almost exactly 90 minutes, and so he doesn't waste any scenes, with each one providing something necessary for either plot progression or character development. It flies by at a smooth pace, never getting ahead of it's audience but never dragging or feeling like it's pandering either.Michael Caine guides the film as someone with his skill was born to do, taking the whole thing in his grasp and commanding every moment of it. He's in almost every scene and his presence was what drove the film the most, crafting a rich and empathetic character despite his seemingly detached emotional position when it comes to the political conflicts at hand. It's ultimately a story of a lost man, lost in country and in himself, having to look inside himself and discover the things that matter to him. There's a lot of development for his character throughout the picture and as we get into the final act it's fascinating to watch Caine unravel and peel back the layers of this man. It's the kind of performance from a veteran actor where you can truly feel the decades of this man's life being worn on every expression he makes and the way he holds himself. A very strong work from him, that unfortunately isn't quite matched by Fraser or Yen.Brendan Fraser does his best but he's just not a deep enough actor to handle the complexities of Pyle, although when the character is introduced as a naive piece of wood he fits the part to a tee. Yen is probably the biggest detractor of the film, because thanks to her dreadfully flat performance the whole romance angle doesn't work the way that it should have. Caine lifts the project up and Noyce does a good job of bleeding together the romantic plot with the larger political scope of it, but her performance drags it down a bit and kills a lot of the romance angle. Still, definitely a quality film overall thanks to a tremendous performance and some fine writing and directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quiet American is an enjoyable and intelligent film about Vietnam in the early 1950s. On the surface it can be viewed as a film about two men fighting over a girl, but it also provides an interesting commentary on post-war geopolitics. The film is set in 1952 when the threat of "world communism" became an obsession for many. Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is a cynical London Times correspondent based in Vietnam. Fowler is an older man, living with a beautiful young Vietnamese mistress called Phuong. Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) is a young, energetic, American idealist who befriends Fowler and later steals his girl. Fowler is jaded, lazy and selfish. He doesn't want to return to the UK. Pyle wants to rescue Phuong from what he considers to be a bleak future with Fowler. He offers marriage and Phuong accepts. She wants someone affluent to look after her. It's never clear whether she really cares about either Fowler or Pyle. The relationship and competition between Fowler and Pyle can be interpreted as a metaphor for the post-war relationship between the U.S. and the European colonial powers. Pyle considers French efforts to defeat the communists in Vietnam as ineffectual. He doesn't like the way the Europeans exploit their colonies and treat people like second class citizens in their own countries. Pyle wants the Europeans out of the way so that America can lead the struggle against the communists; he favors a Third Way. We eventually find out that Pyle is a senior CIA agent and the "Third Way" involves the U.S. putting its own thugs in charge. America's man is General Thé who commits two atrocities witnessed by Fowler, one in which women and children are killed. Pyle recognizes that the general is cruel and ruthless, but doesn't appreciate that backing violent thugs like the general is not in America's long term interests because it alienates the local population. Fowler doesn't approve of the carnage that develops and helps the communists to assassinate Pyle.The communists are viewed sympathetically, they are presented as nationalists who just want to get the foreigners out of their country. The film presents the case that the domino theory was wrong and the Vietnamese just wanted their country back. According to this film they supported the Russians because they funded their independence struggle. The problem was that pushing the Europeans out of their colonies left a vacuum leaving the U.S. to become the world's policeman. I don't know enough about Vietnam to know whether the movie is historically accurate or whether the CIA had a master plan for the country back in 1952. But it is an interesting and thought provoking film. The film revolves around the complex characters of Fowler and Pyle, Caine and Fraser do an excellent job in bringing the characters to life and making the film work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite Like the Experience of Reading Greene, But What Is?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie version of the Graham Greene novel "The Quiet American" seemed oddly out of place in 2002 for some reason. But it's a pretty good adaptation of one of Greene's lesser known works.Michael Caine is wonderful as an older, wearier spy who teams up with a young American in 1950s Vietnam, only to fall into a vicious mire of bitterness and jealousy as he begins to suspect that the American is stealing the heart of his beautiful -- and much younger -- native girlfriend. The film is much more plot driven than the novel, so it's not as rich an experience as reading Greene. But everyone involved, especially Caine, tries hard to get at the themes that make Greene's fiction so rewarding, and they could have done much worse.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine does his usual phenomenal job (an Oscar would have been well deserved), while Fraser on the other hand is totally miscast in my opinion, totally unbelievable as CIA station chief and in general as the complex character he plays. This to me is a major setback to this motion picture. Otherwise, the Director paints a very nice picture of Colonial Vietnam and Colonial life in general, aided by very good cinematography, a good screenplay, dialog, etc. All seems well, but 'that something' is missing that would make this a great movie. One important aspect of this film is that it is definitely politicized and very opinionated, yet it does this in a very intelligent, subtle way. Even though I do not agree with most of its political messages I have to admit they are woven into the tapestry of the film ingeniously. Good therefore, but definitely not great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was disappointing. The plot, concerning the murder of an American in 1950s Vietnam, seemed like it had a lot more potential than the resulting film. The historical backdrop was a pivotal moment in Vietnamese history, a time of declining French colonial power and emergent Communist influence. The fault doesn't lay in the technical aspects, as Christopher Doyle's cinematography and camera-work is typically rich and evocative, painting a dazzling picture of post WWII Saigon, Nor is it weakened by Michael Caine's turn as the cynical British journalist, yet another stellar and intense performance from this great actor. I think the film's weaknesses largely stem from the screenplay's overemphasis on the romantic subplot and the poor casting of the other leads. Unfortunately, these weaknesses compound each other.Brandon Fraser is bland and not up to the demands of his role and Do Thi Hai Yen as Phuong, the Vietnamese dance girl entangled in a romantic triangle with Fraser and Caine, gives an unconvincing turn to a character that was not well written to begin with. The end product is a decent film, but is frustrating because it feels rushed and compromised. I never read the Graham Greene source material, but its pointed critique on American foreign policy seems much toned down here. This movie was shelved by Miramax immediately after 9/11 and released at a later date. Could it have been edited due to fears for its commercial prospects? Who knows? But if a director's cut ever appears in the future, I would certainly revisit this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quiet American is a wonderful adaptation of the Graham Greene novel. Many worse adaptations have been made, and from many worse novels. This is a powerful, complex novel and yet the adaptation has revealed new plot lines and implications which only enrich the novel. I thought it was a fantastic film. Credit must be given primarily to Greene's wonderful novel, but significant credit must also be given to Christopher Schenkkan and Robert Hampton who adapted the novel-a daunting task but which they accomplished admirably. That the film retains the essential plot elements that identify it as a Greene novel but that it is also identifiably adapted-and well-only further endorse the screenplay adaptation. The film itself centers on the relationship between a veteran British reporter in Vietnam, Graham Fowler (the never better Michael Caine) and a seemingly na?ve American medical professional in Saigon, Alden Pyle (the excellent Brendan Fraser). It is set in 1952 when US involvement in the country was in its very early stages and France was the primary western power with colonial interest in Vietnam. In this context, Pyle meets Fowler and the two men use one another for their own professional ends while also developing a mutually respectful friendship. Pyle sees Fowler as a wise and informed source of information and Fowler sees Pyle as one of the more sophisticated, intelligent Americans in Saigon and as someone who will not afflict him with intolerable stories of supposed American derring-do. Pyle also finds Fowler's mistress Phuong (the gorgeous Do Thi Hai Yen) gorgeous and his interest in her throws an unexpected spanner in their relationship. Having watched the film but having not read the book, I am a little mystified as to the purpose of Phuong in the narrative. It doesn't seem to me that she has a particularly large role in the film and I'm not sure if I am underestimating her significance in the story as a whole or whether I her role is simply that which was depicted in the film. Perhaps she is to signify the agency of Vietnam and the fact that Vietnam has some control over her fate. Or not. I'm not sure. But I did find, and this might be more a question about the novel than about the film, that I wondered what Phuong's purpose was, overall, in the film. The film itself seems to be a critique of uninformed meddling by the United States (or any other ill-informed Western country) in other countries' affairs and really, I'm not sure what Phuong adds to the picture. That said, it is a fantastic film, splendidly bought to life by both primary actors, but particularly by Caine, whose Fowler seems to have seen it all and is skeptical of the doe-eyed idealism which Pyle betrays initially. Caine deserved an Oscar nomination and in a perfect world, this film would receive a best film nomination also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a disappointing film. The plot structure resembles in many ways Graham Greene's screenplay for The Third Man, but this script is not nearly as witty or gripping. Occasional humorous lines intended to lighten the atmosphere and offer some of Greene's characteristically dry satire fizzled and flopped, and the acting was uniformly stiff and ill-at-ease. The character of Phong is a travesty, too, as the plot seems to revolve around her, and all the men in the film talk about her as an actual human being, proclaiming their love for her, but she's presented with dialogue that makes her seem like nothing more than eye candy. Technically, the film must have been made in a ridiculous hurry... overuse of slow-mo techniques prolong scene endings that don't quite meet at the ends. There is a horribly saccharine coloration to the entire film that would imply the makers wanted an epic, atmospheric, landscaped look but just didn't have the patience. During the 15 minutes of rather compelling plot development, in the middle of the film, there is a battle scene that looks totally unbelievable... you can smell the fake smoke and feel the sound-stage plastic astroturf they are rolling on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without any doubt the best adaptation of a book to the cinema I've ever seen. It has been always frustrating to me to see a movie of any novel I've read before. Usually because the movie just scratch the surface of the story (and sometimes not even that). In the case of the Quiet American I saw the movie 10 or 15 years after I read the book and what I saw was exactly what I remembered, further more, what I felt reading the book was very close to what I felt when I saw the movie. I'm quite far away of being a fan of Mr Fraser, and I must say that the election of this actor for the role is perfect, and his performance accurate. The rest of the cast is perfect. When i say cast I mean from production to person who maybe just worked a day in the shot. A very different thing is what you may think about Mr Green's literature... personally, I like it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Quiet American' is the product of many years of observation and reflection originating from Graham Green's modern classic. The film version in which Michael Caine gives us another memorable interpretation captures this spirit of the story of Graham Greene with the added bonus of hind sight. Vietnam in the movie is a great metaphor of the sacrificial lamb,a story that goes back to biblical times and a concept at the center of Christianity, a religion to which Graham Greene himself was converted. The young Vietnamese(Dho Thi Hai Yen's Phuong) is Vietnam itself with its unbelievable beauty, The two contenders, the Quiet American (Brendan Fraser's Alden Pyle) and the Veteran Journalist (Michael Cain's Thomas Fowler)turn it into a country torn between two opposing forces, the forced modernization of the American and the traditional contemplative existence of the British. All these forces are weaved together by the excellent direction of Philip Noyce who as an Australian can afford the have a fresh look at events, from a country where the Vietnamese found refuge and a new life while fellow Vietnamese were caught in the relentless web of historical change with is political economic and human overtones. A truly rich experience to understand the fate of a country which in the Sixties stole the headlines of a million newspaper and the hearts of millions of young and old. The film exploits positively the natural beauty of the Vietnamese landscape and gives us also a love-triangle situation which adds to the layers of meanings the film possesses. I recommend this film to all those who want to lift their spirits in times when political change is threatened by violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Second, and arguably superior, screen adaptation of Graham Greene's fascinating, still pertinent novel about Western meddling in 50s Vietnam. Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser star The spirit of Graham Greene can rest slightly easier now. The British novelist was critical of Joseph L Mankiewicz's 1958 adaptation of his 1955 book for its more positive portrayal of the Americans. This 2002 adaptation may not be the most strident political movie, but it make a far more reasonable appraisal of Greene's themes and the US involvement in Vietnam at the end of the French colonial period. And, of course, the critique of US foreign policy remains pertinent. It's 1952. The story starts with the body of the titular American being fished out of Saigon River. British journalist Thomas Fowler (Caine) identifies the body of his "friend". But who was this man? Fowler's narration takes the action back several months to the arrival of Alden Pyle (Fraser), working for the American Economic Mission, who naively hopes to make a difference in the war-torn country (France is fighting the Communists). The two men become friends, despite their jarring ideologies - the cynical Brit saying, "I am just a reporter, I never get involved", the earnest Yank later saying, "It's not that easy to remain uninvolved." One thing they share, however, is love of Phuong (Yen), "the most beautiful girl in Saigon" and Fowler's mistress. When Pyle falls for her, the men vie, the younger man saying, "I want to protect her". This mirrors the US attitude toward Vietnam, to essentially take possession of it for its own good.American policy is to surreptitiously back General Thé (Hai) and his breakaway army, who provide a "third force", a force that is neither French nor Communist. Yet when General Thé's forces let off a bomb in Saigon Square ("30 dead. Probably 20 more by the morning"), it becomes clear that this approach is mistaken. It's this image of ordinary people dying or in agony as a direct result of US policy that makes the film particularly problematic for Americans. But why shouldn't mainstream cinema be critical? Why can't it deal with difficult subjects? The film - a US/German co-production, directed by an Australian - contains numerous lines that either provide a premonition of what America would get into in Vietnam or comment on US foreign policy at large: Pyle saying "It's like a test run for us" and "We're not colonialists", or Fowler's colleague Hinh (Tzi Ma) saying "Never underestimate a patriot." The film, of course, has an agenda different to that of Greene or Mankiewicz. Although it doesn't shy away from the problems of US foreign policy, it's also a fine piece of entertainment. Caine just gets better with age, while Fraser's amiable demeanour suits his role. It's also finely crafted. Like director Noyce's other 2002 film Rabbit-Proof Fence it's shot by master cinematographer Christopher Doyle. Although born in Australia, much of Doyle's career has been in Hong Kong and China; he therefore has the ability to balance the western vision of Vietnam as exotic with a more realistic sense of 50s life in a vibrant but messed up Asian society.Verdict A sumptuous, well-acted and, perhaps most importantly, thought-provoking look at how Western foreign policy - however well-meaning - can wreak havoc in other cultures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phillip Noyce should have been nominated for an Academy Award for his direction of this movie. From the opening shot, you are in a master's hands as he guides you slowly, inexorably, into the beginnings of the American/Vietnam war. The actors' subtle characterizations are superb, as is the photography and the music. These are complex, conflicted characters.But it is the director's touch that stays in my mind. Each scene is a little jewel. Some of the tiniest details tell you everything about a particular character -- without a word being spoken. I want to immediately watch this again to see what I missed the first time.

Yes, possess: I really saw little emotional love expressed.The backdrop was the decaying years of French Colonialsm in Vietnam and this was handled with skill by the cast and crew. The dynamics between the male protagonists blended well with the fighting but totally overshadowed the potential that the women could have had.Nevertheless, it was good drama and another notch in Phllip Noyce's achievements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a quiet, albeit gripping film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a string of questionable popcorn flicks (including what Anthony Lane refers to as the first Hollywood film that makes absolutely no sense), Phillip Noyce returned to his native Australia for two out-of-the-blue features in 2002. While it's hard to judge between this film and Rabbit Proof Fence, it is an honor to see him dedicating his efforts outside of tripe like the Bone Collector. The Quiet American, originally scheduled for release around the time when certain disasters were shaking the nation that Miramax is based in. Fortunately, the delayed release came at an apt time- when Afghanistan, a country in which none of the September 11th hijackers came from, was having its civilian population decimated and little quagmire called Iraq was causing murmurs in the press. What could be a more subversive movie then than this little innocuous thriller based on 1950's Graham Greene novel in which a British Journalist declares no national identity and, despite attempts to steer clear of involvement in the conflicts arising around him, becomes forced to choose a side. The result is like some twisted Casablanca, with no moral boundary left unquestioned. The story flies across the screen breezily with a grace rarely duplicated in films of this magnitude (and by that, i mean small films). Noyce has used his Hollywood training well to bring a mesmerizing and enticing charm to a feature that does very much with the very understated. Michael Caine excels of course and Brandon Fraser's acting screams that he, like Thomas Fowler, choose a side and either revise his moronic encino man role in a thousand kiddie flicks or go the art-house end and showcase the genuine talent he can bring to a screen.my only real problem is that (as unfortunately tends to be the case in films where two males vie for one female) the character of Phuong is criminally underdeveloped. As an object of desire, she's easily instantly attractive and a plausible source of the two men's lust. But her physical beauty is never outshined by any specific niceties or overwhelming personality traits.It seems that her reserved character disallows the audience from painting a full picture of the women to whom the men lose themselves in behind closed doors. However, in a story that is at least partly about intimacy and respectful affection (and not, surprisingly enough competition), this is an unforgivable sin. Not egregious enough to suggest that you should miss this film by any means, but as a general concern for the diminishing leading roles available to women in the film industry (maybe Noyce felt he could let the strong young girls of rabbit proof fence compensate for this).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are among those who saw Audie Murphy in the 1958 version of Graham Green's novel, you may notice that this 2002 film comes a tad closer to Greene's tale of CIA meddling in Vietnam in the days before the full scale war erupted. True, the French are already fully engaged with Vietnamese rebels, but the U.S. is just beginning to poke its nose in. Even so, this film involves us more with the love story triangle than with the ongoing rebellion. Aging British reporter and young, engaging CIA agent masquerading as a doctor vie for lovely Phuong, who seems to have her eye on the main chance. The openly anti-american sentiment of the novel is toned down considerably, but there is implied criticism of the CIA guy's fiddling around with a "third force" ploy and playing footsie with a loose cannon self promoted "general" The. Film shows excellent production values against what looks like real Vietnam locations. Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser shine as the "burnt out" foreign correspondent, who wants mainly to enjoy his mistress and his opium pipe, and the young CIA agent with big ideas. As for Do Thi Hai Yen, who plays the lovely Phuong, you can see why every male in viewing distance has a "yen" for her! As is usual in most modern films, the editing is only barely acceptable. Spasmodic might describe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quiet American is an unassuming little film, compelling some people to think that its boring. It is, in fact, anything but boring. It tells the tale of a woman caught between two men, which in itself is merely a plot contrivance comparing Vietnam to a woman caught between two lovers. In fact, the script has one of the main characters explaining this very fact. The acting is outstanding - Michael Caine is in top-form and Brendan Fraser delivers a career-best performance. The two main leads are so believable that the lines between "good guy" and "bad guy" are blurred. All we're left with are two flawed characters trying to make the best of a bad situation which they find themselves in. They're both such gentlemen that one finds oneself empathising with each character which is extraordinary in an age where movies clearly define the "good guy" and the villain. An outstanding film, one that I can wholeheartedly recommend.</fullReview>

I guess Brandon Fraser's character, Pyle, really did love Phoung, but I'm still not sure if he just wasn't using it as an excuse to keep seeing Fowler and using him to report stories. But the ending didn't make a lot of sense because it didn't explain who the people were that killed Pyle and why. And why was Fowler involved in setting it up. One thing's for sure, Phoung didn't seem to really care that Pyle was dead.FINAL VERDICT: Not the tightest script. It was OK, but the story gets convulated toward the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good movie that takes place during that gray time 'tween the exit of the French from Vietnam, but just before America enters in significant scale. A time when certain small groups were 'consulting' with the Vietnamese. Michael Caine is perfect in the role of the English reporter based in Vietnam, who has settled into his role of the dissolute ex-patriot who has a stable, comfortable life and is easing his way along to retirement. Into his world comes an increasing level of violence due to the turmoil of the vietnamese situation. Also into his world comes a fresh, young, seemingly idealistic and naive boy-man from america, come to do medical aide work. This young man is respectful and appears to admire the englishman, a hard combination to refuse. Michael Caine's character is drawn to this young man and he befriends him, opening up his world and his personal life. But very soon, small things cause Caine to sit up and take notice.... An attempt is made on his own life, but comes to naught due to the young american's interference and apparent ability. Also, his personal life has become a quagmire. His boss is requiring him to return to England, his mistress's sister is cold-bloodedly shopping for a better deal for her sister, his hated wife back in England wont cooperate in a divorce and now the new American friend has come to him to say that he loves the mistress and wants to take her back to America! What is a man to do? Well, you do what you have to. Especially if you find out that the idealistic young man isnt what you thought he was. Especially if you find out he really isnt naive at all, speaks vietnamese like a native, is an agent of a foreign power and is trafficking in explosives that are being used as terrorist weapons. How easily the decision is made. How rapidly the rationalization is adopted. How lucky for the englishman that there is someone to do the dirty work of removing his rival.I really enjoyed this movie. Michael Caine, although not a personal favorite, really nailed the character. Brendan Frasier's character is a hard one to achieve.... first so unable to deal with life in a foreign country, then totally adept, but having to be believable in both guises. He does a pretty good job, but in the end, its not that important as Caine's performance overshadows everyone else's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this *is* essentially an amalgamation of love, politics, and war rolled into one, but it's set during a time where war was prominent in everyone's lives. Michael Caine, in the performance of his life for which he should have won an oscar, plays Thomas Fowler, an English journalist based in Saigon, Vietnam, in the period preceding full-scale war in the country. He's there to report on all events for the London Times, but has also fallen in love with a native girl he cannot marry due to his wife's refusal to grant him a divorce. Enter Pyle, effectively portrayed by Brendon Fraser. He's there as part of an international economic aid fund, and falls in love with Fowler's mistress, after Pyle and Fowler meet by chance and become acquainted. The story is well directed, and shows off each actor's abilities very well indeed, while never allowing the performances to supercede the narrative.It is not strictly a love story at all, and uses understated moments to convey the harsh realities of a country at war, and the political and military factions which fight amongst themselves for control.It is very difficult to sum the movie up, but suffice to say it's an excellent excercise in professionalism in film-making, with polish evident throughout.Never boring, never slow, it is a deep and powerful story, and worth viewing.</fullReview>

I hope this is a sign that he's going to start being more selective about his roles instead of making easy money in rubbish like Miss Congeniality and Austin Powers 3.The Quiet American is an exercise in professionalism. The story is tight yet fluid, the atmosphere is ominous but never smothering, and the action scenes serve a genuine purpose. There are some flaws, however. Ambiguous though Alden Pyle is supposed to be, we need to know more about him as his fate is curiously unaffecting. I haven't read the source novel, so perhaps this accurately reflects Graham Greene's intentions. In any case, I'm not being unfair by saying that it doesn't help the film.The other weakness is Do Thi Hai Yen, who doesn't have enough natural luminosity to overcome her acting shortcomings. Again, I'm not being unfair - her character is pivotal to the story and the movie required a much more competent actress than she.Still, I learned something and rediscovered my respect for Michael Caine.

		<shortDescription>Graham Greene's novel of America's quiet imperialism comes to life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an outstanding adaptation of Graham Greene's novel about an American spy, Alden Pyle, during the latter stages of the French occupation of Vietnam. Much of the story is told from the perspective of an English reporter, Thomas Fowler, who is part of a love triangle with Pyle and a lovely Vietnamese girl, Phuong.Michael Caine is excellent in the role of Fowler. He has just the right touch of worldly cynicism Graham Greene intended. Brendan Fraser is the eager beaver American out to save the world from communism. The title of the movie comes from Pyle's adapted persona of an unassuming aid worker sent to fight disease in Vietnam (he's really there to set up an anti-communist force to replace the French). Fowler's pessimism clashes with Pyle's altruism as they argue over the girl and what is to become of the country.There are many sides to this story and all is not what it seems. Fowler is the older cynic and Pyle the benevolent young man, yet it is Fowler who best understands Phuong. He loves her and wants to be with her forever; Pyle wants to bundle her off and take her back to Boston to be an American.Pyle talks about saving the Vietnamese from communism, yet it is he who supplies the nationalist forces with plastic explosives which are used to kill many innocent people in Saigon. And it is Fowler who is horrified by the death and mayhem and who stoops down to assist those who are dying in the street. Both men make choices about what they think is right, and one of them has to die in the end.Nicely photographed and very well acted by the three principals. Michael Caine is just as accomplished an actor now as he was four decades ago when he starred in "Alfie" and the Harry Palmer films. You can see in his eyes and hear in his voice the internal struggles going on over what to do about Phuong and Pyle. Brendan Fraser turns in a steady performance, and Do Thi Hai Yen is absolutely charming as the young girl in the middle.Highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent movie- such a rarity these days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this wonderful film made me reflect upon the death of intelligent mainstream cinema. Philip Noyce, Michael Caine, Brendan Fraiser, lust, intrique, suspense, and the adaption of a classic novel by a master stroyteller. Where's it end up? At your local Art House. Something is so wrong with Hollywood these days. I read where Clint Eastwood's "Mystic River" had trouble getting financing. $30 million the damned film cost and it wasn't a hot commodity. But hey,no problem greenlighting a $60 million sequel to Daddy Day Care. I like an occasional comic book film or Bruckheimer opus as much as the other guy, but I like an occasional such film amongst smart comedies, clever thrillers and character driven dramas, not a steady diet of sequels with either no story, or the same story as their predecessors. It's been five years since "American Beauty" won best picture. I bet that it wouldn't get much beyond the art houses ( though it would do well there) if it were released today. So what's on tap for the rest of this year? Oscar buzz for "The Last Samurai". Hey I liked "Braveheart", I loved "Gladiator". Cruise's Japanese Braveheart is going against "The Alamo" which is destined to lose money. The only real intelligent sounding film for the mainstream audience on slate this winter is "The Human Stain", but there's more art houses than ever out there so I guess I'll quit my bitching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a fan of Michael Caine in the past. Having said that, I have found that Caine has made some excellent films in later life, which I have enjoyed very much, this being one of them. The Quiet American is an example of classy moviemaking, with understated performances and superior production values. This thoughtful and stimulating film is a jewel in the midst of the constant junk that we are fed from Hollywood. At 90 minutes, it is compact and does not overstay its welcome, something which cannot be said for many films recently.If you enjoy good quality films, then catch this. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Noyce Renaissance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smart, literate, and compelling adaptation of Graham Greene's novel about romance and political intrigue amongst the colonial French, indifferent British, gung-ho Americans, and fractured Vietnamese during the early years of that tragic conflict. The film is highlighted by taut yet straightforward direction from Noyce (you don't want to believe this is the same guy who directed "Sliver") and Michael Caine's Oscar caliber performance as the agnostic/neutral British reporter caught in a love triangle that serves as a metaphor for the war against Communism in Vietnam. Viewed in tandem with "Rabbit Proof Fence" (a compelling true story about atrocities against Aboriginal children in Australia that was released at virtually the same time here in the States) the two films can be viewed as the Noyce Renaissance.This would make a great double feature with Lars Von Trier's hauntingly bleak WWII thriller, "Zentropa" (aka "Europa") as it deals with many of the same themes (the futility of trying to remain neutral in the face of conflict and tragedy, how we are all forced to take sides, and how religion plays a part in war). In the end, Caine's character laments, "I just wish I had somebody to say I am sorry to." Even those without faith, without a side cry out in the end. The world is a dark, ambiguous place, and this film shows how we all desire things to be cut and dry, good and evil, when in the end it's all relative and we are left only with our own broken dreams of a perfect world that never was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful anti-Hollywood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the many thoughts that passed through my mind as I watched this gem of a movie was how poorly it would be commented on by the younger generation brought up on The Hulk and The Matrix-films that rely on special effects to keep people in their seats. Noyce's The Quiet American is the antithesis of these movie monsters and I thought the whole film was terrific. I'm not familiar with his work except for his small masterpiece, Rabbit Proof Fence but to see him work with something completely different and about as far away from out-back Australia as you could get was an indication of the depth and breadth of his directorial expertise.There have been a number of movies set in post colonial Asia and I freely admit that I have loved them all. I was lucky enough to visit Southeast Asia as a tourist in the early '70s and Noyce's superb camera work involving shot selection, angles and lighting direction made this film languid, rich and immensely enticing visually.Based as it was on a Graham Green novel the viewer knows immediately that the film's plot will be superb. Having said that, I can easily see why the film had to be pulled after September 11th because of American box office resistance-the movie was too tough for viewers. I'm glad that it's re-release was greeted better the second time because it is a beautifully made film and deserves wide and full appreciation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me this movie had it all. First Michael Caine is at his best as an jaded but principled reporter caught up in the turmoil and tragedy of Viet Nam during the defeat of the French and the dirty tricks of the CIA. His love for a much younger Vietnamese woman also transcends the norm and is wonderfully portrayed. The direction and cinematography are also outstanding. Brendan Fraser as the CIA agent sincere but ideologicaly flawed is also excellent. This film probably did not get the broad exposure it deserved in the US in the light of 9/11 and Gulf War and the accurate ugly American interference it so tellingly reveals.</fullReview>

I read Graham Greene's provocative novel many years ago and can understand perhaps why the book was not made into a movie until now. It arrived at a time when the subject of French Indo-China/Viet Nam was a very sensitive one, particularly America's involvement in SE Asian affairs. The remarkable aspect of the book and the movie is that it is so relevant yet today. Kudos to the producers of this excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumph for Caine . . . and Fraser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Greene's 1956 novel The Quiet American appeared soon after France abandoned colonial control of Vietnam but before the U.S. war effort escalated to stop the spread of Communism in that country. Nearly a half century later, director Phillip Noyce adapts this story of love and betrayal in Saigon in a powerful, moving film anchored by superb casting.. Saigon in 1952 was the outpost of the waning French empire. An insurgent movement in north Vietnam was pushing the French closer to defeat at Dien Bien Phu two years later. But Saigon has become home to London Times correspondent Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine). Fowler is a decent man, but disengaged. The war is less important to him than staying with Phuong (Do Thi Han Yen), a beauty he met in a dance hall. A telegram that threatens to recall him to London disturbs his quiet life, as does Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), a young American ostensibly on a U.S.-sponsored medical mission. The screenplay by Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkan turns on Fowler's effort to stay put and on Pyle's sudden infatuation with Phuong. Because Fowler's wife in England won't divorce him, he can't offer marriage. But Pyle can. Fowler tries to uncover the truth about a massacre to buy time with London. His suspicion points to an upstart Vietnamese general, supported by unknown sources, who is driving a wedge between Viet Minh insurgents and the French. And clues hint that Pyle is involved. Romance and politics become entangled as Fowler realizes that to keep his woman, he must get rid of Pyle, a man whose good-natured innocence he can't help but like. Fowler is the center of Noyce's film. As in the novel, he tells the story in flashback from the discovery of Pyle's body in the Saigon river to Fowler's first encounter with the young American. Michael Caine gives Fowler his special seedy authority, an Englishman who has found a home where rules bred in the bone don't necessarily apply. This is a role Caine perfected long ago, starting with The Ipcress File (1965), which caught his character in a similar clash between loyalties. Much older than Harry Palmer in that film, but almost as cheeky, Caine plays Fowler as a man who knows life is running out but hopes to hold on to what little savor it has left. The increasing complexity of the Vietnam conflict forces him into moral ambiguities familiar to admirers of Graham Greene. Just as convincing, but more surprising, is Brendan Fraser as Pyle. Blocky, big-shouldered, and wearing horn-rim glasses, Fraser is an unexpected choice for Greene's quiet American. Yet this actor can traverse the distance between self-effacement (Gods and Monsters) and formula self-importance (The Mummy). Caine's portrayal was nominated for an Oscar and other awards, but Fraser deserves notice too. The Quiet American was filmed once before (1958) with Audie Murphy in the title role. Greene was reportedly furious because this version suppressed the novel's anticipatory indictment of America's chosen role in Vietnam. Noyce's version gains power from a half century of hindsight, imaged in a morose closing montage of newspaper articles over Fowler's byline about the ensuing American war. That hindsight and the need to invent a plot arc for a character-driven story forces Noyce to fashion a suspense thriller closer in spirit to Greene's `entertainments' (his term) than to his serious novels. This is no criticism of Noyce; many Greene `entertainments,' like The Third Man and Our Man in Havana became memorable movies. One welcome change enhances the importance of Phuong, who is little more than a cipher in the novel, and Do Thi Han Yen invests the role with passion and complexity. The director and star have run the gamut from psychological dramas to simple potboilers. Noyce debuted with Deep Calm and recently directed Rabbit-Proof Fence. Along the way he helmed The Saint, The Bone Collector, and other forgettables. Highs and lows punctuate Caine's roster of roles. This is another high. The Quiet American joins two mature talents in an emotionally subtle film that showcases their special skills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evokes the Prelude to the Tragedy of Vietnam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed that this film did not fare so well with the under-18 crowd, and for good reason: they haven't a clue as to the politics of the period ("Vietnam, a French colony?") and what was to come. While many viewers may see it primarily as a love story set against a tropically exotic political backdrop, the story has a terrible historical resonance for its prescience of what was to come. It is the tale of Americans, who, with their deadly mix of self-righteous idealism and ignorance of the outside world, end up running roughshod over the "little people" of other countries, with horrific consequences at home and abroad. I'm not sure that Brendan Fraser was a good choice to convey this characterological mix (someone like Edward Norton would have expressed better the intelligence and missionary zeal), but the story is powerful enough to carry him. Perhaps the implications of the choice made by Fowler were also unsettling to an American audience: the inevitability of choosing sides when you're in the middle of the fray and the realization that that decision can leave you with blood on your hands. But while there was no way to avoid bloodshed in French Indo-China in the '50s given France's commitment to Empire, it still wasn't too late for the US to avoid sliding into the imperial politics that led to slaughter in Vietnam, Guatemala, Chile, Nicaragua, Iraq, et al. And for us today it is the knowledge of what was in store for the people of Vietnam and for America that gives this film its wallop and brought me to tears.</fullReview>

Caine, on the other hand, has already decided the outcome of this duel. Phoung is his and he will be quite ruthless in his methods to keep her. He lies to Phoung and betrays Fraser to his death.In the pre War Story; Michael Caine is the perfect gentleman. He reports the truth behind what he sees, not blaming neither the communists, nor the French, as he feels the cruelties is in neither of theeses interest. Fraser, on the other hand, has already decided the outcome of this conflict; America must join the war, and he is quite ruthless in his means to accomplish this. Killing innocent sivilians blaming it on the Russians. Caine wins this battle between the two of them as he wins the truth.In both stories the gentleman wins. And looses. Cause in the end, Fraser is killed and Caine gets the girl. The media blames the cruelties on the Russians and Fraser gets his war.</fullReview>

In my opinion if they can't make a movie as good as this one, they shouldn't make it.

		<fullReview>This movie flows smoothly. It all seems simple, until well into the movie you realize that the plot is quite involved. The story is typical Greene - a love triangle played out against a political background. This movie makes points that are particularly relevant to our involvement in the current Iraq war.The on-location Viet Nam scenes are totally realistic. So many times in movies scenes on a city street seem staged. You can almost hear the director telling the extras where and how to walk, and the props seem to have just been painted. In this movie you could well believe that you had stepped back to 1950s Viet Nam.Of course Michael Caine's performance is one of his best - completely unforced and natural.I suspect that those who lived through the Viet Nam era in the U.S. will find this movie more involving than those who did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right off, I liked Michael Caine more than I liked the rest of the movie, with the exception of the man who played his assistant (Tzi Ma?) whose role, when you think about it, is fascinating. Though Roger Ebert, whom I respect, gave it four stars, I'd be closer to three. I thought the direction was jumpy, clumsy, and even annoying. Like a snapshot photographer, the movie takes lots of pictures, but they aren't well seen.I also thought Brendan Frazer's character was just getting interesting, when suddenly - whap, it's the end of the movie. Drat. I would have liked to have seen thirty more minutes.But "The Quiet American" did make me think of unintended consequences, and how wars have many more surprises than any military strategist can plan. Which in light of the Iraq war is sobering indeed. I read a report today that to encourage and train his troops, Saddam Hussein has distributed copies of "Black Hawk Down." I dearly pray that it doesn't become that. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>if one is to remain human."The faces of politics/war easily suffocate us as individuals. However, as we so often try and "run" from conflict...in the end human nature takes over and forces us to react.Phillip Noyce (director) and Christopher Hampton (screen writer) carefully craft Graham Greene's novel, "The Quiet American", into a tremendously rich film of love, war, politics, power and seduction. Noyce subtly uses the beautiful landscape of Vietnam to set an enigmatic tone from the outset of the film. Michael Caine, one of the greatest actors of his generation, is absolutely flawless in the lead role and Brendan Fraser is brilliant as Alden Pyle..a.k.a "The Quiet American." Fraser proves once again, that given a powerful script and a strong actor to support him ("Gods and Monsters") his talent as an actor blossoms. Fraser all too often makes poor film choices ("Monkeybone", "Dudley Do-Right" and "George of the Jungle"), but then again Caine too had his faults (Jaws: The Revenge"). We must not concentrate so much on a person's mistakes, but must admire them for their achievements.Caine and Fraser work brilliantly together in this film set against the backdrop of the French occupation of Vietnam, and the beginning of the U.S. interest in the area because of the threat of Communism.Michael Caine undoubtedly deserved his nomination-nod for Best Actor as he tenderly portrays a man so desperately in love, but not necessarily deep in lust. His love for a woman, a friend, a wife, a land, and a cause are all at the focal point of the film, and all are tested on several occasions."The Quiet American" is one of the best films of the year!For more top-notch work from Phillip Noyce in 2002 I recommend "Rabbit-Proof Fence". An epic-tale of determination, and what the heart, of even little children, can accomplish.</fullReview>

Michael Caine gives an exquisite performance as Fowler--I could not have imagined anyone else in that role. It is really too bad that the film was so overshadowed by the current (2002/2003) state of the world; that and its low box office returns make it impossible for Caine's performance to be truly recognized. Phillip Noyce also does a wonderful job of capturing the sort of sense of atmosphere that is characteristic of Greene's novels.

Through the really moving acting by Michael Caine and some of the supporting roles, we encounter small people that are making small choices and thus create history. The only thing I liked less was the narration in the movie. I think this tool is used to often to hold movies together, and in this case at least it's unnecessary.

I think that the extremes of dynamic range in some movies now days, some blasting your eardrums, others unintelligible, shows directors acting like many scientists - if you can do it, do it (whether it's cloning, building a nuclear bomb, or making movies with extreme sound dynamics).

		<fullReview>Caine is perfect as the disaffected British journalist in Saigon during the 1950's. Brendan Fraser is wonderfully three dimensional as the American who is more than he at first appears. As the plot develops (in typically languid Greene style), the tension builds between the main characters, until the last half hour, which moves at a comparatively breakneck speed to its conclusion. The atmosphere is certainly reminiscent of "The Year Of Living Dangerously", but this is not a bad thing. One might even think it was all an opium hallucination. Considering we are seeing it all from the vantage point of Caine's character who is, in fact, an opium addict, this is entirely appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been wanting to see this movie since I heard it was in production, and I finally did recently. Excellent film, but be forewarned if you're expecting an action/war flick: not to be found here. The pacing is very slow, but that's not necessarily a complaint. Lots of long (as in time-wise) shots, slow pans, etc., but the scenery and colours are all rather striking, so it works well. I'll keep it short, but Michael Caine turns in a wonderful performance...oscar-worthy in my opinion. On the other hand, Brendan Fraser is his usual dorky self, but it fits with his naive, misguided character. So, basically, see it if you can...not sure what kind of release it had stateside, due to the subject matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is nothing quiet in the heart that desires a love as unforgettable as a mistress'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised. Michael Caine played the role of the aging lover with dignity. Brendan Fraser isn't known for his dramatic strengths but he should; I thought that he was fabulous opposite Ian McKellan in Gods and Monsters. Initially when we meet him, we think that he is a charming innocent who is in sinful Saigon, about to lose his innocence in the face of beauty and corruption. He falls for Phuong and quite awkwardly seeks to win her from Fowler. What makes Pyle dangerous is his seeming charm and innocence. His gentle manner masks a dark agenda that includes backing a murderous, narcissistic general. The audience recognizes that his love for Phuong is not genuine; it is what she represents that is seductive and desirable. The actual person is unimportant. As an allegory, this story totally works. There is one scene where she has come under his protection and begins to dress differently in a sexy contemporary American style. She has rejected the traditional silk dresses that respectable women in her culture wear. Pyle promises that he will never leave her as other Westerners do with their Asian lovers. But hindsight in history is 20/20 and we know that this scene foreshadows what America will do when it must abandon its Indochina interests and beat a humiliating retreat back home.I know that many have seen this film as being anti-American. Yes, there is indeed a strong subtext that rings loudly, especially given the current political climate. Still, go see the film and see it for the story of how obsessive love weakens and implodes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one nice thing that I like about Michael Caine's acting in this film and others is that I never feel that I am watching Michael Caine but more importantly a good actor in a good role.The film is good yet I walked away with a sense that it was more of a book read than a film view. There was something absent on at the end yet not necessarily missing, yet still missing. I don't know what I wanted to know.I praise the use of episodic lighting / brightness / colors and their lack of intensity to set an emphasis in the story segments. I mean, this is a rare cinematic experience to see the dark of night in an eerie countryside setting, and as a viewer I cannot sense what is out there other than in slight movement that is perhaps imaginary. It is absolute dark and dank. That use of lighting was refreshing since I always get p***ed at night scenes lit by mega-candlepower lamps on wet pavement or trees or buildings in the background with typical Hollywood productions.This is a good movie, but needs another half-hour added. But perhaps, I should just read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie and I must say that it was very enjoyable. Michael Caine is undoubtedly a great actor and though this might not be his best performance, it is certainly high up on the list. Even Brendan Fraser delivers a great performance that I never knew he could pull off. His role in conjunction with that of the lead actress cements this movie as one to remember. This is a movie that utilises a great plot, some amazing writing by Graham Greene and a very straightforward directorial style to get its message across about a war and time that is usually polluted with strong opinions and unnecessary violence when portrayed by Hollywood. Thoroughly enjoyable and recommended as a sophisticated and thought provoking movie to watch.Rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

But he has fallen in love with awoman half his age- he can't marry her because his wife won'tgive him a divorce. This isn't really a problem until he meets 'theQuiet American'- Brendan Fraser in one of the best performancesof his career. Fraser's character of Alden Pyle falls in love withFowler's girlfriend- and then we find that Pyle is not who heseems. Suspense and thrills abound in this wonderful film.Recommended- see it for Caine alone. 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philip Noyce's cinematic surfing between human relations and politics ends up dilluting itself in manichaean political concepts and lacks human intensity to reach the soul of the character's drama.Beautifully shot, with an extraordinary performance from Brendan Frazier, which brilliantly makes the transition between a supposedly naive scientist with a human heart, to a shrewd manipulating spy, and an apt performance by Michael Caine, the movie is narrated in a very conventional way, having probably too much respect for its source, the Graham Greene novel of the same title, ending up as a cold, extremely quiet rendition of a literary text, devoid of visual impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, quite simply, a superb movie. Few films have been put together better or presented more exquisitely. Yes, you have to pay attention and think. If you don't like to do that, go see something else. But thinking is well rewarded here, and you will probably be thinking more about this movie later in bed, and possibly the next day. I have read one Greene book, Brighton Rock. It was expertly written, and this book probably was, too. The movie certainly gives you the feeling it was. As for the idea often posted here that Americans will be offended and reject the film because of its content, that is naive. America is the land of the free. We learn about Vietnam as a complicated affair and question our country's role there in our college--and high school--history classes. Sorry, we are the greatest nation on the planet, and we aren't going to hide from the facts. As for who the good guys are and who the bad guys are in this movie, it isn't all that simple, and if you think it is, think again. Certainly Caine's character is complicated, and should not be viewed as anything less. Also, Fraser does an outstanding job here, despite misleading reviews on this site suggesting he does not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quiet Movie In A Loud Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brendan Fraser gets a great role, playing against type. Michael Caine is solid as usual in this character-driven movie about relationships, deceit, betrayal, and war. The Quiet American is in some ways a predictable piece but it is done with good pacing and sufficient intrigue without becoming just another action thriller. The focus remains on murder, on human emotions, and on ethical decisions that must be made if one is to remain human. A somewhat liberal-tilting movie with an American-isk ending - it becomes an indictment against war and the illicit means by which we attempt to control it. It is also about love and how we go about trying to get it and keep it, acknowledge, commit to it. The nature of the movie, however, doesn't seem to rise up to the level of contemporary popularity that can translate into Academy Award winning best actor like a movie like reconciling growing older "About Schimdt," or the more horrific World War II "The Pianist," or even the more zany antics of "Adaptation." "Gangs of New York" even has the epic feel of a historic period that has been overlooked by most of America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, a happy ending for a man, a dreary prospectus for two countries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until a few minutes ago I did not realise that THE QUIET AMERICAN was a "remake," which would under-estimate its quality. Had I known that the Greene story and film had been from the 1950s (!), I would have viewed it through a different filter.On the 60 MINUTES interview with Caine because of his elevation to the peerage, there was comment about how he had to pull teeth to have THE QUIET AMERICAN issued in the U.S. perhaps a year after showings else-where. It is easy to see why. Americans do not take lightly the role of villian -- and especially willing participants in what the story depicts. When Americans have been the heavy, the justification has always been, "It was forced upon us." The closing scenes would naturally have been impossible in antediluvian 1958.Regarding Caine, Ed Bradley's asinine question, "How have you managed aging? (promptly switched off in contempt) has some meaning. Michael Caine plays an older man -- and one alien to his class origin -- with finesse. Gone is the glamour boy, the tough guy. One is drawn to this long of tooth, not terribly successful newspaperman. He is also the world-weary European, the culture that for forty years has seen it all, and much too much, suffering the rise of a new force self-confident to the point of arrogance in the person of the attractive, "quiet," and duplicitous American.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film. But What Are We Going to Do About Brendan Fraser?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine's performance is terrific, as those of most of the rest of the cast. I left this picture feeling troubled by its content (which is good) but unsatisfied with the film (which, of course, is bad.)But all-in-all it is a far far better film than most and definitely worth seeing. Its story and tone are wonderful.As I've thought about it, I believe the trouble I have comes down to Brendan Fraser, who is an actor I always want to enjoy but rarely do. For me, there is often something "wrong" about him in films. I believe he is a decent actor and one who tries hard, but there is some quality about his presence on screen and his often rubbery face that seems to make it difficult for "Brendan Fraser" to disappear into a character. I also feel that Fraser was probably miscast, although I think that mistake was an easy one to make. His style and affect differ have a significantly different quality from Caine's --- I want to say that Fraser is a more "cartoon"-like actor, but I don't mean it in a derogatory way. I think that there are certain "types" of acting styles that don't often work well together in the same picture. For instance, say...Jack Nicholson and Robin Williams. Or Judy Dench and Frances McDormand. They are actors who seem to exist in different acting universes. I've always thought that this is one reason you often see the same sets of actors in each other's films. One of the career problems that Fraser may have, when you look over the odd selection of roles he's played and the fact that he hasn't yet "come into his own" may be the fact that he straddles a line in this regard and does not yet fit comfortably in a particular set of actors.(Perhaps some Spoiler-ish discussion follows)The problem Fraser presents for the film is that his open-faced bonhomie immediately comes across (when set in a 1950's Saigon) as insincere, suspicious and, most notably, uncharacteristic of someone who might be termed "The Quiet American." Certainly he contrasts with the craven ugly-Americanness of the drunken reporter stereotype we see in the Bill Granger(?) character. But as played by Fraser, Pyle, while not a lout, still comes across as the most stereotypical of brash and bold Americans abroad, full of themselves and the purported ability they and their country have to appear as a prince on a white horse to save the world. Pyle's white suit only underscores this point. (An aside: Seeing a world full of white suits and pressed shirts and pristine delicate dresses worn by people who must negotiate a city full of grime and sweat and heat is, I think, the quickest way to make me remember I'm watching a movie.)It is sort of fun to play the "who should better have been cast as Pyle" game at this point. My nominees include Colin Farrell, Matt Damon (though I'm not the biggest fan) or Christian Bale (but I'm still thinking.) I think they're all actors who carry a little more ambiguity with them.Finally, I believe that Noyce did not do an adequate job of interweaving the emotional connection between the insurgency story line and the Phuong storyline. Again, I feel like I want to lay this at the feet of Pyle/Fraser. While the contrast between Fowler's pain and attempts at ironic detachment were well portrayed, I was not left with a similar sense or understanding of Pyle's emotional dilemma, which of course, is meant to parallel Fowler's, since in his professional role in Saigon, Pyle is at least as detached from his emotional life as Fowler is, but clearly has taken on an unexpected and complicating emotional element in Phuong, that we see only as a sort of college-boy crush. Is there any question that it would be just as difficult for Pyle to bring home a Vietnamese wife to 1950's America as it would for Fowler to bring Phoung home to London? Would someone in Pyle's professional role (again, in the 1950's,if not today) be so free and easy about marrying a woman from a country to which he has been assigned? Perhaps the reality for Pyle is that Phuong would ultimately be abandoned. But that set of issues seems left in the dust and Greene's attempt to draw parallels and contrasts between Fowler and Pyle's emotional and professional lives is, thereby, given short shrift.Having said all that, I note that only great movies are worth thinking about to this degree. I want to remind the reader who has gotten this far, that I think it was a great movie...well worth seeing.</fullReview>

What the picture does is project an objective view of the underhanded tactics political Machiavellians employ, and how they justify it within their own structure of beliefs. But it is more than that- it is an exploration of morality, the morality of Pyle versus that of Fowler, each capable of great heroism and great betrayal, motivated by different reasons. Without giving too much away, it is worth noting that the viewer is left at the end questioning the ethics of both men, who view the world in very different ways yet somehow manage to maintain a genuine friendship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saul Landau wrote in CounterPunch (www.counterpunch.org/landau1224.html): `Miramax film exec Harvey Weinstein quietly yanked The Quiet American from the market, despite the good reviews it had gleaned.'So since this seemed to be a case of censorship, I had to see it! Given the politically prudish times we live in it may be that film producers don't want to suggest that Americans could possibly be the bad guys. ?The Quiet American' does have reference to this, e.g., arming unsavory generals, fomenting massacres for propaganda purposes, terrorizing the population for political ends? So what? This has been known all along. Furthermore, the US has done equally disgusting things in Chile, Angola, Indonesia, ? hey, the list is actually quite long! Given that the political use of violence is not the principal theme of the film one wonders what other censorship takes place.About the film: Acting by Michael Caine is very good. Acting by Brendan Fraser is so-so. Do Thi Hai Yen plays the role of the innocent appealing beauty very well, but obviously knows more about her situation than is revealed in the film ? her sister may just as well have been her pimp.The screenplay is not entirely true to the novel on which it is based. The film may focus too much on the love affair of the main actors, perhaps downplaying the context that is emphasized in the book. The film is half a murder plot to get rid of the unwanted competition as much as it is about the unsavory machinations of the not-so quiet American. The book places more emphasis on the latter.Worth seeing? Yes, specially, if one wants to know how easily offended the new self-appointed political censors are. My rating 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timely examination of moral complexity of foreign wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the French-occupied Vietnam of 1952, this is based on the 1955 novel by left-wing British novelist Graham Green and is a remake of the Mankiewicz anti-communist film issued in 1957. Coming out towards the end of 2002 as the United States prepares for a major confrontation with Iraq, this new version, directed by Australian Phillip Noyce, is not likely to appeal much to traditional Right-wing American sentiment and indeed the very limited release in the States means that few Americans will see it. But it is a compelling work which - unlike so much Hollywood fare - makes clear the moral complexity of one country intervening in the affairs of another and explores the origins of America's most serious foreign policy blunder.Brendan Fraser is good as the eponymous aid worker whose life turns out to be somewhat less quiescent than at first appears. Do Hai Yen is beautiful as the Vietnamese girl who sees him as a route to the West. But it is Michael Caine, as the "Times" foreign correspondent Thomas Fowler, who is wonderful as the initially indolent, self-serving ex-pat who finds that, as he learns more about his new world, he has to make a moral and difficult choice. The film gains much by being shot on Vietnamese locations, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) and the excellent soundtrack complements well the atmosphere of exoticism and danger.</fullReview>

Forget the claptrap about this being an anti-American piece; it is a piece about the unanticipated consequences of actions in domestic, political and geopolitical situations. Graham Greene understood and interpreted these issues brilliantly and the film conveys that meaning extremely well. One of the best films of 2002, even if it was really made in/for 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine in perfect role, Brendan Fraser also very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other comments in this section already give a pretty complete picture of the politics and historical context of this film. Michael Caine's performance is absolutely top-notch in a role that's perfect for him, and Brendan Fraser shows again that he is much more versatile than many younger American actors. The lack of substance to the role of Phuong is reflected in the book, as well... it just isn't that meaty of a role; a flaw in the story but not attributable to the production, directing, or acting.This is one of the most compelling movies of the year. The mysterious darkness of the Vietnam countryside at night is captured most effectively... probably the best movie about Vietnam since Apocalypse Now.I am curious why the Michael Redgrave (Fowler)/ Audie Murphy (Pyle) 1958 version isn't available in the U.S. on video... it would be very interesting to be able to compare them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece, but important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Minor Spoilers)This is a very respectable adaption of Graham Greene's terrific book. I read the book while actually in Saigon and I have to say that no film can even begin to match the experience of reading that haunting novel while having the sights, sounds, smells of Saigon all around to kick one's imaginative faculties into high gear. One gets to have the sensual experience as well as Greene's unblunted prophetic intelligence all in one go.This film is not bad as a second choice, however. Caine's performance, while not exactly Oscar material (i.e., the calibre of great artistes such as Halle "Big Boob Bond Babe" Barry), is still highly accomplished as acting, if anybody still cares about that rather moribund craft. Brendan Fraser masterfully handles the transition from well-meaning oaf to duplicitious covert operative. While this film doesn't earn any especially high marks as cinema (I was rather disappointed by the lackluster cinematography of Chris Doyle, from whom one would expect a little bit more), it does have the merit of being very faithful to Greene's very important (now more than ever) text.I fail to understand why Miramax is so terrified of putting this film into general release. They only put it into limited release (a two week run in LA and NY) because Caine put pressure on them so that he would have shot at an Oscar. It's amazing the degree to which media self-censorship has progressed. When Greene's book was released in the mid-fifties in the States (the mid-fifties! Remember, that supposedly oppressive time?) it actually became a best seller, and the book is far more critical of the US than this film is. I went to see a Wednesday night showing of the film in Times Square in a medium-sized auditorium that was practically filled. Many people WANT to see this film. Harvey Weinstein says the film is "unpatriotic." Gee, why didn't he think of that when he bought it, well before Sept. 11? What, did Donald Rumsfeld call and threaten to bust his kneecaps? Right now voices like that represented by this film need to be injected into the (currently nonexistent) public debate on US foreign policy and intervention. The only people who will hear THIS particular voice now, however, are those who live in NY or LA and have the presence of mind to run out and see it before it's unceremoniously yanked. Everyone else will have to wait until it comes out on video (too little, too late).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an impressive film! The ambiguities and incongruities (two men in love with the same woman becoming friends) are true to the spirit of the splendid Graham Greene novel and make for a challenging experience. We tend to want everything clear-cut and tidy, but that isn't actual. Michael Caine gives another bravura performance, inhabiting his character. He IS Thomas Fowler, a British ex-patriot journalist in Vietnam in the 50's. A remarkable and very moving characterization. Brendan Fraser does the best he can with the title role, but alas he isn't the right man for the part. He doesn't carry the sense of careful duplicity and self-righteousness needed to be convincing, considering the mission of his character.And then we come to the woman in the story. Alluringly beautiful Do Thi Hai Yen plays Fowler's mistress Phuong (which translates as "phoenix"...a metaphor for Vietnam itself?). Lovely as she is her character is a vacuous young woman, given to reading movie magazines and focusing her life around men. This may be a true depiction of women in Vietnam in that era...but I doubt it. She is an object, playing a pivotal part in the film, but in a totally passive way. Feminists would have a hard time with this one.Visually (the language of film), it offers the viewer a treat. Saigon at night, the mysterious dark and the close-ups of Michael Caine's expressive face give the experience a richness that lingers.Despite my criticisms, the movie is an amazingly affecting one, and an important statement about the American role in the horrors in Vietnam, before our actual military participation. Very timely stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Quiet American" is going to make some Americans mad. Because of that, it probably won't get the recognition it deserves at Oscar time. But at this point in real time, with America poised to go to war against Iraq at the drop of a hate, this is a film every America should see.Ostensibly, this second screen adaptation of the 1955 Graham Greene novel is a love triangle set in an exotic locale, Saigon in 1952 when Indochina was France's problem and America was supposedly nothing more than an interested observer.In short, it's a story about a jaded, opium using British journalist who essentially has been doing as little work as possible, then suddenly finds that if he doesn't start filing some dispatches soon,he is going to be called home to London by his paper. That makes him unhappy, since he'll have to give up his fetching Vietnamese mistress. And to complicate things still further, an idealistic young American aid mission employee shows up, falls in love with the Englishman's girl on the spot, and poses a strong risk of taking her away from him.But what's underneath all this is the behind the scenes political jockeying for control of Vietnam. It's a three sided fight between the French, the Communists and military free booters who are backed by the United States. Before long, it becomes clear that the "Quiet American" is really in Saigon to do a lot more than bring better eye care to the Vietnamese. Directed by Australian veteran Philip Noyce, this is a beautifully shot, wonderfully paced film that rivets your attention on the screen almost from the first frame. A lot of that has to do with the acting of Michael Caine. He turns in a strong, if slightly understated performance as a man fighting to hold on to the only thing of value he has in life, a girl half his age.Brendan Frazer is also good as the all American boy who seems so sincere in the beginning that he's too good to be true.And Do Thi Hai Yen seems perfect as the girl caught between them. And the interesting thing about her character as filmed by Noyce is this. She is no angel. In fact, she in many ways seems to symbolize Vietnam itself. She's just trying to cut the best deal she can.This film was shelved for a year because of 9-11. Now it's in theaters in limited release and hopefully will go wider soon. It's a movie with a lot to say and without giving too much away, I'll hint at the message. Americans, who have grown extremely skeptical about what their government tells them here at home, should not make the mistake of thinking it never lies about its activities overseas.To me one of the great mysteries of 9-11 is how, in the year since the tragedy, the FBI and CIA, two much maligned agencies that had almost become the butt of jokes, could suddenly be looked upon as our best friends when they failed to prevent the attack in the first place.This movie says there may be other attacks these agencies also failed to prevent, and not by accident, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Best of 2002 (or 2001 since its been shelved for so long). I saw "The Quite American" at the 2002 25th Denver International Film Festival and all I can say is wow! Excellent direction by Phillip Noyce, gret script and a cast in top form. "The Quite American" is a rare film in todays movie market that actually has a story to tell, an interesting plot that keeps you guessing from the moment it begins to the shocking ending and characters that have a life and are not just cardboard. "The Quite American" is at once a spohisticated drama of political intrigue, a murder mustery and a love story all set to the back drop of the coming Vietnam war. This film is based on a Graham Green novel, and its well know he felt the 1958 version was watered down. Micahel Caine (in another Oscar worthy role) plays Thomas Fowler a British foreign correspondent and Alden Pyle (Brremdan Fraser) is an American aid worker (or is he?) who is both frighteningly sure he knows right from wrong in a morally ambigous situation. This film was shelved by "Miramax Films" back in 2001 and has never see the lght of day. A very powerfulll film that opens alot of doors filled with questions on right and wrong and our stand as Americans against war. I think "Miramax" was just scared to put this films in theaters since they are afarid themselves of people having an open mind and asking the very same questions themselves what is truly right or worng in today's changing world. A truly must see for anyone that wants an intelligent and moving story. Well worth the $8.00 to see.</fullReview>

Add to the mix that the cinematographer may never have come as close to achieving the visions in his and the director's heads, and you get the picture. Hopefully you will all see this picture soon, too.A faultless interpretation of an important text on one level, Phillip Noyce's remarkable film transcends it's roots to strike a resonance with with today's social, economic and political climates. Never has a film been quite so stark in revealing where America has gone so awry. Noyce manages to achieve this without histrionics, sentimentality or exploitation. Fraser, have no fear, has underlying menace to spare whilst Caine is world-weary, loveable and detestable all at once. Underneath the conflict in Indo-China lies a story of a love a whisper away, not quite tangible but as overpowering as the plastic explosive planted in a Saigon square in the film's most revealing moment.At last, this year produces a film truly for our times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't quite pull it off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very commendable that someone should attempt this film, taken from a great book by Graham Greene, who foresaw and warned of America's futile involvement in Vietnam. The book was first filmed in 1958 by the great Joseph Mankiewicz, who much to Greene's displeasure reversed the basic premise in the characters of the British journalist and the American do gooder. In this remake they stick to the book, which has the "quiet american" in fact be an undercover agent supporting a despot general. A timely film to remind people of interventionist policies. It is a shame therefore to have to say that the film is served by a poor script, not even near the class of the 58 version, and a very miscast Michael Caine, even though he was made to be the baddie of the piece, Michael Redgrave's performance as the jaded, cynical and world weary journalist had such pathos and emotion you really did feel for him. Still by today's standard, this film is to be welcomed as it does cover grown up themes, alongside the political element the story follows the love triangle, between the two men and an elegant and beautiful Vietnamese woman. The very critically underrated Brendan Fraser is equal to maybe even better than Audie Murphy in the original. Ian Mcekellan would have been a better choice for Fowler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Greene adaptation worthy of accolades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A finer adaptation you won't see of Graham Greene's "The Quiet American", a novel set in 1952 about a journalist named Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) who meets Pyle (Brendan Fraser), an American who idealistically arrives in Vietnam to aid a Third Force which will allow the U.S. a method of infiltrating the government and assert their influence in Vietnam.The film is not only a faithful rendering of the literary material, ingenious in the manner it constructs and combines scenes and uses quite a bit of Greene's actual dialogue; it is a visual splendor, using evocative scenery and taking advantage of on-sight locations (it was actually filmed in Vietnam!) to provide a gaze into both the tranquil, the corrupted, and the soon-to-be disturbed (the scene in the square is very effectively staged).But one of the most essential elements in the film is the pitch-perfect performances of the two leads, who have both (no hyperbole here) never been better. Michael Caine inhabits the body, mind and temporal neutrality of Fowler like he was always meant to step into this character, and Brendan Fraser, to my great surprise, was entirely effective as Pyle, a clean-cut York Harding ideologist who is completely deluded to the Third Force and as a result develops apathy towards any innocent victims that might be sacrificed to assert the U.S. influence in Vietnam.At the moment I can't find an American release date (I saw it in Toronto), but this is certainly one of the best films I've seen this year and cannot recommend it more highly. The director, Phillip Noyce, has achieved a great triumph (simultaneously with another gem of a film, Rabbit-Proof Fence).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destructive Idealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During my childhood in the 1960s there was a strip cartoon in one of my comics called "Texas Ted; Big Hat, Big Head". The title character was a loud-mouthed, boastful Texan who always wore a Stetson hat and was constantly proclaiming the superiority of all things American to his meek little bowler-hatted English cousin. The last frame of the cartoon generally showed Ted being cut down to size in some way or another.This stereotype of Americans as loud, brash and arrogant was quite a common one in Britain in the fifties and sixties; it appears less frequently today, not so much because we have changed our opinions of Americans but because we no longer define ourselves so much as quiet, reserved and modest. The title of Graham Greene's novel "The Quiet American" was probably a subtle reference to this stereotypical view. The "quiet American" of the title, Alden Pyle, is a thoughtful, soft-spoken, idealistic intellectual, yet his well-intentioned idealism is in the long run to prove destructive.When Greene's novel came out in 1955 it was widely criticised in the US as being anti-American, although in the light of what was to occur during the Vietnam War Greene's criticism of American involvement in Indochina might today seem prescient. When the novel was filmed by Joseph Mankiewicz in 1958 he reversed its emphasis, making it anti-Communist rather than anti-American and making Pyle the hero of the story, with the result that Greene angrily disowned the film.The 2002 version of "The Quiet American" is closer to Greene's original. The story is set in Saigon, Vietnam, in 1952, towards the end of French colonial rule. It is both a political drama and a personal one. The personal element involves a love-triangle between Pyle, a British journalist named Thomas Fowler and Fowler's beautiful Vietnamese mistress Phuong. Fowler is unable to marry Phuong because he is already married; he is separated from his wife, who still lives in England, but she refuses to give him a divorce because of her Catholic religion. (This is the only part which religion plays in the film. Unusually for a Greene story, none of the major characters is a Catholic). Unlike Fowler, Pyle can offer Phuong marriage and stability, and he succeeds in winning her affections, thus making an enemy of Fowler even though the two were once friends.The political element in the drama derives from the attempts of Pyle, who is working for American Intelligence, to set up a "Third Force" in Vietnam to take on both the French colonialists and the Vietnamese Communists who had hitherto provided most of the opposition to French rule. There is a sharp contrast drawn between Pyle and Fowler on both a personal and a political level. Personally Pyle is sensitive and idealistic whereas Fowler is jaded, cynical and prepared to use underhand methods to get what he wants. (One thing they have in common is that both are sincerely in love with Phuong). On a political level, however, Pyle is unable to see that General Thé, the leader of the Third Force, is a ruthless megalomaniac with ambitions to become a dictator, and is prepared to turn a blind eye to the terrorist methods used by Thé's militia. Fowler, however, is clear-eyed enough to see that American support for Thé is likely to prove disastrous.The difference between the two films lies in the difference between the political climate of 1958 and that of 2002. In the fifties, during the Cold War, it would have been unthinkable for Hollywood to have produced a film which was seen as pro-Communist or which criticised American foreign policy. Today, it would be almost equally unthinkable for Hollywood to produce a film which argued that American involvement in the Vietnam War was justified either politically or morally. Yet what Pyle is trying to do is not in principle objectionable; the Vietnamese people deserved more than a choice between remaining a de jure colony of France or becoming a de facto colony of Stalinist Russia, and some sort of third force would have been needed to give democracy a chance to work in the country. The tragedy of the war was that, the Americans never really tried to foster Vietnamese democracy but relied too much on authoritarian and often corrupt strongmen like Ngo Dinh Diem, to whom the 1958 film is dedicated.Sir Michael Caine clearly has an affinity with Greene's work, as he gave a very good performance in "The Honorary Consul" in 1983 and gives another very good one here, brings out all the contradictory aspects of Fowler's character. (The film brought him the most recent of his six Oscar nominations). I did, however, think that, at 69, Caine was rather too old for the role, as Fowler is probably supposed to be about fifty at the most. (The film ends with a montage of Vietnam War newspaper headlines, all with Fowler's byline, implying that he was still working for his newspaper a decade and a half after the events shown in this film).I was less impressed with the other performances. Phuong seemed too passive a character, although the fault lay perhaps with the scriptwriter rather than the actress Do Thi Hai Yen, and Brendan Fraser (never my favourite actor) seemed unable to convey either Pyle's suspect idealism or his passion for Phuong. Overall, however, the film works well, on both the political and psychological levels. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching quite a few movies lately. I was disappointed in There Will Be Blood, more so with 3:10 to Yuma, and so on. Then I watch a movie I'd never heard of called The Quiet American. Since then I find myself returning to this movie. Comparing the merits of others in comparison. When my friends ask me if I can recommend something to them. When I think of the movies I've seen over the years. I return to this movie.Set in the period when transition was bringing American forces into Vietnam as the French withdrew, it was something I knew little about up until then. I always enjoy when a film educates and this one got me interested in researching the actual events in more detail on the net.But none of this is it. What this movie does is present a moving story of the lives of those affected during this time. It gave us Vietnamese, British, and American characters who were all too human, and allowed us to identify with each of their predicaments. And Michael Caine, both narrating and starring in this movie, in my opinion did some of the best work I've ever seen him do. With strong support from the rest of the cast, beautiful photography which showed us both the beauty of Vietnam, and the ruin that war causes.So I could go in depth with everything I liked about this movie. Could go on for quite a while. But my best advice is simply to watch it. To be drawn into a story and have it resonate with you for a long period after, is, after all is said and done, one of the highest compliments one can offer.Thanks to Mr. Caine and everyone else involved.If the highest purpose of movie making it to tell a story, and do it well, this succeeds and then some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps. Perhaps only Americans buy a map of the road to failure and follow the curves of its route precisely to the very end. Perhaps not. American viewers above a certain age may bring passionate emotions and unwavering opinions to The Quiet American. That will be too bad. Maybe even in spite of director Phillip Noyce's intention, this movie is not about the war in Indochina. It gives us a glimpse into that time, condemns, it seems, the incipient American presence, and denounces, apparently, wars of colonial conquest, but all these things merely provide a context in which the lead characters have to make, or evade, moral decisions. Stepping carefully into Viet-Nam the way one of Fenimore Cooper's leather stocking heroes stepped into the tracks of their enemies so as to leave no trace, the US insinuated itself into the French-Indochina war for the purpose of . . . well, the purpose is never quite clear. Walking, almost sleepwalking, through events in Viet-Nam is British reporter Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), who also lacks purpose. Besotted by whiskey, opium and a fetching young woman, Fowler has made his own peace with war as well as with life. He is no James Bond, preferring one specific drink but many different women. In fact, he has it the other way round. He wants one woman, Phuong (Do Hai Yen), but any drink will do. He is also no Humphrey Bogart trying to mind his own business by running a popular bar. Instead, he tries to have no business at all. He has neglected, almost forgotten, his London newspaper employer. An aging libertine, he only fitfully and half-heartedly partakes of his self-indulgences, pursuing them as if reluctantly following doctor's orders. He has long since come to his own terms with the war, such as they are, whose sporadic noise in the streets of Saigon annoys him from time to time, but it is nothing more to him than the barking of a neighbor's dog. In fact, it turns out, dogs annoy him more than the war does.Then into his complacent world steps one of those leather stocking heroes, the "quiet" American, Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser). Young, congenial, modest, courteous, sober, knightly, even "Boy Scoutly," Pyle comes to Viet-Nam bringing medical aid and supplies for the Vietnamese people and a belief in freedom. He annoys the French for some reason, seems to know everybody who matters, and befriends (or is it the other way round?) Fowler. Then, almost immediately, he falls in love with Phuong, Fowler's mistress, apparently for no other reason than that Fowler seems to love her. True to some kind of misguided Victorian code, he requests in a peculiar way Fowler's permission to court her.Pyle does not forget his mission. Very quickly he learns to distinguish between the sound of the backfiring of a car and the sound of a detonation of a grenade. Old-hand Fowler grins in triumph to see him learn the difference.The viewer of the movie must make even finer distinctions. Author Graham Greene did not shy away from making political or moral judgments, nor does the movie. However, the viewer has no easy time deciding just what judgment should be made. All we have to go on seems to be the fact that the grand sweep of conflict depends most decisively on the moral decisions of individuals. From some decisions come certain results: people will die. The question is, do you want people to die, and if you do, why? There are other questions. Do native women who shun common prostitution come off any better sleeping with married men? Should men who want and love children embrace the need to kill them? Can civilized men and women who abandon morality be depended upon to defend humanity from barbarity?By movie's end we are left with men and women most of whom are, however congenial and however civilized, too distasteful to face and too dangerous to turn our backs on. Both in the movie and beyond it, the major powers continue to engage the rest of the world. As they must, if only because the rest of the world will not let them disengage. Not being in positions of world leadership, most of us, we the viewers must content ourselves with observing the Fowlers and Pyles and Phuongs around us and deciding what decisions we would make in their place.Would we do better? Perhaps, though what is better?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Graham Greene's novel, Phillip Noyce's The Quiet American is must-see for anyone who wants to be engaged, delighted, riveted, and haunted. It is a great, conjuring act of melodrama, suspense, and even romance. At a time when any filmmaker can engage us on a purely facile level, Noyce is fair and gentle, cutting no corners. Every dramatic moment is earned gracefully. It follows Michael Caine as Thomas Fowler, a journalist living in Saigon in 1952, when the conflict between America and Vietnam is just beginning. He meets an American (the 'quiet American', that is) named Alden Pyle (Brendan Frasier), an idealistic aid worker, and becomes friends with him. Their relationship becomes more complicated (for the worse) stemming from Pyle falling in love with Fowler's mistress Phuong (Hai Yen) and other revelations that I would have to be deranged to reveal. The film uses this story as a jumping off point and becomes a questioning of America's involvement in Vietnam. While Pyle is representative of America at the beginning of the war, Noyce never tries to be blunt about this; this is a film that can be enjoyed on the level of a human drama if one is oblivious to the political undertones. It can also be enjoyed as an ode to Vietnam, the beautiful country looking all the more beautiful with the help of the lush cinematography by Christopher Doyle, Huu Tuang Nguyen, and Dat Quang. Also more than worth mentioning is the resounding score by Craig Armstrong. Michael Caine and Brendan Frasier both have the quality of being wonderful while making us wonder just why they are so wonderful. There are no powerhouse moments or big dramatic speeches (a scene where Caine starts crying is done realistically rather than artificially dramatically). There are in scenes of interesting and provocative chatter and, in these scenes, Frasier and Caine are true to their characters while being absolutely gripping. By the end of the film, we have been swept off our feat by godlike, grandly small-scale drama. This is a masterpiece and Phillip Noyce, Michael Caine, Brendan Frasier, Hai Yen, Christopher Doyle, Huu Tuang, Dan Quang, and Craig Armstrong are all masters, of style, drama, melodrama, wit, and romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine turns in another terrific performance in this pretty good film that was a novel by the great Graham Greene. Foreign intrigue, politics, love, lust, lies, and of course the core of his stories, human ethics. No real surprises in the script but while I watched this film I was reminded of how underrated Brendan Fraser is as an actor. He does his share of bad Hollywood junk but every once in a while he pops up in a film that reminds us of how good he is (Remember Gods and Monsters?). Phillip Noyce directs and he did another good film last year called "Rabbit Proof Fence" so it looks like Noyce is just getting better even though he was already considered an excellent director. Noyce creates great atmosphere here and its reminiscent of "The Year of Living Dangerously". The only flaw for me is that Caine is about 70 years old and he does some things a man of his age just cannot do! But thats just nit-picking because Caine is just terrific and it would be hard to imagine another actor in the role. Caine deserves his Oscar nomination for this interesting and very well made film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leaving aside the historical baggage, this is a pretty good film in its own right. Because it is closer to Graham Greene's original novel it has more of its defects eg the weak portrayal of some of the Vietnamese characters, particularly the doll-like Phuong, who becomes both Fowler and Pyle's lover, and the rather melodramatic plot, recycled from one of Greene's early novels. But Michael Caine as the cynical old English journalist Fowler and Brendan Fraser as the idealistic and ruthless American Pyle are a great pairing and will hold your attention throughout.Michael Caine is often accused of always being the same in his movies. Here, his Fowler has a touch of the Billingsgate accent, but Caine gives us such a careful and measured performance that the man from Billingsgate really does seem to be the Saigon correspondent of that pillar of the English establishment, `The Times.' Brendan Fraser's previous record as a portrayer of buffoons (George of the Jungle etc) is cast aside, and he looks and sounds exactly right as the crusading and ultimately dangerous Pyle. Incidentally, Pyle is not based on Colonel Ed Lansdale, who had not been to Vietnam by the time Greene visited. Although some characteristics are taken from people Greene met, Pyle is a true literary creation, and all the more universal for it. If you want to understand the name, think `pain in the bum.' I also liked Tzi Ma as Fowler's assistant Hinh, he with the contacts in some pretty scary places. He has one of the best lines in the movie: `You become human when you decide what side you are on.'The `end of an era' atmosphere is terrific ? the House of 500 Women, the taxi-dancing club, the twittering French and American wives in the verandah cafe of the Hotel Continental, the glistening harbour at night. Phil Noyce got full co-operation from the present Vietnamese government (and used a large skilled Vietnamese crew) and the location shooting is all one could wish for. The death and destruction portrayed is gut-wrenchingly realistic.I read somewhere that Phil Noyce claims the only book available for sale in the Ho Chi Minh museum in Hanoi apart from Ho's autobiography is `the Quiet American.' The irony here is that Greene did indeed manage to interview Ho for the `Sunday Times' in the early 1950s but he also sent a full report on the encounter to his old employers, MI6. Greene's sympathies tended to be a little divided. If you wish to explore Greeneland a little further I recommend Michael Shelden's `The Man Within' Heinemann 1994. If you just want an engrossing and intriguing story this film has it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, haunting film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful, haunting adaptation of Graham Greene's novel and, in the faithfulness of its adaptation of Graham Greene's predictions, a remarkable indictment of the U.S.'s involvement in VietNam (although also carrying the novel's failing through with it). Michael Caine is an indolent British reporter stringing out his term in pre-U.S. VietNam as long as possible. He falls in love with a young woman, which impels him to do a bit more work to justify prolonging his stay. As he is drawn in, he discovers that all is not as it seems. What is left out (as was in the novel, written by a lapsed Catholic) is the role the Roman Catholic Church played in U.S. interference in VietNam, the suicide protests of Buddhist monks, the attempt to install a Roman Catholic top dog on a Buddhist country that could have recovered from the Communist-French conflict left to its own devices. But much of that came later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love drama films. I like films that can really make me just go "oh my god". A good drama film in my opinion has to have a realistic storyline that really grasps us. This film does more than an excellent job of doing that. Michael Caine is to be fair washed out to the younger generation, as a young person myself I wasn't expecting much from this film. I was expecting a drama film which gave us something to laugh at. I was so wrong about that, yes there are a few laughable times but nearly every bit of the film just kept me wondering what was going to happen next and I liked that. I think it was a very well made film and I'm glad I watched it. I felt attached to the film and the whole ending was really well performed. The innocence of the actors feelings amazed me.

		<fullReview>It's 1952 Saigon in French colony Vietnam. Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is a world-weary British ex-pat reporter in love with the country. Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser)'s dead body is found. Inspector Vigot interviews Fowler about the "quiet American" working for the Economic Aid Mission. Fowler doesn't want to return to his unhappy marriage and has a young Vietnamese girlfriend named Phuong. In flashback, Fowler befriends new eager Alden Pyle and travel up north to do a story.This is based on the Graham Greene novel. Michael Caine inhabits his role completely. Brendan Fraser is great at being an American political zealot. The only problem is a lack of intensity coming from the Vietnamese actress. The movie has a compelling sense of place and time. It's a great story of murky morality and absolute conviction in the two lead characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Graham Greene's 'The Quiet American' is wonderful evocation of Saigon and Vietnam during the French War. The story revolves around Mr. Fowler, a cynical British journalist, and Pyle a young American idealist both of whom are in love with Phuong, a young Vietnamese woman. Unfortunately, the film is a bitter disappointment. Greene's deftly crafted canvas has been brazenly mis-handled with the film applying impatient and ill-defined strokes.'The Quiet American' uses the love triangle as the focal point of the story when it should have been rather more focal on the political and personal intrigue within the book. The film is certainly a commercial one, dumbing down the themes and spoon feeding the audience. I was even let down by the production values, as it did not transfer the lavish and brooding atmosphere in Greene's work. The romance is not creditable and the characters are vastly under developed and malnourished. The film does not spend enough time in any one place and this is probably its biggest fault.Maybe I am prejudice by my memory of the book but the film is way off-key, poorly conceived and mis-aligned with Greene's words. If the purpose of the film was to capture the book it needs to re-study the masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle And Beautifully Made But Rather Flat Love Triangle/International Intrigue Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thomas Fowler is a British journalist in Saigon in 1952 who is in love with his mistress, a much younger Vietnamese woman named Phuong. He meets Alden Pyle, an American working for a medical aid programme, and they become rivals for her love. However, as Fowler's work leads him to find a secret, sinister side to Pyle, the trio's relationships become more and more complex and dangerous ...This movie, like so many quality adaptations of a critically acclaimed novel, is very well written, handsomely produced, features great performances and is rubbish. The reason I think it's rubbish is because I hate the sub-genre of the movie; the love story set against a backdrop of war. Whenever I see one of these pictures (The Year Of Living Dangerously, Pearl Harbor, Barry Lyndon, Gone With The Wind, Cold Mountain) I enjoy it, but I find the war scenes detract from the romance and there's never enough war to be a battlefield drama. This is the same. The most intense scenes are the one in the watchtower and the bombing of the market square, and the theme of the growing American involvement in Indochina is gripping, eloquently summarised by Hinh's line, "Sooner or later Mr Fowler, one has to take sides if one is to remain human.". However, this isn't what the movie's really about - it's about a boring love triangle where Caine is something of a dirty old man, Fraser is an enigma whose love for Phuong seems highly implausible, and Yen is just an unreadable retiring beauty. It's hard to feel empathy with these people, or care about their agendas. Its best features are the classy, polished photography by Christopher Doyle (with exteriors shot in authentic Vietnamese locations) and the gorgeous costumes by the talented Norma Moriceau (Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome). Filmed once before in 1958 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and based on a semi-autobiographical novel by the much-lauded Graham Greene (whose book The Power And The Glory I defy anybody to enjoy reading), this version suffered from delayed and poor distribution, despite having two big-name producers in Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack. Films like this kinda irk me; they're made by talented people and great to look it, but I always get the feeling they're trying to be holier-than-thou and slavishly adhering to a literary style that doesn't work well in cinema. All this griping aside however, this is a classy picture with a highly original setting and a powerhouse performance from Caine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not grip and maintain attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film this evening but found it hard to become very involved. In part I think this was due to the lack-lustre performance of Michael Caine - he was very bland and surely in a film which moves at such a slow pace one needs a lead actor with a stronger presence - I was thinking of a Sean Connery or an Harrison Ford type.I did not see the film in terms of the romantic relationships - the young lion challenging and displacing the older one - but in terms of the decadence and collapse of French colonialism and the tragedy of replacing one colonial power with another. In a political sense the film reflected the tragedy of Vietnam in not being able to establish a democratic government but rather to being forced to follow an extremist authoritarian communism regime or to be dominated by an opportunistic puppet regime driven and supported by the CIA and other agencies to extend and maintain USAmerican military and capitalist interests.With the French losing their grip on maintaining colonial rule, a power vacuum was created and thus their were two contenders for power, one the communists with their rigid ideology and ruthless methods of gaining and maintaining power, and, two, opportunistic puppets like General Tay supported by right wing USAmerica.The film probably attempted to do too much - perhaps if it had focused on the political issues and made them clearer it would have been better - or if it had sought to examine only the sexual relationships -as how women are used by men in a situation where they have little power of their own - so there were too many threads perhaps and they became entangled and it was difficult to untie the knots and make sense of it all.Reading the book would probably clarify some points not made clear by the film.So my main query was, 'What was this film all about?'- to indicate the reasons for the Vietnam war - to show the insidious presence of these Quiet Americans and the havoc they provoke and for which they fail to take responsibility? Or was it merely about the predicament of a woman who has to rely upon a man for a decent life? The characters are rather sad - none is very heroic - all are sinners - perhaps this is Greene's main theme - if the human beings were better in themselves, everything else would be better - or in despair he shows that we are all in the soup up to our necks and all we can do is sweat it out until our demise.Perhaps someone else could clarify this for me???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What starts out as a simple beautifully set love story between three people turns out to be a very serious and intense political thriller. 'The Quiet American' follows British news writer, Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), and his life in Vietnam. He is married, but is in love with a beautiful Vietnamese girl, Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen) and is shacking up with her. Phuong's sister hates this because Phuong can't get married and be well off. Then enters, Pyle (Brendan Fraser), the quiet American as Fowler describes him. He falls in love with Phuong, and the film becomes sort of a contest for her love. Then Fowler starts to suspect Pyle being involved in C.I.A. mission to supply a violent military party with bombs. 'The Quiet American' moves kind of slow, but the film's sheer beauty and scenery will win you over. The acting is first-rate all the way with a stellar emotion-packed performance by Michael Caine who in more words than one makes the film. Do Thi Hai Yen does a fine job while I was impressed with Brendan Fraser's (an actor I'm not to big on) great performance. Director Phillip Noyce hits it out of the park with this one. 'The Quiet American' isn't for everyone and has some elements that could be construed as anti-American (although I really didn't think so). The film received an Oscar nomination for Michael Caine's wonderful performance. One of the best films of 2002. Grade: B+</fullReview>

It is the story of an ageing British journalist (Caine), a young American (Fraser) and a beautiful Vietnamese woman caught between them. This is a world where nothing is as it seems - suffused with opium, intrigue and betrayal. Watch this film, I highly recommend it. Micheal Caine gives one of his best performances ever if not his best. Brendan Fraser also gave an excellent performance as Pyle. It is nice to see Fraser can diversify his roles. The sadness this film brings upon is overwhelming at times. The film is almost poetic at times.LOVE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fascinating Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An adaptation of a 1956 novel by Graham Greene, the movie's biggest shortcoming does not stay true to the novel, particularly the ending. The ending to the novel was much more satisfying than that of the movie. However, the movie captures most of the essence of the novel. If viewers have read the novel or has seen this movie more than once, the viewers will understand the movie and the literary qualities it includes. The story which is historical fiction, more fiction than history, is set in 1952 Vietnam. Having been stationed in South Vietnam as a military advisor in 1957, the story covers familiar ground and I read the novel before I went to Vietnam. However, Greene's approach is much too simplistic and cynical. He paints the situation in black and white when in fact there were a lot of gray areas. He does not bring out that most people in South Vietnam were strongly opposed to communism. Greene's story has Vietnam split into three factions, the French, the communist Viet-Minh and a new third force led by a Vietnamese general. Not so in reality. Outside the communists, there were no Vietnamese generals since the French were in command and all its army units were lead by French officers. Perhaps Greene's general was a leader of a private army but it is unlikely. It was not until after the French capitulated and South Vietnam was formed that there were `generals' and they were generally incompetent and they earned their positions through politics rather than through the standard routes of promotion. Greene has the American CIA intervening in Vietnam in 1952. Although Americans provided the French with money to fight the war, it did not interfere with the French as the book and the movie show. The U.S. would not have backed any Vietnamese `general' against the French. The story does bring out an all too common trait of the Americans of involving itself in the affairs of another country with `good intentions.' In South Vietnam, Americans were invited in to protect the new country. The U.S. did not force its way in. Our `good intentions' was to help South Vietnam establish a democracy and a free country. But as often happens with our `good intentions' (i.e. Iraq) it is not an easy task. Democracy is only possible in stabilized countries and because of internal fighting between factions stability just doesn't happen. Success occurred in South Korea but it took many years for it to occur. In South Vietnam we didn't have a chance. There was intense rivalry between the Buddhists and the Catholics, much as in Northern Ireland. And the Viet-Cong communists, aided by communist North Viet Nam constantly disrupted everything. The South Vietnamese government was paralyzed and never had a chance. Still it is a fascinating movie largely because the characters are not only well developed but Michael Caine's performance is masterful as a British reporter and should be a high light of his career. I was not impressed though with Brendan Frasier's performance as the Quiet American. It just didn't ring true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>South-East Asia drama - missed opportunity for a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The history of SE Asia in the second half of the 20th century created a whole cinema genre, from stylish French films dealing with the end of the colonial period, up to some of the finest American films focusing on the national American trauma generated by the Vietnam war. Hopefully, some of the local cinema industries will add at some point strong creations from their own perspective, but this is still to come. 'The Quite American' is at the intersection of the above sub-genres. It is well filmed (although I saw better) as the French films are, it is an American production with local Vietnamese cast, and it takes a very critical anti-American historical approach, too blunt maybe, closer to the European view. The film is based on a novel by Graham Greene, who was in the 50s and 60s the top author of British complex and human spy novels and stories, fathering the direction nowadays led by John Le Carre. Acting is key in this film. Michael Caine is good as always and Brendan Fraser gives the best act in his career until now in my opinion, succeeding to let us forget his roles in comics-history action movies. The acting of Do Thi Hai Yen is more of a problem. She has style and authenticity, but her lack of experience as a non-professional actor misses the complexity of the character, and leaves too many question mark about what the film intended, and what the character really was about. Yes, there is a lot of Far-East mystery in her act, probably too much of it. Unfortunately, the script is too manifest in its message, and lacks some of the details that would have brought logic - both artistic and plot-wise. Some of the key reasons for things happening are never explained, neither on the factual, or on the emotional plans. Too little of the complex moral questions specific to Greene were lost at the expense of the explicit political case. For these reasons 'The Quite American' which could have been one of the great films of the genre, misses some of the points and falls at the average level. 6/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Quiet American" is based on a 1956 book by a British writer, and deals with Viet Nam's war of independence from France, but also against Communism. Portrayed here is an attempt at backing a popular General who can rally the common citizens and unify Viet Nam. As we know, it didn't happen, the country was eventually divided into North and South countries, and the 1960s and 1970s saw the "conflict" which heavily involved the USA. With all that as a setting, this fictional movie is about an older British writer, Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine, in a perfect role), who doesn't really want to be re-assigned back to London, and a young man he calls the quiet American, because he isn't rowdy like the other Americans, Pyle (Brendan Fraser, in a perfect role), who is there for apparent humanitarian purposes. A very good movie, especially for those of us who remember the Viet Nam conflict well. The DVD has a great 5.1 surround sound, and a nice video. The "extras" include a very interesting "Viet Nam timeline", pluse three original book reviews from 1956.some SPOILERS follow, you probably want to read no further.At barely 2 minutes and 50 seconds into the movie we see a body, face down in the water, and we learn it is Pyle, the quiet American. And we see Fowler being questioned, so we know part of the end. Fowler and Pyle hit it off at first, but soon Phuong,the pretty young native that has been Fowler's lover, gets in the way. Pyle is attracted to her, so much that he wants to take her to America and give her a good life, knowing that Fowler never can, since he is married and his wife will not give him a divorce. We learn that Pyle's 'humanitarian' mission is a disguise, he is really the lead operative that is helping the General get explosives, and offering advice, explosions to kill civilians and that can be blamed on the Communists. In essence, doing bad for a greater eventual good, he thinks. In one scene there is a car-bomb blast, very realistic looking and sounding, that kills many in the town square, Pyle's animated activity, speaking fluent Vietmanese, directing others, tipped Fowler off to his true role. Fowler was exposed in a lie, saying his wife had agreed to a divorce when she didn't. Phuong left his residence, went with Fowler. In meetings between Fowler and Pyle, we see that Fowler has relinquished, apparently letting Phuong go. However, in a great restroom stall crying scene, we see how devastated Fowler is, risking losing all he really cares to live for. So he sets up a trap for Pyle, his Vietnamese assistant traps and stabs Pyle in an alley, dumps his body into the bay. In the end, Fowler gets Phuong back, she really has no alternative. Does she love him? probably not, but she needs to survive too. The movie ends with a montage of fictional reports written by Fowler, who never left Viet Nam, covering incidents from 1954 to 1966, chronicling the split of Viet Nam into two countries, and eventually the big 'conflict'.</fullReview>

Brendan Fraser is better.

It does not paint a pretty picture of Americanactions, but neither does it let Britain or France off the hook. It wassupposed to have been released in the autumn of 2001, but after9/11, Miramax assumed (probably rightly) that no one would beinterested in seeing a film that depicts American cooperation inacts of terrorism. Seeing this movie, I couldn't help but see certainparallels to current events. Michael Caine is credited withconvincing Harvey Weinstein to take the film off the shelf andrelease it.

		<shortDescription>Tepid, Spineless Anachronism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE QUIET AMERICAN is altogether too quiet, too tepid for its subject matter, and incompletely realized, mediocre. It fails on all levels, as film, as historical drama, as morality play. It fails to even to transport one off the movie lot to early 1950's Viet Nam, which in this day and age of hyper graphic realism in movies is really something. The first act is so subdued, so perfunctory, that one has to try hard to imagine what the Graham Green book might have originally been about; certainly not this drab love triangle with faint historical overtones.Michael Caine sleepwalks as if in a fog through his role as an opium-addicted British journalist, a man past his prime who claims, right from the onset, that he merely reports on what he sees, never gets involved. His character lacks the requisite seediness and sweat, misses the desperation and suppleness of a man hiding in the interstices. When he finally does take a stand, finally acts, it seems almost flippant, done on the spur of the moment. Neither the struggle with the decision nor the moral ramifications of it are ever fully illumined or examined. What is supposed to be the climactic moral moment of the film, its epiphany, just drops like a pebble into the muddy puddle of the rest of the film, so totally unlike two other movies based on Graham Greene novels that come to mind, "The Third Man" and "The Fallen Idol" (both highly recommended), both of which flash moral insight like lightening into previously ambiguous, deceiving appearances. Brendan Fraser and the love interest, Do Thi Hai Yen, fair no better. The script is a straight jacket restricting everyone. Noyce's direction lacks snap, clarity, an amazing shortcoming given the high-octane potential of the subject matter, setting, and cast of characters. Just as it lacks a moral spine, the film takes unconscionable anachronistic liberties with historical fact. In the film, the CIA is depicted subverting French interests by secretly taking steps to install its own puppet dictator, General Thé (played by Quang Hai). Trouble is, this film takes place in the early 1950's, a time when the French were very much running their own show, mired in their own colonial mischief, with American involvement consisting merely of limited intelligence and military advisors brought in strictly at their behest. The Americans did not deceitfully usurp French interests. On the contrary, the France used America to take over its own lost cause, concurrent with the general decline of its colonial empire (e.g., Algeria). Further, the ideas of setting up a puppet regime and Communist containment were not implemented by the US until the early to mid 1960's.At a time when European anti-Americanism is all too fashionable, especially among the French, I resent this twisting of history to make it seem that the US was the villain, when it was initially more of an unwitting accomplice, a generous friend taken advantage of by the French. (One should also recall that when shortly after the end of WWII Ho Chi Minh personally approached Truman to ask for help in setting up a socialist democracy--the Vietnamese then saw the US as its liberator--Truman decided instead to support our "ally," France, going so far as to use the Japanese military police, with its intimate knowledge of the Vietnamese resistance acquired during its brutal occupation, to reassert French colonial domination over the country.) The very title of this film is an underhanded anti-American slap, being a not too subtle reference to the Lederer and Burdick novel, "The Ugly American," made into a film starring Marlon Brando (dir. Englund, 1963). That film, not coincidentally, also dealt critically with American intervention in the struggle for self-rule of an underdeveloped Southeast Asian nation. This film adds nothing to the historical legacy of Viet Nam, nor does justice to its themes of indecisive moral laxity and love amid the ruins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual Metaphor for Being Ankle Deep in the Big Muddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Philip Noyce avoids telling the viewer that "The Quiet American" is based on a Graham Greene novel called "The Ugly American," but he's not subtle about much else, including pointing a finger at Western European colonials' complicity in Viet Nam as well that we have only seen up to now in the restored scenes in "Apocalypse Now Redux." But to his credit he tells the allegory of how we got stuck in the Big Muddy mostly visually and from the point of view of a cynical, ethically-challenged Brit journalist, played brilliantly, almost sympathetically by Michael Caine, to whom the personal is the political.Refreshingly, it is the American who is the ideologue, played winningly by Brendan Fraser as he presents himself in turn as a naive medical missionary and manipulative cop of the world. Actually filming in Ho Chi Minh City adds immeasurably to the beautiful mise en scene, where the flimsy ships bobbing in the harbor are a continuous visual motif, from sunrises to sunsets. Both the weakness and the strength, though, are the plot points of the Inscrutable Orientals who cross their paths. On the one hand, I sure wish we knew more about the Viet Namese characters as individuals and human beings because they do seem like emotionless stick figures. On the other hand, by being cyphers they represent that we never really knew the Viet Namese anyway, because it was their country and neither the French nor the Americans had any business being there. Australian Noyce is not overly heavy-handed in communicating all this through the interactions of three characters in the 1950's and their assistants, but is very effective at showing this through a look, a tear, and the wiping away of blood on the cuff of a pair of pants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The self-righteous are guilty of history's greatest cruelties. Most evil is done by good people who do not know that they are not good." - Rhinehold Niehbur, TheologianShelved for over a year because Miramax decided it was unpatriotic, The Quiet American by Phillip Noyce was finally released only after favorable critical reviews at the Toronto Film Festival. This release is very timely with the U.S. government seemingly bent on another unpopular war in a tiny third world country. Based on Graham Greene's 1955 novel, the film looks at America's clandestine involvement in dirty tricks in Vietnam prior to the French defeat in 1954. Because of its political relevance, this is a film that I desperately wanted to love; however, I found that I could not fully embrace it. Though it has anti-American written all over it, it never develops its themes with sufficient impact to make clear the full impact of U.S. policy and what the issues were really about. The film is set in Saigon in 1952 during the latter stages of the war between the French and the Viet Minh Communists. Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is a world-weary British journalist on assignment in a Saigon where bombs continually go off in random horror. The film opens when the body of an American, Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) is found floating in the river and the French police launch an investigation. It then recounts the events that led to the murder. Fowler (in true Bogart fashion) claims he is just a neutral reporter and doesn't want to get involved in politics. He fills his time smoking an opium pipe and writing perfunctory dispatches to head office: "I wrote what I saw. I took no action -- even an opinion is a kind of action", he says. Although married to a strict Catholic who lives in London, Fowler is in love with a young Vietnamese girl named Phuong (Du Thi Hai Yen). Things get complicated when Pyle, an idealistic young American shows up claiming to be in Vietnam on a medical mission, defending America as only interested in bringing democracy to Vietnam. Fowler visits Phat Diem in search of a story to keep him from being sent back to London. A love triangle develops when Pyle turns up and tells Fowler that he has also fallen in love with Phuong and wants to marry her and bring her back to Boston. The conflict becomes heated through the course of the film, but it is unclear if Phuong is really in love with either man or is just using them.When Fowler discovers a massacre of civilians at Phat Diem that cannot be traced to either the Communists or the French, he investigates further and finds shipments of plastics from America used in making explosives. He learns that Pyle has ties to an insurgent Vietnamese leader, General The, a local right-wing warlord who wants to be a "third force", independent of the French or the Communists. Pyle? surprise, surprise? it turns out is actually a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and not just an aid worker. The results of terrorism are graphically displayed when two car bombs explode in a downtown street in Saigon. Pyle must face questions about who supplied the explosives for this attack and the final confrontation between Fowler and Pyle brings the story full circle. There is a lot to like in The Quiet American. The film has a conscience and Noyce's use of Vietnamese amputees as extras graphically communicates the agony of what war does to people. Michael Caine is excellent as the weary, cynical reporter trying to reconcile ethics with practicality and the film has the courage to follow Greene's novel closely (unlike the 1958 distortion by Joseph Mankiewicz). Unfortunately, I found the performance of Brendan Fraser as Pyle to be unconvincing either as a lover or a political operative and the entire romantic subplot seems peripheral and lacking focus or passion. The film ends with a montage of newspaper clippings about American involvement over the next two decades, but its impact is muted. It is not made clear that U.S. meddling in the fifties led directly to the establishment of the puppet regime of Ngo Dinh Diem years later, the same kind of "third force" depicted by General The in the film. For those of us with short memories, this regime led to the Buddhist immolations, the Viet Cong, Diem's eventual assassination, and ten years of napalm and broken bodies. The Quiet American comes to life briefly than loses its footing, never meshing into a coherent and satisfying whole, either as a romance, a character study, or a political statement. At the end, it captures the mind but not the heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I sure wouldn't want to capture the lyrical Greene on screen. Noyce does an admirable job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Greene understood the American penchant for taking the Marshal Plan to its limits. Even in the '50's he knew in his novel "The Quiet American" that the American presence in Indochina, where the French were losing control, would be powerful and doomed.Enter Brendan Fraser as the American idealist Thomas Fowler in Philip Noyce's film of the same name. Watching him and the winds of war is Michael Caine as a war correspondent for the London Times named Alden Pyle. Noyce's film emphasizes the romantic triangle with those two men and the inscrutable Vietnamese beauty, Phuong. Phuong as metaphor for the kept mistress of the French and Fowler as the US are a bit too obvious to be truly impressive. Even the parallel to "Casablanca's" triangle and obvious allegories makes this film look like it suffers from dramatic anemia.Fraser is a weak-acting choice because he has difficulty with nuances and emotions when it comes to love. As an American agitator attempting to disrupt the corrupt political machine of Saigon, however, he is much better. Caine is more natural as the boozing newsman watching the world change. His voiceover is unparalleled: As he did for "Cider House Rules," he gives gravity and melancholy to the events.Christopher Doyle's cinematography is lovely--the river at night with its eerily passing boat lights reminds me of some quieter "Apocalypse Now" shots and emphasizes the darkly seductive world of South East Asia.Greene has given life to Foreign Service. Hollywood's "Quiet American" adaptation is like the US of the Vietnam War: never really belonging there but a presence you can't ignore. This film is not quite the success that brilliantly terse novel promised, perhaps because like America, it never really understands why it is there. But the film does well reflect Greene's interest in the vagaries of friendship and the inevitable clashes between youth and old age and idealism and realism.I sure wouldn't want to try to capture the lyrical Greene on screen. Noyce does an admirable job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ink this film received before general release did it harm, at least for me. Expectations were high. Having read most of Greene and having liked this book quite well, I anticipated what apparently, according to reviewers, was a brilliant transition to the screen. Not so, alas. Despite my concerns about Fraser, who always looks to me like a guy from the gym lost on a set, I approached his performance with an open mind. His entry looked good but after that it was all eye and mouth with not a hint of artistry. (Where is Guy Pearce when you need him?)Mr. Caine was terrific, despite his uneven application of a peculiar walk well before the accident. He gives a line wonderful meaning and he uses that face to great effect. The young woman was lovely to behold and to hear. The sister and Caine's assistant were finely portrayed as were all of the supporting cast. The script was not particularly strong, either in language or rhythms. The recollective voice-overs were most affecting and effective. I wished for more of them. Very well lensed, particularly with the suppressed color that gave this often a black and white look. Good music track and sound. Nifty costuming and sets, although quite untrue to the dinginess of the original written settings. On the positive side, Philip Noyce does a wonderful job of working with the political material and giving his and Mr. Greene's point of view some punch. Perhaps a bit broad with the updated ending using newspaper stories (a very forties thing) that bring us through the escalation from a few CIA guys to 495,000 troops hell bent for disaster, but well done and fitting my view, therefore good. The explosion scene in the square is extremely effective as is the symbolic ending of the chase ending in the death of Fraser in a blind alley. Deftly done. I wish this were better done, used less straight narrative, and had cast a believable actor in the CIA man's part. Requiescat in pace, Graham. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing if you've seen the trailer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quiet American may be a brilliant movie. It starts out with the discovery of the body of an American, who is then identified at the morgue by a British journalist who was "his friend". It then goes on to tell the story leading up to that moment, involving a love triangle, a civil war between Communists and Colonists and third parties.Now giving away the end before the movie starts is always a difficult thing - it can destroy the tension and the anticipation. In some cases (eg "One Hour Photo") it can actually generate more interest. For me it is difficult to judge which is the case in "The Quiet American". Unfortunately, I have seen the trailer for this movie. The trailer was interesting and successful in getting me interested to watch the movie, hinting at a great storyline, and even great cinematography (Brendan Fraser running through a dark alley in a white suit presented a powerful image, that would have fit equally well in eye-candy like "Road to Perdition"). But at the same time, it gave away so much of the story, even some of the most important plot twists, that it completely ruined the experience of the movie itself for me. I go to a cinema to be entertained - to be moved or thrilled or enchanted. I can see the potential in this movie to do all three. If only the trailer hadn't ruined its surprises.On the technical side, this movie is very well done. Acting is, as remarked upon by many others, good. Brendan Fraser somehow fails to be entirely fitting of the description as "quiet" American, but much of that is due to the script. His character is too outspoken too quickly, making him just another "loud" American. Cinematography is very good (a very powerful shot with strong metaphorical value of the aftermath of an explosion sticks particularly in mind). Visuals and Sound are good. The story might be good, but I cannot judge its impact on the uninitiated mind.All in all, it may be a great movie. But if you've seen the trailer, don't bother going to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie's a first-rate pressure cooker!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen a telecast of this 2002 movie (I saw it theatrically at the time), I was again reminded of how wonderfully and subtly-etched this historical suspense drama truly is. On the surface, it is about the rivalry between two men: one a British journalist who has planted himself in French Indo-China and grown lethargic and somewhat indifferent to the daily chaos around him, and the other an ambitious American doctor--the "quiet American" of the title--who is enthusiastically setting out on a program of medical reform in the embattled region. How these roles gradually shift and change throughout the movie is what makes this such electrifying entertainment. Truths are revealed, and Thomas Fowler (Caine) begins to realize that it is immoral to remain detached, that true survival lies in making judicious choices. Caine, of course, represents the old French colonialism of Vietnam, and Brendan Fraser represents its slick salvation...the eventual American decision to overstep its guarded role of peace-keeper in Communist-infiltrated Southeast Asia. The performances are uniformly strong, and I believe this is Caine's best role in years. He acts with restraint and precision, his face a carefully-kept mask that gives away none of the turmoil, even when his own love life is in tatters. Fraser is also good, on the surface cheerful and reliable, but opaque, difficult at times to read. These performances are perfectly in keeping with the slowly-building, ominous tone of the movie as Vietnam itself leaves the comparatively-innocent colonialist era and moves into another in which there will be much suffering and bloodshed. Graham Greene's story is a wonderful puzzle, rich in implication, which involves the viewer. And, at the center of the film, is a love triangle. In this movie, the silences count. It is the things that are not said which become the most important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quiet little movie about a big deal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the original Graham Greene novel as I'm not a big fan of his, and was curious as to how his sentimental and "soft" personality would come to the big screen.Some things didn't work too well. First off, the heavy reliance on narration almost works but not entirely. I wonder if a straightforward telling of an intriguing story might not have worked to better advantage rather than the flashback approach. What DOES work brilliantly is the "love" story involving Michael Caine's character and his Vietnamese concubine. It's good to see Caine on top form after all these years of an outstanding, brilliant acting career on film. Do Thi Hai Yen's portrayal of Phong, his lover, is bewitching. She is distant and mysterious, perhaps too distant. There is something preposterous about Pyle's sudden intrusion into their lives. He enters the scene and simply takes what he wants from Fowler (Caine) with little resistance from the latter; a bit of Greene's "softness" coming into the lead character's personality perhaps. It rings a bit false, as does most of Pyle's behavior throughout. A chance to elaborate on Pyle's motivations is completely ignored in favor of a sort-of generic "ugly" American approach and consequently muting the impact of the outcome of the film.Brendan Fraser, a brilliant comedian, is surprisingly good as the "heavy" Pyle. He looks like a beefy geek and conveys a mysterious under-pinning to the character that is left to the viewer's imagination as to what is really going on inside his head.It's a good film but oddly muted. The technical aspects are excellent and the shots of Saigon before the Viet Nam war went into full swing are beautiful. But if you want a more complete view of the French occupation of Viet Nam, pre-Lyndon Johnson, see 'Indochine' with Catherine Deneuve. Now THAT is a great film.This version of 'The Quiet American' is good but nothing special, aside from the opportunity to see Caine in a highly nuanced performance late in his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning beauty, marred by politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quiet American has all the stunning beauty that Vietnam has to offer. Exotic, Eastern history, mixed with European colonialism meeting resurgent, brash US culture and the moral decay of communism. Yet the moral decay of communism is not portrayed as such. Instead, there is the same suggestion of admiration for desperate communist forces which so mirrors the opinions of those that cannot quite criticize terrorist activity. The circle of silence which envelopes such lands in transition is well portrayed, and exploited by The Quiet American. Should France have made their attempt to reclaim the former colony? What were the US motives? The Chinese? Russia? Che Guevarra and Cuba? What of the people themselves, Vietnamese, from the mountains to the valleys. None is able to show what they want, what they do, for there is a murderous undercurrent as there is a beauty. The acting is superb, and all the basic elements of a great film are there. However, ultimately, it is the direction that prevents this film from rising to achieve what it might have, to inform and portray. Instead, it colludes, and many who struggled to survive the aftermath may well feel betrayed.</fullReview>

OK, a very nice smile. A bumptious Canadian plays a mysterious quiet American, who also develops a deep romantic attachment because he also likes the exotic teenager's smile 'at first sight' (who wouldn't?).In chemistry, this reaction (apparently serving as a deep metaphor for the shift from colonialism to neocolonialism in southeast Asia) simply wouldn't happen. And the chain-reaction that ought to follow, drawing me into the film, didn't get started. I won't get into domino-theory...Apparently there was a casting director called Christine King.

		<fullReview>I missed this film when it was released - probably due to a lot of traveling then. Caught it by chance on cable, and judging from many other of these comments, perhaps I'd better take another look sometime soon. The setting and scenes are well-presented, and evoke the feeling for the period when the whole Vietnam experience to erupt later was festering. Brendan Fraser has made many excellent films in 15 years, Michael Caine numerous outstanding ones in a period more than three times longer. And in a film released shortly after this one, "Secondhand Lions," Caine performed with exuberance and with the great Robert Duval made one of the best pictures one could desire. But here for, for heaven's sake - both he and Frazer were laconic, insipid and even silly. They looked as if they'd overdosed on tranquilizers, and made you wish somebody would shock both of them with a cattle prod. The beautiful Vietnamese actress, whom they both pursue - also in an insipid and annoying manner, represented a desirable young woman - but here they mooned and schlepped around with each other as if she were some sort of blend of Mother Teresa with Sharon Stone. Even within that turmoil occurring there, she could walk down a narrow street at midnight and meet at random someone with more personality and vigor than the these two. "Low-key" is often appropriate, and can be entertaining, but here it has been taken to depths few characters and films have known since Jolson said "You Ain't Heard Nothing' Yet."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That in history European powers have robbed their colonies of the ability to transition to sovereignty easily is a given (with the exceptions of the US and Canada). That making a movie about the French losing their grip on Vietnam--and the United States endeavoring to take their place--does not guarantee anything close to good, interesting storytelling.Phillip Noyce's The Quiet American, with Michael Caine as a British journalist, Brendan Fraser as a CIA officer, and Do Thi Hai Yen as their mutual love interest, is an example of what happens when film-makers go for deep and profound--and get dull-as-dishwater.The Quiet American may or may not have merit, but Noyce's leaden direction robs it of being anything more than a chore to watch. Caine and Fraser are successful at portraying real people, but Do is nothing more than a porcelain doll who daintily steps between the two men who want and/or love her. She's supposed to be a metaphor for Vietnam, but as a character, she's tedious and unappealing.Maybe the metaphor works, but by the time the credits rolled, I had long since stopped caring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this book was first made into a movie in 1958, Greene was incensed at the pro-America sanitization it received. I think if he were alive today, he would be similarly disgusted at how far it misses the mark in the other direction.There's no mystery as to the culprit in Greene's novel. It's Pyle's innocence that is held up by Fowler again and again as the real danger. In other words, the road to hell is paved with the good intentions, on the part of people who aren't there and don't really understand what's going on.At no point in the novel does Pyle become some super-spy, barking orders in fluent Vietnamese into a walkie-talkie. Ludicrous, and antithetical to the novel's thesis! America may have been culpable for a lot of indecency and manipulation in the war in Vietnam, but that simply wasn't the point of the story. It's clear the screenwriters had an ax to grind, which is painfully apparent in how they decided to close out the film, with all the statistics about America's later involvement.</fullReview>

He befriends new arrival, American aid worker Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), and he also introduces him to his young beautiful Vietnamese mistress Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). The story basically revolves around their love triangle with startling revelations, and eventually murder. It is the classic story of love, betrayal, friendship, and ultimately the origin of the American war in Vietnam.

The soap opera nature of the movie, the very poor performance of the actors (which again I don't understand why it received good reviews and Oscar nominations), the very bad dialogues, the mistakes on presenting the period, the lack of emphasis on the powerful parts of the Graham Greene story, and more and more weaknesses, disappointed me to a great deal.The movie basically has absolutely no value, it is not a historical movie, it is not a visually nice one (again shocked to see that a great cinematographer like Huu Tuan Nguyen has done a very basic and mainstream job), dialogues and character development are poor, and it doesn't touch any of the strong aspects of such a deep and condensed era. Nothing really on the war, hardly anything strong on the CIA involvement in Indochine, and not even one nice shot of such a beautiful country, and let's not even talk about the childish and un-sophisticated love story.It is a great disappointment, more to the critics who gave it 4 stars and must-sees than to the film itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The poor script doesn't focus in one certain thing ... is it a war movie? Or a love story? Or both of them? Nothing is convincing enough. The political background is not strong, and the love story has no compelling characters. What is Michael Caine doing in this film? And why, why, why Brendan Fraser?Even Christopher Doyle doesn't delivery anything here. Is that really Ho Chi Minh or just a set? Please .... The location doesn't look good at all. So sad that Graham Greene's classic can end up like this on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched the film at London Film Festival. I saw Michael Caine there so I should have told him that the film was hideous.Caine's performance was superb. Brendan Fraser was convincing as a clean-cut yet mysterious American.But I think the relationship between Caine and a Vietnamese girl part was totally irrelevant. That part was the film's biggest downfall. They didn't describe enough in the film why Caine's character is into that woman that much. She just looked like an eight-year-old, brainless gold digger who doesn't have her own opinion and just does whatever she was told to do. She was a just another younger lover of European old man. The only reason why she sticks to Caine was money. That's not love.And Vietnam in this film was superficial. They only showed surface of it, not inside. Well, it's usual for Miramax film, I suppose. Great hype, no content. Maybe it's because of the novel which the film is based on. I don't know.It is a very shallow film. Some will love it, because the girl is pretty. But to me, it was a total waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quiet American could rather be named The Boring American.Indeed, this story has been told over and over and this picture doesn't ad one bit. Bad acting performance of Frazer (Alden Pyle). The only convincing actor is Pyle's dog, sadly enough killed in action.</fullReview>
