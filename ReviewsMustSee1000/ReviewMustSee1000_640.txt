		<fullReview>Absolute Power may not be an overly special film but it was the first movie I saw in the cinema after leaving high school. I was certainly not the target audience but it had my attention from the first scene and maintained the suspense for the during of the running time, even if it doesn't build to much.Clint Eastwood plays Luther Whitney, an expert thief who targets billionaire industrialist Walter Sullivan (grouchy old EG Marshall, in his last theatrical movie) while he is off on vacation. While in the midst of cleaning out the vault the President of the United States (Gene Hackman) enters the room with Sullivan's wife. Whitney hides in the vault, which has a two-way mirror, and witnesses the President get a little too rough with the woman, which ends in her fighting him off and being murdered by the secret service. The Chief of Staff concocts a plan to cover up the murder not knowing that Whitney is watching the whole thing. As the group leave he escapes, taking a crucial piece of evidence with him.Initially unsure what to do, Whitney decides to taunt the President, though it's not clear what his complete plan is or even if he's just free-forming. If one should fault Absolute Power for any reason it's that it establishes a lot of plot and potential but never really does anything with it and ends with an anti-climactic cop-out.Where it succeeds is with the small cast of characters who really make the dialogue and relationships work. Ed Harris as the confused but dedicated cop investigating the case, Laura Linney as Whitney's resentful daughter, and the austere Scott Glenn as the self-doubting agent make every scene effortless even when there's not much happening.Adapted from (and streamlined and improved in the process) the bloated novel by David Baldacci (I call them 'Airport novels' ? those 600-page bricks with generic covers featuring nothing but the title and author in giant gold letters in a tacky font) the screenplay makes many changes but they are all for the better. Eastwood's direction is slow and steady ? or 'mature'. The pace and framing is the antidote for anyone bored to tears with the nauseating aesthetic of today's comic-book movies and CGI nightmares.A curious thing about the beginning of the movie is that Clint Eastwood only has 2 lines of dialogue for the entire 35 minutes. I don't understand why he didn't cut them out and remain silent, which would give the film a peculiar edge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Starts Out With Immense Potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What starts out with immense potential gradually evaporates into preposterousness in ABSOLUTE POWER. That doesn't make it an entirely bad picture, but it certainly puts a damper on what could have been. Clint Eastwood is an aging thief (he's been an aging something or other for his last 20 movies) who secretly witnesses President Gene Hackman get rough with his mistress. The encounter ends with her being shot by the Secret Service as she tries to defend herself, and the incident is promptly disguised to look like run-of-the-mill foul play. He may be on the outside of the law looking in, but Clint ain't about to let the powers that be get away with this one.The opening 20 minutes of ABSOLUTE POWER are quite suspenseful, bordering on mesmerizing. There we are, trapped in a walk-in, two-way mirrored vault along with our pilfering hero, helpless to stop the horror unfolding just meters away. Eastwood may start out as the bad guy, but his status is quickly upgraded as he flees the scene holding what may be the only piece of evidence that can prove his astonishing observation. From then on we find ourselves rooting him on, even if he is in reality nothing more than the lesser of two evils.What unravels ABSOLUTE POWER is its laziness and improbability. In an attempt to set up one stirring scene after another, the characters begin doing and saying things one would expect of a low-rate Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. A one-dimensionally evil Secret Service man surreptitiously hunkers down in a tall building trying to snipe Eastwood ala Lee Harvey Oswald. A police detective has no problem with Eastwood sneaking around his home at all hours of the night. A three-minute argument by Eastwood's thief is enough to convince the mistress's widower of the involvement of the most powerful man on earth. And to call the ending outlandish and unsatisfying would be a pair of understatements.As well, though it's usually the other way around, ABSOLUTE POWER would have benefited from a longer running time. One comes away with the sense that Eastwood, who also directed, tried to cram too much into too little. The film certainly had the material to go longer, and its compactness gives the whole endeavor a choppy feel at times.ABSOLUTE POWER is a film you really want to like. There is considerable talent involved here, and the movie's heart seems to be in the right place. But like that one photo we all have in our album, this one didn't turn out as good as we would have hoped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast + Compelling plot = Mediocre movie (and why) *MILD SPOILER*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute Power featured an exceptional cast. Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Judy Davis, E. g. Marshall - few movies boast better talent.Absolute Power also involved a compelling scenario - Eastwood, a master thief, has staked out Marshall's house and is pulling a third story job involving a vault full of diamonds and money, when Marshall's wife and the president of the United States waltz into the bedroom intoxicated and frisky. Things get a little rough, and Hackman (the president) finally yells for help when the young woman tries to stab him, with a letter opener. The Secret Service blows the woman away and sets about cleaning up and covering up the crime. Eastwood, of course, witnesses the entire proceeding and manages to grab one important piece of evidence (the letter opener) before making good his escape. He then begins a cat and mouse game somewhere between the police, the secret service and his estranged daughter, who is unsure who to believe.Absolute Power, despite its potential, was a disappointment. The characters were made believable by the phenomenal cast. Eastwood, Linney and Davis were outstanding at times. And the film has several tense and visually very interesting scenes which showed Eastwood's directorial talent nicely. From my perspective, the problem was somewhere between the script, the editing and the directing, but I am not sure exactly where. About 2/3rds of the way through the film, the Keystone Cops antics of the Secret Service members who are supposed to be "taking care" of the situation, are no longer believable, and neither is Eastwood' ability to be anywhere at any time without being detected. Further, when the end finally does come, it moves in pretty abruptly, as something of a less than interesting anticlimax, long after the plot has fully unraveled, and you are left wondering just how much of the script was edited out. In fact, the last half of the film seemed rushed.Absolute Power is a plot heavy film. Less character-driven and less action oriented than most of its genre peers, the film relies on strong but underdeveloped performances, the likability of its antihero (Eastwood) and what could have been a very engaging string of scenarios culminating in a powerful conclusion. Plot heavy films can be good films if they stick to their heavy story-lines. However, and inexplicably, Absolute Power derails about half way through and never really gets back on track. Instead, none of these potentialities are explored fully and we are left with only petty revenge, a little misapplied justice, and the rebuilding of a relationship between the story's most likable characters (Linney and Eastwood). Yawn. An entertaining little show with a few really good moments, but nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A burglar may be less of a crook than a politician</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some actors, upon reaching their sixties or seventies, retire. Some enter into a sort of semi-retirement whereby they continue to accept cameo parts but not leading roles. Some, however, try and revisit the triumphs of their youth by making the same sort of films that they were making twenty or thirty years earlier. There are too many examples to list them all, but I was less than enthusiastic to note that Sylvester Stallone, at the age of sixty, has just made his sixth "Rocky" film and is currently working on his fourth "Rambo".Clint Eastwood is a rare example of a star who managed to remain a leading man throughout his seventh and into his eighth decade, but did so without a desperate attempt to put the clock back. (Doubtless his status as a director and producer has given him a greater influence inside the industry than many of his contemporaries). In his early sixties he made "Unforgiven", one of the all-time great Westerns, in which he starred as an ageing gunfighter, and since then has made a number of other films, such as "The Bridges of Madison County" and "Million Dollar Baby", in which an older man takes centre stage. Occasionally his roles have contained elements of an old man's wishful thinking, such as his romance with Rene Russo in "In the Line of Fire", but even in that film his character's age was important to the plot."Absolute Power", made when Eastwood was sixty-seven, is another older man's film. His character, Luther Whitney, is a veteran burglar who has broken into the Washington mansion of an elderly millionaire named Walter Sullivan, where, from his hiding-place, he inadvertently witnesses a killing. Sullivan's young wife Christy enters the bedroom with her lover, who is none other than the President, Allen Richmond. What starts out as a consensual love-making session goes wrong when Richmond, clearly a lover of rough sex, starts slapping Christy. She takes exception to this and slaps him back. Things get out of hand, and she attempts to stab him with a letter-opener. Richmond calls for help and his Secret Service bodyguards burst into the room and open fire, killing Christy.Some reviewers have described Christy's killing as "murder", but legally this is not correct. Had the two bodyguards ever stood trial for murder, they would have been acquitted as they were only carrying out their duty to protect the President's life, but things never get that far. Richmond is too shocked to take any action, but his Chief of Staff Gloria Russell, realising that if the truth ever came out it would destroy his career, organises a cover-up. When the President's staff realise that Luther was a witness to the killing, he is forced to go on the run.This could have been the plot of a very mundane political thriller, but Eastwood, both as actor and director, is able to lift it above that level. Despite Luther's criminal tendencies, Eastwood is able to make him a sympathetic figure, a man with his own sense of decency and honour. He had the assistance of a very strong cast, featuring some of Hollywood's most accomplished actors. There is E.G. Marshall in his last feature film as Sullivan, Gene Hackman (always a very watchable villain) as the hypocritical Richmond, Judy Davis as Gloria and Ed Harris as the police chief who is investigating Christy's death and soon comes to realise that there is more to it than meets the eye. A particularly important role is played by the very talented Laura Linney as Luther's daughter Kate. She has become estranged from her father as she disapproves of his criminal lifestyle and now works as a criminal lawyer, prosecuting on behalf of the police. When she realises that her father is in danger, however, she comes to his assistance, and they start to rebuild their relationship.The idea that their President might be a philanderer would have come as no surprise to most Americans in the mid-nineties, even though this film came out just before President Clinton was caught up in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Eastwood was not, however, interested in doing something along the lines of "Primary Colors" or "Wag the Dog"; there is no attempt to make Richmond a disguised portrait of Clinton, and we do not even learn if he is a Democrat or Republican. "Absolute Power" is intended as a thriller, not a satirical comedy. Nevertheless, it does tap into the feeling that many Americans have had, ever since the Watergate affair, that their Presidents cannot always be trusted to tell the truth. It is significant that the hero of this film is a burglar by trade; the implication is that such a man may be less of a crook than a politician. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely enticing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HIGHS--A very fun plot. Gene Hackman could vilify Ghandi given the right lines. Clint Eastwood as a high-stakes jewel thief?? I'm in heaven. Soft, subtle score; typical of modern Eastwood films. Intense finale that has you rooting for the bad guys, or is it the good guys?? You decide. E. G. Marshall's version of a scorned billionaire is a wonderful turn.LOWS--I have not read Baldacci's novel this is based upon. But I have to think, Clint Eastwood was not who he had in mind for the elusive cat burglar Luther Whitney. That casting was probably a little too self-serving. Also, I did enjoy the plot. But maybe a touch of more believability would have been nice. The murder scene at the beginning, while necessary for the remainder, may be a touch too implausible for my taste. PARTING IMPRESSION--Solid entertainment. This rating denotes that. Sure, won't win any Oscars, but that's not why you really want to see a film like this. We all root for these high stakes take-the-money-and-run type finales and here we are satiated in the chicanery, the likes of which could only emanate from D.C. Seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Eastwood Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood, nobody's fool, seems to alternate between quiet, almost arty films, and commercial thrillers or comedies. This is probably an above-average example of one of his thrillers.The plot -- in brief -- Eastwood is a highly skilled thief and in the process of burglarizing a rich old man's house he witnesses the murder of the owner's wife by the President of the United States (Gene Hackman) and two of his Secret Service agents. Clint manages to get away, carrying some damaging evidence with him. The police narrow down the list of suspects until only Clint is left plausible. Thereafter he is hunted by the police (Ed Harris), a hit man hired by the tycoon (E. G. Marshall), and the Secret Service (Judy Davis and Scott Glen). There is a subplot involving Clint's estranged daughter (Laura Linney) who gets together with Ed Harris in the film's course. In the end, through Clint's deft weaseling about, justice is done.I had a bit of a problem with the film's moral calculus. E. G. Marshall, one of the world's richest men, is a good guy. We are told this repeatedly and he's shown a good deal of respect by people who should know. But then why did he "give the presidency" to a murdering, philandering fool like Hackman? And SHOULD he have? He loses our sympathy when he hires a hit man to kill Eastwood. Evidently, somehow, he manages to stab the president to death. The script seems to want us to applaud him for dealing out power and justice as he sees fit, and to respect him even after he kills Hackman and lies about it on TV, using the pat phrase, "He was like a son to me." "Good man," my foot.It's rather a gutsy movie. In most of them, when a "high government official" is involved in some really nefarious business like murder, it's usually someone of lesser status than the President himself. (Cf., "No Way Out," in which, in a similar role, Hackman is Secretary of Defense or something.) In all of its aspects -- its photography, location shooting, musical score, and performances -- it's professionally competent. If it doesn't probe anyone's psych, it doesn't matter because it's easy to be swept up in the events and the clarity of the characterization. It even rises above that level in its dialog. The plot may be no more imaginative than is called for, but the writers have thrown in some sparkling bon mots.Harris and Glenn are talking in a parking lot and introduce each other. Harris remarks that Glenn is famous as a state trooper for his heroism. Glenn: "I was younger and dumber then." Harris: "Yeah, I was younger then but I think I'm dumber now." When E. G. Marshall is negotiating with the hit man, he offers him three million dollars to kill Eastwood, who he believes murdered his wife. Hit man: "You're a good salesman." Marshall: "Selling sin is easy." And when Harris first finishes interrogating Clint, Harris says, "I'll see you tomorrow." Clint smiles gaily and replies: "Tomorrow is promised to no one." Now -- I'm not claiming that these are Shakespearean flights of poetry, but they're at least as good as a lot of well-known lines from B movies like "Detour." ("What is money? Just a piece of paper crawling with germs.") At least after hearing them you don't want to take a can of scouring powder to your auditory canals and clean out the accumulated garbage. Whoever is responsible for lines like that HAD to think beyond the merely utilitarian.Nice journeyman job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tense powerful crime and brilliance from Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Narrative.A consistent plot involving many different types of characters in the form of organised professional robber Whitney (Marvellously portrayed by Eastwood) who is involved in a huge conspiracy involving the very uncomfortable president Hackman.Perhaps the story gets too involved at points with a lack of realism. However the film is always tense and engaging, especially the beginning which was definitely one of my all time favourite openings to a crime film. Tense, exciting and with a few twists it presents a realistic view of a robber caught up in what will surely be a huge case.The story justifies the genre by being focused upon murders and robberies and adds sentimental value in the form of family and friendship values. Laura Linney (The Truman Show) is terrific as Eastwood's daughter and adds a great sentimental value to a heavy crime film. She is involved in a great twists towards the end which is a must watch.The ending surprised me. Although there were great twists, the final few scenes and the way the narrative came to never felt quite justified in my opinion but then again I may have been expecting too much from a film that was consistent and engaging from the beginning. The film is always kept exciting through the tense robbery scenes, character actions and a plot about a man and his power.Direction.Eastwood's direction is simply breathtaking. The opening sequence where he explores the neatly kept mansion for his robbery is the best moment in the entire film; I was literally on the edge of my seat. Dark, quiet and with a grace that any director would be proud of I held my breathe from start to finish. Heavy critics may argue it conforms too much to an action styled genre with many shots appearing focusing in or around the main priority but I appreciated it for what it was, which was sheer brilliance.Eastwood is outstanding in the whole of this film. Not only his ability to pull off a stern ageing character but this direction is also worthy of huge praise.watch it if...you enjoy the crime genre and appreciate tense dramatic sequences.but its simply just worth watching for the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable Clint Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Washington DC -1990s. Luther Whitney, reputed one the very best thieves of the country but supposedly retired, is in the process of executing his greatest robbery ?the private vault of a powerful billionaire, Walter Sullivan. But he is disturbed by the billionaire's young wife. Christy takes advantage of her husband's absence to receive her lover ?the US President himself. President Richmond is a sick pervert, and the love affair turns sour. In front of hidden Whitney, the lady is murdered. Before escaping, Whitney secures the murder weapon, but he will need all his experience and skills to manipulate the secret services and the very competent police investigator Seth Frank. Not only must he protect himself but also his estranged daughter Kate. Not to worry however ?Luther Whitney is Clint Eastwood, after all! And since the suspense in this respect is minimal, we can just relax and enjoy watching one of our coolest supermen smoothly make his way through a nicely structured scenario. Although the action itself is ageless, one sign definitely links the movie to the 90s ?the blatant lack of respect for the person of the US President and the undisguised criticism of political corruption. Maybe a way to exorcise the scandals that have been plaguing the White House over the last decades?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Running Scared...then a 180*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a well-paced Clint film that is fit for a heart-attack! The cast that accompanies Eastwood is flawless. As 'Luther' the old 'cat' who has made a fine career out of stealing, is at a major moral crossroad...from what he had witnessed on 'the job' that never should have taken place, in front of him. This is a stunner, that keeps your pulse pounding in places and slows down to a normal pace in other spots, and it all works perfectly. Eastwood's style is second to none, as he makes his way through this thrill-ride of an enthralling story. He is very thought-provoking as he works to figure his 'escape', then a moral dilemma of major proportions hits him like a ton of brick!! His whole mission, has changed at that point and he knows it. From then on, he is set on a new course of decisive action. Next to actors like Scott Glenn and Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Judy Davis Dennis Haybert, that is pretty solid for a cast, all the players pull their own weight. But then with the addition of Gene Hackman, this is a frantic paced unveiling of events.This for sure, rounds out my top of the top great films... This is recommended as a Clint Eastwood fun, solid action, white knuckled thriller that is satisfying for most discreminating movie-mogals I would believe. (*****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Power???? Absolute rubbish more like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan and I think I'm dangerously close to being in love with the beautiful Laura Linney. Combine the two and what do you get? A film made in heaven? No - nearer to hell in fact.I read somewhere that Eastwood was so methodical and resolute in his film making that he managed to shoot Absolute Power 3 weeks ahead of schedule and 2-4 million under budget. Now, I don't know if he had spent that money and time on the film if it would be an improvement but it couldn't be any worse.Right from the get-go this film is doomed. Hackman (a criminally underused Hackman) is the President having some midnight fun with the wife of his biggest supporter. He gets a little rough, she fights back too much for the liking of the secret service men who in the end shoot her dead in her own bedroom. All of this is witnessed by Eastwood hiding in a secret vault room. The chase is now on. But the thing is - nothing - not one single thing afterwards, fits. There is NO suspense, no drama, a sequence of events that would make your eyes water with incredulity and enough plot holes to drive a truck through - sideways.I won't (can't - don't have the space nor the time) go into all of the issues with this film but here's a flavour: 1. Eastwood abseils out a window of the crime scene with a pack that must weigh a ton on his back - filled with jewels/cash and then manages to outrun 2 trained secret service agents through a forest. Now the fact that Eastwood is quite obviously an old man carrying substantial weight doesn't seem to matter. The two guys following him must be 25 years younger, are armed and even have night vision goggles !!!! Yet cannot catch him.2. The day after the theft/murder, Ed Harris, the police investigator, walks into his office, holding Eastwood's file. He says something about how a friend of his told him there are only 6 guys IN THE ENTIRE WORLD that could pull off that theft and only 1 of those 6 lives in D.C. - Eastwood! Is this how police investigation works??!! Very convenient that he just lives right under their noses too.3. Harris then persuades Eastwood's daughter - Linney (again criminally underused) to set up her dad and bring him in. She agrees. Why? I don't know. But the set-up goes wrong and she is shot at by 2 snipers (one SS guy and another hired killer). Then Harris takes her home and starts flirting with her. Embarrassingly. I would have thought she would be a little aggrieved that he nearly got her and her father killed a few hours previous, but no... she invites him in for water and flirts back! This stretches believability to the max here. Why would a beautiful, successful lawyer even look at a small, balding cop who almost got her killed? To make matters worse, Eastwood - at the end of the movie encourages his daughter to get together with this cop. WHAT?!! 4. One of the snipers is set up in a hotel room of some sort with a big window. After building his rifle like something from an airfix kit, (the SS man is simultaneously building his click-together gun too) he HOLDS THE RIFLE OUT OF THE WINDOW waving it about. The place is in the middle of a high traffic, public domain, SWARMING with cops as well, in daylight! 5. Eastwood turns up in disguise. My dog would come up with a better disguise. A hat and a Mac left over from Columbo. Terrible.6. The President then sends the SS guys to find Eastwood's daughter. I thought they would bring her in for questioning or put the squeeze on her, but they simply follow her until she parks her car at the edge of a cliff prior to a run. Rather than arrest her and bring her in for questioning (or use as bait), they simply push her over the cliff and drive away? What purpose does that possibly serve?7. After Eastwood finds out that the SS is taking over surveillance of his daughter, he drops a public phone, speeds across the city from a phone booth in the middle of who knows where, screeching his tires and blowing his horn repeatedly through traffic to the same spot where Linney has just been pushed over the cliff. How did he know she would be there? At no time, did he see his daughter's car or talk to his daughter. How did he know to find his daughter there ?8. At the end when the billionaire husband walks in to the President with the knife in his hand , confronts the President and CUT- there is a scene cut - and later it is announced that the President stabbed himself to death. WHAT? I could go on for another 5 pages with things that were just happening for the sake of it or Eastwood appears out of nowhere but I won't bore you any longer.Given Eastwood's pedigree behind the camera, I am majorly surprised at this shoddy effort. He had a good cast Linney, Harris, Glenn, Hackman, Haysbert and a decent premise of a story - but the haphazard way this is thrown together is nothing short of abysmal.3/10 - 5 points for Linney alone, 1 point taken away for Harris' terrible flirting and another point taken away for the serious amount of plot holes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine, intelligent thriller, with thanks to Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Judy Davis, among others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the president of the United States may not be the nicest guy in the world. Well, we've known that can be the case since 1789. So the idea of our presidents engaging in sexual shenanigans may be as uncomfortable as realizing our parents do it. Well, we've learned more than we want to know over the last few decades about how our presidents spend their time when they aren't bringing peace to the world and ensuring our domestic tranquility. One of the reasons Absolute Power is such a fine thriller is that it involves the dirty doings -- murder, cover-ups, self-serving righteousness -- of those in high elected office. Absolute Power is the story of Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood), "one of the great thieves of the world," who breaks into the mansion of Walter Sullivan (E. G. Marshall), a very rich, very powerful and very old political kingmaker. But then Luther hears voices and has to hide in a bedroom vault with a one-way mirror. He has to watch the rough sex between the rich man's much younger wife and a friend of hers. When things get out of hand and she angrily starts to do some stabbing, suddenly two very competent men break in and shoot the lady dead. They're followed by an aggressively competent woman who proceeds to clean things up and spin a story that a thief must have killed the lady of the house. Luther comes to realize that the two shooters are Secret Service agents, the competent woman is Gloria Russell (Judy Davis), the president's chief of staff, and the man is Allen Richmond (Gene Hackman), the unscrupulous president of the U. S. Luther is spotted and barely escapes but Russell and the two agents manage to identify him. They also learn he has an estranged daughter, Kate Whitney (Laura Linney), a young prosecutor. At first Luther decides to take his accrued wealth and flee the country. Then he sees a press conference on television where Richmond uses the grief-stricken Sullivan, who made him president, in a smarmy soap opera of shared grief. Luther changes his mind and decides to see that justice is done. Luther's brand of justice is resourceful, clever and dangerous. All the while he has to deal with an honest homicide cop, Seth Frank (Ed Harris), who is on his trail, an assassin hired by Sullivan to kill whoever killed his wife, and the machinations of Gloria Russell, determined to shield Richmond, aided by the two Secret Service agents. One, Bill Burton (Scott Glenn), has a conscience. The other, Tim Collin (Dennis Haysbert), does not. Eastwood and writer William Goldman have, in my opinion, concocted a fine, intelligent thriller that plays off Eastman's age ("Go down a rope in the middle of the night? If I could do that, I'd be the star of my AARP meetings."), gives us some fine set pieces (the break-in, killing and cleaning up; the attempt on Luther's life by two separate assassins when he meets his daughter; and the wonderfully played dance at a White House ball between Hackman and Davis) and which is told at a more-or-less human-sized scale. While I think perhaps too much time was spent on the relationship between Luther and his daughter, it's this relationship, well acted between Eastman and Linney, that helps raise the movie beyond just another thriller. Three things make this movie so good. First, there are two sets of intriguing relationships, one of which is poignant and tender, the other almost grotesquely amusing. The Eastwood- Linney situation is the first. And then there is the Allen Richmond-Gloria Russell pas de dieux. He depends on her but we know he'd toss her out in a minute if he needed to. She depends on him, probably loves him, and would gut her mother to protect him and her power ("I'll take care of everything. Like I always do."). It's fascinating, especially as played out by Hackman and Davis. Their White House waltz at the ball, where Davis is coy because she thinks the necklace she received was a present from Richmond, and Richmond knows, and tells her, that the necklace was the one worn by Sullivan's wife and that it had to have come from Luther Whitney, is a classic lesson in acting. The two of them play every emotion you can think of, all the while dancing in close-up and smiling for the admiring guests. The scene is a tour de force and immensely funny. Second, this movie is so good for what Eastwood and Goldman don't do. This is a thriller without explosions, without wild car chases and without star posing. We're left to focus on the story, on the intelligence of the dialogue, on the cleverness of the situation. As Roger Ebert said, "it's a thriller not upstaged by its thrills." Third, and most importantly, is the casting. The impact of the movie primarily rests with Eastwood, Hackman and Davis. Each one has shown many times that they can carry a movie by themselves. Judy Davis is the least known and has been stuck in character roles for years. However, just watch her in My Brilliant Career, A Passage to India or Children of the Revolution to see an actress who can dominate a movie. The second tier, made up of Ed Harris, E. G. Marshall, Laura Linney, Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert are just as effective. These are experienced actors who work well together and who know how to deliver their stuff. E. G. Marshall at 83 gives a performance that combines great sadness with an implacable sense of retribution. And Scott Glenn, such a good actor who has slowly slipped down to smaller, secondary roles, gives a performance of such regret it nearly distracts us from the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood plays and directs a professional work dealing with a thief who witnesses a grisly event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When expert thief Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood) breaks into the luxurious mansion of a politically influential billionaire (E.G. Marshall) , he is surprised by the arrival of a couple (Gene Hackman , Melora Hardin) . After their drunken shenanigans turn nasty that leads to crime and taking place a set-up in which everyone around him is involved . There is only one witness , an ultra-secretive master burglar . Luther is soon pursued by two cops (Ed Harris , Penny Johnson) , a hit man (Richard Jenkins) and the President security guards (Dennys Haysbert , Scott Glenn). This is a light thriller in Hitchcockian style including action , suspense , thrills , improbable events and twisted intrigue . It is about the ruthlessness of people in power but the plot lacks even a political analysis or comment . This Eastwood film is solid but nothing really stick out . It is hard to take against contemporary time , as portraying a coward , cynical , traitor President , being politically incorrect for Hollywood standards . In addition , it contains some unlikely scenes as when the silly dancing between President/Gene Hackman and his cabinet chief/Judy Davis who wears a robbed necklace . Based on the novel by David Baldacci , being screen-writer the notorious William Goldman , who wrote such important successes as Marathon man , Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid , All the President's Men , The princess bride , Misery , among others . This Absolute power (1997) was well-received as well as the subsequently shot Space Cowboys ; however , both of them don't rank with Clint's best jobs as actor/filmmaker . Adequate Clint Eastwood in his ordinary stoic acting as a professional burglar who witnesses both a crime and a cover-up . Nice acting by Gene Hackman as a philander President believes that everything he does is beyond reproach . Support cast is frankly well such as Laura Linney , Melora Hardin , Kenneth Welsh , Mark Margolis, Penny Johnson , Richard Jenkins and cameo of Alison Eastwood , Clint's daughter . Furthermore , the picture displays an atmospheric and sensitive musical score by means of piano composed and performed by Lennie Niehaus , Eastwood's usual . Colorful cinematography by Jack N. Green filmed on location in Washington and Los Angeles . The film was professionally performed and directed by Clint Eastwood . It has some flaws and gaps ; but it's nevertheless solidly agreeable . The picture is far from his other big hits such as his first directed western , Unforgiven (1992) also with Gene Hackman , which garnered him an Oscar for Best Director, and a nomination for Best Actor . Then he took on the secret service in Open fire (1993), which was a success , followed by the interesting but poorly received drama , A perfect world (1993), with Kevin Costner as a thief . Next up was a love story , Bridges of Madison (1995), which was yet again a hit . Subsequent pictures were enjoyable but nothing to do with previous works . Among them were the and the badly received True crime (1999) and Blood work (2002) . Then in 2004, Eastwood surprised yet again when he produced, directed and starred in Million Dollar Baby (2004). The movie earned Eastwood an Oscar for Best Director and a Best Actor nomination for the second time . He had other successes directing the multi-award-winning films Mystic River (2003), Flags of our fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), and The changeling (2008) . After a four-year hiatus from acting, Eastwood's return to the screen in the successful Gran Torino (2008) .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, that, ok maybe some of the actions of this film are a little manifested, but nevertheless, it holds for some nice suspense when it is required, and it also has a lot of eclectic moments(i.e. moments when the feeling is far from previous, yet conveyed appropriately). Besides the plot, this film has a wonderful, albeit short, soundtrack(composed by Clint), and good settings. A nice little ending on it too. Oh, and I have to say that Ed Harris is a excellent at 'doing' the sarcastic cop. I love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Absolute Power" entertains Absolutely!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood makes two kinds of movies. He cranks out sure-fire popcorn hits such as "Dirty Harry" (1971) and "Pale Rider" (1985). At the same time, he gambles with unproven, oddball projects such as "Pink Cadillac" (1989) and "A Perfect World" (1993). Eastwood's latest opus "Absolute Power," co-starring Gene Hackman, Judy Davis, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, and Scott Glenn, combines elements of both kinds of Clint flicks. Altogether, "Absolute Power" is a laid back, efficient potboiler that avoids rabid sensationalism but delivers the goods.In "Absolute Power," Clint plays Luther Whitney, a elderly but hi-tech cat burglar. During a jewelry heist at the posh estate of a well-known Washington, D.C. power broker, a drunken couple interrupt Luther as he's cleaning out the safe. He is trapped in a closet that houses the vault and valuables, but he remains undetected throughout the tryst. Suddenly,things get rough, and the man (Gene Hackman) finds himself in a deadly fight with a scorned woman. She stabs him once in the arm and is poised to plunge a letter opener into his chest when his Secret Service bodyguards scramble in and gun her down. Meanwhile, a shocked Luther sits quietly in the closet behind a two-way mirror and grimly contemplates his future. The man responsible for the murder of the socialite is none other than the President of the United States!Republicans will no doubt stand in line and argue that Alan Richmond (Hackman) is a Democrat. The President in "Absolute Power" is insidious. Gene Hackman, a gifted actor who can turn his emotions on and off as easily as a water facet, excels in his portrayal of a philandering President. The President's Chief of Staff (Judy Davis) struggles to keep a lid on the murder. The Secret Service agent (Scott Glenn) who shot the girl bows to the Chief of Staff's decision not to summon the police. They clear the room of all evidence. But they lose the incriminating letter opener. When they go back, they find it gone and a rope hanging out a bedroom window. They realize somebody witnessed the murder, but they fail to capture him."Absolute Power" contains a couple of classic scenes. The President's tango with his chief of staff in a room full of guests while they discuss the murder is superb. Eastwood's clash with a Secret Service agent at the hospital is hard-edged Old Testament revenge. If you're looking for a dandy confrontation scene between Eastwood and Hackman like the one they had in "Unforgiven" prepare to be disappointed. The Eastwood and Hackman characters never cross paths. Scriptwriter William Goldman of "Heat" has retooled David Baldacci's bestseller. Notably, he's changed the ending. "Absolute Power" has enough scenes from the popcorn style Clint movies to get it over the rough spots, but it strives to be different. Clint fans will approve of their hero's invincibility. As Luther Whitney, Eastwood doesn't miss a trick in besting the bad guys. But he doesn't play his usual taciturn loner. His role emphasizes him as his father figure more than his action figure. "Absolute Power" is rated R, but there's no nudity, little blood, and moderate profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luther Whitney is a professional thief, he also happens to be exceptional at it. During a carefully planned burglary at the home of wealthy Walter Sullivan, Whitney is disturbed to hear voices coming from outside the room he is in. Hiding in a secret room he observes from behind a two-way mirror the cheating wife of Sullivan with her lover for the night. Whitney is further startled to find that the man in the company of Mrs Sullivan is none other than the current president of the United States, Allen Richmond. He is then horrified to witness the couples union getting out of control, Richmond starting to get far too heavy handed with the lady in question. Things spiral out of control and during the fight Mrs Sullivan goes to stab the President with a paper knife, thus giving the entering secret service agents no choice but to gun her down. Sensing a political scandal, the agents and Richmond's Chief Of Staff, Gloria Russell decide to cover the incident up. Whitney, after making his escape, doesn't know what to do, who's going to believe a renowned thief, but crucially, will he be allowed to live if he comes forward? Dastardly goings on and government cover ups are merely part of what is going on in the search for Absolute Power.Absolute Power is a fine film, but I'm a little biased because I really like the pacing of the picture and more importantly, I like the plot. It's true that the film fails to capitalise on its first hour set up, we are brought into Whitney's world and given reminders of dodgy doings that blight so many countries political machinations, but then director Clint Eastwood and his team fall in to the trap of adding strands that merely alter the viewers attention span, thus taking us away from what was a concrete and wholly engrossing plot arc. But with a truly diamond cast of professionals in the piece, the film manages to stay the good side of good, tho the ending is one that is sure to be a divisive one for any prospective first time viewers. Eastwood stars as Whitney and is joined by Gene Hackman (President Allen Richmond), Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Scott Glenn, Dennis Haysbert, Judy Davis and E.G. Marshall. William Goldman adapts from David Baldacci's popular novel, and Eastwood's direction is the usual steady professional job that he would further enhance down the line with the likes of Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby.Should have been a truly great political based thriller/drama, but as it is, I settle for it being a way above average one that has far too many good points to ever see it as being below average or bad. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an entertaining thriller in spite of some implausible situations. Starring is Clint Eastwood who is at home as a loner who takes it upon himself to right wrongs, thwarts the activities of the rich and powerful and manages to stay just beyond the reach of the law and secret service agents. While not entirely faithful to the book, the film has its moments and moves along at a good clip but the payoff is a bit of a let down, considering all the risks Eastwood takes to protect his estranged daughter from harm. The cast, especially Gene Hackman, is great, and Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn are always good. The smooth, urbane E.G. Marshall, in his final movie, seems a bit out of character as a vengeful widower. Taken on its own level, the film delivers in fine style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What The Burglar Saw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goodness me, I'm surprised at the low overall rating of this movie, to say nothing of the caustic commentaries of those who gave it the thumbs-down. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. I certainly don't dispute the fact that there were some gaping plot holes, but the tension, the psychological baiting, and the stellar acting quality from some of my favourites were more than enough to make up for any shortcomings. Knowing what we know about Bill Clinton's philandering (or Kennedy's, come to that) the idea of such a death and its monstrously hypocritical concealment doesn't seem so far-fetched. In fact, conspiracy theorists have been hot on the Kennedy trail for years. Perhaps they were the inspiration for the original David Baldacci novel upon which this movie was rather loosely based. I myself have not read it through, so cannot judge. Eastwood acts, and directs himself, in a role that carries far more depth and conviction than I have seen him play in any movie except perhaps 'Bridges Of Madison County'. Here, he gets to play an ageing and unscrupulous thief, an estranged but doting father, and at last an avenging agent-provocateur. Simplistic, shoot-'em-up Dirty Harry is long gone. Ed Harris plays the investigating police officer, who gradually realises that there's more going on than meets the eye. There's a sly little thing begins developing between him and Eastwood's daughter. He offers a nice pitch between candour and suspicion.Gene Hackman plays the president, using his 'obnoxious' method style to full advantage. There is excellent support all round. Scott Glenn is very good as the conscientious lieutenant torn between conflicting loyalties. And I particularly like E G Marshall, as the president's favourite, who is similarly trapped between grief, anger and shame. This guy seems to have been playing thoughtful old men in movies for as long as I've been going to the cinema. The script is fair rather than clever, but the quality of the players make the often mediocre lines seem perfectly normal and genuine. There are some fine moments of tension, especially during the assassination attempts. The pacing, camera-work and lighting are competent if not imaginative. And the incidental music and sound effects are all that a good thriller should possess. The ending is a little weak. The fate of the president seems implausible to say the least. Yet for the most part you get a good run for your money up to that point. It is considerably better than the re-makes of 'Get Carter and 'The Italian Job'. I bought the DVD. Admittedly, I only paid ?3.00 at the supermarket, but I'm perfectly happy to have it in my collection. If you like Eastwood in his more thoughtful old-age, give it a whizz. He's as good as he is in 'Unforgiven', even if that movie itself is ultimately better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute Power (1997, R)Produced and Directed by Clint Eastwood.Written by William GoldmanLet me start off saying two things to two people. Number one, to William Goldman: I'm not saying this because I'm supporting or defending Clinton (which I'm NOT), but do please stop writing political thrillers. Number two, to Ed Harris: well, at least it was better than Stepmom.Number three actually would have gone to Clint Eastwood: please stop starring, producing, and directing your own movies but he obviously got the point as nary a frame of the intriguing Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil shows him.That said, let's go on to my review of Absolute Power, which is twenty notches above Murder at 1600, which I saw being filmed, but a hundred notches below Six Days in May, In the Line of Fire, or about any other political thriller you can name.Absolute Power is pleasantly medicore. You don't expect much, and you don't get much.It is yet another film following the Clinton chic of films, books, etc which show our nations President as someone who's able to get laid, in constrast to someone who couldn't get it up without Viagra. Absolute Power is the story of a President who has sex with a girl and, whoops, ends up killing her. Unlike Murder at 1600, which shows the girl being done right in the opening credits, Absolute Power waits a nice ten to fifteen minutes before getting down to business.When it gets down to business, Luther (Clint Eastwood ) is breaking into an estate to steal millions. His perfect heist is interrupted by something unplanned: the president is going to have sex with the billionaires wife. Things get a little rough, one thing leads to another, and the girl ends up shot by secret service agents seconds before she's going to give President Al (Gene Hackman) a Lorraina Bobbit.Of course, since we live in the wonderful democracy where everyone is free to make a dumbly plotted and cliche film as they want, the Chief of Staff decides its for the best if the girl stumbled upon a burglary and was shot. Forget for a second that her dress has been ripped, the President's fingerprints are all over her, and a secret service agent (Scott Glenn) made sure he hadn't done a Bill Clinton.Now, going out of the character of a jewel thief who just witnessed a murder from a secret room and stole $5,000,000 worth of material, Clint grows a heart, picks up the piece of evidence left behind, and leaves. Of course secret service agents chase him. Of course he runs into a cop (Ed Harris) who believes him because the facts don't add up, and of course his daughter (Laura Linney) grows closer to the old man through a complicated process of stocking her fridge at just the right time and saving her life.The only really redeeming aspects to the film, the saving graces against terrible performances by the ensemble cast and William Goldman's piss-poor script is the steely direction by Clint Eastwood. Mixing in just the right amount of light, the right tone and time of the music and working with such a terrible script, Clint Eastwood does directing up to par with A Perfect World and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. He's as good of a director as he always was, and that alone makes the film enjoyable. He gives as much that he can to a movie with such a bad script, as do the actors. This will be on the movie's gravestone: "They tried, they really tried".Now, from all of this, you'd expect that I'm telling you to skip Absolute Power. I'm not. I'm just saying don't drive to rent it. Should Absolute Power be on TMC or Showtime, like it was for me, go ahead and watch it. You'll have fun. If you're a Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry jag, see it. It's just up in the air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beats True Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute Power is an exciting thriller and one of the better latter-day films that Clint has starred in. I thought True Crime was mediocre, Space Cowboys nothing but a gathering of names, Bloodwork pretty lame and boring and Million Dollar Baby...well, it's not really a Clint Eastwood film, is it? It is a Hilary Swank film, although Clint made perhaps his greatest performance ever in it.Anyway, the first couple times I watched Absolute Power, I thought it was OK but didn't do anything special for me. It is only now, after seeing it again after many years that I see its' quality. Not among Eastwood's greatest works or roles, but another exciting and pleasing work. After the sappiness of Bridges of Madison County this came as a breath of fresh air for us who appreciate "the real" Clint Eastwood. I am not putting down on that film either, but such roles are not really where he is best put at use.This film boasts a really marvelous supporting cast consisting of Gene Hackman, Laura Linney, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris and Judy Davis. All class acts. So if you have never seen it and are a fan of Eastwood, see it! If you have seen it before, but didn't quite get into it, give it another try. This really is one of Clint's last good thrillers, perhaps the last one that resembles his true classics.</fullReview>

A nice touch is the musical theme written by Eastwood himself, the second time of late he has done this. There's jazz anytime Eastwood can get it in there, but the performances from Linney and Ed Harris are convincing. This is a stellar cast that is used well.

It starts out slowly, with no dialog, then increases its yawn factor as words are added to this meandering, nonsensical script. There are so many disconnected and incomplete avenues in this film that the viewer suspects it is a parody of a real movie. It continues trudging along into an undeveloped storyline that makes the viewer wonder if anyone actually viewed this film before it was released onto an unsuspecting public. Hard to believe Clint Eastwood directed, produced and acted in this piece of human excrement. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing The Trophy Wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood directs and stars in Absolute Power, a film based on a book about a philandering president that came out in 1997. Now I wonder just who they could have had in mind?Gene Hackman who played so well against Eastwood in The Unforgiven is the president who has made a carefully arranged rendezvous with Melora Hardin, the trophy wife of a very powerful and elderly Washington insider, E.G. Marshall. When the sex starts to get rough because the two are quite inebriated, the noise attracts secret service bodyguards Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert. They shoot Hardin down as she's about to stab Hackman with a letter opener. What nobody knows is that Eastwood is hiding in a vault in the bedroom. Clint's a professional burglar who decided that night to pick that expensive townhouse to rob. After that the power of the federal government comes down on him because he can topple that selfsame government.Absolute Power is a nicely paced political/crime thriller combining those two genres nicely for most of the film. But an incredibly muddled ending will leave you completely in the dark as to what exactly has happened or what the future will be.Other performances of note are Laura Linney as Clint's estranged daughter who is of all things, a junior prosecuting attorney, Ed Harris as the tough homicide cop from the DC police force who's good on his job, but slow to realize the implications of what he's investigating. But best of all is Judy Davis as the hard as nails presidential chief of staff who tries for a cover-up and would have succeeded, but for Clint's unplanned presence at the crime scene.When Absolute Power came out no one could have missed the illusions to the Clintons. The first lady is never seen, she's on a mission to Africa while all the action takes place. But E.G. Marshall is very suggestive of Averill Harriman who was gone eleven years at that time, but who held that kind of influence within the Democratic party. He also had a much younger wife, but not quite the difference in ages between Marshall and Hardin. This film also marked the farewell big screen performance of E.G. Marshall. Marshall's scene with Eastwood in the limousine is the best in the film.I can't comment on how Daniel Baldacci's novel ended from which this film was adapted, but Clint should have opted for a much clearer ending. Then again such things even after Watergate are horrible to contemplate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially I must say I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and as a director. I love and admire his unforced and natural style of both acting and directing.I just now have watched this movie and am really disappointed. In one sentence - in my opinion - Clint didn't put his heart to this movie. No wonder, the plot is very weak, predictable and very, very artificial. I didn't believe a single moment in the movie. Also the screenplay contains only simple sentences what makes the characters quite flat. This is projected to the acting which is not really good. I haven't noticed one actor that would really try to do his best. All of the main actors can perform much better. But again this script wouldn't allow them. And finally I get to the directing jog - again quite poor. Clint definitely didn't push the actors and somewhat let them float through the scenes on a medium level.Summary - for a huge fan of Clint big disappointment. Average thriller with predictable and synthetic plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting take on politicians and their power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film like this would be impossible to make in the current year, here's why: Absolute Power makes a sad but true political statement, a statement about corruption, dishonesty and the dark nature that all people have inside of them.This is what we see in Absolute Power. The president of the United States of America is portrayed as a corrupt, criminal person. While the thief, who would be seen as the bad guy in reality is actually the good guy. Corruption is our greatest enemy.This movie couldn't be made today, because nowadays we live in a more sensitive world than we lived in back in 1997 (the year or release). Absolute Power would have no chance of being released due to it's political undertones. Enough about the politics, let's talk a little bit about the movie.This film is not a stand out thriller, but it's not a bad one at all. We have a great cast with Clint Eastwood, my personal favorite actor, Gene Hackman and Ed Harris. They're all doing a fine job, but they're all not even close to their best performances. A thing this movie lacked for me was that big "WOW" moment. There are a few tense scenes scattered across the two hours, but there is no standout moment, action wise or character wise. The only moment that really got me was Luther watching TV at the airport, which was an interesting piece of character development.Absolute Power is a well written movie though, the plot ties together pretty good and it's not as predictable as most thrillers are. A fine movie overall, not highly recommended but if you're interested about political statements in film, then this is a good pick for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a an action political thriller movies, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Absolute Power (1997) is one of my favorite underrated Clint Eastwood powerful political thriller. This movie is misunderstood from critics and fans and they just don't get it the movie is for Entertainment, fun and it is powerful performed from all the actors. I don't care what anyone says about this movie I think Is Clint Eastwood another masterful movie done. The man can make an action and Absolute Power it is his Direction awesomeness and I grew up watching this movie and It is my childhood movie. I rather watch this movie than Gran Torino. I love this movie to death than I would like Gran Torino overrated movie. Great movie and check out the cast, with Eastwood leading. I really enjoyed this movie Clint you've done it again. Absolute Power is a great thriller featuring the legendary Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman. Supporting them are the equally great Ed Harris, Laura Linney and Scott Glenn. Each performance enhances the to close for comfort cat and mouse game that pertains to the plot and the overall outcome of the picture.This is what a movie should be, plot and character development come first and special effects come second. Clint Eastwood did direct and acted brilliantly. Gene Hackman as president did amazing job, this is the second time Gene Hackman played a villain along side with Clint Eastwood. 5. years earlier they played together in Clint Eastwood's masterpiece Unforgiven (1992) alongside with Morgan Freeman./: Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman reunite 12. years later in Million Dollar Baby my best favorite Clint Eastwood movie! Clint Eastwood's "Absolute Power'' is a tight, taut thriller with a twist: It's also about a father and daughter, estranged for years, who are finally able to become friends. Not many thrillers slow down to notice relationships, but this one does. What I don't understand is the hate for this movie? A comment from a hater: "Evidently the people who liked the movie never read the book! I have never watched a movie that so totally dismissed the plot laid out in the book. Why Mr. Baldacci would sign off on this movie is an even bigger question?" - -&gt; My reply: Why would I care about a book? I don't care about the novel or a book if I can watch the movie! I have enjoyed this movie of Clint Eastwood's acting performance. The movie is entertaining and I have enjoy it so so so so much. I love this movie to death it is in my Blu-Ray collection! If you did not like it sucks for you! Read your book and leave my movie alone! This movie just doesn't deserve to bashed and criticized from haters the actors does all great job in this movie. I don't think this movie is the greatest movie, but it is a good movie and I love it! Clint Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a burglar who breaks into a mansion in the dead of night and penetrates a hidden room filled with diamonds and cash. He's interrupted in the middle of his work by visitors. Hiding behind a two-way mirror, he sees a man and woman having sex. The play turns rough, the man beats her, the woman stabs him, and two men burst in and shoot her dead. Eastwood watches, all but his eyes in shadow. He is about to intervene--risking discovery--when the gunshots ring out. He escapes from the mansion down a rope from a third-floor window, carrying with him the deadly knowledge that the woman was the younger wife of an 80-year-old millionaire, and the man was the president of the United States. What we have here is a setup that could be developed in a lot of ways. The recent and dreadful "Shadow Conspiracy" detailed a White House plot that was cheerfully absurd. "Absolute Power,'' based loosely on a best-selling novel by David Baldacci, could have been as silly, but it's not because Eastwood uses fine actors and a smart script by William Goldman to make it into something more. Ed Harris as Detective Seth Frank did a slick job and awesome performance acting his character. I love him in every way, everyone does a fine a job. Overall I am giving this movie 10/10 because the movie got me on a edge of my seat. Absolute Power is a 1997 American political thriller film produced by, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a master jewel thief who witnesses the killing of a woman by Secret Service agents.10/10 Grade: A+ Studio: Castle Rock Entertainment Malpaso, Productions, Columbia Pictures Starring: Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert, Scott Glenn, Judy Davis, Melora Hardin, E.

		<shortDescription>old Eastwood in slow thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood) is a master burglar. He breaks into the mansion of President's friend tycoon Walter Sullivan (E.G. Marshall). From behind a two-way mirror, he sees President Allen Richmond (Gene Hackman) having sex with Walter's wife Christy. It gets rough. Secret Service Agents Bill Burton (Scott Glenn) and Tim Collin (Dennis Haysbert) kill her. Chief of Staff Gloria Russell (Judy Davis) tries to cover up the incident by staging a burglary. Luther manages to steal an incriminating piece of evidence. His daughter Kate Whitney (Laura Linney) is his only family. Police detectives Seth Frank (Ed Harris) is investigating the case.The opening could not be any slower. Eastwood is feeling the weight of that AARP membership card. The tension never gets too high. There's a couple of good scenes but they are few and far between. The other problem is that much of this movie doesn't make sense. Somebody makes an off chance comment that the burglar cleaned up. It would make sense for the police to check the vacuum cleaner. Luther tells Kate that the President is trying to kill him. It would make sense for her to seek protection that a prosecutor presumably has access to. Why would he pass a note in the White House? It would make sense for him to lay low and his note adds nothing anyways. How does an old man stage a presidential suicide by knife? It would make sense for anybody with a brain to question its validity. This slow thriller has limited believability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, Tense &amp; Gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes of this classy thriller are so gripping that watching the rest of the action becomes totally irresistible. A cat burglar witnesses a murder in highly unusual circumstances and then has to go on the run to escape those who want to make him the fall guy for the crime. The fact that his pursuers are intent on assassinating him, then turns his already dangerous mission into a desperate race against time.Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood) is the veteran thief who, for the last heist of his career, breaks into the mansion owned by political power broker Walter Sullivan (E.G.Marshall) when he and his family are apparently away on a short vacation. After making his way to the vault that adjoins the main bedroom, Luther steals large amounts of jewellery and cash but then suddenly has to stop when he hears people heading in the direction of the bedroom. Hidden in the vault, Luther watches silently through a two-way mirror as the President of the United States, Allen Richmond (Gene Hackman) and Walter Sullivan's much younger wife, Christy (Melora Hardin) enter the bedroom and start indulging in some sexual foreplay. The exchanges between the drunken couple quickly turn violent and when Christy stabs Richmond in the arm with a letter-opener, a couple of Secret Service agents rush into the room and shoot Christy dead.White House Chief of Staff, Gloria Russell (Judy Davis) arrives on the scene and organises a cover-up to make it look as if Christy had been killed by a burglar and shortly after, Luther makes his escape with his loot and the letter-opener. In the days that follow, Luther changes his original plan to leave the country and becomes determined to bring the President to justice. Some complications develop, however, as his estranged daughter, Kate (Laura Linney) who's a prosecuting attorney and Detective Seth Frank (Ed Harris) cooperate to search for evidence and both the Secret Service and Walter Sullivan attempt to have him killed.By using his trump card (the letter-opener with the President's fingerprints and blood on it), Luther then tries to trigger a sequence of events that he hopes will lead to the President ultimately being made accountable for his role in Christy's murder.The pacing of this movie is masterful as it contributes both to the tension that's such a strong feature of what happens as well as being conducive to developing the relationships between the story's interesting characters. Clint Eastwood's direction is also impressive, especially during the opening scenes and in a later sequence where Luther meets his daughter at a caf in very dangerous circumstances."Absolute Power" is a fine adaptation of the best selling novel of the same name by David Baldacci and features a terrific cast of top actors who all contribute very good performances. A scene in which Detective Frank talks very affably to the man he suspects of carrying out the heist at Sullivan's mansion is a real highlight, as Ed Harris makes his comments so loaded and Clint Eastwood responds in the same style. Judy Davis also adds a lot of humour as the Chief of Staff who's in charge but not in control. Her eccentricities and constant state of panic add a more sympathetic dimension to her amoral character whilst also adding an effective counterpoint to the high level of tension that runs right through this entertaining thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Eastwood at His Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute Power (1997): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Judy Davis: Intriguing setup has a murder witnessed through a looking glass. The title can refer to the President who is guilty of a crime or the thief who witnessed it. Clint Eastwood stars as a thief who does drawings of the places he plans to rob. He lifts priceless items before hearing footfall so he ducks behind a two-way mirror. The President and a young woman enter and get intimate. After a struggle, two secret service men storm in and shoot her dead. The chief of staff constructs a plan to avoid conspiracy but they overlook the letter opener used by the victim, which the thief escapes with. Eastwood directs advocating brains over brawn in the solution. Humor is presented when he dons disguises and investigates. Gene Hackman is well cast as President whose victim was the daughter of a billionaire. Eastwood will toy with their paranoia until he meets his down fall. Ed Harris is superb as a cop who doesn't suspect the thief of murder and doesn't realize that his office phone has been bugged. Laura Linney provides an emotional centre as Eastwood's daughter who assists police and becomes a target. Judy Davis is effective as the scheming chief of staff. Theme regards corrupt lifestyles and a desire to revert even when his nature refuses. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this movie a seven star rating. And that's for me a movie that I enjoyed and might watch again in the future when I forgot about the story. Above 7 stars is a movie that I find very good to excellent. Under a 7 star it's a movie that I will never watch again. I thought Absolute Power was a nice entertaining movie. I first wanted to rate it an eight but there were a couple things that bugged me so I lowered it. I won't tell about it because I don't like spoilers.

		<shortDescription>Tight, Tense Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all my years of watching movies, I have come to respect Clint Eastwood as a very good, prolific director. Undoubtedly, the 2000's were his best decade in directing films. But in 1997, he directed this film, Absolute Power. It's not his best film, but it's still very good. It does everything a good thriller would do since it's tight, taut, tense, and will keep you on your toes. The ending seemed a bit abrupt, but the bulk of the movie is fantastic.Eastwood's film is about a master thief named Luther who becomes a national target when he witnesses a grave crime involving the President of the United States. With all local and federal agencies on his tail, what will Luther do? I love how Eastwood is able to get the most out of his actors in all his films and he has such a good cast to work with here. Eastwood himself is a very good actor and he is very good. Gene Hackman is in a smaller role that accustomed, but still does a great job. Same can be said for Ed Harris as the suspecting cop and Judy Davis as the slimeball Chief-In-Staff.Overall, this is a great thriller and one that raises an interesting scenario of real-life possibilities. I also like how Eastwood adds to the story. Unlike most thrillers, this takes a little time to develop characters and a father-daughter relationship that is plausible. That perhaps makes this movie even better. I was sold by this movie because it's tense and very thrilling. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burglar Clint Eastwood is targeted for a murder he didn't commit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Absolute Power" is a very competent thriller with quite strong neo-noir elements. There are, of course, some lapses in the story that make it less than a masterpiece, but overall it's above average and an enjoyable watch.Eastwood plays a sophisticated jewel thief who is burgling a cache of jewels hidden in a secret vault with a two-way mirror door. The residence and vault belong to the powerful E.G. Marshall who has managed to get his man in the White House, Gene Hackman. Hackman arrives with Marshall's young bride, and begins to be violent with her in sexual play. She defends herself, and when Hackman calls for help two Secret Service men shoot her dead. Eastwood sees the whole thing. The chief of staff of the President then arranges a cover up. Before long, Eastwood is targeted by the White House, by an assassin of Marshall and by policeman Ed Harris.This is not a hyped up thriller with phony thrills. It depends mainly on the plot intricacies and the nature of the characters playing off one another. It does have one or two set pieces in the body of the movie. The initial sequence of the burglary is deftly handled.For neo-noir elements, we have the sadistic behavior of the president and that he is betraying the man who put him in office. We have a cover-up operated by his chief of staff. Then there is the willingness of one of the Secret Service killers to dispose of Eastwood. The president later resorts to targeting Eastwood's daughter, on the premise that she knows what Eastwood knows. Another element is Marshall's behavior. Acting as judge, jury and executioner, he hires an assassin to kill Eastwood. By the end of the story, he's engaging in his own new cover-up. There's nothing like seeing the establishment portrayed as thoroughly corrupt and as corrupting the people around them. In fact, Eastwood would have gone his way to another town except that he cannot stomach seeing a hypocritical Hackman with Marshall in tow making a speech bemoaning Marshall's loss of his wife.Solid addition to Eastwood's body of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ABSOLUTE POWERI thought this was a really good movie.When I was younger I always avoided Clint Eastwood movies because I thought he was the typical western actor... but then I grew up and realised that this guy can actually act.The movie is about a thief who breaks into this mansion and starts to steal thousands of dollars worth of jewellery and money... but then someone comes home. He hides in a secret room behind a mirror and whilst there he witnesses a murder. The problem is, the thief is now accused of the murder and is on the run.The story is really good... and it kept me entertained throughout. There are some really good plot twists and some really good action scenes. The film was on for 2 hours and it was the perfect length.Absolute Power stars Clint Eastwood as the main character. Clint does a great job in this role. I never thought he could play a thief, but he was convincing. What I love about Clint is he is multi talented. He also produced and directed this movie.Other stars were Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney &amp; Dennis Haysbert. Everyone did a great job. I could not fault anyones performance in this movie.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It is a very good film, but not the best drama/thriller i have seen.For more of my reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

We are so surprised to see the same painting in the movie. Just want to learn more about the original work. Appreciate if anyone can shed us some light. Thanks! Btw, the movie was great!

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** It's when master Jewel thief Luther Whitney, Clint Eastwood,brakes into billion dollar philanthropist and political king maker Walter Sullivan's ,E.G Marshell Virginia mansion that he ends up becoming a witness to a murder that if exposed can shake the very foundations of power in the US Government! Hiding in a secret vault in the mansion Luther watches the President of the United States Allen Richmond, Gene Hackman, almost dead drunk getting rough and violent with the lady of the house Christy Sullivan, Melora Hardin, whom he's been having an affair with behind her husband's back from the last few months.With things getting out of hand and Christy getting the best of the drunken slob and about to run him through with a letter opener the secret service agents Bill Burton &amp; Tim Collins, Scott Glenn &amp; Dennis Haysbert, comes to Pres. Richmond's rescue and blast her away before she can do any damage! Luther who witnessed the entire spectacle, behind a two way mirror, checks out but takes with him the bloody letter opener that Agent Collins left that can tie Pres. Richmond to Christy Sullivan's murder! Instead of just laying low and forgetting about the whole thing, Christy Sullivan's murder, Luther takes it upon himself to bring the most powerful man in the world President Allen Richmond to the bar of justice which not only jeopardized his life but that of his estranged daughter Kate, Laura Linney, as well. It's then that the film takes a turn to the worst or unbelievable with Luther using his skills of disguise as well as intimidation to take on the entire power structure of the United States Government with the government from President Richmond on down seemingly powerless to stop him. A feat that even super cop "Dirty Harry" Calahan couldn't do!Clint Eastwood who's in his late 60's has trouble convincing the audience that he's at least 30 years younger in the action scenes that he's he's in. Eastwood also jokes about his age in telling the cop in charge of investigating the Christy Sullivan murder Seath Frank, Ed Harris,that he has to have his pacemaker checked out in all the pressure that Frank is putting on him in being a suspect in Mrs. Sullivan's murder. Yet Eastwood,or his stunt double, preforms action stunts that even an Olympic gold medalist gymnast would have trouble duplicating!***SPOILERS*** The end of the movie spears the audience the bloody details of the dramatic encounter, arranged by Luther Whitney, between Walter Sullivan and his best friend ,who he helped put in office, President Allen Richmond. That in Sullivan finding out that Richmond not only had an affair with his wife but also had her murdered to keep her mouth shut! As for Richmond's chief of staff dragon lady Gloria Russell, Judy Davis, who tried to cover up the whole bloody mess as well as tried to shut Luther up, by having him killed, she ends up getting all that's coming to her. Which we can't say for the actual killers of Christy Sullivan Burton &amp; Collins who took, or in the case of Collins got, the easy way out by never having to be put on trial from what they did! Luther Whitney made certain of that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talented Cast And Material Saves The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute Power is a political thriller produced, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood as a thief who witnesses a murder. The screenplay by William Goldman is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci.The film also stars Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Judy Davis, Laura Linney, Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn. It was also the last screen appearance of E.G. Marshall.In this thriller, an aging cat burglar becomes a crusader embroiled in a deadly cat-and-mouse game involving murder and a government cover-up. The trouble begins when ex-con Luther Whitney decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. Just as he finishes looting the vault of a well-fortified mansion, a drunken couple enters the adjoining bedroom apparently eager to start making love. But something goes awry and a violent tussle ensues that abruptly ends when gun-wielding men bust in and shoot down the woman. During the ensuing chaos, Luther slips out. Only later does the audience learn that the would-be lovers were U.S.- President Alan Richmond and Christy Sullivan, the young wife of the President's biggest supporter Walter Sullivan. As the investigation and cover-up begins, Luther, who has already been contacted by hard-boiled and suspicious detective Seth Frank begins to fear that he will be blamed for the killing and prepares to leave the country. He tries to see his daughter Kate to make peace with her for having been absent in prison during most of her life, but she rejects him. Luther goes to the airport, but just before he flies, he sees a press conference in which President Richmond, without so much as a twitch, goes on a tirade concerning his stand against violence. Something inside him snaps and he abruptly decides to stay and fight for justice. Adapted from a novel by David Baldacci and featuring a powerful all-star cast, the story works at different levels, not only as a straight- forward thriller but also as an insightful look at the love between the old thief and his estranged daughter, a highly successful prosecuting attorney.It had an immense potential to be a classic consider the talent of the cast involved in the movie.Unfortunately,the movie ended rather abruptly as it minimized the film to a thriller that lacks suspense and tension.Aside from that,there was a seemingly lack of effort in making a good film.What saves the film is the talent of the cast and the great potential the material had despite of its poor ending and contrived and formulaic events as the movie ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, but not terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has made some magnificent films, he's made some awful films, and he's made some so-so films. Absolute Power falls into the third category. It isn't awful by any means but I wouldn't call it a great film as it's really nothing special. Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a thief who witnesses the President of the United States get himself involved in a terrible crime. The secret service tries desperately to cover up this crime, trying to get to Luther before he says something. It's a dark and cynical film about the way absolute power corrupts absolutely. The film has a fun story filled with good performances from a wide collection of skilled actors. However, when you boil the film down it's really fairly dull and there are numerous issues and absurdities that keep it from being a great film.Absolute Power tries to be as believable as possible, striving to be a sincere suspense/drama, yet the plot grows more and more absurd as the film progresses and the plot thickens. The way the secret service handles their cover up just isn't believable in the slightest. At first it seems legitimate enough as they do all they can, but as the situation grows more dire they become more and more careless, making silly mistakes and taking unnecessary actions that would never occur in reality. Certain irrationalities obviously only exist to further the plot, breaking down the reality of the film.Yet, this film doesn't aggravate you and it doesn't slip into the realm of utter stupidity, just occasional irrationality. Thus it's still a mildly enjoyable film. The plot is engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention, despite it having no emotional pull and no sympathetic allure. It's devoid of any heart and we don't build any kind of strong connection with the characters. We only watch as they go about their business making a somewhat exciting story move along. I can give the film credit for having a story that is at least somewhat interesting from start to finish, and even has some really great moments every once in a while. There's one particular scene involving the police and two separate assassins that is actually pretty thrilling as it's unclear exactly what will happen. But one gripping scene isn't enough to make me love this film, but it keeps me from hating it. Overall, Absolute Power is a lackluster film that, although it does know what it's doing, doesn't do it particularly well. It might be worth one watch, but after that it's basically forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed it. I liked Ed Harris' subtle dry wit, (made me laugh out loud a few times), along with the father/daughter issues between Linney's and Eastwood's characters. The scene where Linney's character opens her fridge and discovers that it had been well-stocked by her Dad, whom she suspected earlier of spying on her for not eating well, was a gem. I thought it was a bit absurd for Eastwood's character to return the murder evidence to E.G. Marshall's character in the end. Marshall could have stabbed him with it, for starters. Why not give it to the police, who seemed to already know he wasn't guilty of murder? But then, as in real life, even smart people often do strange things at weird times. Oh... and for those who found it implausible that Linney's character would betray her Dad, she didn't. That's why we see Eastwood playing back the phone message a couple of times... she gives him clues that it's a probable setup and that he should beware. (Calling him "Dad" instead of "Father", stuttering, etc.) 2 of his daughters appear in the film, one of them Kimber, as the White House Tour Guide; the other, Alison, as an art student.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Power corrupts absolutely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read the review of this movie in the DB magazine it sounded really bad. Then I heard that DB hates everything except for really arty movies. Absolute Power, being a typical Hollywood movie, was not liked that much. Still the impression that I received from DB stuck in my mind but I still chose to watch it when my friend hired it from the video shop. Now that I have seen it I am glad that I didn't pay for it. The movie isn't all that bad, but there is a tendency to drag a scene out for much longer than is necessary. When Clint Eastwood breaks into the house of a very wealthy person, a lot of time is spent going over the paintings. Then when the president of the US comes in with some other guy's wife, the scene that ensues is over long and it is not until a little later that the whole purpose of the scene appears. The audience, when watching this scene, is not really sure who the two people are, though it is revealed later on. In one way it is supposed to add a mysterious nature to it because we are not supposed to know that this is the president, but Clint Eastwood, who is hidden behind a two way mirror, would no doubt know this. Absolute Power is sort a conspiracy movie. The President is involved in the murder of the wife of a powerful business man and it is covered up. One man who sees everything is not only a thief, but has evidence that will convict the president. The movie then goes into a chase where Clint Eastwood is attempting to evade the police and the presidents men who are trying to assassinate him while trying to expose the president for what he really is. What Absolute Power does though is expose the president as being as corruptible and despicable as everybody else. This is quite an impact on a nation who worship's their presidents. With the Watergate scandal (and the hotel is shown in this movie) the belief of presidential infallibility was somehow destroyed. I doubt that such a movie would have been tolerated twenty to thirty years ago.</fullReview>

Of course, the game is how Clint is going to prove it and how Gene Hackman, as President, is going to have him stopped/killed. A good cast, with Eastwood and Hackman reunited from Unforgiven, along with E G Marshall. Clint's daughter Alison, even is featured in an early role as an art student.Of course, the plot with a philandering president, is meant as a take off of the Clinton Administration with its Lewinsky/Flowers/Jones scandals.But overall, the film falls flat.

		<shortDescription>Read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading David Baldacci's gripping thriller, I decided to watch the movie based on the novel. When all was said and done, I was very glad I read the book first. Without giving too much away, characters that die in the novel are alive at the end of the movie, and one MAIN character was totally written out of the screenplay. Yes, I was disappointed by the film.However, if you haven't read the book, or if you enjoy mysteries/thrillers, this is still a pretty good flick. I admit I was biased by my previous experience.

		<fullReview>Well I certainly wish I could have written something like this! I love the economy of the writing above all - the performances are the cherry on top.Clint Eastwood is himself and yet not himself.Sitting on a mountain of subtext, he's got the stillest face in celluloid history, I'd bet. Ed Harris I always love and the scene in which he keeps reminding Laura Linney that he lives alone is utterly gorgeous. I tell you, this film held me from beginning to end.And the music - Kate's Theme at the end - one of the most poignant melodies i've ever heard, was written by none other than Clint Eastwood!!

There are some fine moments, such as the relationship between Eastwood and his daughter(Linney), and good performances, but they are sunk by a script full of implausibilities and predictable twists.

		<shortDescription>Quite absurd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Clint Eastwood's, but this time no! He soon discovered he was following the wrong trail and got bored and gave it up. The beginning maybe farfetched, but the ending is a travesty. We are told things happened that should be on screen; but seeing wouldn't have been believing it, and so - to paraphrase Mark Twain - he's drawn the curtain in a rush for pity's sake.Hackman has played the same role much better (and in a better movie) in the past, so he is very bored and he looks it.Casting people apparently wanted the late Lotte Lenya (Mrs. Klebb, remember?) for the part of the President's Chief of Staff, but had to compromise. Only Ed Harris is saved, as always (he's played in a lot of bad movies to be sure), excellent actor that he is.Now Clint may have been very angry with Bill at the time -- but this is no way to show him he was a bad boy. He stops short from having a burglar save America from an evil President, and gives the knife to a millionaire philanthropist, who's wife by the way the Big One was about to bang. Now the millionaire philanthropist knew very well his wife did such things, but the President was his friend and no friend should do such a thing to his friend's wife? Right, guys? The milk-man would be eligible of course.What a great pity. Eastwood has directed (and played in) some of the best American films, during the last decades. This must be not only his worse one but one of the worst ever.</fullReview>

And how in the name of the lord can a person walk into the oval office, stab the president to death and then walk out like nothing happened. If there would be one place on earth where this kind of stuff CAN NOT HAPPEN it's the white house thankyouverymuch. Not even once does somebody question the story that is later passed off.

Clint Eastwood did a good job as Luther Whitney, Gene Hackman was an appropriately slimy villain while Scott Glenn and Ed Harris were good in their roles. The problem I think I had with this movie was that it started out promising, but then headed for one of those Hollywood type endings.The book on the other hand worked better.

		<shortDescription>The plot is absolute rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is going to contain spoilers as I want to show some oddities in the plot. I have not read the book on which it is based so I cannot comment on whether or not these oddities came from the author David Baldacci.This film was released on Clint Eastwood's 67th birthday. He directs, produces and stars in this slow-paced crime movie. Eastwood plays Luther Whitney, a cat burglar (at 67!) who targets the home of billionaire industrialist Walter Sullivan (E. G. Marshall). While in mid-burglary, none other than the President of the United States (convincingly played by fellow 67-year old Gene Hackman) enters the room with Sullivan's wife (Melora Hardin).Whitney hides in the vault, which conveniently has a two-way mirror (why?), and witnesses the woman being killed by the secret service as she was about to stab the President with a knife. The Chief of Staff (Judy Davis) concocts a plan to cover up the incident. Unfortunately Whitney has witnessed the whole thing and has the knife.Carrying a pack filled with jewels and cash Whitney manages to outrun the two trained secret service agents through a forest despite them being half his age, armed and equipped with night vision goggles.Seth Frank (Ed Harris), the police investigator, decides there are only six guys in the entire world that could pull off that theft and one of them lives right here! If only police investigation really worked like that! Frank and Whitney then have a very civil chat over a nice lunch.Whitney then decides to taunt the President by turning up in a hat and a fake beard to a guided tour of the White House and leaving a photo of the knife. Why? Whitney's daughter Kate (Laura Linney) (now remember he is a cat burglar) is a high-flying prosecutor. That makes sense. So Frank persuades her to set up her dad and bring him in. She agrees. Again we don't know why.In a hotel room of some sort with a big window a sniper is building his rifle from a kit (the Secret Service man is simultaneously building his click-together gun too). This is in a public place, in daylight! Whitney turns up in the least convincing disguise ever (not even a fake beard, just a hat and coat). They are shot at by the two gunmen with state of the art equipment (we have just seen them shooting perfectly at a rifle range) and they both miss!.Now events turn really weird. Frank rescues Kate and starts flirting with her. You might think she would be a little upset that he nearly got them both killed but the beautiful, successful lawyer invites the small, balding cop (the actors are 14 years apart in age) into her flat and flirts back! There's a weird set-up by Whitney (now disguised using a moustache), a necklace, the Chief of Staff and the President, where the President learns of the cover-up. The President then sends the Secret Service guys to kill Kate. They follow her until she parks her car at the edge of a cliff, push her car over the cliff and drive away. At the same time Whitney has found out that the Secret Service is taking over surveillance of his daughter, so he speeds across the city from a phone booth in the middle of who knows where, screeching his tyres and blowing his horn repeatedly through traffic to arrive at the same spot where she has just been pushed over the cliff. How did he know she would be there? At no time, did he see his daughter's car or talk to his daughter. She survives. When the Secret Service then try to kill her in the hospital, Whitney again arrives there at the perfect time and kills the Secret Service guy.Whitney then poses as Sullivan's driver (how?) in order to talk to him and tell him the truth and present him with the knife. Sullivan believes him and walks in to the President (through all the security) with the knife in his hand. The President then commits suicide, apparently.What stops the film from being a complete turkey is the competence of its cast. There are several actors for whom it is worth watching this film. The score and the direction is fine. Just a shame the plot is absolute rubbish.</fullReview>

I must say I was seriously disappointed. This film is full of clichs. There are of course some good points. Acting is good, but with Eastwood, Hackman, Harris and Liney it is no wonder. To be honest in this film even Eastwood acting seemed the worst from all the others (whereas Harris was great as always). Eastwood often plays loner independent characters, but this character is not in a least believable. Also the movie is shot quite well. What brings it down is the story. Which when in short seems believable and very interesting but it wrongly done and executed. The film is quite entreating but it is nothing special and in contrast to other entreating movies I do not think I watch this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book when it was first released and thought it was unbelievably bad, both in prose and plot. Throughout I can recall thinking what a terrible movie it would make. When word was released that Clint Eastwood would be directing and starring in the adaptation, I thought maybe he could massage it into something of value. But alas, even Eastwood could not turn stagnant tap water into expired Boone's Farm.Forget the absurd nature of a long-in-the-tooth cat burglar witnessing a POTUS nearly raping and killing his mentor's wife (through a two-way mirror in a vault) when Secret Service agents shoot her to death. Forget that this same cat burglar now must outsmart and out man the US Secret Service and one of the wealthiest power brokers in the world. Beyond this inane stupidity, the film fails to build suspense, resolve many opened questions - and then makes the worst mistake so far: taking itself too seriously. E.G. Marshall actually says to a hit-man - 'It's easy when you're selling sin." They're selling something - and sin is not the word I would use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood delivers absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute Power has one of the best premises of any thriller I've ever heard of. It starts out with a quiet loner who goes to a huge countryside mansion in the middle of the night and robs the secret vault clean. He is interrupted when two drunk people enter the room not knowing that he can watch from inside the revolving door which is a two-way mirror. What he witnesses he can't believe: the President involved in the killing of a woman and his Chief of Staff attempting the cover-up.The first 30 minutes of this are spectacular. Eastwood's simple, straightforward style of direction is perfect in laying out the setting and action that occurs. As he starts to run with Secret Service, police and assassins chasing him, the plot goes a little awry but never into B-movie material. Eastwood is too reformed to be ridiculous and though some scenes may seem too unbelievable or outlandish, they are handled with professionalism so as to make us think they could happen.The cast is outstanding. Eastwood delivers as the smart and slick jewel thief you cannot underestimate, Hackman is good but very underused as the scumbag president, Ed Harris is solid as the fervent police detective and Laura Linney is wonderful as Eastwood's estranged daughter who has serious trust issues with her father. There is a lot going on here and it all comes down on a rainy night in Washington. This is not one of Eastwood's best films compared to Unforgiven, Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby. Yet, it is a very smart and fun thriller that has its head in the right place. Sometimes, you just need to take a break from the more serious films out there and enjoy what cinema was originally created for. Here, Eastwood accomplishes just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but far from excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Clint Eastwood has always been a better director than an actor. I never liked his "Dirty Harry" movies for instance, although I admired him in movies like "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "For a Few Dollars More", but I sure can appreciate some of the movies he directed. Knowing that he directed this one plus the fact that he had a very good and promising cast (Gene Hackman, Ed Harris,...) to play in this movie, I was quite eager to see this one. Now that I have seen it I must say that I'm quite disappointed by it. It never delivered what I expected. The entire story is quite weak and unbelievable, the acting isn't always very good (the stars do their job, but never really convinced me) and the plot never really surprises.The American president is a womanizer (that's not unbelievable, Kennedy wasn't exactly a saint either), but also a very violent man who first wants to sleep with his best friends wife and than starts beating her. Because she tries to defend herself, an agent of the secret service comes in and shoots her in the back. The woman is dead and the president's co-workers try their best to conceal all evidence. But they have one problem. A thief has seen it all happen...In my opinion this movie is watchable (especially on a rainy afternoon), but you better don't expect too much of it, because then it will let you down. If you can see past the sometimes ridicule story and just want to see some good actors at work (not all doing a great job, but that's a different story), than this might be the movie for you. Personally I was a bit disappointed by it. I give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

The two characters that truly bugged me were played by Judy Davis (the Chief of Staff) and Dennis Haysbert (the black Secret Service agent).

		<shortDescription>Absolute crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of David Baldacci's critically acclaimed, fast-paced thriller may recognize the premise of his book in this woeful screen adaptation, but that will be about it. Clint Eastwood directs and stars in this thriller in name only as a cat burglar who witnesses a tryst gone awry between President Gene Hackman and the wife of wealthy billionaire E.G. Marshall which ends in her murder. While I normally hate it when people compare novels to their screen counterparts, in this case one must wonder what Eastwood was thinking by turning this novel into a film since he deprives it of all of its strong points. Subplots that are fairly important are removed completely. Intriguing concepts are abandoned to give us asinine and often illogical "action" sequences that fail to generate anything in the way of tension or suspense. Eastwood would seem to be a great fit for the role as written in the novel (especially given a shocking midway twist in the book), but that twist has been removed from the film and Eastwood removes an important lead character from the novel and combines it into his own, which allows him to basically become some kind of elderly superman that can be everywhere at once and accomplish ludicrous feats. A great cast has been assembled, but most of them are wasted and come off badly. Judy Davis is particularly deadly as the Secretary of State. She spends the film snarling, sashaying, and bugging her eyes out as though channeling Carol Burnett's Nora Desmond. The dance sequence between her and Hackman is not only foolish, but seems to have been lifted from a slapstick farce. In fact, the entire second act of this film is slapstick farce without the laughs. Actions are done (such as the attempted assassination of Laura Linney as Eastwood's daughter) that make no sense whatsoever, until one realizes that Eastwood just wants to set up the age old scenario of him being able to go all man-with-no-name on his adversaries - the Secret Service. When the film is not laughable and foolish, it is downright tedious. There is not an iota of tension or suspense to be found any where in this mess adapted from a novel that had enough for two books. Please someone...keep Mr. Eastwood from ruining any more promising thrillers!</fullReview>

I don't want to get to in depth with what he should have kept because I don't want to ruin the book for you if you decide to read it.

		<shortDescription>If This IS Clint Eastwood's Best Directing Job...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm afraid it isn't that good. The plot drags in many places, while in others the exposition is so thin it leaves you perplexed. Well, in movies, being perplexed (to a certain degree) is definitely better than being bored.Gene Hackman excels only in one area: making his character thoroughly disgusting. I suppose that _is_ acting the part well; here, "absolute power" becomes "unmitigated loathing." Clint's character has one direct line to say about Gene's: "You Heartless Whore!" Right On! I'm afraid the few "suspense" scenes are clichs, predictable from the start.Clint Eastwood as the lead, and most of the supporting actors, put in creditable acting performances, making their characters seem quite believable. For example, I always like seeing Scott Glenn, who put in such a fine performance in "The Hunt for Red October." Ed Harris is fine as the chief investigator of the murder central to the story. And E.G.Marshall was very good... I was saddened to see he had died about a year after "Absolute Power" was released.This is alright for mindless entertainment, on the par with some single-episode-made-for-TV dramas... That is damnation by faint praise, but there you are. In other words, it's enjoyable enough if you turn your mind off completely."Absolute Power" isn't talked about much anymore... A well-deserved obscurity, as they say. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent and provocative thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An experienced, charming and perfected thief witnesses the President of The United States killing a young, beautiful girl, during a robbery. Trying to choke the case, professional murderers are contracted to hunt the thief, at the same time in that he tries to prove his innocence and the president's crime. Eastwood is the main character and he also directs this interesting thriller written for the great William Goldman.Even being an excellent film director (what was proven along his career), Eastwood didn't obtain the same success of "Unforgiven", accomplishing a thriller that even counting with touching and tense moments (as the scene in which a murderer tries to kill Eastwood with a rifle),is slow and without any memorable action moments ,what helped to cause the box office failure of the motion picture.The interest for "Absolute Power" is justified by the excellent supporting actors' cast, and among the great performances stands out Laura Linney's work as the Eastwood's daughter, and in this movie, unlike "Truman Show", she has the chance to really play her part in a convincing way and not just to offer big smiles.It's evident that are flaws in the rhythm and that the running time is very long, but "Absolute Power" is sustained due to the charisma of Eastwood and the script that tries to evidence the actors' interpretation, leaving the action in second plan.</fullReview>

It tells the story of Luther Whitney, a professional burglar who witnesses the president murdering a political big guy's wife. Things happen and then the story finishes, leaving you somewhat satisfied. Clint Eastwood (Space Cowboys) and Gene Hackman (Superman) lead the ensemble cast including Ed Harris (Stepmom), Laura Linney (The Truman Show), Judy Davis (Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows) and Scott Glenn (The Silence of The Lambs) Overall, well acted, well directed and well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastwood is a successful, high-stakes cat burglar who has never met the President. Until an incident when the thief meets the Chief up close and personal. Hackman plays an official in the oval office who has taken a lover in the house and master bedroom of an extraordinarily wealthy philanthropist. Whitney finds large amounts of cash there in the businessman's bedroom. Shortly, he realizes someone else is in the mansion. . A vicious lover's entanglement ensues. Soon two agents played by Denzel Washington and Scott Glenn enter the bedroom and one of the three preceding players in this drama is dead. Now every Eastwood movie contains at least a small amount of humor, whether they are action or drama. Now enter the supervisor, Diane Lane. Who is Diane Lane? Not the prolific celeb of modern movies considered a hottie. A different, veteran actress by the same name. I needed to search for both actors(not here), Lane and Glenn(who was in Apocalypse Now, by the way). Lane is funny, in an offhand way..kind of like a savage or sadistic sarcastic humor. Whitney has witnessed a killing, which soon turns out through circumstance to be a murder. Circumstance can be a wonderful thing, as Ed Harris discovers(another agent) when he "happens" upon the burglar. Meanwhile, the millionaire(E.G. Marshall) is tore apart by loss. Although much older than his beautiful yet extreme..better half, the man is devastated, and takes an active part further in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above-Average...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood cinema is diverse. Here's a personality who never stuck himself in one genre, and as a filmmaker he went greedy to prove his versatility. His 1997 flick 'Absolute Power', which is based on the 1996 novel of the same name written by David Baldacci, a thriller, has it's moments, but not enough to make this one a memorable affair.'Absolute Power' is about a career thief, who witnesses a horrific crime involving the U.S. President. It's a yet another film, that goes onto prove that power is indeed everything.The film begins well, and it must be said that the actor-director has handled some sequences exceedingly well. The problem however happens too soon, the writing isn't sharp after a point, and the slow-pace acts as a complete speed-breaker. However, the climax is interesting and absorbing. The adapted Screenplay could've more sharper, especially in the middle, and the pace should've been faster. Eastwood's direction is good.Acting wise: Eastwood loves multi-tasking, and his performance proves it. He plays the main hero with ease. Gene Hackman does well, as always. Judy Davis is another topper. She's superb. Laura Linney is efficient, but the show belongs to the legendary Ed Harris. He is excellent all through.On the whole, an above-average fare that could've been so much more. Nonetheless, it's a harmless one-time watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a robber who breaks into a mansion, witnessing a murder that he is not supposed to see."Absolute Power" does not replicate the usual Clint Eastwood magic of emotional build up and its subsequent satisfying release. The plot is not particularly engaging, with no emotional high points that are usual in his films. The plot delivery is winded and unnecessarily long. The first half an hour could easily have been condensed into ten minutes without affecting the story. For example, a chase does not need to last five minutes! Due to such unnecessarily lengthy scenes, the already thin plot loses even more tension, making "Absolute Power" an average thriller. It is weak and not engaging at all for a Clint Eastwood film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but a little weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This political thriller involving the President of the United States for some sexual crime, in fact a radical crime in that line, viz. murder, right in the middle of the Lewinski "affair" is a provocation of a type since it suggests suicide for the President. The film is good at showing how things could be hushed up in the USA, and in fact cannot. They always try but they mostly and most often fail, because there is a fink or a mole somewhere. Luckily for us. Though they are quite better at hushing up a crime that has to do with something more serious than a sexual offense, even accompanied with murder. For example the lying and the forging of evidence, necessarily false then, like with a certain George W Bush. Or deciding not to count millions of votes that would give the victory to the one they don't want like with Al Gore. The weakness of the film is also the key to its ending. The use of the husband of the girl who is killed, a quite old man indeed, and the main supporter of the President. This reveals the completely mentally deranged psychology of this President, of his main supporter and of the system they are living in. The suicide of the President is not an act of justice, but only an act to escape justice. No one, not even the President, has the right to evade justice and make his own justice, even on himself. The role of the police, when they know, which is the case here, is not to close their eyes on that kind of en ending, or to cover up another more radical ending for the unwanted witness of the crime, but to arrest the murderer and prevent him from escaping normal justice, which is the justice of the people, for the people and by the people and not justice for only individual, to quote the Gettysburg address.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Crteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just slick enough, just well-acted enough, just with that hint of good vs bad that make it work well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There probably isn't anything too groundbreaking in Absolute Power, and maybe it's all the better for it. It's an above-average by-the-book thriller (not by the numbers, there's sort of a difference I'd rather not prattle on here), and it's more than suitable that Clint Eastwood is director. He takes a handle of William Goldman's good if predictable screenplay by casting very well and making a point about how simply ruthless the world of the cover-up is as well as the double-cross. There doesn't need to be much else said since so many other movies and books have done better, so as a "well-oiled" machine, as it were, it functions like amazing brain candy.We get Clint as an aging thief who lives off his disability money from fighting in Korea but still likes the thrill and just the process of planning for a heist. But the place he heists from, unfortunately, is the home of a very old man (EG Marshall) who happened to get the President of the US elected (Hackman) who proceeds to interrupt Eastwood's robbery with a girl, gets into a big nasty physical fight with her, and the secret service kills her. That's when the ball of wax begins to ferment and un-bend. Now, granted, if you've read your share of books to read on an airplane it's nothing new. Yet this is a sort of challenge that Eastwood takes on, in a sense.Meaning, if you're thinking what you'll get is something too generic that you'll just want to tune out of, stick with it... the film goes into a very sturdy structure, one that allows for a few good surprises and twists, contingent on Eastwood's Luther being a cunning criminal mastermind who can slip into disguises and copy signatures and send trinkets like, say, the murdered girl's necklace to the Chief of Staff as a "present" from the president. It wont blow your mind with these twists (though the final one with Marshall and Hackman is classic, and fitting final note for Marhsall as an actor), and it's fine with what it is. Also a big help is the cast, filled with either real stars like Eastwood and Hackman or just great character actors like Linney, Scott Glenn, Dennis Haysbert, even Ed Harris to a degree as a character actor is very good.This is suspense film-making for those too bored to usually bother late at night or watching some channel like TNT. It's good, very good, as long as you know what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable thriller with good acting, a great fluid direction and some flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Absolute Power" (1997) is for me a prime example of what a director skilled with both actors and fluid camera can do to make a riveting film from a second-rate book. The David Baldacci novel in question, whatever its merits, gave brief but telling opportunities for individuals to interact with one another; these intelligent moments, director/producer/star Clint Eastwood had to string like bright beads onto a continuous and unbroken thread of dark meaning. In my opinion, he did this with Hitchcockian or Vidorian skill. The plot of this film can be told in two sentences. "A brilliant, aging career thief is interrupted during a very big score by the arrival of a man and a woman, then witnesses her murder by two secret service agents as she gains the upper hand in a struggle in the bedroom. He escapes but they get his license number, and thereafter he decides to leave the country but then gets angry when the D.C. highly-placed perpetrators, the bad guys and their agents, misuse the victim's husband and then nearly kill his daughter--and exposes the crime.". Leaving aside details of how he does it, he and the police officer on the case manage to bring about a very satisfying conclusion. This efficient thriller is directed in award-level style by Eastwood, from a screenplay by William Goldman. Understated music by Lennie Niehaus, intelligently- matched cinematography by Jack N. Green, director of photography, a lovely production design by Henry Bumstead and solid art direction by Jack G. Taylor, Jr. advance the proceedings far above ordinary films. Stellar set decoration by Richard C. Goddard and Anne D, McCulley, above-average costumes, lighting, sound and special effects add to the film's considerable power. In key roles, Gene Hackman as the central figure in the disaster and Laura Linney as Eastwood's daughter come off best. Ed Harris as the head detective is folksy but adequate; Judy Davis is fine as the bad guy's chief, and E.G, Marshall lend dignity to the role of the aged husband. The secret service men are Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert, and they are good and well-used. As a telling fact, every small part in the piece is made memorable by the director's skill, from start to finish. Eastwood unarguably does one of his best acting jobs in a role that suits his strengths and limitations very well. The film is not as strong as "Space Cowboys", a bravura project; but it adds to the director's credentials; the closet sequence with its p.o.v. shots, shot changes is extremely memorable. There flaws-- notably the protagonist's failure to recognize the murderer sooner; but the film is miles above most of the special-effects with loud brainwashing music that constitutes postmodernist film that's being produced. A swell-acted, generally superior thriller this is, and one worth seeing more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's character, a great jewel thief and cat burglar, robs a mansion at the same time that the President of the United States (Gene Hackman) arrives at the mansion with the wife of the owner of the mansion, roughs the woman up, and during the struggle, she threatens the Prez with a letter opener, at which time the secret service (Scott Glenn) bursts into the room and shoots the woman. A big scandal. This is the conflict upon which the plot rests, and all in all it is a fun movie. BUT! When the police (Ed Harris) investigate the crime they question Clint Eastwood since he is a capable jewel thief. Here is the major problem: Clint Eastwood's alibi was that he was watching a live football game with a friend. This makes no sense since the burglary was committed in the middle of the night. This is a major oversight in the continuity/screen writing department.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid thriller with a message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute Power is not among Clint Eastwood greatest films, but it's much better than is usually given credit for. A dark thriller, directed as professionally and bleakly as only Eastwood can do it, Absolute Power centers around Luther Whitney, a professional burglar (Eastwood himself, in one of his best performances in the last decade), who finds himself in a classic wrong place, wrong time situation ? while robbing a luxurious mansion, he accidentally witnesses a sexual assault and a murder, and the subsequent cover-up, that involves the President of the United States and the White House staff. That scene at the very beginning of the movie is probably the strongest one in it, Eastwood making brilliant use of cinematography, music (and especially the lack of) and his trademark heavy contrasted lighting, and with almost no dialog at all, it's a remarkably effective scene that overshadows much of the rest of the film.Still, as the film turns into a more standard conspiracy-thriller, it holds its own quite well, mainly due to William Goldman's wonderful script (as his always are, this is the genius who wrote 'The Princess Bride', 'Marathon Man', 'Misery' and 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', among others) and most of all thanks to the absolutely fantastic all-star cast; other than Clint himself, who is ideal as the charming, ruthless but honest criminal, fantastic performances are also given by Gene Hackman as the President and by Ed Harris as the detective on the case. The rest of the excellent cast includes Laura Linney ('Primal Fear') as Luther's daughter; the fantastic Judy Davis ('Naked Lunch', 'Barton Fink') as the President's sneaky assistant; Scott Glenn ('Buffalo Soldiers'); Dennis Haysbert ('Far From Heaven'); E.G. Marshall ('Tora! Tora! Tora!'); Penny Johnson ('24'); and Richard Jenkins ('Six Feet Under'). As is usually the case with Clint Eastwood's films, all the actors seem to have been hand-picked by him directly, rather than participated in an audition, because each character seems to have been designed specifically for the actor portraying them. Because of that cast and the brilliant directing and dialog, Absolute Power is an entirely gripping watch, even if the story is at times less than entirely convincing and just a little fragmented.Absolute Power tries to make its mark on three levels ? the thriller level is the only one where it completely succeeds, and it manages to be constantly exciting, gripping and enticing. It works slightly less well on the human level, because the inter-character relationships are rather poorly developed. Laura Linney's character in particular is underdeveloped, and so the father-daughter relationship element hardly carries any weight in the story, and neither does her relationship with Ed Harris's character. As there is no interaction between Eastwood's character and Hackman's, the only relationships that are worth mentioning are the ones between Eastwood and Harris, which is strictly superficial and based on mutual respect, and the one between Hackman and Marshall, who plays the old billionaire who funded Hackman's rise to the presidency. The third level on which the film works is as political commentary; there it achieves partial success, as the story often seems contrived (although, one might note, not as contrived as we may imagine). Still, it can give you a general idea of how absolute power corrupts, and of the kind of horrors that the intricate systems of democracy might hide; but it's not to be taken too literally. The strongest elements of the story are the mystery, and Clint Eastwood's character, clearly the strongest in the film; as such it's a solid and enticing thriller with lots of atmosphere and wonderful acting, that will keep you glued to your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popcorn entertainment that could have been so much more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the beginning I treated "Absolute Power" as a popcorn movie as there are so many unbelievable coincidences to make it a good political thriller. When Eastwood is escaping from the house after just witnessing a murder, the bodyguards start running back into the house for no apparent reason. One of them accidentally dropped the murder weapon and when they are told to get it they just run as if they knew that Eastwood was in the house. And when they come into the room the guy who dropped it knows exactly where he did it and looks there (of course to find that it had already been stolen by Eastwood). Well why the hell didn't he pick it up if he knew he dropped it. Now that's what I call an intelligent movie.There is of course the story which is by no means clich and could have made a much bigger impact if presented in a more credible manner.The ending was unsatisfactory because of its unbelievability and I was left with the feeling that the movie, despite being very well cast, just didn't live up to its expectations.A nice 2 hour popcorn entertainment that could have been so much more. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes the results of being both director and actor have diminished Clint Eastwood's work, such as his poor showing in "Blood Work". However, this thriller moves along at a good pace with good performances all around. As Luther, an accomplished thief, Clint fits the bill and establishes credible relationships with his daughter and his pursuers. The supporting actors turn in good performances. Of particular note is Ed Harris, who does a fine job as a homicide detective. A weak plot point is the apparent difficulty the police seem to have in figuring out obvious crime scene staging. Another weakness is the ending. As usual, Hollywood writing takes the easy way out. But these are relative quibbles in an otherwise watchable thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since when the bad guy becomes the hero? When he sees the President get kinky with someone elses spouse. A thief is the only witness to crime which is more than passionate. A normal thief would leave immediately, but a cover up to a murder would complicate the whole thing. Clint Eastwood as Luther Whitney did a remarkable job there. He was Dirty Harry, but he hated dishonesty just as much I would. Even though he was a thief, he still had a heart for his daughter. Gene Hackman played the president very well, although he should know about his shortcoming. And the two Secret Service agents had their share as well. Whitney took out the more loyal one who tried to silence his daughter, NO,NO,NO!!! The other caved into the pressure, and confessed the hard way! After the roundup, everything should be back to normal, the question is, "Who'll be the new president?" Rating 4 stars out of 5 7 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrills with a dash of humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made before the Clinton/Lewinski scandal became public property, the scenario of this enjoyable White House thriller may have seemed more unlikely when it first came out than a year or so later. The plot revolves arround a sexual encounter between the USA President, played with gusto by Gene Hackman, and the wife of his best friend, which ends with the wife being shot by Secret Servicemen. Unfortunately, the incident is seen by veteran jewel thief Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood), who just happens to be robbing the house at the time, and who of course become chief suspect in the killing.One of Eastwood's strengths as director is his ability, via his actors, to inject humour into scenes which other directors would play straight, without losing the overall tension of the movie. This is illustrated here by Judy Davis as a Machiavellian Chief of Staff, who would stop at nothing to cover for the President; there is an especially hilarious dance sequence between her and Hackman, where they never stop smiling and laughing while having a desperate conversation about their predicament. The pace of the film tends to ease in the central section, as relationships between Whitney and his estranged daughter (Laura Linney), and between her and the detective on the case (Ed Harris), become more the focus of attention. Moreover, quite regrettably, the film's ending is rushed and confused. Nevertheless, despite these flaws, this shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

If, for some reason, you can't rent another movie and you don't have anything to do in raining weekend, you can take to it to home. Otherwise, choose another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much cry and little wool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ambitious movie begins to mix in its first scenes a burglary committed by a professional burglar (well acted by Clint Eastwood as the great actor he is) and a murder following a violent sex scene involving the President of the United States and the wife of a powerful millionaire to whom the President always confesses to owe his position. These two events have nothing to do with one another except for the fact that they happen simultaneously and the hidden burglar is an involuntary witness of the murder a fact which brings him a lot of trouble afterwards. The story is not badly filmed but it's rather weak in itself and have some incongruities and inconsistencies which become more numerous as the end approaches. It ends up in an unconvincing and somewhat forced outcome after a few entangled scenes. The only positive aspects of this movie are the great performance of Clint Eastwood and its good quality in formal and technical terms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To watch or not to watch, that was the question, the premise of the film, the President of the US is watched by a thief, killing follows, is just too preposterous.Multi million dollar mansions with burglar alarm systems no better than in the average suburban house,Secret Service agents who don't come when the shouting and furniture moving start, The simultaneous failure of two snipers, The murder by lethal injection all strain credibility too much.So the fine acting and generally good direction (Eastwood must take some blame for the script however) are wasted in a muddled attempt to reach into the excesses of power.I loved the premise, the smart burglar but hated the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 Star Cast. 5 Star Storyline. But does the ending let it down?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With great performances from a 5 star cast, Absolute Power is easily one of Eastwood's best directed works. The film invokes intrigue and suspense, however, many audiences may be left hungry for more with a quick and seemingly rushed ending. For 4 minutes audiences are almost unexpectantly bombarded with various events in order to complete the story, as if Eastwood ran out of time during production. The completely unexpected and out-of-character suicide of a Secret Service agent, and the murder of another seem to be used in an attempt to ensure all loose ends are tied.Despite the less than expected conclusion, the film will satisfy all those who look for a 'top notch' thriller and rightfully deserves a place in the DVD rack.My rating 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a little far fetched, this is actually one of the better thrillers I've seen over the past few years. Great performances by all the main players. Hackman and Eastwood, Harris and Linney give very believable performances -- who knows what happens concerning the President? Given the Clinton scandals, is this so far gone? Not at all.I really like the pacing, the script, and Eastwood still comes off as the gruff wiseguy who can eke it out when necessary. I think that after this flick he was just too old -- but not here. Liked this one far better than the farce with John Malkovich, In The Line Of Fire.Sure there are some overdone moments, but this is one of Eastwood's better movies. Ending is also good, especially the Eastwood confrontation. Kudos for an excellent, well done flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scene where the president is dancing with Judy Davis was almost a parody the dialogue was so bad. Apart from that the plot is pretty implausible. There are many instances in the film where the reaction and response of key characters to events as they unfold is completely inexplicable.It also starts off with the classic scene involving a timer counting down to zero and the geek racing against time to disarm the system with the aid of a gadget. Another case of technology being completely dumbed down so that imbeciles can get it.This movie is basically a another vehicle for Clint Eastwood to look perplexed and scowling.If you want a better movie with pretty much the same plot, check out 'No way out', with Kevin Costner and directed by Kiwi Roger Donaldson. This movie also stars Gene Hackman in pretty much the same role so it makes you wonder why he ever got involved with this turkey.My advice..save your $7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute power of the director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder why the auteur theorists of cinema never put Clint Eastwood under scrutiny. If they did they would have the prime example of an auteur under total control of his material, so much so that he should more appropriately be called dictator. Remember, I am not saying that in a good way. I believe that the best films come out as teamwork, and I even count the audience as part of the team. (After all, it's audience expectation that drives the filmmakers.) But it is also possible for the director to stamp his authority on the production, and the result is usually vanity showcases rather than proper films. I'm afraid this is the fate of the "Clint Eastwood film".But it's strange too, because the Eastwood vanity comes across as unique. He is not really a director. He is first and foremost a star persona, and this was cemented through "the man with no name" character of the spaghetti westerns, and later augmented through Dirty Harry. He creates a mystique of quiet strength through minimalist expression, squint-eyed stares, dialogue that comes across as scowls etc. With slight modifications here and there, Clint has played this same character throughout his career, be it sheriff, convict, boxing trainer, farmer, and in the case of the film in question, burglar. Not to complain, because he does it well enough, and with enough verisimilitude to keep us interested. But the problem is that he directs the same way as he acts. It's a minimalist kind of direction, with almost no flashy highlights. There may be emphasis here and there, but it's always understated, like the intermittent scowls of the actor. He does it film after film, and there seems to be nobody to tell him that he should "direct" and not just carry his star persona along with him in the director's chair. It really is a dictatorship here. For anyone else, this is a recipe for disaster. But the confidence of Clint is monumental, and this is what carries him through. Most of his films are duds, even though oddly engaging in places. Only once in a while a script comes along that suits his style, so we get gems like Play Misty For Me and Million Dollar Baby. But the film in question is probably his worst of all. It's called Absolute Power, but it's got nothing about politicians exercising full reign. It is better seen as the director exercising his own absolute power over his product, via his star persona, and ruining it in the process.It's a sensational premise &#x2013; a burglar witnessing a high profile crime and cover-up. From this point on it needs fireworks to fly from the directorial chair. Instead we're treated to the same ponderous "character studies" of the Eastwoodian bent &#x2013; dipping but not probing. If it's character that he's concerned with, he should have paid attention to the Luther Whitney character. If we are going to start rooting for a professional burglar, the director needs to put a lot of effort into it. Watching a speech of the President on television and suddenly becoming "good" and empathising for the widowed Walter Sullivan &#x2013; this will not work. In fact, we're asked to accept a litany of contradictions and anomalies, just because Clint is squinting and scowling his way through it. After a point we stop believing in the plot, and we stop caring for the characters too, because no effort is made in this direction. It is just more of the same, slow, ponderous, workmanlike, Clint getting through his script with quiet strength and dignity, not much unlike "the man with no name" getting through his gun-slinging opposition. Sometimes it works, but not here.</fullReview>

To do that they have totally written out the main character of the book! (In fact, Eastwood's character died halfway through the novel.) This is one of the worst book to movies that I have ever seen!

The opening weekend of the movie had one of the bodyguard to check the woman for signs of relationship with the "president" and it was hilarious how he picked up her legs to "look" evidence after stating he was not a gyne! I wish I could purchase or even view this again! I have not read the book so I can not compare. Many have stated the difference but it was a great plot with a few funny parts. The plot just goes to show you that no matter how "important" you are, you a human with all the same temptations that people of lesser statue have. A cover up is just that- covering up something that WILL be discovered later after the masks are pulled off. Clint Eastwood was the perfect one for the lead roll and Ed Harris is always a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute PowerLuther Whitney (Clint Eastwood) is an incredible crook; he's one of only six people who can defeat the Sullivan mansion's alarm system. Eastwood breaks into the Sullivan mansion, owned by Melora Hardin, and breaks into the main vault. But bad things happen when Eastwood, trapped in the vault, watches, sickened, as Hardin brings the US President, Alan J. Richmond, into her bedroom and starts to...have fun. Unfortunately, things go even worse when Luther watches Richmond kill the woman. But it's not long before the detective leading the murder investigation, Seth Frank (Ed Harris), realizes that Luther was in the house when the crime occurred. But was he a witness or a participant?This marks the beginning of a chain of events in Luther's life. The FBI is dead on Luther's every trail, trying to assassinate him."Absolute Power" has one main flaw: it is nothing extraordinary. We've seen it all before, and done better. Clint Eastwood has never been a favorite of mine, and he doesn't improve my respect for him here. He mumbles his way through every badly-written line helplessly, looking for a way out. Gene Hackman is a good actor, but he's not anything special here, either. The main standout, as always in his films, is Ed Harris as Seth Frank. I've been a fan of Harris ever since "The Right Stuff," and while this isn't his best performance, he definitely carries his own more than Hackman and Eastwood.In the end, what could have been a great government thriller turns into a mediocre "Murder at 1600" affair.2/5 stars -</fullReview>

And as a director, he sure knows how to stage some tense suspense sequences. But he cannot overcome the artificial, contrived and often unconvincing plot, or its awfully unsubtle attempt at some sort of political "commentary". Ed Harris and E.G.

I saw this on cable with my wife (there being nothing better on at the time), and we missed the opening scene in which the murder occurs. After we'd been watching for about ten minutes I said to her, "You know, I don't think Clint committed the murder and I think all those nasty CIA guys are going to end up dead." She replied, "And I don't think the estranged daughter is going to remain estranged."That's Hollywood, I guess. It wouldn't do to have the bad guys winning.I think the thing that most disappointed me about this particular effort from Clint was that he was supposed to be a master of disguise, and we saw him in about half a dozen different disguises, but in every single one of them he was instantly recognizable as good old Clint.Don't bother.</fullReview>

The missing knife causes near hysterics by Davis' character, yet only moments before, the discovery of the body barely raises an eyebrow. When the secret service agents return to grab the knife they approach with weapons drawn, why? they had no reason to suspect anyone was there, and certainly not an intruder. The agent then looks for the knife in only one spot, again why? These all happen in a 5 minute period the rest of the film is of a usual high standard for Eastwood if one can overlook the fact that the pres is a stumbling woman bashing incoherent drunk with memory loss, sort of a cross between Clinton and George W i guess.</fullReview>

At any rate, there are huge plot holes all over the place in this story of a President who is boinking the Vice-President's wife. A "cat burgler" played by an aging cat (Clint Eastwood) just happens to be there when Bill's...Errr...the President's philandering takes a deadly turn. The rest of the movie is about the cat being chased and playing a cat and mouse game with the Secret Service who is trying to hide the dastardly deeds.Having said all that it sounds like a silly movie but you're almost required to watch with stars such as Clint Eastwood, EG Marshall, Gene Hackman and Ed Harris all in the same film. And they all turn in great performances. That is what makes the movie. I am a great fan of Bruce Willis and think he can act...Sort of...(I think he's putting on a great act not laughing out loud at Ashton Kutcher as Demi Moore's new husband instead of him...But I digress again). At any rate, you can't really say there is a lot of great acting in BW's movies. Lots of fun, fast action and even fantasy. But great acting? No. Here you have a lot of the wild suspensions of belief that you are asked to have to make (people running all over without permission, nobody checking credentials for anything, folks just happening to conveniently being in places...All sorts of stuff.). Yet you have great acting and directing (by Eastwood himself) so it's a fun, suspenseful ride.So...and I know you've heard this before...You'll absolutely enjoy Absolute Power. But you must absolutely think of it as a fantasy...except for Bill...from the start.</fullReview>

He hit a mansion where the owner is out of town. He finds a secret safe that has one way glass and a chair. Now, here is where it gets a little far fetched. The President shows up with the wife of the owner. She skipped the trip. Eastwood is in the safe watching the action. Does the owner also do that? Kinky. Oh yes, the owner is old (E.G. Marshall) and is wife (Melora Hardin from The Office) is young and hot. Well, things go wrong and the Secret service is cleaning up the mess and they discover that someone else was there. To the chase!Eastwood's relationship with his daughter (Laura Linney) plays an important part and provides some of the most interesting scenes. Other very interesting scenes are provided by Judy Davis (Husbands and Wives, A Passage to Idia) as one of the Secret Service agents.Ed Harris, Scott Glen and Dennis Haysbert also add to the story. It is worth two hours of your life just to see all these stars in one film.</fullReview>

It is a pleasure to watch E.G. Marshall in one of his last roles. As one might expect because a star plays him, the criminal is a "good" criminal arrayed against a corrupt system (compare with Eastwood's Alcatraz movie, and True Crime). I am a little troubled by the depiction of the president as amoral. Is this Eastwood's statement against government in general, or the previous holder of that office? Perhaps conservative actors will make this kind of movie to balance Rob Reiner and Michael Douglas's gushy depiction of a liberal president.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something's Missing Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years before this film, Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman made their despicable characters likable in "Unforgiven." Now in this 1997 Columbia Pictures reteaming, it's just the opposite. Eastwood hams it up as a veteran cat burglar who witnesses U.S. President Hackman commit a murder. Will Eastwood stay alive long enough to implicate Hackman before Hackman's cronies off him? Will you really care?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks credibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the beginning I treated "Absolute Power" as a popcorn movie as there are so many unbelievable coincidences to make it a good political thriller. When Eastwood is escaping from the house after just witnessing a murder, the bodyguards start running back into the house for no apparent reason. One of them accidentally dropped the murder weapon and when they are told to get it they just run as if they knew that Eastwood was in the house. And when they come into the room the guy who dropped it knows exactly where he did it and looks there (of course to find that it had already been stolen by Eastwood). Well why the hell didn't he pick it up if he knew he dropped it. Now that's what I call an intelligent movie.There is of course the story which is by no means cliche and could have made a much bigger impact if presented in a more credible manner.The ending was unsatisfactory because of its unbelievability and I was left with the feeling that the movie, despite being very well cast, just didn't live up to its expectations.A nice 2 hour popcorn entertainment that could have been so much more. 6/10 </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has done a competent directing job in this absorbing, somewhat underrated thriller. It benefits from careful pacing and uniformly strong performances. However, those expecting spectacular action scenes (i.e. explosions, shootouts) are bound to be disappointed. Worth a look; it's certainly not as lame as one would gather from many of the comments here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a great movie, the beginning and the end is well written. The thing is that the middle of the movie is not good cause some of the scene doesn't make any sense.Few parts that can be make better and the plot should be adjusted so audience will understand what happened during the movie especially the middle part, and what the story supposed to end, perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but needs major improvement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute Power has a very clever and interesting story, about a professional jewel theif who finds murderous secrets at a billionaire's home. But, it really needs major improvement, the film is often too dull for it's own good, and it is far too long and has a boringly unexpected finale. However, there is an upside to this movie, it is very clever, and the acting from Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman shows effort and skill.Overall, Absolute Power is not a bad movie. It will keep you entertained for a couple of hours, but it is not a memorable or brilliant experience.Rating: 6</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Clint never betrays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has taken the book by David Baldacci and changed a lot of things. First, his character (MAYBE I'M SPOILING!) doesn't die anymore and I think it's better for the movie, because Luther is a very funny and nice thief, you can't be against him. Gene Hackman portraits a cruel president, who could be the joy of every Kenneth Starr but the best actor of the movie is the great Judy Davis (really she deserved the Oscar). Her staff chief Gloria Russell is my favorite character of the movie, deeply but timidly in love with her president and totally devoted to him. The scene, when they dance at the White House and he reveals to her that the necklace is the one of the dead woman, is one of the highest moments of a thriller well acted, well written, well everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another decent Eastwood double billing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood plays a thief, a great pro at what he does and he is not some nickel and dime idiot thug, he's a brilliant heist man. While robbing the castle of a very rich and important man that is suppose to be on holiday, he is interrupted when the president of the united states escorts this rich mans wife home. Eastwood hides and then witnesses as this woman is murdered and the secret service cover it up.When investigated by cops the burglary looks like a great motive for the murder and cops go on a mission looking for thief's and Eastwood is a major suspect, even assumed by his own daughter but not everyone is buying his as a murderer. Eastwood and one trustworthy cop must get the real truth out and get the real man responsible.I was interested in this film for the most part, but too much drama was involved at times. My biggest flaw was the way the movie all came together real quick in the end and wrapped everything up all nice and perfect. It could've lead out a bit and had a bit more drama in those results.Eastwoods direction was good, through out the years he has became a great director. Having himself in the lead was a good choice because he's still one of the great actors out there. The majority of this cast was great; Scott Glenn, E.G. Marshall, Gene Hackman, Judy Davis, and Dennis Haysbert and Penny Johnson (later of TV's 24 fame). The actor I did not like was Laura Linney, I think shes an awful actress.Eastwood fans, Hackman fans, suspense or drama fans...heres your movie. It is a pretty good little film. I didn't love it but I am hard to please, but i can recommend it 4/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has had hits and misses throughout his movie career, and this one doesn't even hit the target.I guess after "Unforgiven", Clint may have thought he would have another hit on his hands by re-teaming with Gene Hackman,but the results this time are miserably flat.This is a yawner from beginning to end.I recall going to see this film when it was first released,I mistakenly walked into the theater where the re-released version of "Star Wars" was playing.I quickly exited,only to end up wishing I had stayed there.Save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Chevy Chase Selecting Eastwood's Roles?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolute Power, is a perfect example of wasted talent, and wasted camera work. The plot of a sexually funky President abusing his conquests is bad enough. However, a murderously complicit Secret Service takes the cake.Despite a "Wag the Dog" type truthfulness to the story, nothing saves this film. First, it is boring. Second, it is fantastical, and Finally, the question of "who really cares" surfaces.Well, not me. Going into all of the defects of "Absolute Power" is more of a chore than actually viewing the film. Suffice it to say, I feel guilty for giving it a four out of ten. Perhaps I should have rated it lower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very slow paced and extremely unlikely development. Nothing to make you give a hoot about the main character in the first place. It gets worse and worse. It was so bad that my husband and I could hardly believe it at times. We joked about it for months afterwards. I can't think of a worse movie ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>President's have Affair's But not Murder!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed this film quite a few times and greatly enjoyed the entire plot. I did think about former President Clinton and his affair, however, I doubt very much that anyone very close to the President, including the Secret Service would cover up a MURDER! Clint Eastwood made this a great mystery with his great acting skills and directing talent. Luther Whitney(Clint Eastwood),"Unforgiven",'02, was doing a great job in house stealing from E.G. Marshall(Walter Sullivan),"Russian Holiday",'92, and at the same time his wife, Melora Hardin (Christy Sullivan),"The Hot Chick",'02 was plenty Hot and passionate with Gene Hackman,(Pres. Allen Richmond),"Welcome to Mooseport",'04. It seems that Walter Sullivan was use to watching his wife have affairs with other men, as he had a perfect hidden room which permitted him observe EVERYTHING GOING ON AND MORE in his bedroom. Laura Linney(Kate Whitney),"Mystic River",'04, was Clint Eastwood's daughter in this film and she was always after him to give up the love of his life JOB, ROBBING THE RICH! This is definitely a great film to view off and on and just simply enjoy the great acting by great Veteran Screen Actors and Director!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just love it! Absolute perfection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder where would the whole movie industry be without a man called Clint Eastwood? As a more personal note I (as a fanatic long-time fan) might ask how could I possibly survive without him and his excellent movies? If I'm not going over my limits here, one of the main reasons to stay alive is a chance to watch his flicks over and over again and maybe catch his next movie because thank god he won't retire no matter what.Is there any other actor/director who's more capable of directing terrific movies one after another and perform a leading role in almost all of them? And all this with a style nobody can't quite imitate. Shame on me if I find even one movie he has made that I don't like. I remember when "Absolute power" was in the movie theaters and I went to see it for the very first time. After the flick all I could say was "Clint my man, you did it again".Recently he hasn't done anything I could rate less than 10. "Absolute power" is a perfect thriller and a magnificent ride. Cast is fantastic, Gene Hackman who won the Oscar from "Unforgiven" hasn't lost his "it" and Ed Harris is a swell man to spice things up. Clint - as an old bloke - is having a time of his life in the leading role. This is a movie that people will appreciate and look up as a classic years from now. All Clint Eastwood really needs is a good story and he instantly turns it into a masterpiece. What a magician... Easy to say "Absolute power" is one of his best works in the 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly one of Eastwood's best films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cleverly written suspense tale of where Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood), a master thief who overhears the conversation between two people that he hardly knows. A few minutes later, one of the two people is shot in the back and dies. When Whitney comes out of hiding a few minutes later, he finds out that the people behind the murder cover-up involves the President of the United States (Gene Hackman), two Secret Service agents (Scott Glenn, Dennis Haysbert), and the Chief of Staff (Judy Davis). A local cop, Seth Frank (Ed Harris) investigates the homicide and finds out that Whitney isn't the main suspect. The second half of the film is just as terrific as the first half is. The film is based on David Baldacci's novel and is masterfully adapted in the story that's done by William Goldman. Lennie Niehaus composes a very solid musical score, Jack N. Green's cinematography is well done and so is the production design by Henry Bumstead. The performances in this movie are great, most notably Eastwood, Hackman, Harris, and the late E.G. Marshall (as old Walter Sullivan). "Absolute Power" is certainly one of Eastwood's best films (as a director).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Bull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Unforgiven," "A Perfect World," and "The Bridges of Madison County," you would expect Clint Eastwood to seek out equally challenging projects to direct. Instead, he gives us "Absolute Power," a preposterous thriller in which aging cat burglar Luther Whitney (Eastwood) witnesses a murder involving (gasp!) the president of the United States. A first rate cast, including Gene Hackman as the president, make this more watchable than it would otherwise be, but not even Ed Harris, Laura Linney, E.G. Marshall, and the dynamic Judy Davis can save it. The premise is too unbelievable and William Goldman's script fails to make it credible. In real life, Eastwood's cat burglar would have been snuffed out quickly and quietly, then forgotten. Instead, he single-handedly brings down the president. Every movie requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but the intelligent ones help us out by providing situations that have some connection to reality as we know it. "Absolute Power" is so silly that you simply can't accept it as anything but a comedy made by people too lacking in humor to know this one desperately needed the help of a laugh track.Much was made of the father-daughter relationship in the movie, but it doesn't amount to much. Then there's the pacing. Eastwood made his reputation in action movies, but his directors, notably Don Siegel, were masters of the genre who knew how to make a movie exciting. Eastwood's legendary snail's pace behind the camera works in more thoughtful films, but it sinks those, like "Sudden Impact" and "Firefox," that rely on action. "Absolute Power" joins them deep in the well.</fullReview>
