		<shortDescription>Oh, come on! Let go! Trust me, it's not that bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, not Oscar material and this was pretty badly made. But again like most brainless comedies, I walked in the theater with a good mood and expecting a laugh and I got that with "Scary Movie 2". I mean people are being so harsh on this film, I understand, I know this isn't the greatest movie or comedy. But if you aren't expecting fun and laughter, I think normally you just feel like bashing the movie then.We have some of the old cast members from the original Scary Movie: Anna Farris, a surprising return of Regina Hall, and Marlon and Shawn Wayne. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcist(hilarious scene by the way), Poltergeist, The Haunting, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, and What lies beneath. With some great add ons like Tim Curry, I just had a great time. Tori Spelling, yeah, she's a bit scary, but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs.The Butler just killed me with the hand. Yes, it was gross, but I think you just have to let go and just go with the joke. Scary Movie 2 isn't the best comedy ever, but it's a decent one with your brain turned off. Sick jokes, yes, and very crude one's, this movie isn't for everyone. But I think if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie, you'll enjoy this one too! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it was a great sequel that lived up to the first quite well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do a lot of people who really enjoyed the first movie hate this installment? I can understand why some critics would, or people that just thought the first was okay, however, I enjoyed both the previous film before this and this film itself, thinking this film is really funny and enjoyable. It was great fun and total entertainment to watch, and I have watched it quite a few times.The comedy might have been a little too over-the-top and repitive at times, as it seemed like this one tried really hard to please the audience when the first one just went with the flow, but that is really how a lot of comedies are like, even more so now than then, so I do not see how this one is any different. Anna Faris pulls off Cindy Campbell's character wonderfully, again, and nobody could have done it better than her. All the other familiar characters, as well as the new ones, are excellently portrayed and likable, in a sense, and the movie has a high replay value, for me at least. This movie was not a disappoint to me either, because I thought it lived up to Scary Movie perfectly.There were a lot of funny parts in this film, such as the opening song, the Charlie's Angels spoof scene, the scene were buddy gives back Cindy's book, and the Cindy singing in the car scene. If you have seen the film, you know what I am talking about and hopefully enjoyed those scenes as well. If you hated this film, please try to watch it again, and you'll see just how good it really was, hopefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not quite as funny as the original, I still enjoyed Scary Movie 2 very much. While some bits are downright idiotic, some are genuinely hilarious, and will have you rolling in the aisles. If you're not a fan of Scary Movie, you won't like this one either, however. But, if you enjoyed the first, come back to see this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious! very crude and edgy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the raunchiest of the Scary Movies. If you thought the original was "too much", well, this one will truly give you more reasons to avoid it for it's vulgar content and crude sex jokes. That's for you, easily offended people. I had a great time with it when it first came out in theaters. I really liked the crude sex humor and vulgar spoofs. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological humor, you will be amused.The opening sequence is truly hilarious and in my opinion, the best part of the movie. It was about time that the "Scary Movie" franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was great. James Woods in the role of Father Merrin delivers a hysterical performance relying most of his scenes on scatological humor and profanity. For example, when Reagan says "f*** me" and he immediately jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating her. Another example is the line where Reagan's mother says "she won't even let me touch her!" and the priest responds "yeah sometimes that happens, you have to give candy to the children" (or something like that); obviously referring to recent pederastry cases. On the other side, the movie also has "classical" but always effective teen humor . For example, when entering the room for the first time, he gets scared and runs away when Reagan turns her head on 180?; and the always effective vomiting cycle. After the Exorcist spoof, the movie centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's when the movie takes a new direction and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs from popular t.v. commercials, songs (Vitamin C), and even racist and homophobic jokes. The sex jokes worth a watch specially on the infamous clown scene, and the sex ghost. "Scary Movie 2" does not "cross" the line on the vulgar factor. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. But be sure to watch it on DVD; do not watch the t.v. version because it's very cut (specially on dialogs).This is in my opinion the best of the "Scary Movies".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weak Storyline Filled With Constant Hilarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the first Scary Movie completely ripped off Scream, at some points scene for scene, the film had a very developed, rich storyline which was filled with tons of hilarious gags.Half of that works in the sequel. The storyline is weak, mainly copying the plot of the lackluster "The Haunting" which leads the main characters to spend a weekend in a haunted house. This is a great idea, but the story is not developed enough and after watching the film, I couldn't even remember why the characters ended up in the house in the first place.Yet, the film's cast and writers give constant hilarious moments to add to the weak storyline and make a great film. Anna Farris returns as Cindy Campbell and is just as hilarious as she was in the first film. Other returning members are Shawn Wayans as Shorty, Regina Hall as Brenda, and Marlon Wayans as Ray.There are several other new cast members, such as Tori Spelling, who does a tolorable job as a fellow college student, Alex. Several other cast members make the film enjoyable and the gags are hilarious. This is a great movie to see, because it's short and just something to laugh about, so fork over the nine bucks and laugh your ass off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even funnier than Scary Movie! (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from "Scary Movie 2" just about an hour ago and I'm still laughing from thinking about it.The cameos by James Woods, Veronica Cartwright, and Natasha Lyonne are funny enough just to pay for admission. But that's before the film starts to get funnier as the Wayans spoof "The Haunting," "Hannibal," "Save the Last Dance," and "Charlie's Angels." The only (semi) downside to the movie was that the sex jokes in this were racier than the ones in the original film, especially the spoof of "Titanic" that ends very messily.But besides that, "Scary Movie 2" may probably be the most fun you will probably have at the movies this summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel returns with great original characters and brilliant new ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with, I love the way this film was worked around a storyline where the original Scary Movie seemed rather random. Ferris, Hall and Marlon Wayans all once again completely steal the film, but new additions Cross and Elliott also have some amazing writing and scenes.The highlights for me were the opening scene with the spoof of The Exorcist, Cindy vs. Cat, the talking parrot and any scene involving Chris Elliott. I also thought the Charlie's Angels spoof towards the end of the film was also brilliant, particularly when a cow was being sucked around the tornado.Definitely a movie to watch if you want some good amusing immature fun with over the top acting and great gags.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have various mixed emotions about this sequel to the hit SCARY MOVIE. It wasn't as good but it delivered many laughs and slap-on-knees. I was a little surprised at this one on how they could spoof any movie right after the other. If you really liked the first one, you could be disappointed or satisfied with this one. I was satisfied. 7/10My MPAA rating: R for strong crude sexual content and humor, drug use and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I might have to do some checking up on this, but I'm pretty sure that seven writers is a record high for a non-anthology film. And just what is this cinematic treat scripted with so many pens? It's probably really good, right? I mean, with seven writers, it would have to be extremely good?or very, very bad. Unfortunately, it is the latter, and the movie is `Scary Movie 2.' This sequel of the funny teen-horror spoof `Scary Movie' has none of the subtleties, parodies, or even big laughs the original film did. Instead, it digresses to overtly sexual and gross-out humor which doesn't even work on a gut level. I feel sorry for every person associated with this project.The story line is actually a little more involved for `Scary Movie 2,' as if you needed a plot to set up the horrendous `laugh scenes,' which are fewer and far between this time. Classic camp actor Tim Curry is Professor Oldman, a college teacher who recruits a group of students to spend the night in a haunted house so he can conduct some sort of experiment (though we never really understand what that experiment is all about). Of course, this group contains most of the kids from the first `Scary Movie,' including innocent Cindy (Anna Faris), loud-mouthed Brenda (Regina Hall), marijuana-obsessed Shorty (Marlon Wayans), and sexually questionable Ray (Shawn Wayans). New this time is straight-arrow Clark (Christopher Masterson). The house is inhabited by the twisted butler Hanson (Chris Elliot) and even a ghost (`Night Court's' Richard Moll). The kids slowly discover the mysteries and secrets of the house, and make every bodily function, sexually oriented, inappropriate joke along the way.There are those who complain about this style of humor in general, and therefor will not see this movie. However, sometimes it works, such as in the original `Scary Movie,' `American Pie,' and even at the far end of the scale, `There's Something About Mary.' There, the gross out is permissible because there are characters we mildly care about, or there are other types of humor going on as well. However, `Scary Movie 2' is the prime example of where gross out humor can go wrong. Instead of playing up some of the humorous character stereotypes, or mixing in some creative horror movie parodies with the gross-out humor, `Scary Movie 2' relies solely on it. It seems to me that many scenes in the film were robbed of their comic potential so our seven scriptwriters could fit more vomit, feces, and other unmentionable bodily concoctions into the film.There are a few laughs that harked back to `Scary Movie,' and those scenes always feature one of the two Wayans brother's characters. Even though they had five other folks working with them, its clear that this is their project. Maybe those other five scriptwriters fought back and added in the gross-out stuff.As for performances, the same can be said. Both Wayans seem to have more comedic experience than their fellow teen-age counterparts. Faris is better than she was in the first `Scary Movie,' but nowhere near as funny. Plus, she still looks and sounds just a little too odd for me. Curry hasn't had a good role since the mid 80's, and its sad that this is the caliber of film he works in. There are other famous cameos including James Woods as a priest and former Conan O'Brien sidekick Andy Richter as his assistant, but one must wonder what they are doing slumming around in this film. After watching Woods in his worst performance to date, it frightened me to realize that Marlon Brando was originally cast in the role. There would be no saving his career had he gone through with this. If you have any desire to be thoroughly disgusted, or like your humor from the bottom of the barrel (and I mean bottom!) then check out `Scary Movie 2.' Otherwise, go on living your life with the knowledge than unlike myself, you managed to escape this waste of a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definition of mixed bag comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that I written off Scary Movie 2 when I first seen it as a sporadically funny sequel to Scary Movie(which I love). After seeing it again it's a lot better than I gave it credit for and is better than what comes after it.Scary Movie 2 pokes fun at haunted house movies, The Exorcist and even Charlie's Angels. The movie has its fair share of laughs in the beginning of the movie but sometimes the gross out gags are way over the top. To explain why I think this movie is a mixed bag, I'll contrast the funny parts from the unfunny parts.Funny Scene#1: The beginning with the spoof on the Exorcist was pretty funny stuff.Unfunny scene#1: The scene with James Woods on the toilet is flat out disgusting. Bleeech! James Woods already gives me the creeps so the last thing I need to see is him on the john.Funny Scene:# 2: Marlon's character teaching Anna Faris's character how to be hip and she mistakenly beats up on some unsuspecting girl.Unfunny Scene# 2: Chris Elliot's abnormal hand digging into a pie as well as a turkey. Nuff said! Funny Scene# 3: Tori Spelling's character becomes clingy to a ghost after a night of sex.Unfunny Scene# 3: Shawn Wayan's character impaling the evil clown from Poltergeist with his third leg. Need I say more? Funny Scene: # 4: The spoof on the Nike commercial.Unfunny Scene: #4: The wisecracking parrot pooping.I could go on forever.Scary Movie 2 is a lot better than most people give it credit for but it could have been a lot better than it predecessor. What kills it is the excessive gross out gags are focused on more than the movie that its supposed to poke fun at. All in all it was a good spoof not a great spoof. Its definitely better than Scary Movie 3 and 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.You know why I like this movie? I spent easily over a thousand dollars on all the bad movies this makes fun of. Now I get double my bad movie value.The first `Scary' was great. It made fun of the audience. You couldn't get what was being made fun of unless you were just the kind of dope who both went to the original movie being made fun of AND you thought the spoof joke was funny. This was pretty clever stuff, right on the edge of spitting in your eye and expecting you to laugh. But we did.The sequel bears the same relation to the original that the Blair Witch sequel did. The original BWP was an intelligent reference to the state of film. The sequel referenced not the same state that the original did, instead it referenced the phenomenon of the first film.And so it is here. This sequel doesn't make fun of the audience directly as before, but indirectly by reference to the first. Not every kid will be able to follow this. But I'm impressed by those that can.Your tipoff is James Woods, and the reference to `Shadow of the Vampire.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a let-down from the first one! (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I *loved* the original Scary Movie. I'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. I think the Wayans' are a family of comical geniuses. Alas, even geniuses make mistakes.The movie begins with promise. I liked "The Exorcist" parody, especially the "come on out, ma" gag. Now, that's Wayans-quality material. But, other than that, I can only think of two other times I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he's saying, "It was just a booty call!!" That was kinda funny. 2) The "Save the Last Dance" parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.The rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gross-out gags. Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone. For example, in Scary Movie I, several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay. This was hilarious. But, in Scary Movie II, the whole penis-strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny. This is the pattern of the whole film. Shock humor *alone* doesn't take a movie very far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give this one a 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scary Movie 2" is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.This movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I don't think you will like it nearly as much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A haunted house where a girl was once possessed by the devil is the locale in this unwanted sequel to the box office monster of 2000. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are the most notable teens in a parody-riddled bore that falls all to pieces after "The Exorcist" becomes the early headliner with James Woods (no idea why he is in this, but is admittedly the film's strongest asset) doing battle with the prince of darkness ala Max Von Sydow nearly 30 years earlier. Tiring and down-right sleep-inducing chapter in the highly successful series goes for gross-out and adult-oriented humor and falls flat on its smug face over and over again. Do not waste your time.

		<shortDescription>A Decent Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of teens are tricked by their professor into visiting a haunted house for a school project. Now, the house is filled with secrets and ghosts.This film pokes fun of many horror films, including The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Haunting, and What Lies Beneath. The prologue, like any other Scary Movie films, spoofs The Exorcist. It was funny and gross.The acting is some-what good but a film like this only focuses on the jokes, which is a good thing. This film made me laugh so hard at some scenes and others were tend to be too gross and not funny at all.Unlike David Zucker's Scary movie films, the Wayans push their Scary Movie films to be rated R. Their jokes can go far as they want it. It can be as crude, gross, or sexual as they want it. Some may like their style better than David Zucker's so it just depends on which team you like.This is the worst, not meaning bad, film of the series. Yeah, it gives out some big laughs but it wasn't as funny as the other three films in the franchise. The team are trying too hard to pull for the joke. Fans of the Scary Movie films might be disappointed by this sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is way badder than the first. Scary Movie 1 had laughs every single minute of the movie, but the second one is less funny. The interpretation was still very good, and Keenan Ivory Williams is still able to direct his movie, but let's just say it's not as funny and as organized as the first Scary Movie. Yeah, you get a laugh every once a while, but still, that's not enough to make this movie one of my favourites. It's watchable, but still, as I said many times, Scary Movie 1 is way much better. The Wayans brothers are still pretty good, but I've seen a lot better (and funnier) results from them than from Scary Movie 2.</fullReview>

Some of which are the best films to be ever created in the 20th century. One really great film is Poltergeist. A very well conducted film based on spirits attacking others. I really thought in the past this film was really great. Now, watching this in the future, I think, wow are these the same directors for the first film because I could their not. I guess the pot and drugs got to their brains...BAD. They could do more really. I loves comedy/horror films though this is my least liked one. In this people are getting blow-jobs by ghost, getting smoked, also clowns are being raped, plus fighting cats. I mean that sound like it could the funny but anyone could outgrow these laughs.

		<fullReview>Much like Scream 2, the original was a huge success (if only financial) and everyone knew the inevitable sequel had to be bigger, bolder, and even better. In both cases they failed though Scream 2 is a decent follow-up and Scary Movie 2 is not decent. At all, really.Parody and satire are two forms of comedy that overlap well. Parody to be making fun of a particular film while satire targets an institution or ideal. The first Scream satirized the horror genre and the audience's awareness of formulaic conventions of cinema. Scream 2 to a lesser extent satirized the necessity of sequels while Scream 3 became a parody of itself. Scary Movie 2 attempts neither and, as Scary Movie 1 did with Scream, popularized the trend of referential humour. Do you remember this scene from that movie? Well here it is but dumber, no real punchline or set-up, just try and find the laughter yourself.The film is slower, looser, and plain meanders through what coherent plot there is. Whereas the adopted structure of Scream gave a natural flowing pace, the new targeted genre of the Old Dark House is so poorly accomplished. The two biggest strengths of films such as The Haunting and the House on Haunted Hill being suspense and atmosphere. Unless a complete absence of those two counts for parody then the writers are left with resorting to arbitrary current pop culture nods from Charlie's Angels to Nike commercials with little to no connective tissue between scenes.That Nike reference becomes a perfect summary of the Movie franchise from here onward. The riff of The Changeling into the basketball commercial is an almost clever subversion and yet they expect audiences to laugh continuously through every single character performing dribbling and passing until you forget what movie you're even watching. Monotony leads to false expectations of a punchline but there is none bar a character getting hit in the nuts before just moving on with the next scene.I give the original Scary Movie some credit. It is lazy in just taking Scream's formula almost scene for scene but at least moves with a steady pace and some sense of purpose. These sequels are the equivalent of a YouTube playlist of fan-made parodies of completely unrelated films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary in its awfulness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is, Scary Movie wasn't that bad. Seriously, it was actually a half-decent spoof. This? Not so much. A spoof of haunted house movies, this starts out well with a funny Exorcist parody before descending into juvenile spoof fare that actually defies belief. How did someone come up with all these terrible jokes and see them as funny? Still, to come up with so many awful gags and stuff them into an 80 minute film must take a lot of skill, so for that the many writers should be given some sort of credit I suppose. Otherwise, this film deserves no credit at all. Ironically, the parts where it works are during the more action-based set pieces which can be quite fun. It has a reasonable cast as well, with the returning leads (Even though their characters died in the first one) giving serviceable performances. Tim Curry and David Cross are both good as well. The reason why this spoof doesn't work is because the jokes are so lame, juvenile, over-the-top and coarse that you'll find yourself nostalgically thinking of many horror films this kind of spoof parodies, since most of them are funnier than this. The truth is, it'd be a good spoof for young children since they might find this kind of humour funny. Sadly, since it's also very adult and at times pretty offensive, which clashes jarringly with the juvenile nature of the movie, the people that will go to see this are mostly just going to be annoyed. Overall, this just isn't a good movie. At first, you can sort of enjoy it due to its silly, unrestrained atmosphere but eventually it just becomes highly annoying. There are decent jokes at times, but they pop up too rarely to salvage this train wreck of a comedy.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The monster is gonna kill us...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the best of the entire "Scary Movie" franchise, in my opinion of course. And the reason for this is that the laughs are more bountiful and sincere throughout the course of this movie, and the spoofs are more thoroughly executed.But a big portion of the credit should also go to the fabulous cast, both returning cast members but also new ones on the cast list. Because people were really doing good jobs with their given roles and characters throughout the course of "Scary Movie 2".True to the spirit of the first movie, and the rest of the movies essentially, this is a hilarious spoof movie which has no restraints and respects no boundaries. As such, then there are many really funny scenes throughout the movie, and if you enjoy a good spoof movie that pokes fun at a lot of other movies, then "Scary Movie 2" is definitely well worth watching.Compared to the first "Scary Movie" installment, then this 2001 sequel offers more of a storyline, better spoofs, better effects and and all-round better cast. All in all, a more enjoyable movie experience. And I guess I enjoy this sequel more because the spoofs are based on some more impressive horror movies, compared to what was seen in the first "Scary Movie".Even the introduction scene which spoofed "The Exorcist" is enough in itself to make it worthwhile to sit down and watch "Scary Movie 2". That really was a great way to start off the movie.I am rating "Scary Movie 2" six out of ten stars. If you enjoy comedies, then "Scary Movie 2" is well-worth sitting down to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make way for fanny........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of teens including Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks are invited to spend a night in Hell House. Professor Oldman has convinced them it is for a school project, but the night won't go past quietly. Master Kane is long dead, but still plans on enjoying himself, especially with one of the group. When things really start becoming more perfunctory than parody, the gang must work together to find a way to capture this ghostly menace......Scary Movie was always going to be a smash hit. After all, how meta was to spoof a film that was wholly ironic with the horror genre to begin with? But a huge theatre hit doesn't always necessarily mean it will be a good film, but it does mean a lesser enjoyable sequel will be released somewhere down the line.......Ask Jack Sparrow.....So this film spoofs the like of The Exorcist, The Haunting, Hollow Man, What Lies Beneath, and for some reason, Charlie's Angels.The film starts off not terrible, with woods sending up Max Von Sydow's Father Merrin, and a little bit of The Amityville horror.But once Woods looks at 'Reagan' and utters an expletive, it goes downhill rapidly, and we are only five minutes into the film.The rest of the jokes consist of homophobic, drug related, disability, culture, sexual organs reference which never really demand ones use of the brain, and instead cater for people who like inane jokes that are nothing more than pop references that become out if date the minute the film is released in the home format.For example, their is a two minute set piece involving a basketball, and what must be a parody of some sort of sportswear. The thing is, this commercial was never shown in the UK, so it really goes over Many a head.So all in all, it's just a blatant cash I on a surprising success, and the films just got porter and poorer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A jumbled mess with few laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary movie 2 is of course the sequel to the movie I wish I could forgot, Scary Movie (2000). This sequel is basically just more of the same, but maybe with a couple more laughs than the first film. The acting is alright I suppose, for this type of movie it is. Many of the jokes just fall flat and fail, but there are a couple that squeeze bye and actually did make me laugh. There are a couple of scenes where the gross out "humor" was just too over the top for my taste. Tim Curry is in this movie, and I didn't really hate his character, but I certainly didn't love his character either, I didn't really care whether he was in it or not. If you liked first scary movie then you will probably like this one. But I just didn't care for it, the jokes were lame and dull, nothing to brag about. Yeah I guess that's about it there's not much more to say, this is a dull movie with too much gross out humor that really I would just like to forget about, basically the same as the first film. So both movies receive the same rating from me, a 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 (2001): Dir: Keenan Ivory Wayans / Cast: Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Tim Curry, Regina Hall: After spoofing The Exorcist and The Amittyville Horror in the opening, this sequel then plummets in despair. This time it targets The Haunting and The House On Haunted Hill with Tim Curry summoning a group of students to Hell House. There is no story to be found as it gets lost in its own vile. Keenan Ivory Wayans achieved the satire delivery in the first film but he directs this sequel rather half-heartedly. Anna Faris returns as Cindy who gets into a boxing fight with a cat in a reference to Raging Bull. Marlon Wayans is wrapped and smoked by a marijuana plant. This may very well be the best visual joke in the film but it is carried on too long. Shawn Wayans surprises a clown demon under the bed in a reference to Poltergeist. Curry is wasted as a professor who serves no real purpose. Perhaps it is his appeal from The Rocky Horror Picture Show that aided in his casting but this film hardly allows him to catch lightning in a bottle. Regina Hall returns and dies again, which makes little sense but then again, why look for logic here. Scary Movie used vulgar humour but it worked because it exposes horror film clichés. This time Wayans is given a larger budget and creates a spectacle in shame that should be wrapped like a joint and lit on fire. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel spoofs a number of movies including Charlie's Angels, Poltergeist, and Hannibal, with The Exorcist being the central theme of the movie. Here, some college teens are invited to spend a night in Hell House by Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) as part of a school project. However, Oldman's really wants the ghost of the house's former master resurrected.There are a lot of gross sexual humor is this film, as well as over-the-chart shameless stuff. While I got a couple of chuckles out of the movie, the plot was rushed through and there is nothing supposedly scary or exciting about the story. If you want a good scary film comedy spoof, watch Scary Movie 3, which is much more entertaining and serves much better as a parody of scary movies.Grade D---</fullReview>

Overall, still a good laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was coming off of streaming, which motivated me to give it a try. Frankly, I was expecting this to be way too juvenile to stomach, but I wound up being pleasantly surprised. Yes, it is crude and raunchy with strong teenager appeal, but it was also reasonably intelligent and quite entertaining, as long as you get the jokes and references. No way is anything like this ever going to win an Oscar, but some (most?) nights that's not what you are looking for anyway. This movie was perfectly fit for purpose, so, and I can't believe I'm doing this, I'm giving it a perfect ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making a comedy that is funny because it is stupid is one of the hardest things to do. Because it can very easily just end up being stupid. Scary Movie 2 has none of the charm, laughs, and fun that the original provided. It might have something to do with that the main movie being parodied (The Haunting remake) wasn't even that good to begin with. Instead of poking fun of the genre in a hilarious over the top manner like the first one did, this film instead goes for gross out humor and various unfunny jokes. There are only so many times I can say "thats not funny" so I just leave it at this. Scary Movie 2 is not funny, its dumb, vile, and idiotic. Just watch the first one instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hell House is a haunted place where there was an attempted exorcism on Megan (Natasha Lyonne). One year later, professor Oldman (Tim Curry) is using students Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), Shorty Meeks (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) to awaken Hell House. They are monitored by the professor and his assistant Dwight Hartman (David Cross). The house caretaker is Hanson (Chris Elliott). The other invited students include Buddy (Christopher Masterson) who pines for Cindy, Alex (Tori Spelling) and hot Theo (Kathleen Robertson).The Exorcist spoof start isn't that funny with a couple of passable gross out jokes. The main spoof is The Haunting. It's great to have Anna Faris back. There is a constant flow of gross out jokes. They're not always particularly insightful or relevant to the horror genre. There are a few big laughs but it's mostly a lot of random jokes that don't work. Following a single movie spoof gives the movie a better and more consistent flow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I myself happen to enjoy the scary movie franchise and find the films quite funny abit idiotic and cringe worthy but funny none the less. Scary Movie 2 is a parody of many films including What Lies Beneath, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill &amp; The Amytville Horror. All though I can see why people would say the films are stupid etc. I did find myself actually crying at some scenes for example the basketball scene in which they are doing a a parody of a old Nike commercial and the scene really was funny another scene is when Cindy is fighting with the cat it really did make me laugh. There is so many scenes in Scary Movie 2 that are really funny well to me anyway. I would recommend this film if they are in the mood for something a little bit scary and funny. Over all OK film with good humour.</fullReview>

The Wayans brothers? they're back! and better than ever! Okay, I think the reason I love this one way more is because of what it's spoofing and goofing off; the Exorcist. Oh yes, and another few things too. Those things being: The Haunting, What Lies Beneath, The Amityville Horror and Hollow Man....with a few more in there. And to be honest, they couldn't have done a better job. You see, although the first one was new, original, funny and had a great start-to-finish, the second is better because of the things it spoofs off; they're just funnier things to make fun of....mainly The Haunting and the Exorcist, but everything in general anyway. If you've not seen the 2nd Scary Movie, you honestly should! It's 75 minutes of great laughs, funniness and ever dirtier situations and happenings. A well-done, hilarious spoof.8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of the Scary Movies, almost ruined the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a couple laughs in the movie, so I won't rate it a 1/10. There are two memorable scenes in the entire movie for me. I went to see this with my best friend when it released in theater's. There were 2 other people in the theater.What really makes this movie so bad is the awkward scenes that draw on way too long. The movie had potential with the comically spooky plot, but the script, directing and casting ruined it.The only two actors/actresses that make this spoof movie funny in a couple parts are Marlon Wayans and Anna Faris. Marlon Wayans is responsible for one of the most memorable scenes in spoof movies, which I won't ruin for those who haven't seen it. Anna Faris does the best she can with the script she's been given, it would have been much worth with someone else cast in her place.Don't get me wrong, I'm an Anna Faris fan, but this movie almost killed the franchise for me.Some of what was supposed to be funny, instead made me completely uncomfortable as with anyone else I watched it with.I rate this a 2/10 because of two funny scenes that prevented the movie from being completely boring and not watchable. Scary Movie 3 saves the franchise from extinction in my opinion. The first Scary Movie was quite good for its time in my opinion as well.I hated Scary Movie 4, but Scary Movie 5 was a a lot more funny as a spoof movie than I expected.Please remember that the Scary Movie series is a collection of spoofs, not parodies. Movies like this are designed to be completely unrealistic. Spoofs are comedic copies of other movies.Scary Movie 2 almost has nothing to do with the rest of the series, so I'd suggest skipping it in the series entirely. Scary Movie 4 also has nothing to do with Scary Movie 5, but its a lot more watchable at a 5/10 in my opinion, so the choice is yours.</fullReview>

I can find enjoyment out of bad movies like sharknado but not this one. It is a fact that I laughed only once the entire movie! The saddest part is that it was in the first five minutes of the movie so I sat through the rest of the movie bored out of my mind. There are no characters to care about, no plot, and shitty special effects. But guess what I fully expected that and put that aside. AND I STILL HATED IT! I just wanted the movie to make me laugh and it failed at that. Well, it did make me laugh once so I'll give it 1 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent sequel but not in the same league as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is the follow up to the immensely funny 'Scary Movie' that released in the year 2000. This franchise reintroduced the spoof genre from where the 'Naked Gun' series left off. As a matter of fact it was this franchise that spawned many similar spoof films such as epic movie, disaster movie etc. The Wayans brothers return with more tongue in cheek humour. As a stand alone film it score full points. But one can't help but notice it falling short in comparison to the first film. It felt like a rushed venture. Despite it's short running time, the film didn't seem to have a plot unlike the first movie. Many loose ended comic situations arise revolving around each character. It was almost as if the writer had written the script as production proceeded from one stage to the next.The whole premise revolves around a group of characters who are invited by Tim Curry to a haunted house to spend the night and conduct supernatural existence experiments. This intending to have connection to 'The Haunting' film. Afterwards strange occurrences begin to happen, which lead to hilarious situations. The film depicts haunting situations in a comic fashion. Apart from some of hysterical content, there were many moments that appeared pale. They were not so funny and the comedy seemed forced at times. For instance the 'basketball' scene. Many films were parodied from the outstanding 'Exorcist' sequence with James Woods, to the 'amityville horror' and 'poltergeist'. The highlights of the film are without a doubt the scenes involving David Cross and Marlon Wayans. The actors are part of the best moments from the entire movie. Cross is rib achingly funny with his wheelchair antics and Wayans evokes much laughter with his unique acting. The joint and having sex with the ghost segment were the best. Anna Faris unfortunately disappoints as she is shadowed by supporting actors. There was n't much opportunity for her to perform. The 'charlie's angels' scene was bad. and the worst from the selection. Overall this is a good addition to the franchise, but it could have been better if perhaps David Zucker or Aaron Setzler had contributed.</fullReview>

It's unbelievable that the people involved are allowed to write after something as uninteresting and poorly conceived as this. This is garbage on top of garbage and the only reason I saw it from one point to another is the fact that I thought I needed to warn people about how horrible it could get, and it gets pretty horrible and then unwatchable.

		<fullReview>Woe is me; was this unfunny! They must have rushed this one into production after the smashing success of the original. I very much enjoy the original Scary Movie, but this one is truly god awful. The opening scene with James Woods as a priest is sidesplitting. They spoof The Exorcist, and it was brilliant. It's all downhill from there? There is an unfunny Charlie's Angel's spoof (Why did that need to be spoofed, again?) The cast itself is just fine. It has way too many juvenile jokes. I always expect hit and misses with these movies, but most of them ARE misses. There is plenty of semen jokes and crude stuff like that. We also get one of the most annoying comedians in the world today. (Chris Elliot) I can't stomach the guy. He does nothing but gross out gags throughout the film, and I just wanted to slap him one. Watching Kathleen Robertson's cleavage bop up and down is a rather nice distraction. Her cleavage does the acting for her. Great performance! Anna Farris is fine as per usual. She plays it all straight faced like a trooper; I just wish she had better stuff to work with. Christopher Masterson makes me pine for Jon Abrahams. The Wayan brothers do their thang and it's not as funny this time around. Regina Hall sticks out like a sore thumb. I actually got very annoyed by her in this one. Tori Spelling &amp; Tim Curry are both OK. David Cross is excruciatingly unfunny as the invalidFinal Thoughts: This is what happens when you get greedy and rush production. Scary Movie is quite funny, this isn't! By far the worst in the series 2/10</fullReview>

The only good characters they kept were Brenda portrayed by Regina Hall and Cindy played by Anna Faris. The Wayan's brothers stayed, which I am so glad they left in the next movie, and new cast were recruited, like Tori Spelling who played Alex, Tim Curry who played the Professor, and the best new cast member was Christopher Masterson, who portrayed Buddy. Me and my friend always say the quotes from the "Scary Movie" franchise, since we both love the series, and this is the movie in which we quote the least. Brenda said our favorite quote which was, "WAS! I'm gonna miss ya girl!" This movie is rated R. Very sexual stuff and some harsh language. Not recommended for people 15 or under.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find these movies the cinematic equivalent of junk food, not good for you but completely fun and nothing else.As far as the jokes go - they range either from amusing to disgusting, yet amusing. Some also fall flat. Which is common in some of these movies. However watch the first, third and fourth one instead. They provide much more wholesome entertainment out of this genre.This one might not be for everyone. In terms of quality I suggest skipping this one for those who want to see all the Scary Movies I deem "good" as opposed to this which I deem "watchable". One thing I did like about it though was it's short length, making the people who may deem it one of the worst movies of all time say "at least it was short." So this one is an okay watch, just not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot work out how on earth this had been rated so low but the only conclusion I can come to is a lot of people mustn't have a sense of humour. I cant tell you how many times I was in fits of laughter at this film, from the very first Exorcist scene right until the end. I will admit there is a few moments that are to stupid but that is no way enough to stop me from giving this a 9. I am just going to give you an idea of how many things I can think of off the top of my head that are hysterical. Firstly the Exorcist scene, the red dress scene, the wheel chair V hand scene, the I.T the clown scene, Sydney escaping form the panic room scene, the Hannibal scene and like I said that is off the top of my head. I think who ever watches this knows they aren't going to get a well written masterpiece but this is a simple story filled with so many good jokes that it is worthy of much higher than 4.9. I can honestly say I have watched this about 12 times and still laugh at all the best one's. Just give it a try, I think its the best out of the whole series. The 1st one is good, this 2nd one is brilliant, the 3rd one is good but the 4th one is a let down (apart from the Tom Crusie scene at the end, that is genius).</fullReview>

Cindy (Faris) and her friends, Shorty (M. Wayans), Brenda (Hall) and Ray (S. Wayans) are now in college and decide to stay at a haunted mansion for their professor (Curry). Robertson (Beverly Hills 90210) plays Theo, Cross (Men in Black) plays the professor's crippled assistant, Dwight, Moll (Night Court) plays evil ghost, Hugh Cane, Elliot (Groundhog Day) plays Hanson, the butler with a gross hand, Spelling (Beverly Hills 90210) plays college student, Alex and James Woods (John Carpenter's Vampires) makes a cameo at the beginning of the film as a priest. Though the first film is better, this isn't a bad sequel I still recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Thousand and One Razzies !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the 1970s end, dirt-exploitation became in fashion through Hollywood's mainstream comedies, with a lot of producers enjoying manipulating the lowest human desires with heavier and filthier load as time goes by. Till I came to a point where I believed they deal with animals not humans anymore. Naturally Scary Movie 2 isn't far from that point; it's nearly it ! In 2000 the Wayans brother's Scary Movie was a hit. For good parody out of the 1990s horror / teen movies?, for the dirty comedy? For both? Anyway, this round, their target was making a parody of many horror movies, TV shows, and TV ads, while immersing all of that in an ocean of filth !Filth, in this movie's makes' conscience, is comic. In my conscience it isn't. It's only filth; purely, powerfully and torrentially made this time too. They sure thought "Hey, if 50 filthy joke made millions, so how about 500 !". Not obligatorily a good move, but the producers must have LOVED it, giving the Wayans a mighty freehand to be as filthy as they could to bring double the money that the original brought ! But profitable or not, the movie is ultra awful. Watching it is like swimming in a dreadful sewer. And completing it assures nothing but the masochist side in every human. The real comic moments are rare coincidences; it's like running into sane persons in a nut house ! Here, filth comes with many shapes. (Chris Elliott)'s character does the biggest job of it. I bet, the Wayans peed themselves out of laughing while making this, and we just were left to smell the conclusion.. of their peeing !Porn movies are all about many sex scenes. Toilet humor movies are all about Scary movie 2. However, this movie is cheaper than porn, because it could do more but ended up being a nightclub designed as a real, so busy and so dirty public toilet. I won't say comedy was never more loathsome; it's loathsomeness was never more loathsome ! The problem is that not nominating it for even one Razzie Award as if refers to its being as a good comedy anyway ! Well, a 1000 Razzies from my side then, and one Razzie for the Razzie foundation itself due to its shameful overlooking ! (Scary Movie 2) reached a zenith concerning the dirt-exploitation. Being the extremely overfull it is, produces 2 kinds of audiences; a die hard lovers, and a die hard haters. I'm with the second. My only consolation is that it has less farts than Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000) !Finally a note; 2001 witnessed a wave of comedies with various nastiness, like Scary Movie 2, American Pie 2, Freddy Got Fingered, Not Another Teen Movie, Say It Isn't So, Shallow Hal, and Tomcats; being not what 2001 is distinguished by, rather ashamed of! Though, after 10 years, I have to thank god. Because having in 2011 The Hangover 2 and Bridesmaids only refers to how this sort of comedies has reduced through the years. Ahh, does humanity finally prevail ?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but a hilarious sequel to the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first Scary Movie. Though, it did seemed rushed and some of the humor were crude, it was still a mindless entertaining start to a franchise due to it's success at the box office. I thought this movie was going to be even better, but sadly, it does have some flaws that ruined it for me. The Titanic spoof was forced and messy, the Haunting spoof, although adequate, wasn't as great as I thought it would be and the pacing was too rushed for it's own good.With those flaws aside, everything turned out fine. The story was OK, but nothing special. Some of the spoofs are clever and funny including the Exorcist parody with a great cameo from James Woods, and the scene during dinner with a running joke about the hand. Then, there's the cast. Marlon Wayans, David Cross, and Chris Elliot did great, but Anna Faris's, although a bit better than the first, was overdone, and Tim Curry, although made me feel pleased to see him, sadly didn't get enough screen time. The 2 strongest highlights for the movie goes to the bizarre and silly, yet hilarious script and a great soundtrack.Overall, flawed, but an entertaining and hilarious sequel to the first and is not as bad as some say it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day 29 Of My 31 Days Of Horror Double Review Part 2.Director Keenan Ivory Wayans returns with a hit and miss comedy sequel with Scary Movie 2. The films main parodies are The Haunting And The Excorcist. The film is about Cindy Cambell played by Anna Faris and a group of her friends go to a haunted House for the night but are really being used for an experiment run by a professor played by Tim Curry. The film is the weakest in the series and is not as fun as the first and is very hit and miss although I recommend it for a few laughs.Rated R For Some Strong Sexual And Gross Humor, Graphic Language And Some Drug Content.1hr 22min/82min.39 uses of the F-word.**/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, the Wayans brothers have trawled the murkiest depths of toilet humour and smut to put together another crude collection of puerile fart, tit, willy and sex gags, loosely tied together by a scrappy horror-based script that parodies everything from genre classics (The Exorcist) to modern clunkers (The Haunting remake), as well as unrelated big-budget blockbusters such as Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission Impossible 2.As with the first film, there has clearly been zero attempt at quality control in the gag department, with even the most utterly moronic and totally cringe-worthy of jokes making it into the final film (there were only two things about Scary Movie 2 that I would describe as genuinely laugh-out-loud funny: the opening scene featuring James Woods and Chris Elliott's inspired performance as Hanson, a crazy caretaker with a withered hand. Still, that's two more than the original, so I guess this silly sequel could actually be considered an improvement!).Thankfully, the charms of a pre-blonde, pre-surgery Anna Faris and the ample curves of busty babe Kathleen Robertson provide just about enough impetus for guys to persevere to the end (the girls stripping to their underwear is worth the wait); female viewers aren't catered for in the same manner (unless you count Shawn Wayans posing semi-naked with his todger tucked between his legs?eeek!).3.5 out of 10 (marginally more than I gave the first film), but not good enough for me to round it up to a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film although being so idiot, had a successful release and provided what the audience truly wanted from it: laughs.The conversations between the characters are so stupid that makes it funny. "Scary Movie 2" is basically a spoof of all the things in our society: horror movies, teenagers, selfishness, proud, drugs, women's seduction on men and the constant seek for sex. It's funny the way they approach the women's seduction on men, that thing that makes men say yes to all the girls ask. Cindy Campbell should have won some Oscar for being the dumbest character ever!! Anna Faris really knows how to interpret this kind of persona!And you see, this film is unbelievably 9 years old.. the jokes are still current and they'll probably make you laugh (if you've seen the movies spoofed), so give it a chance if you didn't see it yet. Worth your time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the first one and absolutely loved it so I thought I'd give the second one a go. I knew that it wasn't going to be as good as the first one but I wasn't disappointed. Faris' performance was yet again funny and believable. I hadn't seen any of the films that they were spoofing so I didn't really know much about the story-line but nevertheless it was funny as! My favourite character was definitely Shorty (although I thought he died in the first one?!) but the guy with the funny hand weirded me out... Overall I would say that Scary Movie 2 is a funny film with a clever cast. Like the first one if you don't like the sexual/toilet humour, give this one a miss. I would give it 8.5/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone 13+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too rushed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that "Scary Movie" was a huge hit, I can understand the studio wanted to strike while the iron was hot. This sequel came out less than a year after the original, they really wanted to make sure the audience hadn't forgotten the first one yet. Sadly, the time pressure is very apparent. This whole movie just seems very unfinished, lots of scenes look like blueprints of something that could potentially be funny. Take the scenes with the handicapped character for instance, those had so much more potential than they actually showed. Other scenes however are just plain lazy and repetitive. Yeah, Shorty still smokes weed, the gay guy is still gay, Cindy is still ditzy and Brenda is still loud. Nothing new or creative is done with any of these characteristics, the actors just routinely reprise their stereotypes wondering when they're finally going to get a funny line. At 83 minutes, this movie is really quite short, but it's still packed with needless filler material and jokes that just appear to be rejected material from the first one. Very disappointing flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is a pretty funny sequel to the first film even though it may be a tad worse than the first one. This film seemed a little rushed but still had the same jokes from the first one. I was happy to see Anna Faris return as the clueless girl because she's pretty hot.This movie parodies films like The Haunting, House on the Haunted Hill, and Charlie's Angels. It's about a group of college friends who stay in the same haunted house for a so-called college project.There were a bunch of stars here that made this movie funny such as James Wood and Chris Elliot.I liked all the spoofs here. They were pretty good even though not all of them made me laugh.I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't quite like the first scary movie. The basic storyline there was copying "Scream" (which originally was supposed to be named "Scary Movie"), but didn't have anything in the story department other than that. So you can imagine my surprise when everyone was ranting about the second movie, having no story. The first one didn't have one and people didn't mind, why now? I guess it's the old, sequels must be bad (especially if they are comedies/spoofs). I beg to differ. I do think that the jokes do hit their target and if you don't mind the fact, that you do not have a coherent plot/story, you will enjoy this movie very much. There might be a few too many jokes concerning intercourse, but that's what people wanted to see at that particular time. Still no match to the great spoofs, like "Airplane!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films, for there is not much of a plot , bad acting, pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes. But. And this is a big but, there is one good actor, one good recurring joke, and a good beginning. The good actor being Tim Curry, the one good recurring joke is the creepy,weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things. And the good beginning is the spoof of the Excorsist.The plot to Scary Movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion, but will they survive the night? This film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One good thing about Scary Movie 2 is that it doesn't make you bored all the way unlike its prequel, which even though was better, but was dragging towards the end. The problem with this movie is that there are very little gags, and many of them are not that funny at all. Some of them are just stupid and not laughable. It had some good gags too like the Charlie's Angel's spoof and a few others. But many of them were just repeated from the first part. A few scenes, like the basketball scene, were good to listen but didn't really make any sense. I can't comment that much about the acting here as all had to act stupidly. Though I feel that the lady who wears lesser clothes and is one of the friends, has no acting capability as she wasn't funny either. One thing was good. Less nudity and whatever was there wasn't shown that clearly. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Defying Action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 was described by the Producers as being full of Death Defying Action. Oh really! Well I'll say this. The only "Death Defying Action" which you'll experience during watching Scary Movie 2 is managing not to die of boredom! As many people have already said on the comments page here, I was a big fan of the first Scary Movie. It was very funny. Unfortunetly, this sequel is neither funny, nor interesting. It has no real plot and although it starts brightly, it quickly runs out of steam. Personally, if I were a main actor in this movie, I think I would lose a lot of credibility. Of course, Scary Movie 2 is not supposed to be taken seriously, which is why it doesn't appeal to many people. To get the jokes, u have to have seen quite a few horror movies to 'get' the jokes. Jokes? Hmmmm. Indeed, I spent 2 hours laughing so much at Scary Movie 2's hilarious gags and zany knockabout comedy that I: a) Split my sides laughing and am now carrying 25 stitches in my midriff b) Dislocated my jaw during the riotous masterpiece that was the "clown under the bed routine" c) Was suffering from oxygen starvation due to protracted laughing. Uhh...no. Not really. In fact, this movie is FAR from funny. I'd rather set my new sofa on fire than watch this pile of junk again, so take my advice. DONT WATCH IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most stupid and unpleasant to watch movie of the last few years. Compared to that, the first "Scary Movie" seems like a brilliant comedy! It's only 83 minutes long, which is one of the two good things about it, the other being Anna Faris."Scary Movie 2" is filled with bad jokes (I laughed about 3 times while watching it, but I don't remember on what, and I'm writing this a day after watching it), cliches and copy-paste scenes from other movies. A few of those are at least a bit funny (For example, the "Charlie's Angels" scene), but most are pure garbage. The plot is copied from other horror films, mostly from "The Haunting", I guess...Actually, the first "Scary Movie" had a few scenes which could really scare you. This one is not scary, it's just repulsive... Rating: 1 out of 10. Please avoid seeing this even for free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far be it from me to tell a movie-maker how to make a movie. I've never done it. I'm sure it is quite hard.But, oh Jesus, it can't be this hard. The Wayans brothers must have been in some sort of horrible accident that rendered them completely (and unknowingly to themselves) unfunny.That is why I made the "one line summary" of this film: An Unfathomable Morass of Suck. I am a genius for being able to create such a complete and lucid one line summary, that so accurately depicts the true 'suck' of the film.But, seeing as that I am not a movie critic, you needn't take my word for it. Go ahead. Jump aboard the "Scary Movie 2" train, and watch, in seemingly perpetual agony, as the Wayans brothers take you on a journey of insipid body-humor and flat sight gags.If only the Wayans brothers could sit in a room filled with speakers, and listen in endless pain, to the thousands and thousands of miserable movie-goers, laughing in hideous cacophony at the failure known as "Scary Movie 2". Maybe then, they would learn their lesson.Wayans brothers, do us a favor and make like many failed comedians before you. Take your own lives. And do it in some pitifully unfunny fashion.</fullReview>

This is not one of them so stop judging it as it is. This film made money becasue it was funny and nothing else. That in itself is original these days.This film is the best of its kind since the original scary movie which in turn was the best of it's kind since Spaceballs. Just watch it and let yourself laugh at the jokes, at the plot, at the acting and at how something with so many bad parts can actually put a smile on someones face, after all isnt that the most important thing ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a prime example of how not to make sequels. The original Scary Movie was not a great movie (or even a good one), but it did at least have guts and was able to supply audiences with a decent amount of laughs.Alas, Scary Movie 2 is a hack effort from K.I. Wayans, who showed a lot of true comic talent years ago with I'm Gonna Kit You Sucka and TV's In Living Color. This is the thinest possible material for a major sequel (oh, I forgot Speed 2), with gags not even measuring up to those of Leslie Nielsen flicks like Wrongly Accused or Spy Hard. There are a lot jokes thrown at the audience, yet only the occasional one actually gets a laugh...the James Woods/'Exorcist' spoof mildly manages to succeed. It's all downhill from there.Marlon Brando had to decline the movie for health reasons. Or maybe he just reread the script.</fullReview>

The rest of the time I was just astonished that anyone making this film thought any of the scenes they were doing were funny. It was just gross many times and some scenes went on too long. So do you self a favor and dont see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you appreciate a funny film but your not too bothered about plot or story line? Then don't fail to give this film a try. Ok, so it's not going to win any awards for script or acting, but how many comedies do? The acting is first rate from Chris Elliot as the family butler with a strange looking hand. Other performances are second rate, but that doesn't matter as the movie takes you on a rollercoaster ride of laughs. The down side to the movie is that it can't make up its mind if it wants to be a spoof (of the Excorcist movie) or a collection of comic skits. Maybe that has something to do with the non-exsistant script. All in all, its worth renting out, honest!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I was disappointed in this film, I must say that I wasn't surprised either. The original "Scary Movie" was quite hilarious in the theater, but had no re-watch value at all. As far as "Scary Movie 2", I rented it because I absolutely HATED "What Lies Beneath." So any movie that poked fun at it was worth my time indeed. Boy, was I wrong. Plus (sorry to say, but...) Marlon Wayans is a moron. Just look at the scene where he rips out a page of a textbook and rolls a joint with it....and need I say more?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first installment was much better woven than this sequel. Marlon "Shorty" Wayans had a bigger part in the sequel; therefore, his drug-fried brained character brought the "plot"s mental level down greatly. Sexuality was overdone much in the same way as a puking scene was.Tori Spelling was her usually obnoxious self, while Kathleen Robertson was no replacement for Carmen Electra. Anna Faris was the most attractive quality of the film, while James Woods (solely an ice-breaker, unfortunately) was the funniest. Tim Curry and Chris Elliot were their usually selves as well.Richard Moll was a good choice for the ghost.WARNING: THE LIST OF PARODIES THAT FOLLOWS MAY BE CONSIDERED SPOILERSAs the first film was based primarily on "Scream," this sequel's exposition begins with a "Scream 2"-oriented story; however, it quickly turns into a spoof of "The Haunting." Here are most of the other movies parodied therein:Charlie's Angels; Child's Play; The Exorcist; Hannibal (though the mask shown on the cover never appears); Hollow Man; House on Haunted Hill; It; Paulie; Road Trip; Save the Last Dance; Urban Legends: Final Cut; The Weakest Link; What Lies Beneath</fullReview>

The biggest fun is to guess what movie they are making a fun out of in every scene, useless to watch if you are not in the scary movie genre. "Hollow Man, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Hannibal" just to name a few. Charlies Angels, one of the best weelchair chases ever and 75 mins of very rude jokes spice it up a little. The movie has its scary effects, is funny but not one of those you will watch twice or thrice...</fullReview>

Whether you're making The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Hot Shots or Dude, where's my car?...the one crucial element you require is STRUCTURE, and this film had none. It's as if they came up with all the sketches; Titanic, that Basketball ad, etc. then just filled in the gaps.I will give it one plus - the Exorcist skit was great - I nearly sh*t myself laughing. To be honest, had I left the cinema after that scene, I wouldn't have cared so much about paying hard-earned cash to watch ten minutes of a movie, but sadly - I stayed - and forced myself to endure the rest of the crap in it.But then again when it takes 10 writers or so to write a script, you're asking for trouble...and also a sh*t script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 (2001) Starring: Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Anna Faris, Regina Hall, Chris Masterson, Kathleen Robertson, David Cross, James Woods, Tori Spelling, Tim Curry, Andy Richter and Natasha Lyonne. Genre: Comedy/Horror.In 2000, the Wayans brothers released Scary Movie, a spoof of recent slasher movies of the 90's as well 80's and 70's. It was a surprise hit and grossed over US$150 million, but the tagline of the movie said "No sequel", well they lied.The Wayans brothers bring us a new follow-up of last year's surprise hit, this time Scary Movie 2 spoofs the supernatural movies. Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), now in college after suffering the wacky massacre in her birth town, is invited by a laid professor (Tim Curry) to take a weekend in a house alongside with her friends the always show stealer Brenda (Regina Hall), Ray with his always confusing sexuality, Shorty the drug adict and Brenda's brother, the bombshell Theo (Kathleen Robertson) and the dumby girl Alex (Tori Spelling). When they are welcome to the Hell House, more jokes and crazyness happens when they discovers that there's a ghost watching them.Scary Movie 2 delivers with more laughs and more jokes. Is better that the first one and this movie will make you laugh more harder than the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They´ve got Tim Curry, and no RHPS joke?! CONTAINS SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AGAIN, THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS - but since the movie has like no plot or surprises, all it spoils are some jokesI loved Scary Movie. The second installment, well... I´m not so thrilled about. Sure, it had good jokes, but this time, it had a lot of jokes which either were completely unfunny (all those jokes about the handymans hand were SO not funny IMO).When the movie shines and makes you laugh, it WORKS. For example, you know the scene in the trailer "I hope she doesn´t find out..." "Who?" "Your wife". That scene itself is really unfunny, I wonder why they bothered to put it in the trailer, but a joke about one minute after this which builds on that scene had me howling with laughter.And finally - maybe I just didn´t catch it, but with the whole movie having a cast of characters just like Rocky Horror Picture Show (they´ve got a couple, a guy in a wheelchair, some other not-so-important characters, a handyman AND Tim Curry in an old creepy mansion), I was really disappointed that there wasn´t a mock-up of it. If there was one, I didn´t notice it.So, I can´t really recommend this movie. If you liked the first one, go ahead and watch it - you probably won´t be as thrilled as you were with the first one, but you´re pretty much sure to get some good laughs out of it.Oh, finally - if you liked the first Scary Movie but didn´t like this one, you might want to check out "Shriek (if you know what I did...)", an (unfortunately) straight-to-video release. It´s a movie I personally liked even more than the first Scary Movie, maybe because it was really low on gross-out jokes. Hey, I liked Can´t Hardly Wait better than American Pie, too... so maybe that´s just me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly bad movie. I love horror films. I love spoofs. I love Airplane and Hot shots, but this is just crap. Most of the original cast returns even though they died in the first and the fact that Shannon Elizabeth isn't one of them just makes me hate it more. It's just the same old jokes and repetitive swearing that this film offers. The thing that really bugs me though is the stupid woman constantly yapping! The deformity and disabled jokes although funny were getting out of hand by the end of the first half and the tired old sequences copying famous films have mostly been spoofed before. The plot is mostly based on the Haunting, which strangely, no review I've read has mentioned. But it could have been better if they kept the scream guy in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less jokes. Less movie. Less fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is like the majority of sequels: alright movies, but pale in comparison to the original. There are several things wrong with this movie. First, its way too short, less than 1 hour and a quarter. Also, there are less jokes than the original. Second, some of the jokes are very badly worked (most notably, the rip off of the Nike basketball ad: all that build-up and a bad joke at the end. Third, even if it is a spoof and not a horror movie, there really should be a larger death toll. Finally, the plot really lets it down. Weren't Ray and Brenda killed in the first movie? Just who are Theo and that one played by Tori Spelling? They're not introduced to the audience, they just walk up to Cindy and start talking to her a few scenes into the film. I know a spoof doesnt really need a great plot, but when IMDBs two line summary would do for a full, in-depth review of the movie's plot, you start to worry. Dont get me wrong, there are some excellent jokes and the actors are alright, which makes the movie worth going to see, just don't expect to enjoy it as much as Scary Movie 1. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, I'm viewer Marchy, you may remember me from such movie reviews as...'Scary Movie.' And, once again, I find myself questioning what it is people expect a film such as this to do for them. If they're expecting chilling horror, they won't get it. If they're expecting a 'Memento'-style plot that twists like Chubby Checker, they'll be disappointed. However, what they will get is a SPOOF. A SPOOF. A MICKEY-TAKE. Yes, the plot is basic, if existent. It's part of the parody. Yes, the characters are one-dimensional and do stupid things. It's part of the parody. Yes, there's some pretty gross bits (well, actually, just one bit springs to mind, why the uproar?) but here's the tricky bit - these bits are for the benefit of people who actually find slapstick things funny, not only ironic or black humour. You saw the trailer, you saw the opening scene, if you didn't like the sight of a bodily-fluid-heavy Exorcist spoof which is the film's opening and main selling point, why persevere? I choose to see this as a film fan's film. Having seen all the lampooned flicks I found it fun to spot the references, some of which were pretty subtle - it added a whole new level to the humour; the play on the climactic scene from 'Hannibal' isn't going to mean much to those who haven't seen it, but it's still funny. And to those who have blasted the references to the wheelchair-bound and so on - lighten up and stop looking for reasons to dislike the film just because you're so much more mature than the rest of us. They did it in X-Men, Naked Gun and even Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where were you then?Worse than 'Scary Movie' - slightly less clear references Better than 'Scary Movie' - KATHLEEN ROBERTSON8/10</fullReview>

The entire cinema was laughing from start to finish and everyone there found it hilarious.The main reason that this is better than Scary Movie is because of the wide range of films spoofed even including comedy flms such as Dude, where's my car. I think this gave the writers a lot more scope whereas large amounts of the original were simply recycled from Scream.Overall I would say that this a fantastic film and everyone should see it, even if you didn't like the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first one was a disposable but funny comedy that you laughed hard at and then threw away when you were done. The second one should have been thrown away before it went into production. Why? They didn't care. The introduction parody of the Exorcist approaches the level of comedy of the original and shows how funny James Woods can be but after that it goes downhill real fast. Which leads me to wonder if they started out with as much enthusiasm as the first, but got lazy and decided just to slap something together. And why not, it seems slapped together from left over ideas they probably wrote over one weekend and contains zero of the care of attacking all the little details of horror movies. I mean, they even reuse gimmicks from the first one that don't even work in the context, they were so dry for ideas. Huge disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the Exception of Elliot's Hilarious Performance, this Movie Is Drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely walk out of a movie before it ends. I feel that I owe something to the cast and crew to sit through the results of their hard work. But I left Scary Movie 2 after the first hour. Simply put, there was no reason to stay until the end. I had guessed every scene up to the point that I left, so I just imagined a dull, uninspiring ending and got popcorn instead. The movie was lazy, not scary and not funny. Essentially, Scary Movie 2 exists to capitalize on it's predecessor's name and make a lot of money off of teenagers (and me). I enjoyed the original Scary Movie. While I admit that it was lowbrow movie fun, it was hilarious. The performances were funny. The writing was clever and satirical. It was worth my money. I feel that the makers of Scary Movie 2 owe me money now. To think that I actually gave up an hour of my life for this worthless chatter angers me. I will, however, say this about one of the actors . . . Chris Elliot (previously in Cabin Boy, There's Something About Mary, and the Doritos commercial) is hilarious as the disgusting misfit butler Hanson. If this movie is ever on HBO, try to watch Chris' scenes. He really is a comic talent. I suspect most of his dialog was improvised, since it contrasted so starkly to the rest of this depressed film. Scary Movie 2 is drivel.</fullReview>

I was expecting more from the wayans brothers yet the only funny thing out there mouths was when shawn wayans told his girlfriend " baby get my vasoline wheres my vasoline".

		<shortDescription>Tired re-hash of the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie, "Scary Movie" was a guilty pleasure. Unfortunately, the second movie, "Scary Movie 2" was an unrelenting disappointment. Whereas in the first installment, I was laughing at almost every joke, gag, and example of gross-out humour; in the second installment, it quickly became tired and worn.The Wayans Family franchise is talented, with brothers: Keenan Ivory, Shawn, Marlon, Damon and sister, Kim. However, their involvement with this latest comedic offering proves that one can indeed go to the well once too often.The scriptwriting attempts to parody all the most popular movies from the "Exorcist" to "Charlie's Angels". The question begs to be asked, "How original is it to make fun of "The Matrix"?" The straightforward answer is "not very" when it is done repeatedly.Keenan Ivory Wayans had the responsibility to bring his interpretation of the script to the screen. Many times, the director of a film can save it from a mediocre script. This time the effort fell miserably short. The timing between scenes lagged and film seemed excruciatingly long. The movie did not flow properly and appeared disjointed. It can be compared to a jigsaw puzzle that is assembled in no particular order.There is a consolation, the Director of Photography, Steven Bernstein, is a respected cinematographer in the film industry, with a best-selling book titled, "Film Production".

		<shortDescription>Tired re-hash of the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie, "Scary Movie" was a guilty pleasure. Unfortunately, the second movie, "Scary Movie 2" was an unrelenting disappointment. Whereas in the first installment, I was laughing at almost every joke, gag, and example of gross-out humour; in the second installment, it quickly became tired and worn.The Wayans Family franchise is talented, with brothers: Keenan Ivory, Shawn, Marlon, Damon and sister, Kim. However, their involvement with this latest comedic offering proves that one can indeed go to the well once too often.The scriptwriting attempts to parody all the most popular movies from the "Exorcist" to "Charlie's Angels". The question begs to be asked, "How original is it to make fun of "The Matrix"?" The straightforward answer is "not very" when it is done repeatedly.Keenan Ivory Wayans had the responsibility to bring his interpretation of the script to the screen. Many times, the director of a film can save it from a mediocre script. This time the effort fell miserably short. The timing between scenes lagged and film seemed excruciatingly long. The movie did not flow properly and appeared disjointed. It can be compared to a jigsaw puzzle that is assembled in no particular order.There is a consolation, the Director of Photography, Steven Bernstein, is a respected cinematographer in the film industry, with a best-selling book titled, "Film Production". At least, the scenes were established correctly and the details were accurate for the shooting of the film.Finally, the ensemble comedic cast is a fine collection of talent. It included the likes of a reptilian-like Tim Curry to an even more slimy James Woods, with his $1,000,000 cameo appearance fee. Sadly, try as hard as they may, the laughs were forced from the audience.

		<fullReview>Okay so some of it's base humor; okay, they use four-letter words A LOT in this film; okay, so the opening scene will make you wish you hadn't spent $7 on soda and popcorn 'cause you can't eat it. Enough visual gags in the beginning of the film and you'll start laughing. The audience was a tough crowd, as usual, when I went to go see it but unlike as usual, I wasn't the only one laughing. It was clear that most of the material was created the same way stand-up comedy routines are, except that instead of all the visual comedy being simulated by someone on stage with a mic and describing it, visual effects, stuntmen and actors were able to portray the ridiculous events. A couple of things didn't work but most of it did. Cindy Campbell and Buddy's characters aren't surprising, knowing who wrote them but Anna Faris and Chris Masterson playing their parts was hysterical because Anna Faris has a very wide range of expressions that are quite striking. And Buddy is basically Francis Wilkerson with some updated lingo. I had a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all you people out there who are complaining about this movie - why did you go see it ? ? ? Just so you could justify the right to complain afterwards? This is one of those few films that basically gives away what the movie is about during the preview (NOTHING!) - and after the over-the-top antics of the first one, you all knew what this was going to be! A sequel trying to push the envelope even more, and that's what it did. Yeah so what, it was full of cheesy gags and bodily functions, but come on, at the end of the day, that kind of thing can make you laugh. It's tasteless, crude, and it's hilarious! Movies like this are never made anymore, so be glad the Wayans brothers have the guts to come along and do it, and do it well. Don't rip this film to shreds, it is what it is - funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the first "Scary Movie", and rather enjoyed it, on a mindless, silly level. But this one makes Benny Hill look like Citizen Kane.One basic rule of a parody is that the audience should have at least a hint as to what is being mocked. Apart from a rather clever (in Wayans' standards) spoof of "The Exorcist" and the oh-so-expected "Crouching Dragon" and "Matrix" parodies there was almost nothing but a grade z collection of body humor, ranging between just tasteless and downright disgusting. Whereas Monty Python used this kind of humor ("The meaning of life", for instance) to make a social statement, here there's no point whatsoever.Too bad this movie is so utterly terrible. In the right hand, with the right directors and writers (the Abrahms brothers, for instance) it could have been much funnier and a lot better. As it is - a waste of time and money (for both sides...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SM 2 is far from being as funny as SM1. The Wayans hit the mark on a few of there skits like the take-offs on Mission Impossible, Charlies Angels and The Excorcist. There are even throw in skits on older horror movies like William Castle's 13 Ghosts. Yet for every home run there's three strikeouts. See this one at the matinee or better yet wait for it to hit the DVD rack. I do however look forward to the next Wayan brother flick. When they hit on all 8(which they don't do very often here) they are fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIG let down from the first one ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically the same concept as the first one, only this one runs REALLY FLAT at times. Using a movie as lame as The Haunting as the basis of this parody is difficult to start with because almost nobody saw that awful movie (or cares to remember it) - plus the last one had many more horror parodies than this one. Too many scenes fall short of the necessary comedic power the first one had. The whole thing with Chris Elliot and the wheelchair guy was lame, and the dinner scene was a complete flop (and pretty stomach churning too). Nice to see Night Court's Bull Shannon back at work, though. RECOMMENDATION: If you can sneak into the theater for the first 10 minutes of the movie (the Exorcist scene w/ James Woods, Andy Richter, Natasha Lyonne &amp; others) do that (you'll nearly wet yourself), then run away as quickly as possible from the rest of the movie. Too obviously a rush job after the success of last summer's Scary Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You basically get what you expect going into this movie, spoofs on other horror flicks (i.e. The Exorcist, The Haunting) and jokes that mainly involve bodily fluids. It doesn't even come close to topping the first one. The first one drew on both specific films and stereotypes of horror flicks, and mixed them together. This movie basically spoofs on specific commercials, t.v. shows, and movies. I felt robbed at the end of this movie though because it is barely over an hour long. I'm wondering why they didn't put more thought into this movie, instead of just punching up a sequel and releasing it quickly. There was really no focus on this movie unlike the original. I'd give it a 4 out of 10, mainly due to length of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But still it was ok. Of course going into a movie like this you should NEVER expect much or else you need help. But the whole vibe of this seemed so out of place and not knowing where to go next. One scene you have a funny scene with Anna Faris or Marlon or Shawn, then we're taken to a scene where a clueless Tori Spelling is in love, then some slut girl(Kathleen Robertson) is just plopped into a scene for no reason. I have to say I was scratching my head a few times as to WHY exactly some scenes were even in the film. The opening sequence was hilarious and Natasha Lyonne has a talent for deadpan comedy. I remember seeing the first one in a packed theater and everyone was rolling out with laughter including me. This time maybe I cracked a smile here and there and then a lil chuckle. But that was about it. Also it wanders off to much into spoofing other genre of movies when we know it's supposed to be spoofing Horror type of films and should stick to that one. Personally I think since the first one was molded after "Scream", then this one should have been molded after "Scream 2". But that's just my opinion. Also Cheri Oteri("Gail Hailstorm") and Dave Sheridan("Doofy") were greatly missed in this one. They should have been it. This movies was to rushed and I think they should have spent more time on it...</fullReview>

I thought the cast was great I did miss the old characters from the first movie though they were the best. Tori Spelling is a great actress but her character had no reason to be the movie and she was horrible at acting. When you see this movie don't expect a great plot because you are not going to get one but go see it because of the jokes they are so funny. Especially the Charlie's Angels scene that was great.

Anyway, the movie starts out really funny for about the first 20 minutes. In fact, it pretty much provokes gut-wrenching laughter. Then it takes a BIG nosedive. I was forcing myself to laugh. The material they have to work with here is promising, but it is very badly executed. The comedy seems forced and unoriginal. It's kind of like watching a series of SNL skits. You just wait and wait for something to be funny and it never happens. There are a few memorable moments in this movie, but I will not spoil them for you. As a big fan of the first one, I just had to see this one. I was disappointed. If you are also a fan of the first one, catch the matinee and go in with low expectations. If you didn't like the first one or have never seen the first one, don't bother with SM2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I was bored last saturday and wanted to see a movie. I was in the mood for a cheap laugh, so I went and saw this one. Whoah, is it bad. It's not as though I were expecting much, and indeed the first fifteen or so minutes were pretty funny, but after that it was one tiresome trip. A few of the actors were good, especially the girl who got knifed to death in the movie theatre in the first one, but somebody in Hollywood needs to tell the Wayans clan that not EVERY member of their family has the talent to be in a film. Painfully obvious. Speaking of acting, Tori Spelling was in this one. Normally I give her more credit than the average moviegoing critic, but she was terrible. She has an outrageous scene that could've been the film's funniest, if she'd displayed any of the comic timing she had in "Trick". Also, the director didn't allow her much, so it's not entirely her fault. I don't normally show compassion for one of Hollywood's privelidged children, but if there was ever an actress who had to PROVE herself worthy, Tori's the one. Keep trying, Tori. I support you. To sum up this movie, potty humor (bowel movements, body abnormalities, maturbation, vomit, kinky sex), not to mention jibes at gays and human deformities (I know someone with a deformed hand, IT'S NOT AMUSING, JUST CRUEL!) does not a funny movie make. I score this one a big fat F.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although some of these other people didn't, I thought Scary Movie 2 was pretty funny. Slightly cleaner than the original, less gory, and genuinely scary in a few places. But I love virtually any spoof film, and although this wasn't exactly excellent, it was still worth my time. The beginning bit with the party guests switching from 60's show tunes to contemporary rap was hilarious, to me anyway.Here's a list of some references I saw or heard of from other people: The Exorcist, Amityville Horror, The Haunting, Scooby Doo ("we've got to lure him to this platform!"), Hollow Man, What Lies Beneath, The Matrix (anyone notice the yawning commentary that Matrix rip-offs are getting boring?), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Charlie's Angels, House on Haunted Hill(?), Ben Hurr, Ghostbusters, and, believe it or not, Face/off. I was probably the only person in the theater to get it, but when pigeons fly across the scene during one of the later fight scenes, it references a scene that occurs in a church in Face/off as Sean Archer and Castor Troy begin one of their many gunfights. I guess that was my purpose for commenting, to share that tidbit.</fullReview>

Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. The movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) I dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers.

The plot was nonsensical and the acting, for most, was sub-par. And after looking at all the factors, one should take a deep breath and say, "Who cares?"I don't! If you stop contemplating the "juvenilism" of the movie for a moment and actually decide to sit down and enjoy a mindless flick-- you'll discover you can actually have a good time.The opening "Exorcist" parody had me in tears. And no, I'm not a slack-jaw yokel who laughs at every fart joke I hear. I enjoy "Scary Movie" for what it's meant to be... a silly, unserious, gross-out movie that was actually good for quite a few laughs.Besides, I love Tim Curry, and I believe my only real disappointment was that there were no "Rocky Horror Picture Show" parodies.

Even though the story and setting was kind of dumb it was still a funny movie.If you like a great laugh see Scary Movie 2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See this movie! I was expecting to laugh, but not as hard as I did! Yes, if you are Siskel or any other film critic, you will hate it because it is strictly a fun movie. If you are looking to relax, kick back, maybe even drink a little, this is the movie to do that to. The Wayans Brothers have been funny since In Living Color and they continue the tradition with this movie. If you enjoy laughing and are like stupid, silly humor, see it in the theater. If you enjoy laughing, rent it when ti comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the sick jokes youre ashamed to laugh at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I do read the other comments before posting, and I wonder exactly what type of film the other reviewers were expecting. I knew it would be stupid, I knew it was a Wayans comedy, so I expected gross jokes, over the top bodily functions, and other gross out things that polite society should not talk about. This movie, while weak on story line was nothing but a laugh riot, it expects the audience to have a wide range of pop culture knowledge in order to recognize the many spoofs and also the ability to appreciate the low brow humor of urination jokes (which I'm ashamed to admit I found both of them quite funny).This was not Shakespear, nor was it meant to be, it is more like sitting around with your buddies and making each other laugh with the grossest and most obscure references you can think of. We have all done it at one time in our lives and it is nice that a movie can cater to that 'I shouldn't be laughing at this' side of our mind, and Scary movie delivers, and delivers, and delivers some more.I was especially pleased and surprised to see the many well established celebrities join in the cast, especially the likes of James Woods, Tim Curry and many others.I found it to be a fun ride that took my mind off the tedium of daily life and left me with a sore side from laughing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Follow Up to a Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed by this movie. I thought that "Scary Movie" although not a great movie was very good and funny. "Scary Movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid.The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great.Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy.Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in "Scary Movie" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. But this time around it was out of place and not funny.The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless, yet Funny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is one of the most pointless, disgusting, and obscene films ever made. It is also pretty damn funny. The film has little plot. What plot it does have is basically a rip-off of "The Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill." From there we encounter our heros. Cindy (Anna Ferris), Ray (Shawn Waynes), Shorty (Marlon Waynes), and Brenda (Regina Hall) all return from Scary Movie. This is quite interesting because Ray and Shorty and Brenda all die in the first one. Go Figure. We encounter some new charecters as well. Christopher Masterson plays Cindys new "buddy". Tori Spelling plays a ditz (duh!) who isn't in the film too much. Tim Curry plays a sleaze ball professer, and Chris Elliot plays a sort of "Igor" type charecter with a demented hand. All in all the film is funny. The story is nothing, but it is funny. I give it a 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having enjoyed the original upon originally seeing it in theaters (It loses something in the translation from theater to video), I, of course, was interested in the sequel. Like I'm sure anyone else would tell you, it's not award winning material, but it's not supposed to be, and anyone who's watching should know that. Personally, I prefer this over recent "award-winners" anyway. The story is, for the most part, a spoof of the recent remakes of "The Haunting", "House On Haunted Hill", and the classic "Poltergeist" and its sequel, however you can pick a haunted house movie made within the last two decades and it's probably in there if it made it to theaters, the beginning featuring a hilarious parody of "The Exorcist" (Ok, maybe not ENTIRELY the last two decades...) and "The Amityville Horror".I thought the movie was, for the most part, hilarious. I also REALLY appreciate that the Wayans bros. actually took the time to research this one a little with a few nods to the past, as well as the present instead of doing what they did with the original, which was focussing entirely on the Scream trend and calling it a "slasher parody" and having absolutely NOTHING involving the true greats which did themselves inspire Scream, like the Nightmare On Elm Street series, the Friday The 13th series, and all of the Halloweens with the exception of the tremendously bad H20. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc. But, I realize these films are put together for a quick laugh and not analysis under a critical eye for centuries to come, so such little annoyances can be quickly dismissed. After all, neither the Scream trilogy or the two I Know What You Did Last Summer films were that bad, mainly just garbage like H20 and Urban Legends...Anyway, enough of my Scream trend bitterness...Chris Elliot is at his all time greatest as Hanson, the butler. The character is based entirely around Julian Beck's "Reverend Kane" persona from "Poltergeist II: The Other Side", but my favorite character was definately Marlon Wayans' reprisal of Shorty, the loveable pot-head. Now that Doofy's gone, Shorty is really the only likeable character, which I also believe is intentional. The others are such repulsive, back-stabbing, consciously cruel sex fiends, you almost applaud their misfortune. Shorty, however, seems oblivious to pretty much everything. You can't really blame him for being an @$$. I miss Doofy...Anyway, Richard Moll played a great goofy villain...again. I think this casting decision was a nod to one of my favorites from 1986, the Steve Miner vehicle, "House". Another favorite, Tim Curry, pops up, as well as James Woods, replacing Marlon Brando due to illness just before shooting began.All in all a very funny picture except for one small thing...what the hell was Tori Spelling doing there? I don't think her character even had a name...or not a spoken name anyway. There are also a few missing characters which we'll hopefully see the return of in the event of a Scary Movie 3; Doofy, and Cindy Cambell's drug-dealing father. Interesting note on Rick Ducommun, who played Cindy's dad. He portrayed the character 'Art' in THE all-time greatest horror spoof, 1989's Joe Dante classic "The 'burbs". I recommend it, as well as Scary Movie 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage - To the fullest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sincerly and genuinely liked and enjoyed the first SCARY MOVIE. Reasons? Because it targeted so-called horror flicks that needed to be spoofed, such as SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER(ugh, what a dumb name). And by doing so, they were successful. However, SCARY MOVIE 2 was mainly targetting THE HAUTING and THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL which didn't set any milestones and weren't that popular. Since I watch every movie and know quite a bit about them, I knew the movies that were being parodied but my friends did not(and I bet most of the audience didn't either). I really didn't like this movie, it was just a jumble of garbage. It's kind of like the Wayans brothers wrote different little stories and somehow put them together. The only scenes I liked were the scences spoofing THE EXORCIST even though they were pointless.Overall, no good garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scary Movie Indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script for "Scary Movie 2" just wasn't ready to go. This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident, to the actors and the audience alike. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many of the actors are funny people; and so the movie isn't completely humorless. To their credit, the film has several funny moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original.The first "Scary Movie" was a laugh a minute film. It turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold. The humor in "Scary Movie 2" is as heavy handed as it is un-original. They even miss obvious opportunities for parody. Two of the movies stars are former cast members of "Beverly Hills 90210," and this was a show that was begging to be parodied! In the final analysis, "Scary Movie 2" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon. The script needed a lot more time to age. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary movie 2. you could do worse? yeah, by that i mean you could drive your car off a cliff. After sitting through and reviewing many bad, bad movies ('Ishtar' comes to mind, 'Castaway' - an hour of snoring in the theater) i thought i had seen the worst. I was wrong. Part of enjoying ANY movie, play, etc is a theatrical phrase "willing suspension of disbelief" - in which you suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and allow yourself to believe that what you are seeing could happen and is real. The only thing REAL about this movie was the statement made by the THIRTY people that got up and walked out only 20 minutes into it (i hadn't seen that in a long time). I would have joined them, but i didn't drive! This movie is dead. bury it already! on the bright side - i was an invited guest so it didn't cost me anything but my time. in retrospect, i should have invested my time more wisely...say trying to dodge semi trucks on the freeway. save your money. play with your kids. ANYTHING is a better use of time than watching this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie was one of the funniest movies I had ever seen in the theater, due to everyone else laughing hysterically, and there were many scenes that couldn't even be heard at all, because of all of the laughing. So of course, I went to see this one with the same expectations, but was let down.Now that's not to say the movie wasn't good. It was tons of fun, and gross-out humor, racial and physical slurs abound...but it wasn't Scary Movie. But that was actually a GOOD thing. It wasn't a parody of satire or self-awareness horror flicks (self awareness, meaning the characters realized scary movies existed). This movie pokes fun at such classics as The Haunting, The Exorcist, House on Haunted Hill. But one of the funniest scenes is when they do a rip on Titanic....If you're looking for the same kind of humor, you're looking in the wrong place. It's not Scream - it's not hip or flashy....it's calmer in it's jokes, just like the classic horror flicks. It's a parody that goes just overboard enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness (81 minutes - including end credits, so roughly 76 minutes of actual film). But what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed.The gags are quick and sometimes not even funny. The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film. Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie's Angels, which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it.Today's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s' Poltergeist, et. al.Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together, making the spoofs more enjoyable.One thing though, the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this movie a "3" out of "10".</fullReview>

However, it didn't have much of a plot, but it was made to be a funny movie. I enjoyed it better than the first one, but you have to see it and see what you think your-selves. I do think that if you liked the first one, you should go see this one. I'm going to say one thing that may be a spoiler, the caretaker, Hanson, has one normal hand and the other is deformed so when he brings out dinner, his messed up hand, is in the potatoes so no one will eat. Then he takes the turkey and touches that all over then he licks it. When the professor (Tim Curry) asks him if there is anything he hasn't made, Hanson says he ordered a pie. He cuts a slice for one of the kids and does nothing to it. Then, 2 people touch it and say, "My Germs". So then, Hanson puts his hand in the rest of the pie and says the same thing.

Oh sure the talking Parrot was retarded with his graphic explictives but they were hilararious. The plot: A college professor sends like 7 stupid teenagers to Hell house, a haunted house. That's it. It was stupid, It was a spoof. Spoofs are supposed to be like that. And sure the Haunting wasn't that great but poltergeist was. Put a good movie and a bad one together and what have you got. Some funny s*** recreating Charlie's Angels. Oh and the biggning was some of the funniest stuff i've seen. James Woods make an appearance and does that thing from the excorsist, shh. i can't give it away.This movie is entended for young-young audiences. And old er audiences should see it only if they can remember what it was like those years. The movie was what i like to call the-man. It wasn't the greatest but the bird was pretty original unless you can remember the movie "Paulie". The wayans brothers have done it again only if you make a 3rd, please put somemore effort into it.

		<shortDescription>Don't Bother With Scary Movie 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TV ads for the movie make it appear as if the flix is just a comic parody of horror movies; but the truth is that this "movie" is just a totally amoral and stunningly disgustingly pornographic spectacle which, if the filmmaker's aim was all along simply to corrupt public morality (intended to create the premise that there is no sexual depravity/perversity which is not perfectly normal and acceptable) could not be much improved on. I think even "scarier" than the movie was the audience in the theater in which I saw the "film" (it incl. MANY children as young as 8 and 11... no doubt brought there by the misleading TV ads). But be warned that in one scene a teenage girl rejoices that her very violent rape was "the best sex she's had!" And in the Exorcist parody scene, when the possessed young girl screams out, "F-me! F-me!" the "priest" does precisely that. The language is even more pornographically violent still; and unrelentingly so throughout the whole movie. Artistically, there is no humor here at all--only the sort of nauseating and repulsive visuals (a jock with his penis pinched inside his tights asking whether it looks better "in" or "out")... visuals which people who are unexpectedly subjected to them usually try to cope with either by nervous coughing or with a right-down hysterical over-reaction (the adults in the audience "laughed" a lot louder than the "jokes" merited it, while the children sat in absolute stone-cold silence throughout... very probably forming the same sort of state of mind child molesters aim for when they expose them to hard porn in order to corrupt them into the perverted notion that these sickening forms of behavior are perfectly acceptable). The children in that theater knew what the adults apparently didn't want to acknowledge: Namely, that this was NOT a funny film, just a series of sexually deviant and morally bankrupt visual-verbal degradations specifically designed to shock even those persons who once imagined there were few things left that could shock them. It does that; that's all it does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did you bother to see it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the first one was really bad. It had funny parts, but was so all over the map and gross, I would never watch it again. With that understanding, I WON'T SEE THIS ONE!Duh!All these people saying: I thought the first one was bad, but man, this is worse...Why in GOD'S name did you bother to go see it, and on opening night yet! It never ceases to amaze me the shear number of people who will see a bad movie knowing going in it will suck, and then complain about it.Spend your money on something else. By seeing this movie, YOU make Hollywood make them. I work there. I know.You vote with your dollars, not your opinions. Studios don't care what you think, they just care if you pay. So, if the movie is bad, in the middle, ASK FOR YOUR MONEY BACK. Many theaters will actually refund the money, or at least exchange your ticket for another movie.I have done this twice. The Mod Squad was so boring I asked for my money back. They agreed and gave it to me! Another film I can't even recall was so bad, I asked to exchange my ticket for a film that was just about to start. I didn't just theater hop, because then the wrong movie gets credit. I asked them to void my ticket and give me a new one for the new movie. They did it, gladly.Why would they do this you ask? How much a theater pays to show the movie is determined AFTER the movie has been showing for a few weeks. Sounds strange, I know, but theaters pay the bigger bucks only when they earn the bigger bucks. If you ask for a refund, this gives them ammo against the studios, and the studios listen!But if you just complain here, well, the studios don't really care. Word of mouth is not expected on these movies. It's a big first weekend, a mediocre second weekend, one good foreign weekend, and then to video. The only affect you can have is NOT GIVING THEM THE GOOD OPENING.Only you can prevent Scary Movie 3, because, they are already in pre-production, and if this movie makes any money at all, SM3 will be out in a year. That's a fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great parody movie! Although Ray and Brenda somehow return from the dead to appear in the movie it was really great! I loved the opening sequence..Priceless! There were times where I found myself sitting there waiting for something to happen. Mainly when Tori Spelling was trying to act I found myself looking around. Other than a bad casting move with Tori the movie rocks. Go see it and don't start on your popcorn until the first sequence is over. -PR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great. I must say that it wasn't the greatest but if people can't tell the humor you must be watching Gone with the Wind and Mary Poppins just a few too many times (good thing i've never seen either of them). Oh sure the talking Parrot was retarded with his graphic explictives but they were hilararious. The plot: A college professor sends like 7 stupid teenagers to Hell house, a haunted house. That's it. It was stupid, It was a spoof. Spoofs are supposed to be like that. And sure the Haunting wasn't that great but poltergeist was. Put a good movie and a bad one together and what have you got. Some funny s*** recreating Charlie's Angels. Oh and the biggning was some of the funniest stuff i've seen. James Woods make an appearance and does that thing from the excorsist, shh. i can't give it away.This movie is entended for young-young audiences. And old er audiences should see it only if they can remember what it was like those years. The movie was what i like to call the-man. It wasn't the greatest but the bird was pretty original unless you can remember the movie "Paulie". The wayans brothers have done it again only if you make a 3rd, please put somemore effort into it. You know Shorty in space or something. Pitch Black or Star Wars or something really sci-fi horror. . Keep it up guys.7 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

People who have paid attention to my warning will most likely love this hilarious, raunchy comedy, which pushes the boundaries of the "R" rating again! The Wayans Brothers do more of the same from the first one, except they seem to make fun of much more that just scary movies, ripping on "Charlie's Angels" and "The Green Mile". People who are looking for solid plot and great suspense should go somewhere else, but those looking for side-splitting, gross out gags, are in the right theater! ***\**** three stars out of four</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONCE AGAIN IT'S ON!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started waiting for "Scary Movie 2"'s release ever since I heard about it last year. And now it's finally here. And I'll tell you that it was funnier and raunchier than the first one. It had more laughs, better gags, better acting (not trying to say the acting was bad in the first one), and better plot. This time Cindy, Shorty, Brenda, and others are now in college and go for a weekend field trip at a possed haunted house set up by a crooked professor and his assitant and the laughs take off from there. Actually, the laughs take off from the very beginning. And there's some known gag territory from the first one but it's all worth your five or seven dollars. I'm telling you this one of the most funniest movies of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard there was going to be a sequel to Scary Movie I was excited. The first one was hilarious. I like the Wayans brothers, and I think they are pretty damn funny. Theres just one problem: When the Wayans are good...they're really good, but when they're bad...they really suck...HARD. A good example of that is when Shawn and Marlon hosted the MTV Video Music Awards..they stunk it up. Scary Movie 2 starts out ok. The parody of "The Exorcist" is done well, but it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. The big problem with this movie is that the unfunny scenes drag on WAY too long. Marlon's character is really annoying and not funny at all. That cursing parrot is extremely stupid and gets old very quick. The scenes don't flow together well either. It looks like they wrote the script in 3 days. I did laugh pretty hard at some parts, but most of the scenes were painful to watch and I felt bad for them. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but they made it impossible. What happend here Marlon, Shawn, and Keenan? Didn't you take the time to watch this thing before you put it out there? The casting was also a huge mistake. Chris Elliot is a funny guy (sometimes), but he sucks in this film. Don't even get me started on Tori Spelling, I'd rather watch my dog lick himself then watch her. Another big problem is that none of the characters die! Thats what made the first one so good...the parts where they got killed were hilarious. This was a huge disappointment. What is going on with comedies these days? The past couple years have delivered some of the biggest let-downs ever. Such as "Little Nicky", "Joe Dirt", "Freddy Got Fingered", and now "Scary Movie 2". Please Hollywood!...For the love of God! Take your time while making these movies, and make sure they are atleast funny before they are released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired, worthless "comedy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This original film was 88 minutes of the grossest, nastiest toilet humor with enough on-screen gags to warrant an NC-17 rating. And yet, it was an enjoyable film for the same reason that South Park: Bigger Loner, and Uncut is an enjoyable film- they are both so shockingly vulgar and shamelessly stupid that they become something greater than toilet humor. However, the thing about shocking people is you can't shock them with the same things twice. The creators of South Park knew enough not to make a sequel. After just seeing Scary Movie 2, I wish the Wayans's Brothers would take a cue from them.The movie does not make any attempt to be original; it does not make any attempt to shock us; in fact, we wonder if any effort as put into this at all. I can clearly see the writers, pressed for time and ideas, piecing together a script out of the worst moments of Scary Movie 2.The original spoofed the tired and worn slasher film formula- particularly Scream. This one spoofs the equally tired ad worn formula of haunted houses. There are some smart pokes at Mission Impossible 2 and Charley's Angels; Chris Elliot and James Woods have funny cameos as a caretaker and an exorcist, respectively; and the film's most brilliant gag: a foul-mouthed parrot are the few examples of Scary Movie 2's originality. Most of the film repeats the same jokes from the original, or includes new ones that make the audience groan when they should laugh.The jokes are painfully unfunny and dangerously overplayed. And the movie as a familiar feeling- like we've seen the exact same movie before. Without its shock value, this is mere toilet humor*1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

From the opening scene, I was laughing through the entire movie. The returning actors did a tremendous job in reprising their original roles; the new characters were also fabulous. Spoofing movies such as Mission: Impossible 2, The Exorcist, Hollow Man, The Haunting, Hannibal, What Lies Beneath and Charlies Angels made the movie that much more funny. Some people may not like its gross-out humor, some people may say that it was a waste of time to go, but I'll tell you one thing...The Wayens Brothers are gonna be laughing all the way to the bank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXTRA, EXTRA!! Sequel outdoes predecessor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a great lifetime, a sequel to the hugely successful film knows all the great punchlines to target and relishes them till no more. "Scary Movie 2" is such a case. The original, released July 7, 2000, was a surprise and made $40 million opening weekend. While it spoofed the teenage slasher genre quite diligently, I felt the lowbrow levels of humor went wayward and failed. To my avail, "Scary Movie 2" was nearly bathed in lowbrow from head to toe, but the experience this time was more enthralling. In closing, if in the case you cannot ingest the film after the first ten minutes, then leave the theater and ask for a refund. Still, I must contend that you endure the pre-title "Exorcist" spoof sequence. Why? Two words: James Woods. He was always on fire, just as the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 was by far just as funny as the first. Most sequels never live up to their predecessors. However, a parody such as this one exceeded all expectations I had. It definitely kept me laughing. This film not only poked fun at horror flicks (new and old) but also other comedy and action flicks from the recent years-much like the first did. The kids this time (minus Shannon Elizabeth, Lochlyn Munro, and Jon Abrahams characters) gather with some new friends and are tricked by their professor into spending the night in a haunted house (sounds like The Haunting, right?). This scenario in itself is destined to be humorous. Don't try to look for meaning in the opening Exorcist parody scene. There isn't any. It's just there mainly there for added comedy. If you are looking for a good, rolling on the floor laugh, Scary Movie 2 is the summer movie to see.</fullReview>

A parody of a parody, littered with parody that Scary Movie 1 was made the movie cumbersome and boring. SM1 tried to have a backbone, but the backbone crippled the movieLess really is more with this movie. The storyline has no backbone, nor does it try, which puts the focus on the gags. You're not going to get Schindler's List-like depth from this movie. This is a fun movie, and a really fun one at that.The problem with tamer gags is that people will expect more from the sequel.

Scary Movie was such a good movie for my age group (even though people think it's stupid), why couldn't they just leave it alone. This time, they spoof the sci-fi-horror movies that have been coming out recently (i.e. Hollowman, The Haunting), very old movies (i.e. The Exorcist, Amityville) and some movies that just shouldn't be in there (Save the Last Dance). Another thing is that half the cast that's in the movie died in the first movie, and the other half consists of Tori Spelling, not a good combo. The only good newcomers, in my opinion were Theo and Buddy. And the whole Charlie's Angels spoof was perfect, but the movie really could have used some more work before it was rushed into theaters.

		<shortDescription>Rushed filmmaking drops the ball....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 was made in less than a year. The filmmakers, when they realized that they had a hit on their hands with Scary Movie, started on the sequel. Obviously under studio pressure to deliver a summer movie, they finished with no time to spare. Editing was finished just under two weeks ago, getting the film to theatres on time. One year from script to cineplex; sadly the rush to finish shows. What could have been a cinematic masterpiece of bad taste, instead is a marginally funny, yet sloppy piece of filmmaking.Don't get me wrong - the movie has its moments. Not wanting to give too much away, James Woods as a priest, a spoof of the Nike basketball dribbling commercial and an appearance from the infamous "mangina" are segments that had me rolling in the aisles. However, the movie was not consistently funny, and with a thin storyline, 10 minutes without a laugh can feel like an eternity.The story in Scary Movie 2 is not as coherent as it was in the original. Many times it's not clear what the movie is trying to spoof, and the audience often ends up with seemingly unmotivated wackiness.The movie is short (less than 85 minutes by my estimates) and the pacing suffers. Instead of following the time tested "set 'em up and knock 'em down" formula of comedy, the set-up often seems to be ignored or cut out. As a result, the pacing suffers; when the jokes come too quickly, all in sequence, they become harder to digest and lose their shock value. In addition, the shameless rehashing of several jokes from the first film lends a cheapened feel to the production.The budget for this movie was twice that of the original. Give this fact, the production value is inexplicably shoddy. I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane in terms of technical skill, but the editing and special effects were so poorly done that it was distracting. Several action scenes that could have been comedic goldmines were filled with jump cuts and other editing errors that made the scenes incoherent. And we barely get a glimpse of the main ghost (Richard Moll! It's Bull from Night Court!) as if the filmmakers were embarrassed at how bad he looked.Bottom line: If you loved the first one like I did, you'll probably like the second one. You'll be a little disappointed, but admittedly, it would have been hard to top Scary Movie, which I still think is one of the best spoofs I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is completely different than the first film. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, but am willing to admit that the first one did have some funny jokes or sight gags. My biggest problem with the first one, overall was the lack of any real plot and the jokes that fell flat, which could have very well made up for the choppy plot. The second film has a _lot_ of flat jokes, although I will admit some of them were pretty funny, the crudeness has come down to an modified on steroids version of "Home Alone" - some of the films they make fun of aren't really too clear and stray too far from the orginals to really be parodies of them- The Mummy parody was unclear with a skeleton chasing them around? And the Sabrina The Teenage Witch parody was also unclear, with the cat fight and the "Rocky" ending? It was like a giant saturday night live episode- some funny, some not. But people will love this movie anyway, I saw it in a theatre filled with people laughing so loud, I may have to see the movie again, if for the sole purpose to really hear all of the jokes, or what the hell is going on. Just an added note- the script was pretty awful, but most of the perfomances were really pretty good, like Chris Elliots - even if the script seemed like it was written by a bunch of guys sitting down with a case of beer and Attention Deficit Disorder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, just not very funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this review by saying that I LOVE scary movies, and bad horror is an artform all it's own. Watching a bad horror film can be rewarding, but Scary Movie 2 is not a horror film, it's a comedy, and bad comedy is not an artform. There aren't too many websites dedicated to unfunny comedies, as there are for bad/silly/cheesy/campy horror flicks. I did not hate SM2, it was a fine date movie, but as with the prequel the "satire" breaks down into an endless stream of toilet jokes. Toilet jokes can be funny, as they occasionally are here, but to rely almost solely on them in a film that presents itself as a SATIRE is wrong. I have the same gripes with SM2 as I did with the first one. Not enough genuinly smart jokes. Most are just gross-out style. With so much to parody in the realm of horror it's sad to see the comedy ball dropped so often. An over reliance on swearing and bodily fluids really detract from the actual satire. At least this one went away from the "Scream" style movies that it rheemed in the SM1. This one is more like The Haunting, with a little Excorcist and What Lies Beneath thrown in. I have to say this much, Cindy had me hypnotised, she's so beautifull I just wanted the movie to focus solely on her and never leave. Chris Elliot is also quite funny as the grotesque and gimpy caretaker, he steals most of his scenes. The clown under the bed scared my girlfriend, so it scores points for that. Tim Curry is fat; Tori Spelling is ugly; Cindy is hypnotic; the chick with the leather pants and visable thong should do Playboy; Chris Elliot rules; Drug/Penis jokes get old fast; that's what Andy Richter's been doing? James Woods has no shame. TWO and 1/2 STARS out of four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 was by far just as funny as the first. Most sequels never live up to their predecessors. However, a parody such as this one exceeded all expectations I had. It definitely kept me laughing. This film not only poked fun at horror flicks (new and old) but also other comedy and action flicks from the recent years-much like the first did. The kids this time (minus Shannon Elizabeth, Lochlyn Munro, and Jon Abrahams characters) gather with some new friends and are tricked by their professor into spending the night in a haunted house (sounds like The Haunting, right?). This scenario in itself is destined to be humorous. Don't try to look for meaning in the opening Exorcist parody scene. There isn't any. It's just there mainly there for added comedy. If you are looking for a good, rolling on the floor laugh, Scary Movie 2 is the summer movie to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the film after it hit theaters on July 4th. No fireworks for this film, and not much reason to celebrate, either. While the first one was a surprise hit, the only hit this one is going to make is a loud noise as it strikes bottom.There are numerous bodily function jokes, that get quite graphic, and when you're trying to munch on popcorn and candy while sucking down some drink, it's not very pleasant to watch. Thankfully the thought of the eight dollars I spent on candy, drink, and popcorn was stronger than my stomach. Why the Wayans felt they had to go to such extremes, I don't know.It's like the film is trying to top the last one, but sacrificing anything appealing to viewers. Sure, there are some funny moments in this film---the talking bird made the whole theater (all thirty people) laugh out loud, and Chris Elliot tries a little too hard, but he does have his moments. Everything else that goes to extremes, from the jokes on excrement and urination to making fun of the handicapped, just doesn't seem to hold its own.I'm almost sorry I went to see this film---I should have been smarter and gone to see "Cats And Dogs." If I'd known what was in this film, I wouldn't have chosen to see it. However, if you can sit through about an hour of cheap laughs, physical humor (LOTS of it), and jokes about bodily functions, the handicapped, and stereotypes, then you're welcome to do so. If you really want to spend a few hours watching something like this, though, my reccomendation to you would be to stay home and rent the first one. It's just as disturbing as this one, but at least it has style. This film does not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of playing off of the teen horror flicks, the Wayans brothers decided to base it on older horror/thriller movies, such as "Psycho," "The Exorcist," and "Poltergeist," while throwing in things from movies like "Charlie's Angels" and "Mission Impossible 2." Complete it by tying everything together with the Wayans Brand toilet humor (some of it recycled from "Scary Movie" and even "Don't be a Menace in South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood," some of it new), and you have Scary Movie 2.After the initial sequence, with James Woods and Andy Richter as the Priest and his Assistant, trying to exorcise Natasha Lyonne's character (the possessed Jasonia Voorhees), the movie seems to get lost for about a half hour. All of the sudden it gets good again, when the action starts up (complete with the toilet humor).The only thing I am curious about is why we heard about Marlon Brando being in the sequel. But surprisingly, he is nowhere to be found.I think this movie was rushed into the theatres, and if it wasn't, the movie might have lived up to its predecessor, as they would have had more time to hash out plot points that really didn't work in it. But, I was still laughing my head off, especially in the beginning and as the movie started to get good again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is exactly like the original except that it isn't as funny. The reason for this is that all of the same jokes are used here and aren't even done differently. The first thirty minutes are funny, but then you just get the same old jokes over and over again. Of course there are a lot more black and white jokes in the sequel and they are funny for a little bit. The black and white jokes, however, are very over used and eventually become offensive. The only other type of joke you find in this movie is a fart joke. None of them are remotely funny. No jokes in this movie are new. They have all been used many times before. The beginning part with James Woods is really funny and would have been even better had Marlon Brando been able to fill the role. I laughed almost never during this horribly thought up "comedy".</fullReview>

It is funnier. It is all around better. Chris Elliot does a great job. And even Robert Schimmel makes a cameo..if you know who he is. And they did a very good job spoofing the movies, they did in the first one also, just in a better way in this one. They spoof everything from "Dude, Where's My Car?" to the Nike basketball TV commericial. If you are for the nasty, sick, humor..you will love it..if you are a teen..you will love it.

		<fullReview>The most glaring problem with Scary Movie 2 is that it attempts to satire material so awful as not to warrant discussion, let alone mockery. However, the cinematography in the Exorcist scenes is quite good, and there are several hilarious moments. Close attention to the story line isn't the most important thing for this type of film, but this time it's completely ignored so often as to make the film incoherent. Another major problem is that they try to reference every commercial and recent mediocre film they can think of. Be more selective, guys, as in the first one.The first movie was much funnier than this one, but there are a few moments here. However, many of the jokes are disgusting without the context to make them humorous, and others are just plain bizarre. Perhaps the most appropriate thing to do is to appropriate Roger Ebert's response to Freddy Got Fingered. The film may someday be seen as a masterpiece of surrealism. Nonetheless, it is not a very funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that they were making a "Scary Movie 2", I went and double checked my "Scary Movie" DVD case... yup. Right on the case. "No Mercy, No Shame, No Sequel." But it's amazing what a good run at the box office can do, huh? I thought to myself, "They can't make a 'Scary Movie 2', there is nothing left to spoof!" But I have been proven wrong. "Scary Movie 2" leaves nothing out. They spoof everything from "The Haunting" (which has been begging for a spoof...) to "The Exorcist" to "Hollow Man". I was even more amazed to find that "Scary Movie 2" kept the same level of humor as it's predecessor. The only difference is, the plot is worse. MUCH worse. But, if you are spending $7.00 and expecting a plot from this movie in the first place, then you are in need of some serious help. The target audience for this movie is not interested in a plot, rather, how many boob shots Tori Spelling has and how many sexual innuendos can be squeezed into an hour and a half movie. I should know... I'm one of them! And with such actors appearing as James Woods, Chris Elliott, and, of course, the great Tim Curry, this movie cannot possibly flop. No matter how bad the plot. All-in-all, "Scary Movie 2" has the same level of disgusting humor as the first one. It is worth seeing... just make sure you are with a group of good friends and have lots of sugar before the show!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not as fun or as good as the first film, but while it is a very uneven film I do not think it is the worst of the series. That's the fourth. The film's weakness are mostly to do with the story and the pace. The story is very weak and thin a vast majority of the time, and the film feels rushed sometimes. While most of the references/spoofs are fun, some don't work, especially the forced and messy Titanic one. And there is some uneven performances, Marlon Wayans, David Cross and especially Chris Elliot come off best, but Anna Faris while better than she was in the first overdoes it and while Tim Curry was a welcome presence he doesn't have anything worthwhile to work with. However, the film thankfully doesn't look sloppy or straight to video quality and the music was quite good as well. Of course the film is silly and mindless, but most of it is very funny, the dinner scene with the running joke about the hand, the talking parrot and the Charlie's Angels spoof work especially well, and a lot of the script if bizarre and silly is hilarious. The highlight though is the Excorcist-beginning, with a very amusing cameo from James Woods. That scene alone made me think it would be a good movie, but while the rest of the film wasn't quite as good, it is entertaining enough and not as bad as some say. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Collage of Horror Bits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lengthy introductory skit -- as in "Twilight Zone: The Movie" -- that's a rip off of "The Exorcist." It's pretty funny, with bit parts for James Woods and Veronica Cartwright. The priest is playing the piano at the party when "Regan" appears in the doorway, declaims "You suck," and pees all over the floor. She pees and pees, while the guests look uncomfortable. Finally, Mom rushes to Regans side and explains, "She's been sick." Then she slams Regans face down into the puddle of urine and begins to beat the back of her head.That was pretty funny because until that point you didn't know which direction the movie was headed in. But the introductory section ends in showers of vomit involving the two priests and Regan. Except for its residual shock value, it's about as funny as a pie fight.The rest of the movie, after the credits, is mainly a take off of "The Haunting," a fine film in its original form, directed by Robert Wise, and no more than a special effects extravaganza in the remake. Let's see. There is a lascivious poltergeist who is evidently a male and who chases a young girl across the ceiling after forcing her to have oral sex with an invisible penis. Which teen-age horror movie is that from? The ones with Freddy Kruger? I get them mixed up.Some of the bits are more revolting than funny -- a butler with a hideously deformed hand who manages to stick the grotesque thing into every dish he serves at dinner. A scene with James Woods on the crapper.Most of the gags are physical and except for the supposedly outrageous use of curses and swear words it might have been a silent movie. Not that it avoids ALL possible verbal wit. James Woods is the Max Von Sydow character from "The Exorcist" and when he first enters the house, he asks how Regan is. Veronica Cartwright, as the mother, breaks into sobs and says, "Father -- she won't even let me touch her." Woods nods knowingly and replies, "Yes, sometimes you have to give them candy." It's nothing you wouldn't hear on a late-night talk show, but a little more of that would have been nice.I've concentrated on the first half hour or so because I didn't watch the entire film. The level of comedy or, more important, the KIND of jokes, became predictable and a little stale. Although you could never be sure. One scene is ripped off from "Raging Bull." I'm not sure the younger audience would get that one, but I'm even more certain that there were many allusions that I missed too.It was outrageous, yes, and some of the jokes were better than others, but I had no trouble shutting it off. It's the kind of thing best left to the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, But the Weakest in the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie was hysterically funny, the fact remains that it was the weakest in the entire series. Brenda has all of the best scenes, and some of Anna Farris's comedic genius shines through, but a series of unfunny sequences and several other bland moments make the movie seem rushed. It does have its moments though, and the deleted scenes and alternate endings are some of the best that the series has to offer. If only there was more to offer in terms of a really storyline, this would be much better. Still, it remains better than most parody films, many of which fall extremely flat. The original ending may be unsatisfying, and many of the characters are clichéd and open-ended. Nobody has a real personality, and it seems to be spoofing one movie after another. Which brings us to the only real major problem: there is too much going on. The movie gets consumed in all of the material it is trying to spoof, and becomes sucked up in the stupidity of it all. Still, the acting is superb and many scenes really shine through. The rare scenes that have actual character development are actually written quite well, and pretty much anything involving the 'handyman' was excellent. Tim Curry's presence was truly a gift. Overall, the movie is worth several watches and it is a very good spoof film, but it is not without its share of flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a while I had believed the familiar doctrine that each Scary Movie was better than the one before it. However, that obviously got destroyed by Scary Movie 4. But that's the greatness of Scary Movie 2, is it's still in the hold of the Wayans brothers. Not a minute is wasted, and its a mostly hit, sometimes miss constant barrage of comedic twists. Scary Movie 1 is greatly overshadowed by this wooly mammoth, and Scary Movie 3 is funny but much different and in no way really related. With extra room and creativeness, it's a worthy movie. Just don't expect it to be Shakespeare, because you'll end up hating it along with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honnestly, I don't get how people could like this movie. So you make a parody, okay. That's cool, that's even fun. People buy it, people like it and you earn money.But you don't write a sequel to a parody! This whole idea is wrong on its own, but then they just had to add lame jokes about sex and other vulgarities. You can be funny without that! By example, the Charlie's Angels parody was good. If you saw the real movie afterward, you truly realized how ridiculous it was. But all the other humor was just way over the line. Those are jokes ten year old kids giggle at. By the looks of it, it was some guy with the brains of a ten year old who wrote the script... So, I beg you, next time, think twice before you write a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scary movie directors just lost their touch. The punchlines and jokes in this movie were not funny more than half the time. Why did they even bother to spoof the movies they did spoof, they should have picked better movies to spoof cause the ones they spoofed did not have that much stuff to make fun of. Most of the humour in this movie was ridiculous, like every 5 minutes someone farted or something stupid like that. I still thought that some of the parts of this movie were funny but not all. Overall, this movie was pretty bad/okay and even if it was funny it was not laugh out loud funny, it was more like he - he - he that's kind of funny. I don't recommend watching it cause then you would not be interested in the other scary movies which were good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lame, unfunny, unnecessary sequel that was rushed into production just to capitalize on the original when it because a surprise sleeper hit. Cindy, Ray, Shoty &amp; Brenda are back this time they all find themselves being tricked into going to a haunted mansion.Where as the first film was actually watchable and pretty funny, this one is neither. And at less then an hour and a half, it's still of battle of willpower to sit through. Tottally rancid on just about every level, waisting the combined talents of the usually reliable David Cross, Chris Elliot, Tim Curry, Andy Richter, and James Woods (the last is the only slightly amusing aspect of this waste of film). Unwatchable.My Grade: D- DVD Extras: 22 Deleted and Alternate scenes (43 and a half minutes); Behind the scenes featurette; featurettes in special effects, makeup, scary effects, &amp; Killer cat; A Dimension compilation trailer; and Trailers for Gangs Of New York, 40 Days And 40 Nights, Scary Movie, Scream Trilogy, Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood, &amp; Senseless DVD-ROM Features: Screenplay Viewer, Character profiles; and online trivia game</fullReview>

Then when Cindy is singing along to the radio listening to Vitamin C, Cindy singing very badly is told by the radio to "Shut the %@*# up!" I also enjoy the part when the red headed girl is chasing the ghost saying "Why won't you talk to me!!?" ghost replies, "Because you gave me crabs!"

		<fullReview>OK, the Exorcist send up in the first 10 minutes was amusing. It also made me think that maybe the reviews about this movie were wrong. The oldies dancing to "shake your ass, watch yourself" was fun to watch, as was Natasha Lyonne's deadpan response to their antics. James Woods is always entertaining to watch in any genre and his performance here didn't disappoint.But what the hell happened after that? Director Keenen Ivory Wayans sense of whats funny from the 1st film seemed to elude him here. The jokes just fell flat and flat after that, the acting was terrible and often stupefying to watch. The rest of the film just felt like a waste of time. And that f****** parrot was really annoying!Scary movie 1 and 3 were both enjoyable, and no. 4 does look promising, but I recommend skipping this one in the series, you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

The 'movie parody' parts are hardly parodies at all, and the scenes outside of this are weak, weak, weak on comedy.The very first movie parody is of The Exorcist and I'd love the writers to explain to me how they have expanded the original to make it funny.Whereas movies like Airplane or Naked Gun used killer humour, this goes for a simple 'pie in the face' or 'fart' scenes, some of which are unintelligible to anyone outside of American sub culture.The Wayan brothers certainly have a charmed life in Hollywood.'Airplane' started all of this - but at least that was funny, witty and had some sort of plot.</fullReview>

When I saw the first I was 15 and like most low to mid teen males I found it funny although looking back it really was a stupid waste of time. This sequel, however, is absolute tosh. The production values are unbelievably atrocious and not in a funny or camp way. Everything looks as though it was strapped together with duct-tape. The jokes are not funny in the slightest. The spoofs are unjustified and every single gag is just plain gross, opting for the lowest common denominator every time. Toilet humour is the name of the game and toilet humour is practically all you are going to get. I actually felt sorry for the actors in this film as I can not imagine how degrading and career destroying it must have been to appear on such unbridled trash. It is a sad tragedy that such films can make it to cinemas. Do not see this film, it physically hurts your eyes and brain to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly lousy offering ostensibly of the movie-genre-satire style. The Wayans brothers prove once again they lack the talent of greats like Mel Brooks (Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles) and the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team (Naked Gun, Airplane). These classics were funny. This pathetic wanna-be imitator is not.Speaking of airplanes, if they ran this rubbish on one, people would probably walk out on it, even at 25,000 feet."Teens-in-peril" horror movies are like sitting ducks in a shooting gallery waiting for somebody to insert a quarter, pick up the rifle, and blast them at will. There are so many corny, absurd, overworked clichés in these types of movies, a writer with any sense of humor at all should have a field day lampooning them; yet this is the result: an hour and change of meandering, mindless, humorless dreck, appearing to be no more than skits strung together in random order. None of them evoke a single laugh. It takes more than reenacting a scene from a movie, adding a few swear words and tossing in some toilet jokes to be funny. This dog is not worth your time or money. You would be better off watching a late-night infomercial than this rubbish.</fullReview>

But in a limited sense, it does seem to have a plot to it.The gags range from funny or funny/sick to pointless/impotent, most of them in the middle of those ranges, and leaning towards the pointless/impotent side.Only good as a goofy rental, it still is better than the first one.Give Scary Movie 2, 3.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Gone so far past not funny that it overshot so bad it's funny and instead emerged in the murky and not oft explored world of absolute, unmitigated, unwatchable tripe. Run for your Lives! I was once involved in a minor car accident. It was much more fun than Scary Movie II. Please don't watch this. This plot is non-existent, not really a problem for a well scripted entertaining comedy, but this isn't one. From beginning to thankless end this monstrosity does not contain a single even mildly amusing moment. I laughed more in Brief Encounter. The acting is so bad it hurts, the script was written by diabetic gibbons with Tourettes and the general tone of this crime against humanity is so painfully patronising i was forced to jump up and down on my DVD until it was rendered conclusively unwatchable, avoiding any possible future chance that i might one day trip on a children's toy and accidentally drop the DVD into the player again, forcing me, God forbid, to sit before some of its cringeingly, achingly dull content again. Do anything to avoid ever seeing this abhorration. Take any necessary steps. Murder? Worth it. The only aspect of this movie that has any merit whatsoever is the title, which is fittingly apt. As the epithet suggests, this is indeed a Scary Movie, terrifyingly, spine-chillingly bad. Don't Do It.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWFUL, but a few more laughs than the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an opening Exorcist parody (a film that already received a feature-length comic parody; Repossessed), this immediate sequel sinks right back down to the sheer stupidity of the first one. Lured to a secluded mansion for a sleep study, college students Shorty, Cindy, Ray and Brenda (from the first film), plus some others, find themselves trapped inside with evil spirits. It's all an excuse for unimaginative, low brow "comedy" involving semen, vomit, crap and other bodily functions, sex organs, inflated tits, rape, homosexuals, drug addiction and the handicapped. There are (pretty lame) references to The Amityville Horror, House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Poltergeist and The Entity and some surprising ones to Poe's House of Usher and The Black Cat, plus non-horror gags (Rocky, Charlie's Angels, Dude, Where's My Car? etc.) to pad out the running time. Jokes are made about the Clinton/Lewinski scandal, the missing Florida ballots and Firestone tires (things that will instantly date it), plus a marijuana monster and the fighting cat bit is pretty cute. This has a few more laughs than the first film thanks almost entirely to Chris Elliott's inspired comic lunacy as a weird, perverted caretaker with a deformed hand. It took seven people to script this thing. Marlon Brando supposedly turned down 2 million dollars to cameo as a priest and was replaced by James Woods. There's no point to any of this, but as the end rap theme reminds us, "Must be the money."</fullReview>

The Wayans brothers now prove that they have NO feeling whatsoever for what is funny and what is NOT funny.Four teens are here tricked into going to a haunted house by their teacher. This of course to spoof the horror-movie "The Haunted", which fails miserably. What i don't understand is HOW they could fail to spoof "The Haunting" which is a movie that offers ample opportunities for spoofing. But somehow they succeed. And basically all other attempts to make fun of movies, TV-commercials, music-videos etc. fail just as much.But this movie does have ONE redeeming feature. And that is that the only scene in the movie even remotely funny is right in the beginning, even before the credits! Because the spoof of "The Exorcist" featuring James Woods at least offers a small laugh. And when that's over, you can just turn the TV off and save yourself 80(!) minutes of your life you could never ever get back. I rate this 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more vulgar than funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie 2" may well be one of the crudest, raunchiest and most vulgar comedies ever aimed at an essentially mainstream audience. This sequel to the original box office smash has a great deal of energy but little else to recommend it. The first film, though hardly a model of tasteful restraint, at least managed to be clever and witty from time to time. This version is a farrago of dirty jokes revolving around disgusting bodily functions and perverse sexuality - neither of which I have a particular problem with, but the least we could demand from such an assault is that the jokes themselves be funny. Unfortunately, most of the humor is executed in such a strained, over-the-top style that all the effort is visible right up there on the screen - the death knell for any truly effective comedy. At its narrative core, the film is a parody of all those "Haunting"-type movies in which some carefully selected people are gathered together in a haunted house by a sinister doctor intent on conducting some diabolical experiment. Along the way, the filmmakers poke fun at "What Lies Beneath," "Invisible Man," "The Exorcist," "Poltergeist," "Charlie's Angels" and an assortment of other well-known flicks. The fact that "Scary Movie 2" is aimed at a young teen audience should certainly give the parents of America pause. Although this film probably doesn't visualize anything most of these youngsters haven't articulated amongst themselves already, discriminating parents should at least be aware of the graphic nature of most of the material (if they have to pare this down for network television any time soon, there will be five minutes left of the movie). Almost inevitably - as is the case with most of these scattershot-type comedies - "Scary Movie 2" manages to elicit a few genuine laughs with its antics - just not enough to make the film really worth recommending.</fullReview>

I'm not saying this movie is bad, but the original is much better. Besides "The Exorcist" scene, other funny scenes are when Shorty(Marlon Wayans) is "drugged" by Hansen(former SNL comedian Chris Elliot), then Hansen cuts open part of Shorty's head and finds the guy from 'The Howard Stern Show' in there, a sign that Shorty is on drugs. Then there is the "Charlie's Angels" spoof, when Cindy(Anna Faris), Brenda(Regina Hall), and Theo(Kathleen Robertson) are fighting Hansen "Charlie's Angels" style. I loved it.

		<fullReview>PLOT:Megan Voorhees (Natasha Lyonne), is possessed and two priests, Father McFeely (James Woods) and Father Harris (Andy Richter), must drive the demon out, but the exorcism doesn't go as planned. A year later, survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting.DIRECTING: 7/10- Director Keenen Ivory Wayans directs this film competently with lots of slow-motion shots and Matrix-like camera angles.WRITING: 8/10- Call the jokes crude, but I loved them. No, "Scary movie 2" has no intelligent, thought-provoking or meaningful dialogue but I thought that it was funny, original (Love the Amityville joke) and witty. While the third may have been funnier, this is still great fun and the jokes improved greatly over the original.ACTING: 9/10- All the characters are memorable and funny, and the actors fit their parts perfectly. Great cast, too.GORE: 2/10- Mostly cartoon violence. A man gets his skull cut off, but his heads empty, a chalandeer falls on a girl, a man's hair catches on fire, people get punched and kicked, etc. Nothing graphic or frightening happens.MONSTERS: WE get a few. A Possessed demon girl (Excorsist-derived), a killer plant monster, and there is also some semi-visible ghosts. We also get a skeleton creature. This is one of the fakest monsters I've ever seen, but it serves it's purpose by getting it's head put on it's pubic bone and it's limbs put in different sockets.SPECIAL F/X: 3/10- The effects are intermitent in quality. The creature effects, especially the skeleton and the plant creature, were accomplished via cable puppets and it's obvious--the cables and puppeteers are visible in many shots. Some of the other effects, however, are pretty good, including computer generated ghosts and flying furniture.SOUNDTRACK: 7/10- The film boasts a pretty good soundtrack. I dug the song during the end credits.FINAL VERDICT: "Scary movie 2" is a great sequel. It spoofs everything from the haunting to poltergiest and it's all great fun. My rating for "Scary movie 2"--8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequels don't come much worse than this atrocity. Scary Movie 2 is a spoof of the haunted house genre, which parodies other movies such as Titanic and Charlie's Angels to minimal effect. While its predecessor was creative and often laugh-out-loud funny, this sequel just goes way too far.The feeble jokes are for the most part, just plain disgusting. The new characters in the film are undeveloped, unwelcome and have no charisma. In particular, blow dryer Tori Spelling. Another thing, most of the characters who they killer off in the first one return here with no apparent explanation. They even decided to bring in James Woods and `Alien's Veronica Cartwright for a dreadful and rather pointless sketch on `The Exorcist' at the start of the movie. With more scriptwriters than jokes, I absolutely detested this film's risible attempt at humour.But then again, if a money shot of sperm, a man being smoked by weed, a deranged hand, an invisible genitalia, a big black penis in some poor clown's mouth, a girl p*ssing herself and a vomit marathon are your idea of humour, then watch this film. Otherwise, avoid, avoid, avoid. 2.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

Way better cast, more controlled humor, better punchlines and great direction, this is one of the best satires of all time. The Wayans bros clearly outdid themselves.A very pleasant surprise.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grade lower than Scary Movie, but still funny as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie burst on the scene as one of the most wittiest gross out comedies ever, slashing the whole teen horror movie genre and raping its corpse. I'm surprised Valentine and Dracula 2000 and Blair Witch 2 even came out after that. Oh well. Scary Movie got a B+ from me. Scary Movie 2 was something they couldve done without, but they still had some real funny jokes up their sleeves to parody horror movies with. The movie goes by real fast and has little substance, but you have fun along the way. If this is your type of movie, that is. C+, 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how I ended up watching this. Let's just say I have a friend who really doesn't know how to do video nights.Basically, what we're faced with here are the same problems as in Scary Movie. Silly spoofs that don't even raise an occasional smile. Gross-out humour that covers the likes of supernatural sex, physical deformity and auto-fellatio. What earns this movie a lower grade than the last is the fact that they're repeating all the same mistakes a second time.Let me put it this way. Glitter was better than this. Scary Movie 2 makes Crossroads looks like American Beauty by comparison. Maybe the film's production consultants weren't consulted. Maybe the writers were running low on dramatic irony.Whatever. Let's just pray that we don't wind up with a Scary Movie 3.Grade: F</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok,To give you an idea of how bad this movie is, I registered on IMDB for the specific purpose of warning the masses about this film.Firstly I don't object to drugs, sex, swearing, teen jokes, filth, bad acting or toilet humour. In fact I watched this movie hoping and expecting to see that sort of thing.Secondly I like bad movies, I watch movies that are so bad they are good. Scary movie one was original and most of the jokes worked I liked it.But this... this 'movie' is absolute unspeakably bad excrement. The likes of which leaves you feeling dizzy, sick and wondering how on earth something like this could ever go beyond an idea is someone's mind. How could people spend hard earnt cash funding it? You will spend the next few hours in shock thinking about that time you will never get back that was wasted on watching this. How can something be so utterly terrible?Have I put fear into you yet?The opening 'exorcist' scene is remotely amusing. But from then... nothing. Just a mishmash of the same 'gags' about a wheelchair ridden character, a 'baby' hand and the EXACT same gags as the first movie. It will jar you with its stop start, stop start nature. The uneasy feeling you've done your money will set in by the 10-minute mark.I've seen funerals that were funnier. What is the most worrying thought is that at some point, the creators must have just decided that they didn't care. The same as the actors and everyone else. They had a box full of smelly excrement and a wall. They chucked a couple of pieces and hoped they stuck and made it into a movie.It gets to the point where, as yet another scene shudders to an unfunny jarring halt, for no reason whatsoever shortie is suddenly sitting with his brain exposed. You are crying in sympathy with the creators at how desperate they were to get one tiny incy-wincy laugh, pretty please?... You just sit back and with what little hope you have left you just softly whisper: why? why? why?What was the movie about again? What tiny bit of plot is holding these various scenes together? Is this actually a movie or some unrelated unfunny scenes with the same actors. Why doesn't any one care? How will these actors ever get another job?Please, your life is important, you work hard for your rental dollar. Take my advice and don't subject yourself to this. If this movie doesn't scare you senseless with how badly over scraped the bottom of the Hollywood barrel is, nothing will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood sinks to a new low...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First they give Jim Carrey something other than a mop job, then they let the Farrelly Brothers make a film that isn't a documentary about the use of pooper scoopers, then they give the Wayans Brothers a budget to work with. Will the people in charge of the green light at Hollywood ever learn?It's ironic, really, that people from In Living Colour actually have careers some ten to twelve years after the show was cancelled. I don't know what Jim Carrey did on that show to convince anyone that he should get money for anything other than being severely brain damaged, but after Scary Movie 2, he seems like the lesser of two evils. Which is also ironic considering that the original Scary Movie was actually quite funny in places. Maybe this is a call for more editors and script doctors to be employed in Hollywood?I won't get into critiquing all of the points in this film that others have already bashed to death. It's just a waste of time. What I will do is go over a few things that I found ridiculously wrong with the film. First of all, basing the majority of a film around a similar setting or premise to The Haunting is only going to get you in trouble. The actual film was an unmitigated disaster, even when Owen Wilson got his head chopped off, so trying to satirise it in any way, shape, or form is a bad idea - it satirised itself very effectively.Secondly, when you're choosing source materials or directors to satirise, it is generally a good idea not to pick someone who is obviously at least twice as intelligent as you are (although that could mean billions of people for the Wayans brothers). I am, of corse, referring to the utterly pathetic and childish attempts to satirise Hollow Man. Whereas the original made a good, satirical swipe at the empty morality of the New Testament, as well as provided a good story about a generally decent guy gone power-mad, the satire here was obviously conceived and executed with no idea whatsoever as to what the film was about. This is hardly surprising since, in a Christian-dominated society such as America, hardly anyone is going to properly understand what Hollow Man was about, but trying to match wits with one of Western Europe and Hollywood's most ingenious political satirists with a string of fart/body fluid/stoner gags is like trying to take on the entire American armed forces with a .22 - it just ain't going to work.Lastly, while the America-centric humour of a lot of the gags in Scary Movie was countered by the possibility of seeing the original commercials or films, the former being shown on a "greatest commercials" show ("Whazzup!" is actually an ad for Budweiser beer for all those people from the antipodes who don't watch "greatest commercials" shows), it falls flat in Scary Movie 2. The attempt to satirise the Nike ad was cut down in flames here by the fact that NOBODY had seen the commercial in this country. The fact that the satire was about as funny as a basketball match didn't help very much, either. Even though I like to think I am more cultured than most of my peers, I am also stumped on what the hell that gag involving Shorty's "brain" was about.So to sum up, Scary Movie 2 is an unfunny film written by a bunch of juvenile dipsticks, much like the original, but this time nobody thought to edit the script and bring some semblance of humour into the film. "What the hell," thought the studio execs. "We'll just print this crap up and show it on the screen - the kids will love it." Well, sorry, Dimension, but adolescents are generally far more intelligent than films like this one give them credit for, and most adults like myself outgrew this sort of drivel so long ago that we can hardly remember when it happened.</fullReview>

Also, I lot of the jokes were just recycled from the first film.With all that said, I wouldn't say the movie was a total waste of time, there was some really good comedy in the film and even found myself laughing pretty hard at times. Also, if you're looking for a reason to watch this film, watch it for Anna Faris, Tori Spelling and especially Kathleen Robertson! GOOD GOD!!!All I can say is if you liked the first film and are at all interested in this film, go for it, check it out. Besides, it's only 83 minutes long, that's gotta be one of the shortest movies I've ever seen. I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SCARY MOVIE 2 is a film that is not as great as its predecessor, but what sequel ever is? The humor is not as funny as the original and the writers tried way too hard this time around, using cliched jokes and milking the cow until it screams. The opening spoof sequence of THE EXORCIST is timeless. I would pay just to see that. James Woods truly makes you laugh in that part.The film itself is even implausible because the cast consists of many of the same characters from the original who we all know met an untimely demise at the hands of the ghostface killer. This time around, they have added Tim Curry, Tori Spelling, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Elliot and Christopher Kennedy Masterson into the mix and you have a blend of "sometimes funny, most of the time not" type movie. Sexual humor galore and nothing to account for it, let us hope that the third entry will bring back some of the well-needed, original humor that we were all hoping for when we went and saw this crap. SCARY MOVIE 2 gets 3/5.Let me also take this opportunity to quote Jamie Kennedy from SCREAM 2: "Sequels suck!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first SCARY MOVIE was a guilty pleasure that had a lot of laughs and was so over-the-top that it was also full of surprises. This sequel didn't really introduce anything new, and the first film was so extreme in the gross-out arena that they couldn't have gone any further in this one without getting an NC-17 rating. The clever moments here were few and far between, and it seems as though it is merely a cynical attempt to cash in on a successful franchise. If you liked the first one and it's a rainy night with nothing to do, you might get a laugh out of this, but rent it, certainly don't buy it, and please don't support a SCARY MOVIE 3 if they make one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Scary Movie, while being far from a great comedy, was at least watchable and had a few funny parts. So when I rented Scary Movie 2 last weekend I was at least expecting a few laughs... I laughed only once, and it happened in the first 5 minutes of the movie, thanks to James Woods(Why he agreed to play in that shameful movie is beyond me). The rest of the Movie was as funny as a bottle of milk. Well cross that, I think a bottle of milk might actually be funnier.The plot(plot?), actors, direction, music, everything was terrible. The movie is barely 75 minutes long but it was still 75 precious minutes that I completely wasted. Add to that 15 minutes I spent wondering how I managed to watch the whole thing.If you had any idea to rent this movie, go buy a bottle of milk instead. Trust me.</fullReview>

It also had good timing coming right after the barrage of teen horror flicks. The idea for the script of Scary Movie 2 probably came from installing hidden cameras in the living rooms of immature 12 year olds while their friends were over and seeing what they considered to be funny.

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this one I couldn't wait to see this, so I saw it as soon as possible and even though it's not as good as the original the hilarious parts are enough to give an old man a heart attack. I purchased this on DVD and the extras are amazing such as 3 pages of alternate and deleted scenes. Behind the Scenes Featurette, sneak peeks of other Dimension Films coming to DVD, and much more. The most hilarious scene in the film is its poke funning of the Exorcist. TRIVIA NOTE(S) MARLON BRANDO WAS ORIGINALLY SIGNED ON AND EVEN PAID TO APPEAR AS THE PRIEST IN THE BEGINNING, BUT HAD TO QUIT DO TO SICKNESS (HE GOT TO KEEP THE MONEY). ALSO THE TUNG USED IN THE BEGINNING WITH THE POSSESSED CHILD IS THE ORIGINAL TUNG USED IN THE EXORCIST. TORI SPELLING WHO PLAYS ONE OF THE CHARACTERS ALSO PLAYED CINDY PRESCOTT IN THE "STAB" MOVIE IN SCREAM 2, SCARY MOVIE 1 POKED FUN OF THE SCREAM TRILOGY. I highly recommend getting this on DVD if you don't have a DVD player get one it's worth every penny.</fullReview>

With K.I. Wayans at the helm, this should have been a sure thing. Unfortunately, it was instead a waste of time and money to sit through this sad, humorless film. I did not think it possible to drag so many talented people so far down. Relying on gross-out and sexual "jokes," this film insulted the viewer with non-sequiturs, build ups for which there was no punch line, and scenes that run pointlessly on. The film had only one truly funny moment, a scene which had little to do with the rest of the story and involved a "potted" plant. "Scary Movie" was sharp and funny.

Another point, is that the sequel isn't as sick as the first and that's a nice quality. The spoof on old movies doesn't work all the time, but the Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission: Impossible II do. The returning cast is good (especially Cindy and Brenda), but not Ray (who's sexual identity is still questioned), and I wish a few other people would have returned. Some of the new cast isn't great, all the main adults aren't well done, but the new teens Theo, Alex and Buddy are great.

		<fullReview>Let me first issue an apology:It's impossible not to watch this film with a couple of simple minded friends, in a full theatre, and not choke on your popcorn with laughter. If you are, say, between 18 and 35, like stupid comedies, are in that special mood, and don't care much about your self image, boy, this is the film for you. I was looking to laugh, and I got a movie in which I couldn't stop laughing. So that means the movie works, right?Well. It's like a chiclet. At first it tastes great, but chew on it hard, and the taste is gone. First of all (the apology has ended, BTW), I am SURE I saw a censored version of the movie, since there was a huge gap between the professors' death and the kids trying to get out of the haunted house. Second (and I cannot stress it enough), how come the directors are so keen in showing us the drug addict as the cool guy? I mean, kids are going to watch this movie one way or the other (rental, anyone?) and I can only imagine what they'll think when they see that the dopey guy even gets the girl at the end. Do we really need a drug-glorifying culture nowadays? Sheesh... I have known friends who regularly use drugs, and they ended up isolated and alienated. Nothing at all what is shown on the films.The story, as it is to be expected, stinks. No continuity, jumps from scene to scene, lots of jokes that simply don't work (the whole skeleton thing is stupid), and way too many counterculture references. Which will only help to date the thing. Which will make future viewing difficult or impossible. Which makes this movie appeal to future generation lessen a lot.Which might not be a bad thing, after all.</fullReview>

Most of the cast from the original return, but don't do much with their roles, and the same old gags are recycled. A retarded butler molests a roast turkey, Ray, a gay character, humps a clown under a bed and Anna Faris gets covered in jizzum again. Nice! The plot is poor, the performances annoying and the jokes only mildly funny at best. James Woods is great though. For his 10 minutes of the film. And when the opening skit is the highlight, you know something's wrong. I hope a third isn't released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first scary movie I had to watch twice to get my head around the jokes, and I did find it funny to watch. but scary movie 2 made me cringe, it seems all the movie could do was make fun of people with a handicap, Im not American and I know America sometimes has a strange sense of humor but seriously if anyone found this movie funny then they should go and see a shrink. This movie was so bad I even registered with imdb.com to make some kind of statement about it and in 10 years on the net I have never registered with any website.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny stuff, but PLEEEEASSSE get your minds out of the gutter!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to totally badmouth "Scary Movie 2," because I admittedly laughed a lot. Of course, most of those laughs came in the first half. I felt the second half was hit-or-miss. My issue is ever since "There's Something About Mary" was released, we've been bombarded by these gross-out comedies! Every time another comedy is released, it tries to outdo the previous one in grossness. The writers and directors assume they're pioneers, because they just disgusted audiences to the fullest. Well, what they don't realize is what made "There's Something About Mary" and "American Pie" work was their sense of wit and structure. There was a certain sense of intelligence behind the grossness. Now, filmmakers just assume you can have a young man shoot a wad of...manly juice...in a female's face and that's going to get a laugh. That's mostly because these comedies appeal mainly to young people. And young people, in general (not including me, of course), will laugh at ANYTHING scatological! It's unfortunate, but true! I admit, I've enjoyed tasteless comedies like this, the first "Scary Movie" and "Road Trip," but I've never seen a tasteless comedy that I can actually regard as great. Some of my favorite comedies of all time are films by Woody Allen and Albert Brooks. Those are comedy writers/directors who know how to get laughs without even uttering the word "penis." Now, though I did enjoy the aforementioned comedies, there comes a point where enough is enough. Sure, the young ones are eating this stuff up with a spoon and they'll probably tell ya "Hey, get off our backs! Go watch a historical documentary, if you can't handle it!" Normally, I would say something identical to that, but there always comes a point where it's just too much. And "Scary Movie 2" displays every indication that we have. At least, release some ADULT comedies. In case the filmmakers forgot, there ARE IN FACT grown-ups/mature human beings who go to the movies. But how often do we see adult comedies? Almost never! I guess they feel that's not where the profit is, so screw it!On a positive note, I think there are a few sequences in this sequel that were very well done. The James Woods/bowel movement scene is purely tasteless, but let's face it. There's a certain thrill in watching a serious actor humiliate himself like that, so this is your only chance to encounter Jimmy Woods taking an on-screen dump. I liked the parody of the Nike/b-ball commercial, in which everybody bounces the basketball to a certain rhythm. In this case, even the guy in the wheelchair joins in. The Wayans were pretty sharp in writing the satirical moments. Some other good ones are a "Gone in 60 Seconds" parody and one of "Charlie's Angels." Don't ya love it when they crack on movies that you absolutely loathe? Another scene I have to note is the Wayans' take on "Nightmare on Elm Street" in which Tori Spelling gives a b**w job to a ghost. That's an example of humor (as I mentioned earlier) with a degree of wit and structure. It's a very original idea (I can be wrong, email me if you can name another movie where a woman gives h**d to a ghost) and I felt it was used wisely.One actress they should've deleted from the cast all the way from the get-go is Anna Faris. Though the film's comic timing, in general, is nothing priceless I felt she was totally off-key and her gags come off less as funny and more as...bad acting. She's a beautiful actress, indeed, but looks ain't everything babe! Chris Elliot is another one of those comedians who has good comic potential, but can come off as extremely obnoxious in a badly written role. This is an example of the latter. He plays an annoying butler with a deformed hand (was that supposed to be funny?). He made me groan a lot (especially in the dinner sequence), but I got no laughs. Shawn and Marlon--what were you thinking???The crude humor begins to fade out in the second half, to the point where you just say "Enough already!" There's hardly a single joke that doesn't wander into scatological territory. We are also forced to sit through a recycled gag from the original, in a parody of "Hollow Man." Though many in the audience laughed at the outcome of that scene, I saw it coming (no pun intended). Most of the humor is pretty cheap, predictable and forced, so there are few gags that I can regard as priceless. I still have to say, the funniest sequence is the opening in which we're treated to an interesting rendition of "Shake That A**." The scene contains my main man Andy Richter (as you can probably tell, I was and still am a huge "Conan O'Brien" fan).If you're seeking a bundle of dirty laughs, I can't object to purchasing a ticket for "SM2." As I said, my main dispute is the lack of variety among comedies today. I urge you comedy writers: Get your mind OUT OF THE GUTTER!!! JUST FOR ONE DAMN SECOND!!! Try it, it works. You can still be funny!My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The complete anti-thesis of what the first was all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie was a brilliant, hilarious, and intelligent satire of scary movies. It poked fun at Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Nightmare On Elm Street and so on, and it did it with compassion and care. The writers really did their homework and thus we were presented with a film that not only was entertaining and funny, but it was smart and witty. You could infinitely count the number of movie references in the film and and some of them were so subtle that it took you a moment or two to realize that they were making fun of whatever movie it was making fun of. This cheap ersatz of a film, this charlatan, this sheep in wolves clothing is not only a terrible film, it does a terrible injustice to all that the first one stood for. It angers me when films like this are made as irresponsibly as this one was because it suckered me into the theater based on memories of last year. I actually put The Wayans and Kevin Williamson ( creator of the Scream franchise ) in the same category after Scary Movie. Now, my perception of the Wayans is that they are all one hit wonders.Scary Movie 2 has one big problem, and that is they decided to make fun of movies that weren't as iconoclastic as the ones they made fun of in the first one. When you are satirizing films like The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, you alienate perhaps your core audience that didn't really like those movies all that much in the first place. There were some clever references to Amityville Horror and The Exorcist at the beginning and those were the best jabs in the whole film, but what about the rest of this debacle? Why do I want to watch The Haunting and Hollow Man all over again when I didn't enjoy it in the first place? There are many horror fans out there and this film is not commensurate with the abilities that the Wayans showed in the first one. There are only so many times you can get by with fart, puke, pee, poo and sex jokes before you enervate your audience. I was enervated after the first fifteen minutes. I kept waiting for it to get better. But it never did. For every reference I could pick out and comprehend, there were long, painful stretches of film when I just didn't understand what they were trying to say or do. What was the point of Chris Elliot's character? Was he an amalgamation of every creepy character that has ever appeared in a haunted house film? Was he a pastiche of butlers or chambermaids from haunted house Hammer films? What was he? I have seen a lot of horror films in my day but never have I been privy to a more repulsive and useless character than him. He just wasn't needed, and if he was, then how about giving him more to go on than just a small and deformed appendage? To give a little credit, as I said, the beginning with James Woods and the Amityville/Exorcist scene was clever and there is one brilliant homage/satire that starts with the bouncing ball from The Changeling that turns into a wonderfully directed spinoff of the Nike basketball commercial. I was very impressed and entertained for those two minutes. But then for that clever scene, there are dozens of others that go absolutely nowhere. There is another embarrassing scene with Tori Spelling spouting off sexual profanities to an invisible miscreant that has his way with her against a wall that is supposed to be a send up of A Nightmare On Elm Street when Tina is attacked by an invisible Freddy Krueger. It is horribly done in here and there is no payoff.Back in the 10th century, the charlatan and the mounteback, two unsavory types, used to sell bogus panaceas, cure-alls, at bargain prices. They called this their "nostrum", meaning literally, "our remedy." Well my nostrum for this foul-stenched excuse for a film is for the Wayans to put a little more effort into the writing and maybe cut down from seven writers to two. This way ideas don't mesh and egos don't get bruised. As it stands this is one of the worst films I have seen this year and seeing how good the first one was, they should be ashamed of this deplorable, egregious, vapid and totally unnecessary film that they have given to us. And that is a shame.1.5 out of 10- The 1.5 being for the clever beginning and the Nike/Changeling send off. The rest of the movie receives a 0. Instead of making fun of films that are here today and forgotten tomorrow, why not take on the greats like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Cujo, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre? There is plenty of great material out there, so why go after films that people disliked? It doesn't make much sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 is hilarious. There's one thing that I can't seem to understand, if someone didn't like Scary Movie then why would they go see Scary Movie 2. They couldn't have thought that Marlon and Shawn Wayans were going to change the writing style they used on a movie that grossed well over 200 million dollars. Anyway, the movie was funny. I must say that I did like the first better, but I still thought this one was hilarious. Marlon Wayans is my favorite actor and I am a huge fan of the entire Wayans family. Although I don't believe that any type of comedy is better than another, if I were to follow these beliefs then I would have to conclude that Keenan, Marlon, and Shawn are just very versatile. Keenan Ivory Wayans wrote and produced I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, a spoof of blaxploitation films. This movie received rave reviews and didn't have "toilet humor" as many people like to call it. Marlon and Shawn wrote and produced Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, which critically was not as successful as Keenan's spoof, but was a huge hit with fans and had very little "toilet humor." Last summer the brothers Wayans wrote Scary Movie and mastered gross-out humor in the spoof. They did it again this summer. Perhaps many of the jokes in Scary Movie 2 are taken from scenes or even movies that many people might not remember, but the movie is still hilarious. Straight up, if you didn't like the first one, don't go see the sequel expecting something totally different. If you liked the first one and didn't enjoy the second, I supposed I can understand. I give it a 10 because it did its job which was to make me laugh. One final note, to anyone who says Marlon Wayans isn't talented, go out and rent Requiem for a Dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sorry sequel to the original spoof might have been okay if it had not had the problem of being unfunny. The first movie was okay, mixing gross-out gags and parody of the Scream movies, but this movie is simply a stinker. The jokes are obvious, and can be seen a mile away. The dialogue isn't funny (arguably the worst thing in the film is a foul-mouthed parrot that repeats expletives at everybody within earshot). The movie spoofs are bad (why anyone would want to send up garbage like the Haunting and Charlie's Angels is beyond me). When the jokes were being doled out at a surprisingly clunky pace, I found myself staring blankly at the screen instead of laughing.The gross out gags in the film are not funny, just nauseating, and most can be sniffed out very quickly (unlike the bathroom scene in the original, which was a shocker to everybody). Gross out gags can definitely be very funny, as in There's Something About Mary or American Pie. But here the writers (for lack of a better term) want us to laugh at someone sitting on a toilet just because its gross. It doesn't work that way.The fact that this film makes the original look like a comedy classic just about sums it up. When I saw the original, I was surprised to hear audience members laughing at even the worst jokes. In Scary Movie 2, though, the audience didn't go for it. I heard lots of courtesy laughs and nervous laughter, like some felt they had to laugh because the film was billed as a comedy. Aside from one dinner scene featuring Chris Elliot there are no scenes that inspire raucous laughter, like a good comedy should. If you're looking for a good time, look elsewhere. This film should be avoided at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. Though i guess not. If the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. Though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people take comedy too seriously. Look, if you want to kill some time and get some laughs in, SCARY MOVIE 2 is a good choice. Like many parody films, this one assembles its inspiration from a wide range of films. As I started watching it, I almost started to write down the films they were lifting scenes from. Fortunately, I stopped myself and went back to laughing. Still, it's interesting to watch scenes progress that switch from one flick to another. For example, the "trapped in the freezer" scene from HOLLOW MAN switches to the "do I drown or freeze to death" scene from TITANIC.Other flicks I caught references to--THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (Richard Matheson's homage to THE HAUNTING)THE EXORCIST (most of the opening sequence)THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (the flies in the bathroom)Stephen King's IT (the clown doll)A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (the invisible seduction)THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (the remake; the maze of basement corridors)HANNIBAL (the second dinner scene) CHARLIES ANGELSCROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGONHOLLOW MAN (I think they LITERALLY swiped the infrared goggles from that flick)SCREAM (talking to Dad on the phone at the end of the flick)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was the only question I was asking myself after watching Scary Movie 2. This movie is bad, VERY BAD. It rarely has jokes that are funny and the shock value is overdone and comes off as desperate. James Woods is the only good actor in the movie and he's also bad in it, he does have the only really funny line in the movie though. He walks into the room with The Exorcist girl, she spins her head around and he takes one look and says "F**k this!" And walks out, I actually laughed at that part. The rest of the humor is just horribly crude and rarely funny. The movie is just one big spoof on many different movies done very poorly. Both of these traits can be very good if done correctly, crude humor is funny in the hands of the Farrelly brothers. Spoofs are funny in the hands of David Zucker. But unfortunatly neither is funny in the hands of the Wayans brothers.I can't recommend this movie to anyone except for the most immensely immature and perverted. On a scale of 1-10 I give Scary Movie 2 a 3.</fullReview>

But there was indeed some really funny bits if you look hard enough, like the keep away with the skeleton (Overlong though and they ruined it with swearing), the "Look in the music room" (Ruined again by swearing) and the bit with the statue that says "When you go black, you never go back" were 3 funny parts in a mostly bad movie.In this movie, we see Cindy and her friends from the first movie (With Christopher Masterson as an added bonus) who are offered to go to a scary house with a immediate A with completion. From there "funny" hyjinks ensure. The film is worth a watch for people who have absolutely nothing else to watch or just want to see an OK scary movie spoof.Overall, the film is bad but with a few exceptions which at times is quite clever (Many jokes were ruined by swearing though).

		<fullReview>Making spoofs is second nature now, where this film delivers is the way in which it uses some very clever scenarios to produce some hysterical moments. Films such as Haunted house and 13 Ghosts are brilliantly mimicked to the point where I would rather watch this than the originals. Where this differs to other spoof films is that it doesn't really solely on 'gags'. There are some truly original moments which will have you holding your sides and are much funnier than some of the spoofs. If you liked American Pie and Airplane! Then I highly recommend this movie as it pokes humour at the cliché American scripts at at the time. My favourite moment? A very awkward situation around the dinner table!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could it get any worse than this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first Scary Movie. Yes, it had silly and gross jokes at times and the parodies weren't as sharp as they could have been. But it WAS funny and it had parodies. This sequel started out about the same, but soon the parodies were dropped to make way for the Wayans brothers' running gags, the same as in the first movie. These are: 1. Gays. Gay guys are all nymphomaniacs, so watch out straight guys! Don't befriend a gay guy, he's sure to fall in love with you and/or molest you. And the doll rape scene? Not funny, just gross. 2. Handicapped people. In the first movie there was Dewey, the mentally retarded guy, whose only redeeming moment was when he turned out to be the killer who had only been faking retarded the whole time. In this movie there's Dwight, a wheelchair-bound guy who's obsessed with never asking for help. I don't think I get the joke there. We're also introduced to Hanson (played disgustingly by Chris Elliott), who has a withered hand and - well, that's it. He's gross! I mean, a withered hand, no need for a personality or anything. Just like Goldmember on Austin Powers, he's just gross for the sake of gross, and therefore not funny.3. Bodily fluids. We got to see them all in this one, and when there's a pee scene, a fart scene and a vomit scene within the first minutes, you're in trouble. The sperm explosion joke from the first movie was repeated. These are surely funny moments to some viewers, but to others like me it's just cringeworthy and disturbing.4. Sex. This can't be avoided in a teen comedy, but it was supposed to be a parody of scary movies and not all about sex. I agree with the poster who said the Wayans brothers should just make a porn movie. They seem obsessed with sex.5. Drugs. Shorty's back and still not doing anything but smoking pot. It gets really tired after a while. I did laugh when the plant rolls a joint with him inside, but other than that, it wasn't funny at all.The only part that works is the Exorcist spoof in the beginning, but even that is ruined with crap, pee and vomit jokes. Notably, this part is the only one without the main characters present. As for the roles, Anna Faris does her best, but her role is pretty much being a stupid pretty girl. Kathleen Robertson gets to play the sex bomb and Tori Spelling is the "athletic" girl who has sex with the ghost, and who dies pretty soon. Both are pretty underutilized and aren't even present in most scenes. The new addition, besides Hanson and Dwight, is a parrot saying dirty/rude things, which is pretty predictable and boring.All in all, a very disappointing sequel. Not worth watching. 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stupid, loud, unamusing trash.The whole show here is vulgar language. I have no problem with vulgarity if the writing is skillful, but here it's mistaken as a direct substitution for wit. Every exchange here is a chance to swear or top the previous vulgarity, as if vulgarity itself is humor. Every place you can mention asses, penises and vaginas is considered a punchline. If you aren't twelve years old, you may not agree. It's just harsh and sophomoric. This formula wears out it's welcome in the first ten minutes. Each new bit is lousy and unfunny, and runs on and on without eliciting even a giggle: Chris Elliott with a withered hand, a foul-mouthed parrot, a Nike basketball spoof, a fist-fighting cat. What does any of this have to do with scary movies? It's so chronically off-track that you begin to wonder what the hell it is they're "satirizing."This is not how the first movie operated. Whoever directed this has no sense of humor, excess or pacing.No one will ever go broke making ever-more stupid movies for baked twenty-year-olds. This is a horrible movie made by the retarded, for the oxygen deprived.</fullReview>

I wouldn't let my children and my friends see this. It's not worth watching at all. What a shame! Even though I haven't liked this that much I'd like to see the first one.

		<fullReview>I actually enjoyed the first Scary Movie, I gave it 7 out of 10. But Scary Movie 2 is absolutely horrible. I don't mind gross out humor if it's funny, but here, it's not, it's just plain stupid. I do have some respect for the Wayans Brothers (and the endless list of other writers involved) for at least trying to parody different movies this time around, instead of sticking to the same ones as the first (although a few of the same jokes do show up again here). Unfortunately, they just couldn't pull it off. The teen slasher movies from the original were easier to parody, I think, because they're just really horrible to begin with and very easy to make fun of. People would have laughed no matter what. It seems like they were expecting the same thing with the second movie. However, most of the movies they choose to parody are a little more on the serious side, and therefore, are more difficult to make fun of. Not that it couldn't be done, but the writers would have to put more work into it. They didn't. All but a few of the jokes fall flat, and are more likely to inspire blank stares, not laughter. There are a few really funny jokes, but not nearly as many as the original Scary Movie, and not nearly enough to fill an entire movie.Rating: 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, just to set the record straight, I though the original 'Scary Movie'was tons of funny and really hilarious. I had high hopes that the levelof humor would be as funny as the first, but was kinda disappointed.The movie started out really funny, with a right-on spoof of 'TheExcorcist'. From there on, the jokes kept on coming, and occasionallywere quite hilarious. Hanson's hand had my friend and I rolling in theaisles. But after a while, tediousness set in and the jokes lost theirpunch.The reason I think the first installment was so successful isbecause this kind of spoof was so fresh and new. But now, it is kindaplayed out and even the extremely short running time seemed way to long.In short, 'Scary Movie 2' is ok summertime fun, but I would reallysuggest waiting for video; if at all.My rating: 6 out of 10</fullReview>

(at least there not doing the teen slasher movies anymore) I don't really know why I even saw Scary Movie 2. I thought the first one was really stupid and some what in a way funny except for the male sexual organs being exposed. I thought Scary Movie 2 was better then the first. Yeah I know lots of people either liked both or liked the first one better. But Im not sure if everyone will enjoy this movie. If you a fan of "In living color" or "The Wayans Brothers" you might enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brainless and funny spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of reviews bashing this movie but I think if you go into the theatre with an open mind for a new movie (this sequel has a slightly different feel from the original)and don't take it too seriously (these kind of movies require no real brain use) you will crack up at some of the funniest and most extreme sight gags to grace the screen in a while. I find the opening 'exorcist' spoof to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen, more so than the rest of the movie or it's prequel. James woods does a great job (this is his least serious role I've seen him in, I'll always remember him as Max Renn) but his and Andy Richter's characters are only in the opening sequence. The most memorable characters from the original return, although most of them died in the first one, but in this movie they are more than the simple straight copy from another character in a scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer movie. In this movie the characters, being in a completely different spoof, have more of an identity. With this sequel being pretty much as gross and extreme as the original (I was just glad ms. man didn't return) it's still not for little kids, although I'm sure tons of little kids will end up seeing it anyway. The acting gives me a lot of respect for the actors and actresses, because just not every actor in a big budget Hollywood movie is willing to do such self-demeaning gross-out humor (like the Cindy character). The Wayans were lucky to find such great and willing actors/actresses because performing a lot of their jokes (in what millions of people will see) is not easy to do, and for that I give them respect. I laughed very very much when I saw this movie. One thing that may hold back a viewer's laughs: you need to have seen a LOT of movies to get most of the jokes, most importantly: The Haunting (1999), Poltergeist, Hollow Man, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Hannibal. Oh man, I thought this movie was hillarious. Best gag: The exorcist's reaction to seeing the little girl's head spin around. It is a simple and fast joke, yet it was hillarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, I liked the first one. It had some clever jokes, and funny movie spoofs. But this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've haven't been this tempted to walk out of a theatre since I saw Batman &amp; Robin. It was like the Wayans took all of the gross-out gags from the first one, and decided to make the sequel completely based around that. This time around, the cast is in a haunted house spoof, that consists of so many unfunny jokes, that you throw your arms up in the air saying "what were they thinking?". The humor in this movie is extremely desperate and contrived; even going as far as to spoof movies that aren't even horror movies. As my local newspaper said, Chris Elliot "milked out every scene as much as he could without garnering a single laugh". The only funny part of the movie was the Exorcist spoof (especially the party scene with Andy Richter playing the piano). After that, your waiting for the movie to be funny, until the halfway point when you just give up. For the remainder, your subjected to an annoying parrot that gets old really fast, Chris Elliots deformed hand, Anna Farris's very Jan Brady like disposition, recycled ejaculation jokes, and other very redundant examples of toilet humor. Don't get me wrong; I think toilet humor can be funny if it's done well. But this was just ridiculous. Worst movie this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"No More Mercy. No More Shame. No More Sequels - Honest! - We lied"...That's just it. That tag line did lie...There was Mercy...They held back to much. Maybe they felt that with the first one they went to far, but just the jokes in this one felt like they were, restricted, and that they were holding back the punches.Then there is the fact that you can easily tell how this movie was rushed. The writing was bad, and at many points in the movie, should have been...funny. Like there would be long stretches where nothing was funny, and that it was trying to move like a regular movie would.Also, this movie is called Scary Movie. It is supposed to be a spoof of Horror movies. That is what one would believe, correct. Well, then why did it spoof "Cats and Dogs", "Charlies Angels", and other such movies more than horror movies. Sure it had the basic story of The Haunting, which I was trying to remember that bad movie enough as it were, as well as having a little Exorcist and What Lies Beneath. However, beyond those movies, there really wasn't much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the first movie wasn't bad enough, the sequel only confirms that we are living in the declining years of a decadent society with a blinded sense of esthetics, an amoral soul and the intelligence of club moss. YES, I know this movie is parody, but parody can be funny, witty, and sophisticated without resorting to crass vulgarity and filth for its own sake. This film only proves that Hollywood continues to cater to the lowest common (very common!) denominator (or is it that Hollywood continues to define the lowest common denominator?) and that the vast majority of movie going audiences have the brains of a degenerate ferret. I am no prude. Vulgarity and shock value have their place. They should be the spices and seasonings on the entree, not the entree itself. This piece of work is a hollow mockery of what real parody should be and only moves us that much closer to the total collapse of social responsibility.</fullReview>

I did appreciate the cast, especially Chris Elliott, who is always funny, and Tori Spelling from Beverly Hills 90210 was great also, Kathleen Robertson also from 90210 was wonderfully cast as a temptress, and Tim Curry played a great part also. Overall this movie is worth watching but don't pay full price for it. It's a much better movie at $5 NOT $7. Also, don't go if you think there are too many people in the theater because all they will do is talk through it - a personal pet peeve of mine whether or not I like the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the grotesque humor of the first Scary Movie, I have to say that I liked it, and was interested to see what the Wayans could conjure up for the sequel. As it turns out, not much. (*no spoilers*)So these kids are put in a haunted house for a class. Okay. After that, the plot goes no where. It is never explained WHY they are there--the beginning is simply followed by random puns and gross humor. The jokes were good for a quick laugh, but they weren't much when you thought about it later. And I found myself revisiting the same jokes that were used in the first Scary Movie far too frequently. The fact that the cast is nearly the same didn't help.I'll give them one thing--the opening sequence was pretty funny. There were new actors involved (James Woods, Natasha Lyonne, etc.), and some great spoofs on the Exorcist. But when it came right down to it, the movie lacked a good plot, decent actors (Tori Spelling? come on), and most of all, a healthy amount of humor for what was advertised. I'm glad I knew the guy at the ticket counter and got in for free--my $8.50 will go to better use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously and painfully bad... they should have kept their promise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quick warning. Some things I say here might be construed as spoilers. So if you're really worried about me giving away some joke or plot point of ScaryMovie 2, beware my spoilers and read no further. But personally, I don't think anything could spoil this movie any more than it has spoiled itself.Part of the advertising campaign for Scary Movie was that there would be nosequel. I wish with every fiber of my critical mind that the Wayans had been true to their word.Scary Movie was quite funny. Somehow, they managed to successfully parodya self-parodying genre. This, I think, is mostly because the creative team wasn't afraid to push limits of tastefulness (-lessness), and there was a certaininnocence to their humour. A crass innocence, lacking in the sophistication of a Zucker/Abrahams production like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, but a simplicity of style in the way the jokes were told. While neither film has a grasp on comic pacing, the jokes of the first film still landed. And I laughed.Scary Movie 2, however, is a complete and total failure on all levels. Riding the success of the first, the Wayans pump up the bodily-fluid jokes, none of which are amusing. Some, in fact, are direct replicas of the jokes in the first. They also seem to believe that it is funny when someone says "motherf***er" for noreason, in an inappropriate instance. And it can be funny. When usedsparingly, the shock value of that kind of gag breaks the tension of a scene, and with a proper set up, will illicit laughter. It is not funny, however, when that is the punch line of literally every other exchange of dialogue (variations includecharacters saying: "f*** this," and "shut the f*** up," among others).This relates directly to one of the fundamental flaws of the film, which is that there is never any tension, or solid foundation of a joke, ever established. A great joke starts out like a string pulled tighter and tighter until one of two things happens: either it breaks from its own tension or it is cut. Mike Myers is the master of pulling the string until it snaps of its own accord; as in the Austin Powers movies, he holds off on a punch line, or drags one out, for so long that it eventually becomes funny (consider his villains laughing diabolically for two whole minutes in the first film). Either that, or the setup, with no superfluous distractions, is clean, taut, and then cut at the appropriate moment. In Scary Movie 2, the Wayans try and fit so many stupid things into one scene or onejoke, that, as a result, the setup is never clean, and the punch line never lands. Rarely, in fact, is there a punch line. Also, we see characters repeatedly cutting the tension by commenting on their surroundings (self-reference is dangerousin comedy... it fails as often as it works). At one moment, a character can deliver an absurd line with no one noticing it, and then in the next, a character might comment on a similar line by saying "that's a stupid thing to say." Consider two situations: in the first, the audience sees some food tampered with, or tainted in a disgusting manner, which is then consumed by a character in the film. In the second, the character sees the food tainted, is obviously and vocally disgusted, and simply does not eat. The first can be (though not always) funny becausethe reaction is elicited on the part of the AUDIENCE. The AUDIENCE shouldfeel disgusted, or should laugh at the situation, not the characters. We know something the characters do not. This creates the tension and the release for us. Scary Movie 2 repeatedly opts for the second type of joke. There is notension, no mystery, and absolutely no funny. Likewise, half the time, thecharacters are scared and the other half they recognize that their world is one of parody and comedy. Characters in a parody must accept and address theirpredicament with life or death seriousness, or it kills the comedy. Consider Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun films. To Frank Drebin, everything wasserious. It was how seriously he treated absurd situations that made it funny.There is also very little effective parody, if any. Movies are not parodied here. They are merely referenced. Just because I recognize variances on scenesfrom the Exorcist, Mission Impossible 2, Charlie's Angels, etc. doesn't meanthey're funny. The source material is not mocked, commented on, or made light of in any capacity at all. They are merely replicated with swearing and sex- jokes tacked on.Finally, the film can't settle on a tone. In one scene (in fact, in many scenes), a character is sprayed or covered in some disgusting substance, only to be clean and rid of it in the next. Fine. Perfect. That's the way these movies work. But in another scene, ridiculous occurrences (such as getting in a fistfight with apossessed cat who handles a broken bottle) are treated with a seriousness and meaning by the characters involved. One character supposedly has carnalinteractions with a ghost/monster, and the issue is dropped. Another does the same thing, and it becomes a plot point. Either this is a movie that exists as a coherent story or exists as essentially a series of sketches with punch lines, but it can't be both. Actually, that's not true. Films made by brilliant comedians can do both, because they understand the nuances of their craft. The Scary Movies are not made by craftsmen. They are made by fart-joke purveyors. The first film embraced that.The second film is a little too ambitious, an 82-minute marathon of poor setups and no laughs, all the while wishing it could be a real movie that tells a story. What scares me the most is that Scary Movie 2 is part of a trilogy. May themovie gods save us all. Rating (1/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst sequels I've EVER seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1/2* out of ****  What on earth happened? I don't think I have ever in my entire life seen a film so funny and original have such a TERRIBLE sequel. The things they spoofed weren't really well done, some of the gags weren't even spoofs but rather replicas of what the film was TRYING to spoof, some gags were reused, horribly, and frankly, the comedy tried too hard. I have a feeling the only reason people are saying this one was funnier than the first (which I've heard a lot of) is because of one of the following:1: They are saying what they think their friends will say, and their friends are saying what they think THEIR friends will say, merely for popularity reasons, however untrue. 2: They are overly optimistic. I personally know very few people who didn't enjoy the first film, so the fact that the sequel was garbage just can't be!3: They saw the film on the worst day of their life, which had subsequently demolished their taste and humor to horrific lows,thus ANY comedic movie, good or bad, funny or unfunny, was just what the doctor ordered.4: They were really, REALLY toasted when they saw this movie, thus EVERYTHING, including the projector rays penetrating through the dust of the theatre, was funny.  Admittedly I am somewhat grading this film compared to the first installment, which isn't really fair, but I doubt even without that bit of criteria that this movie would have been enjoyable. Besides, that's the price you pay when you make a sequel, especially when you promised that there wasn't going to BE a sequel! (see tagline of "Scary Movie (2000)" The first film was VERY good, I can't stress that enough, frankly I haven't laughed that hard in a movie theatre since. With the sequel, I giggled a few times, but that hardly makes it a genuinely funny movie. Am I being overly harsh? Nope. I myself was in the midst of an average, take it or leave it day, am only slyly optimistic, care not what my friends think about my tastes, and had not taken part in any mind altering benders that day, and hence saw the movie for what it was: A WASTE OF TIME.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summing up Scary Movie 2 really depends on what you thought of Scary Movie. If you liked the original gross-out horror spoof, you'll probably like this one. If you thought that the first was horribly disgusting and gross and needlessly graphic, then don't go see the sequel. Simple as that.Overall, Scary Movie 2 packed more parodies (do we dare try to list all the movies? The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, The Haunting, 13 Ghosts, a Nike commercial, The Weakest Link, Poltergeist, Hollow Man, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Mission Impossible 2, Charlie's Angels, What Lies Beneath, Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs, Save the Last Dance, is that all? Probably not.) Heck, Scary Movie even parodied itself! Well, at least I sure hope the complete excess of genital humor was self-parody. At least we weren't "treated" to the sight of REAL male genitalia in this one.But anyway, Scary Movie 2 packed more parodies into less of a plot (is that possible?) than the original. True, the gags aren't as funny, generally. But the movie does indeed contain some classic satirical moments: The Exorcist opening is classic. The Hollow Man cooler parody scene is also excellent. Also nice is the way the Wayans unexpectedly throw in parodies out of nowhere. Sometimes this works (Save the Last Dance), sometimes it doesn't (Nike). But that's the whole point of a parody movie. Completely random satires of a movie or movies from the genre in question.But what exactly was the movie/genre in question? In the first we had an idea that it was Scream. Heck, we KNEW it was Scream. But this one seemed to just be a haunted house movie filled with every sort of parody possible - part Poltergeist, part Hollow Man, part ???. So the movie suffers as a result.Oh the laughs are great, and if you don't mind the juvenile humor, they're even better. But hey, it's not as good as the original, which really was a classic parody movie, even if it was disgusting at points.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for free, so all it cost me was 82 minutes. But think hard before you sink nine bucks into this puppy.If you liked the first "Scary Movie," you might -- might -- like this one. In SM2, the Wayans crew loses much of SM1's cleverness and stuffs in even more bodily fluid/fart/boob/gay jokes. If that's what you're after, you've found Nirvana.Not everything here is unfunny or a retread. The opening five minutes pack some laughs, and traces of actual wit surface in spots. Just not often enough.For a spoof to work, you need a target. Unfortunately, the Wayans brothers don't seem to know what they're aiming at here, other than everyone's crotch and their own feet. I'm sure they'll get their aim back, but for the most part, "Scary Movie 2" is off-target practice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this movie made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first Scary Movie, and I thought it was a hilarious satire on those stupid Scream movies. While it wasn't brilliant--it basically borrowed the plot from Scream--it was pretty entertaining. This movie, however, was not. The only tidbits that I found funny were carried over from the first movie. Most of the jokes were over-the-top bathroom humor or constant sex jokes. The characters weren't developed at all which added a great deal of confusion to the movie. I wasn't exactly sure why Chris Elliot's character was in the movie. All I know is that he sounded a lot like a Southern Cartman. I think he was supposed to be the villian, but the movie left out exactly why he was the villian. There was also some major continuity problems that were so bad that they were insulting to the audience's intelligence. The original Scary Movie was hilarious enough that they did not have to make another movie. I rate this movie a 1 out of a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 10 minutes of this film are mildly amusing. Not painstakingly hilarious, just amusing. But considering the rest of the movie is completely laugh-free, "amusing" is good enough.After the opening Exorcist spoof (enjoyable thanks to James Woods parodying Max Von Sydow), Scary Movie 2 fails to make its audience smile even once, despite the presence of people like Tim Curry and David Cross (priceless in Arrested Development, boring as hell is this film). Curry and Cross are studying supernatural phenomenons, which supposedly take place in a "haunted house". In order to succeed with their experiment, they decide to use a group of teenagers (those who didn't die in the previous installment) as baits. You can easily guess what's gonna happen next.The first Scary Movie wasn't very memorable, but it had some good moments under the crude, puerile surface. The sequel, disappointingly, is just surface. All gags involve sex and drugs, drugs and sex, in what becomes a marathon of increasingly embarrassing jokes. The characters are one-dimensional and dull, and the actors do absolutely nothing to add more flesh to the unappealing bones. The whole film is so ridiculous I didn't even mind to point out a blatant continuity mistake (how can Brenda and Ray be in this movie when they were killed in the first flick?).Final verdict: haven't seen this picture? Then don't. Watch Scary Movie 3 and 4 directly instead.3,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 has some very funny moments but overall the film is a generic mock film. Chris Elliot's portrayal of the butler in this trivial sequel is gut splitting. Saturday Night Live would benefit with a skit using Elliot's Character. Anna Farris somehow keeps a comical sisterly approach throughout the movie. Marlon Waylan's homosexual tendencies are amusing. The cat fight has one holding back tears.There's not much going on here except mocking popular horror films. It's a light amusing film that somehow leaves you feeling good. A mindless romp through a popular formula. It works. It's stupid but good stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a movie, this is an uninspiring, disgraceful, pointless crappy spiel of wasted film. Trust me, there are better ways to spend your time then watching this garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that writing about Scary Movie 2 is a painful experience, but not as painful as actually watching the ridiculous film that we are given by Keenan Ivory Wayan and his crew. To put this movie in perspective, it was supposed to make me laugh, right? I did not laugh once, which shows where it fails for me.So I am not going to deeply analyse this film, just tell you that it is not funny, has virtually no moments of greatness, the performances are pretty poor from all involved (including the Wayan brothers, Anne Faris, Malcolm in the middle star James DeBello, Tori Spelling, in a career destroying role, James Wood and Natasha Lyonne). While the direction of the film lacks any sense and is just one contrived mess in my view.To learn that acting legend Marlon Brando was going to accept a role on this film almost made me faint from shock. Thankfully the great man was not well enough to do so, because if he had have been a part of this terrible conglomeration, I believe it could have cost him more than his health. Scary movie (2000), the very original movie spoof, was a surprise in the cinemas, taking off some of the great horror movies of our time much better and was more to my liking. Yet with that film, I could only enjoy it once as it ran thin on me after that. This is the sort of comedy where you are either going to love it or hate it. I hate it with an absolute vengeance.So my rating? CMRS gives 'Scary Movie 2': 0 Reason? Sorry there is nothing here to really get your hopes up about this film. After turning this film off four times in disgust, the best part about this movie was seeing the closing credits, knowing that it was finally over and I was out my misery.P.S. Now seeing that there is a 'Scary Movie 3' out, I just sit, cringing in silence, hoping that this is the end to these bad movies. If I had one request as a movie-watcher, it would be that I could have those 100 minutes of my life back. I am disappointed that will not be happening. A friend warned me that this would happen. Why, oh why did I not listen to him? I am such an idiot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Bad Sequel With Few Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 (2001)* 1/2 (out of 4)The original movie wasn't the greatest but at least it did manage a few laughs. This cash-in sequel has a few laughs as well but the majority of the jokes are just downright lame and certainly never funny. This is a pretty bad movie that has the people from the first, led by Cindy (Anna Faris), now in college and having their professor (Tim Curry) take them to Hell House where a year earlier a young woman was possessed by a demon. The opening sequence is a take off on THE EXORCIST with James Woods playing the priest. For the most part this entire sequence is bad but what few laughs there are come from Woods but I'm curious why he'd agree to appear in something like this. Either way, it's clear by the number of writers that this was going to be uneven but it was obviously also rushed to cash-in on the success of the first film. The first one was lazy for pretty much just remaking SCREAM scene-for-scene but this one here is just lazy because there's no imagination to it. Faris comes across rather bored this time out, the Wayans brothers aren't really bringing many laughs as like in the first film they are mainly here for gay or pot jokes. Curry is forgettable in his role. The only saving grace comes from Chris Elliott playing a deformed cook. SCARY MOVIE 2 lasts just 82-minutes but it feels twice as long and you know you're in trouble when a the smartest jokes seem to have been written by children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was once fresh is now old and tired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* out of (****)It was inevitable. A sequel to a financial succession that jump-started the spoof genre back in 2000. However, with disappointing box office revenues and harsh criticism, it goes to show many people did not like "Scary Movie 2". I am not one of those people. I HATED it. The opening for "Scary Movie 2" starts with a bang and is just very loud and eccentric, but with reasonable intentions. From there, it gradually goes downhill and by the third act, you just want to be done with this movie. The fact that the IMDb average score is 4.8, Rotten Tomatoes has it a dead 15%, and Metacritic has it at a 29% should really tell you something.First off, the performers are just tried and annoying to say the least. In the original, they were fun, zany characters that just had something that clicked with the audience. Not in here. Furthermore, the story just goes nowhere. Going from scary movies to a random basketball showdown to a Charlie's Angels fight, it's all just sloppy and feels like the filmmakers just throw a bunch of random bologna and saw what could stick. The verdict is none. Hey, at least the first had a plot, albeit a shallow one, that you could easily follow and it would actually be a story.To top it off, when your comedy falls dead flat on its face when it comes to jokes, then you know you did something wrong. The jokes are gross, in-your-face, and top each other in terms of raunchiness, but they are tired, dead, and truly redundant. I'll use a quote from critic Michael Phillips. You won't hear crickets in the audience. You'll hear dead crickets.And lastly, this movie is just boring. While the original was not a good movie, it at least held my interest. This was just such a drag. All in all, "Scary Movie 2" just doesn't miss the mark, it misses the target completely. They can throw all the gross-out gags and random penises at the screen, but I could care less. I need a fresh, hot script and some good performers to make the movie. If you fail on those accounts, your movie fails. What was once fresh and hip, is now just old, tired, and begs the question, "why?". I think the filmmakers got the title right this time. This movie is scary, because it isn't funny and just terrible to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily a better party movie than the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first part of the series was very superficial, dumb and boring and only turned around movies such as "Scream" or "I know what you did last summer". The second movie is easily an improvement as the number of referenced movies is much bigger and even some of the cinema's classics are ridiculously honoured in this follow up. You may really laugh about some scenes if you have seen movies such as "The Amityville Horror", "The exorcism of Emily Rose", "Rose Red" and so on. There are not only childish teen horror movies but some really solid flicks that inspired this movie. Even some movies that have nothing to do with the horror genre such as "Charlie's Angels" are referenced in here. One can say that this movie is more diversified and surprising than the first one.The sexual jokes are still the majority of puns in this movie but they are not as present and childish as they were in the first one. Some of the highlights in here are for example the vomiting scenes during the exorcism, the insulting and weird parrot or the wheelchair rat race between a scientist and a ghost. The puns are still predictable and childish but more diversified and far more entertaining than the jokes of the first movie.On the negative side, there is only the fact that some chase scenes in the haunted castle are way too long and get quite boring after a while as well as the bad ending that indicates a lack of ideas and seems somewhat suddenly.Nevertheless, this movie should not be criticized too hard as it is once again a good party movie with some absurd jokes that is mostly well entertaining if you have some good friends and some good beer around. Rent this one to have some fun but once you have seen and enjoyed it, there are no further reasons to purchase or watch it again very soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it odd to like this movie better than the first?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally comedy sequels aren't exactly the better movies but in this case I feel that this is a much better movie than its predecessor "Scary Movie" from 2000.What makes this movie better is its comedy. "Scary Movie" was still in lots of parts a very lame movie. Of course "Scary Movie 2" also does has its lame moments in it but overall the humor seemed more structured and better written and executed this time. Not to call this movie very mature though.Its story also progressed better. This time there actually was somewhat a main plot-line and the many movies that it spoofs in this one are better fitted in into the story. The first movie was simply being a spoof for the sake of being one. It makes this sequel a bit more pleasant to follow. Strangely enough this is a movie that got made under pressure from the big studios that wanted to cash in quickly one year already after the success of the first movie. It's strange because this movie its end result seems far better, as does its story.The characters also work out better in this one. Most of the actors from the first movie reprise their roles in this one again, so the movie doesn't has to waste a lot of time of introducing them again to the viewers. This movie however also has some more big names in it this time, with some big actors appearing in some small roles, such as James Woods and Tim Curry, who both did a hilarious job.Better humor, better story, better characters. Simply a better movie than the first "Scary Movie".7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you thought "Scary Movie" scraped the bottom of the proverbial barrel for its bowel humor, "Scary Movie 2" plumbs even deeper depths of depravity with its politically daring social commentary and its scatological satire. Basically, audiences that roared at "Scary Movie" should relish this hilarious as hell sequel with its inventive ghostly special effects and audacious, envelop pushing ribald humor. The pea-green soup projectile vomiting parody of "The Exorcist" alone should prompt the Vatican to condemn the Wayans Brothers' latest installment as blasphemous while its ridiculing of Firestone Tires during a game of chicken in wheelchairs must have seemed too opportune to pass up. "Scary Movie" director Keenen Ivory Wayans, writers Shawn &amp; Marlon Wayans, and a quintet of other scribes skewer the conventions and clichés of supernatural haunted house chillers instead of "Scream" slasher sagas. For the record, "Scary Movie 2" roasts "Hollow Man," "Titanic," "What Lies Beneath," "Hannibal," "Cast Away," "The Haunting," "Charlie's Angels," and many other demonic possession epics."Scary Movie 2" spoofs "The Exorcist" in a hysterical eight-minute prologue. Father McFeely (James Woods of "Once Upon A Time in America") shows up to exorcise the demons from Megan Voorhees (Latasha Lyonne of "American Pie"), but finds himself caught in the middle of a three way barf-a-rama that leaves everybody drenched before they pull guns on Megan. Anyway, during the exorcism, Megan turns to McFeely's sidekick Father Harris (ex-Conan O'Brien host Andy Richter) and quizzes the young priest about the whereabouts of his momma. The infuriated cleric demands that his mom come out of the head whirling witch. No sooner has he uttered his ultimatum that dear old mom peels back the bed covers near Megan, gives her son a dirty look, snaps "You're no fun," and exits the room.Abruptly, the action shifts to Jefferson University. An inscription on a monument of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings surrounded by a brood of nappy haired children reads: "Once you go black, you never go back!" Cindy (Anna Faris of "Scary Movie"), gay football champ Ray (Shawn Wayans), dope-smoking Shorty (Marlon Wayans), and Ray's loquacious girlfriend Brenda (Regina Hall of "Enemy of the State") are all attending college now a year after the first "Scary Movie" ended. Their sexually randy psychology professor, Dr. Oldman (Tim Curry of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"), and his defiant wheelchair bound graduate student Dwight (David Cross of "Small Soldiers") have arranged for them and some other volunteers to spend the weekend at a spooky mansion. They are participating in a sleep disorders study which really amounts to nothing more than an attempt to document paranormal activity.Director Keenen Ivory Wayans pulls out all stops in this no-holds-barred, R-rated farce. Chris Elliot steals the show as a creepy caretaker with a deformed hand. Ultimately, "Scary Movie 2" surpasses "Scary Movie" with its ripe supply of shameless, slapstick shenanigans. Call me sick, but I enjoyed every minute of this lowbrow, sloppy seconds send-up.</fullReview>

Professor Oldman has convinced them it for a school project, but the night won't go past quietly. Master Kane is long dead, but still plans on enjoying himself, especially with Alex Monday. When things really start getting bad, the gang must work together to find a way to capture this ghostly menace.'Scary Movie' was a decent spoof film. Wasn't fantastic and wasn't terrible. Unfortunately its sequel 'Scary Movie 2', fails to deliver a decent movie. The stars of the film are their usual characters from the previous film. Marlon Wayans isn't as annoying as Shorty Meeks, and Tim Curry makes an nice addition to the cast. The opening spoof isn't actually that bad and i found it quite humorous, but after this, the actual funny jokes are few and made the film drag on. Fortuantly the sequel had an improvement over this. They should have really picked much better material to spoof than 'House on Haunted Hill' or 'Charlie Angels'."Suck on this." - Father McFeely (James Woods)</fullReview>

Spoofing movies like STIGMATA and THE EXORCIST, a conniving college professor(Tim Curry), lures special students to a haunted house for various decadent reasons...mainly to get laid. My favorite scene is the sequence of Tori Spelling with the "ghostly" lover.This comedy is directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. The cast with various degrees of stardom features: Marlon and Shawn Wayans, Anna Faris, Regina Hall, James Woods, Chris Elliott, Kathleen Robertson and Veronica Cartwright. Woods is a hoot. I was most impressed with Robertson...damn, that girl is nice. No doubt about having a following; enough to continue on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome opening, decent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second movie in the "Scary Movie" series is, in my opinion, the weakest overall. That doesn't mean that it isn't without its merits, but the whole thing seems kind of like it was slapped together over a weekend. Many of the jokes just don't work, but there are enough side-splittingly funny bits to make it all worthwhile.This movie opens with an absolutely brilliant parody of "The Exorcist". It starts with the singalong scene with Andy Richter as Father Harris behind the piano. "You guys know this one?" he asks, and then proceeds to play the opening bars of -- get ready -- "Shake Ya Ass". Megan Voorhees (played by Natasha Lyonne) comes down the stairs and starts peeing on the floor, interrupting the singalong. Her mother treats her like a dog! This segues into the more obvious parody of the movie with Father McFeeley (James Woods) coming in to perform the exorcism with Father Harris ("F--- this!" McFeeley says when he first encounters the possessed girl). It's classic.Then the movie kind of dries up. The basic story is a parody of "The Haunting", a movie that was so bad that parody seems kind of unnecessary. It centers around a bunch of college kids going on an overnight trip to Hill House, ostensibly to study their sleep disorders but actually so the professor (Tim Curry) can summon the ghosts in the house. The only real connection with the first is found here, as some of the kids were picked because of their prior traumatic experiences (which they encountered in the first movie).Honestly, I thought the whole thing kind of rambled when I first saw it, and there were some eye-rollingly dumb jokes. But there were also a lot of very funny jokes and the cast (including Anna Faris, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, and the incredible Regina Hall from the original, mixed with vets Chris Elliot, David Cross, and Curry, Woods, and Richter) was very good; it was the writing that suffered more than anything. That, and the sloppy production values, but I guess that's nitpicking with a movie like this. Also, I didn't think the ending was very satisfying. Still, Brenda (Hall) and Cindy (Faris) messing with the "scary" skeleton that tries to terrorize them ("This is a skeleton -- this is bones! Would you run from Calista Flockhart?" Brenda chides Cindy when they run into each other); Hanson (Elliot) and Dwight (Cross) arguing; and Cindy fighting a cat "Raging Bull"-style were just some of the few very funny moments found in this movie.This may not seem like a glowing review, but I actually did like this movie and recommend it if you're into the spoof genre. Just don't expect "Airplane!" or even the first "Scary Movie" when you see it. On the bright side, it ain't "Spy Hard" either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing sequel spoofing mainly The Haunting does not reach the craziness of the original nor does it really take advantage of it's haunted house scenario. As with all of these Scary Movies, certain scenes do warrant the viewing due to the hilarious timing, but where the original thrived off of it's lewd sexual and toilet antics, the second edition merely revisits some of the tired jokes, and when those are not in place, the straight forward scooby doo style will surly doo one in. Thankfully comic brains David Cross and Tim Curry come to class up the juvenile cast, but cannot save, or even attempt to save this very questionable possibility even for rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stars: Anna Farris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, David Cross, Tori Spelling, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Masterson, David Cross, Tim Curry, Regina Hall, Chris Masterson, James Woods, Natasha Lyonne, James DeBello, Veronica Cartwright and Andy Richter.This is what is known as a hit and miss comedy. I'd say that the misses and the hits kind of balance each other out, and it came out really stupid, but funny at times. In this installment of the Scary Movies, Cindy, Shorty, Brenda, Ray and others go and stay at a haunted house for a school project. My favorite part was the opening spoof of the Excorsist with James Woods as the priest. If you want a cheap laugh, I's recommend this movie.My rating: **/****. 80 mins.

		<fullReview>It wasn't until this year I'd heard of the Scary Movies and what better introduction to it than this. It was a drop dead knock out comedy that's sure to entertain the watcher. The Wayans brothers as usual delivered but it was spectacular in this film, with comedy from the whole cast. Anna Faris and Regina Hall were riots delivering both in their brands of humour but the ones to look out for were the males mainly Shawn, Christopher and James. The entire movie is enjoyable with humour at every end and absolutely no dull moment. Especially to one who appreciates good humour and has a good sense of one too. My advice to anyone who wants to watch it is do so, believe me its worth it. This is more than just another parody movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a critic is just one person, then a review is just one person's opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy is a lot easier to judge than most other forms of cinema, it can easily be measured by how many times you laugh. I suppose drama, could be judged by how much it "gets" to you, a horror on how much it scares you etc. Most of you will know what this film is about and what to expect, parodies of recent films and some very low brow humour, so I won't go into detail giving it a proper review, but I'll just say if that sounds up your street, and it's on the TV one night, check it out. If you aren't likely to find a string of gay, sex, toilet and the like jokes entertaining, then you should avoid. I fell into the latter category and still decided to watch it, and it got a couple of laughs out of me and a few smiles, mainly from the exchanges between the guy in the wheelchair and the guy with the withered hand, the guy with the withered hand in general, the Big Daddy Kane nod, and the high tech devices they used for communicating near the end of the film. There is a nice bit of comic acting in here too, and as with most parody movies, you will also get more out of it if you've seen the films it spoofs.Unless you're a fan of general toilet humour, be aware of what you're getting into.</fullReview>

Actually, out of the 4 movies that came out as of now, it by far my favorite.It has a certain story that it follows through the movie. It has some organization, and you can see that some thought has been put into the script. The entire plot and characters are much more tied together.The others (I am primarily talking about part 4) just seem like a disorganized pile of spoofs and jokes. You could reedit and reorganize the movie and it would be the same. I have to say that part 4 is my least favorite part. 3/10 for part 4.7/10 for part 2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep tuning in at about the scene where the girls all tear their clothes off and change into different outfits. I think it was based on Charlies Angels or something.. Anyway, the end part that I have seen takes place in a generic dungeon, and there's a mad scientist doing something bad. People get electrocuted in that cartoony way where their hair gets blown black, and their faces and covered in soot. In one version (it is censored in a few different ways), there is a scene that shows the inside of one character's head, and there's a little dude getting stoned inside. I liked that moment, only because it was different than every other time I had seen the movie. This is something you tune into &amp; keep watching because you have already seen every movie in HBO's current lineup. While the other Scary Movies parody contemporary horror films, this one seems aimed more at the "Young Frankenstein"s of the movie world: Mel Brook's vision of horror. Perhaps because I am in no way a Mel Brooks fan (I've tried....hated them all...), this movie is not something I have ever enjoyed.</fullReview>

I could almost swear Uwe Boll directed this if not for the fact that he primarily likes messing up video games. Maybe he was a secret co-director.My advice is, skip this one, just watch #1 and #3, they're a lot better than this waste of time!

Stupid nonsensical plot lines (obviously) but just ridiculously unfunny all the way through. Even if you were completely paralytic you wouldn't find this funny (or at least shouldn't). The film depends completely on things that happened around the time that it was released so no one outside of USA will understand what the hell is going on, even then some of the thing's are so forgettable that no one in the USA cares about them today. Overall the worst film ever, if you ever get the chance burn every copy you see in a big fire and if anyone from the environmental lobby complains about it causing global warming tell them which film you're burning, they'll understand!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Scary Movie 2' is the sequel to the comedy horror-film parody 'Scary Movie'. The teenagers are back with more crude humor and situations, and this time, they are staying over at a haunted house where they meet some more unusual characters and parodies from other horror films. As in the first film, there is no novelty or artistic merit here. If you are into this sort of crude humor and jokes (and sexual-referenced jokes), then this is the film for you. If you do not like teenage comedies or this humor, then do not bother. It is one of those films that you see in the discount racks in DVD stores - cheaply-priced with few sold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary and disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie", was a somewhat breath of fresh air in the year 2000, with a concept in the tradition of "Airplane!". Making a movie that parodies every cliché of the late 90s teen horror genre like "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer" seemed like good fun. The Wayans brothers hit the target with their particular brand of crude humor that was very attractive to the MTV generation of the end of the last century.A year after, they broke their promise of no sequels with this movie focused on the big CGI horror movies like the remakes of "The Haunting" and "Thirtheen Ghosts" as well as other popular movies of the time, keeping the crude humor and the sex jokes in the same style as the original; the difference being that, as any sequel, there is the more of everything.Actually those two aspects are the main problems in the film; first, the popular culture references are only funny if one is familiar with those, and also become dated quickly as the time goes on. The comedy aspect of the film, unlike the original movie, is very weak, with most gags being repetitive and masking the movie tiresome. Sure, the Wayans are a very creative team and still can make a laugh, but in this movie it feels as if they had written the script on a hurry and without caring too much on the result.The acting is mediocre at best, with Anna Faris being again not only our lead character, but also the only one who knows how to give a good performance. Such a shame that her most famous role to date is as the lead star of this series of films, because she is a real talent on the rise. The rest of the cast is unconvincing and even the Wayans brothers seem bothered by their own script. The brilliant cameo by James Woods at the beginning of the film is among the few really enjoyable moments of the film.The special effects are far better than in the first one; having a bigger budget helps and director Keenen Ivory Wayans makes good use of them. Unlike the horror movies it parodies, "Scary Movie 2" doesn't abuse of CGI and at times it keeps the indie-look of the first one.The first "Scary movie" promised no sequels. If they had stayed true to their promise, maybe "Scary Movie" had been remembered as a jewel product of its time and not as the multi-sequel bore that is right now. 4/10</fullReview>

I gave it a chance and actually laughed in a few places because the exaggeration and over-the-top political incorrectness appealed to me.Tim Curry and James Woods do a pretty good job in their scenes. But their performances indicate that the director was looking for clichés and slightly stilted delivery as part of the humor. Having said that, this movie may offer one of Tori Spelling's best career performances.These kinds of movies seem to be a hit with teenagers and college kids, and I always try to rekindle my youth by watching them. I admit I laughed, but then I wondered why I had. Still, I give the Wayans brothers credit for getting a laugh out of me in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2, again directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, isn't as good as the original film. The script this time seems to have been hastily written so it could make its release date (they only had a year to make this 2001 film after the 2000 release of the original). Because of this, the dialogue is sub-par with the jokes either a rehash of the original, overly raunchy as to be very unfunny, or just plain dumb. The only real highlights are Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall as Brenda Meeks (they are the highlights of all 3 Scary Movie films so far). Sadly, even the James Woods cameo as Father McFeely (in an unoriginal Excorsist spoof) isn't worth watching. An average 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after 'Scary Movie' made so much money, it was inevitable that there would be a sequel. And it was inevitable that it wouldn't be as good.There were several problems with this movie, the largest of which is its lack of material. 'SM1' had five recent horror flicks (the three 'Scream' and the two 'I Know What...' films), the 'Sixth Sense', 'The Matrix', and I don't even know what else to draw on in its sharp, sly parody. Having used that for the first movie, the sequel is left with having to use things like 'The Exorcist' (can you say overdone?) and gross-out humour to make us "laugh." They even use their own gags (from 'SM1') but not as well.All in all, the movie isn't terrible. It just shows why Hollywood can, for lack of a better word, suck: rather than waiting a few years to make a sequel that could have been as good as the original, they rushed this one out to capitalise on the success of the first movie. In its own right, the movie would be O.K. As 'Scary Movie 2', the follow-up to one of the most hilarious and on-target parodies of all time, it sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring: Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Chris Elliot, Tim Curry, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Masterson, Tori Spelling, David Cross and James DeBelloRated R for Strong Sexual and Gross Humor, Graphic Language and Some Drug ContentGenre: Horror/Comedy/MysteryStar Rating: **** out of 5This is the second installment of the Scary Movie series with more spoofs and crazy stuff! As we left off from the first Scary Movie the survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting. So this movie spoofs "Charlie's Angels", "House on Haunted Hill", "13 Ghosts", "Paulie", "Dude, Where's My Car?" and "The Poltergeist". One of my favorite parts in the movie is where Cindy is driving in her car and listening to Vitamin C's song "Graduation" and Cindy is singing along to the song very badly so Vitamin C on the radio tells her to shut up and let her sing! Another funny part I liked was when Anna, Theo and Brenda were going to fight Hanson the guy with the funny looking hand, the three girls where running down the stairs while changing into their Charlie's Angels costumes and then when they come down you at first see them with their underwear and then they run back to change into their costumes. Another part I liked was the part where the group was with Dwight and he was handing out their items to defeat the ghosts and Brenda asks if there where any communication systems like walkie-talkies but instead all he had was just a line of string with two dixie cups on both sides! Another funny part was Shorty was teaching Cindy how to be all ghetto. I like this as well as the first one! Another thing I liked about this movie is that Tim Curry is in this movie and I think Tim Curry is hilarious and a good actor.BOTTOM LINE: FUNNY AS WELL AS THE FIRST AND I'M STILL LAUGHING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think this film was going to be this awful . Part 1 made fun of slasher movies like "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" but this time we get parodies from movies like The Exorcist and some Haunted House flicks. Even though I liked that they parodied a crappy movie like "The Haunting" I was still disappointed and extremely offended by this. It's just the same jokes we got in the first one but grosser, lamer, and just not funny anymore. This movie was just too much for me and I'm used to it at times but to see it again in a sequel not only makes it look unoriginal but it also makes the people who wrote this look very lazy and dumb. Its like they came up with the idea to set the movie in a Haunted House and they decided to throw in some disgusting jokes and that's it, the script is done.I couldn't wait til it was over because I couldn't stand anymore of this horrid and sexually perverse sequel.0 out of 10Rated R-Strong Sexual Gross Humor, Pervasive Language, Drug Use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the horrible original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had so many high hopes for the first "Scary Movie," but after seeing it, I was completely disgusted. It was horrible, with moments that were mainly not funny and instead just plain disturbing and/or wrong(I'm suprised it wasn't NC-17). So after my dad bought the second one, I thought, "Oh, gee, great. Another over-crude film that'll make me want to vomit." But to my suprise, this one's actually FUNNY.There are some great scenes here, such as James Woods spoofing the exorcist at the beginning. Plus, the Charlie's Angels scene, the radio scene(near the beginning), and the fight scene with the cat(that was so funny!). Some scenes are really crude and disgusting(like that one scene with Chris Elliot), but it's not nearly as bad with this disturbing stuff like the first one was.BOTTOM LINE: Since there's no real continuity in the series anyway, just ignore the first one and skip to part 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A success?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mixed bag of comments.On the plus side: James Woods parody of the exorcism seen in Amityville Horror, when being swarmed by flies, only to reveal he was on the the toilet was great. So were the quips between between Dwight and the caretaker Hanson even if they were politically incorrect........also anything involving Anna Faris. A great actress. The film may only be a parody, but there was something about her acting ability in this movie that shines.On the negative side: Whilst there were some good shocks they often involved a lot of swearing and whilst I am not a prude it does become tiresome when you are hit by a barrage of expletives. The main culprit was the parrot. Someone should have shot this bird in the early scenes to save further embarrassment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Do not watch while eating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd be interested to know when this was shown in theaters if staff clearing up after showings found a lot of unconsumed hotdogs and popcorn buckets under seats. The humour is for the most part of the kind that puts you off your food. It's crude and it doesn't always come off. There's crudity in Austin Powers but it's manipulated so skillfully that it's hilariously funny. There are other non-crude jokes which are funny. The scene where the marijuana plant grows to giant size and tries to smoke one of the Wayans brothers is brilliant. A scene early on in the film where the girl is driving in her car and singing along to the car stereo and the singer says tells her to shut up and let her sing is funny although spoiled a bit by an unnecessary swear word. But a lot of the jokes just fall flat unless you've seen the films that are being parodied. In Airplane you could still have a laugh at the scene where Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are rolling in the surf and get covered in seaweed and pollution even if you hadn't seen From Here To Eternity. Not so here. I see that Scary Movie 3 is to be directed by David Zucker so it might be worth watching. He might bring his touch that made Airplane so hilarious to the series. You don't usually see such pretty girls in comedies like this. Kathleen Robertson is gorgeous and so is Andrea Corr lookalike Anna Faris. On the subject of lookalikes, did it occur to anyone else when watching this film that if you took a picture of Joan Crawford and mischievously pencilled a beard on it you'd get Tim Curry? If there was an actor who looked like Bette Davis with a beard a good vehicle for him and Tim Curry would be a film called "Whatever Happened to Baby Jim"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scared me to death, from the almost zero laughs in this supposed spoof comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 brings us once again Shawn and Marlon Wayans from the first and triumphant Scary Movie. This movie spoofs many different movies ranging from The Exorcist, House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Poltergeist 1 &amp; 2, What Lies Beneath and many others. It has very funny opening moments with the spoofing of the Exorcist. However, the movie takes an absolute downfall afterwards. It had maybe and I'm being generous here, 2-3 more laughs scattered throughout the movie.For instance, there is a talking parrot who uses more curse words than I do, but in a VERY extremely non-funny way. It uses jokes like I had your mother last night and stuff like that. The jokes were so unoriginal, I wanted to shoot the person who wrote this crap. Since this movie is suppose to be funny and slapsticky, I expect funny for my buck. I don't expect good acting, plots, character development in these types of movies, but for god sakes, please show me the funny. Marlon Wayans brought a few laughs here and there as did Shawn, but the down-syndrome girl is oh my god, TOO ANNOYING TO DESCRIBE IN WORDS!!Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see some funny spoofs, then I suggest renting National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, Naked Gun, Naked Gun 2 1/2, Hot Shots part 1, Christmas Vacation, Airplane or Spy Hard. This movie doesn't even get a star. 0 *'s out of 4 *'s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why... why... why???This is movie is an absolute piece garbage. I have no idea what kind of people find this sort of thing to be funny. Not only is it excruciatingly unfunny, it is also extremely profane. How many times can you listen to a parrot say the word f*ck? How is this even remotely funny?These movie contains nothing but a group of third-rate, horribly untalented actors who should be on their hands and knees every night thanking God that they receive a paycheck. The script was also equally as execrable. You can find better ideas for stories by looking into a second grader's journal.Not only did I not laugh, I didn't even crack a smile. A funeral would put me in a better mood than this disgusting, offensive, worthless piece of filth. While watching this, the word "why" flashed across my head atleast a dozen times -- why are millions of dollars spent on production costs for these types of movies while people are starving in Africa? Why would ANYONE in ANY type of environment under ANY circumstance EVER find this type of movie entertaining? Why was this movie allowed to be made TWICE? WHY? WHY? WHY?Please, stop going to the movies and paying for these types of movies. It is ANTI-entertainment. We're taking steps backwards with these movies. Don't waste your time.

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don´t know why I rented this movie, I really don´t. I plead momentary insanity. I saw the first Scary Movie in a theatre and I thought it was quite bad. Some of the scenes and jokes were amusing, but overall the whole "movie" was just lame. It could be funny if you watch it in a "proper" state of mind. Anyway, now I decided to watch Scary Movie 2 and I really regret it. I just wasted two and a half euros and 79 minutes on one of the worst "comedies" I have ever seen.The trailer of the movie looks promising enough, but the film itself is unbelievably horrible. It´s obvious that the movie was done very quickly because the studio wanted to capitalize on the first movie´s success. Unfortunately there´s nothing good to say about the result. Few chuckles here and there aren´t enough and this movie´s gets so low every other second that it´s just disgusting. The makers also seem to think that bad and dirty language guarantees laughs. It just isn´t so. The scariest thing about this whole disaster is that people actually put money into this! I don´t even feel sorry for the cast members, their careers deserve to die if they seriously thought that this movie was worth doing. And James Woods...What the hell has happened to good comedies? All these rude teen comedies seem to rule the business and all the good ones are overlooked. I just can´t believe it that there are people out there who liked this movie. Most likely those folks have never seen any real comedies like Airplane! or the Naked Gun which I will watch very shortly in order to forget Scary Movie 2.My advice is... AVOID SCARY MOVIE 2 AT ALL COSTS! It´s horrible, terrible, disgusting, unfunny, boring, shocking and easily one of the worst so-called comedies of all-time. I just hope the third part will be able to top the second part as it has one of the Zucker brothers at the helm and Pat Proft as one of the writers. Beating Part 2 won´t be hard, though. You simply cannot get any lower than this.&gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They said no sequel. They lied! And so we have "Scary Movie 2." Keenen Ivory Wayans and kin come back with another spoof of the horror genre. I thought this one was actually better than "Scary Movie 1," as it seemed to have less outrageous tastelessness (but not much less!). There are some laughs, some screams, and some downright absurd moments, such as with the clown doll, and Beetlejuice's cameo. Anyway, I'll still give "Scary Movie 3" a look, and hope they do better with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Our story opens at Hell House where a big party is going on. It was being held by the Voorhees family. Everything is going great, when the daughter of the family becomes posessed by the devil in an Exorcist fashion. They call upon Father Harris and Father McFeely. They try to get the devil out of her and have a green vomit spewing contest. They don't get anywhere very quick. Years later at college, the friends from the first Scary Movie, who were murdered in the movie, miraculously have returned for the sequel. There's Cindy, Ray, Shorty, Brenda and new guy, Buddy. Cindy has a crush on Buddy, but he just wants to be a jerk to her. Anyway, their professor, Professor, has chosen these guys for a project. To study insomnia he said at an assembly, which Shorty slept through. Professor and his assistant, Dwight who was in a wheelchair, set up cameras at the chosen place for the project, Hell House. They've even set up cameras in the shower for their own personal enjoyment. When Cindy arrives first, she meets the caretaker, Hanson. Hanson was a total creep-out with a deformed hand. He really made everybody lose their appetites when he served dinner. He put his hand in all the foods and basted the turkey with his tongue! The house was haunted! The ghost of the original owner, Hugh, patrolled the house nightly looking for the spirit of his long, lost mistress. The picture of her looked remarkably like Cindy, only her hair had less split-ends, her skin wasn't as oily and her breasts weren't as pointy. Anyway, a giant plant rolls Shorty and actually smokes him! The friends must band together to stop this evil. Dwight sets up a contraption to blast it into oblivion.  And that's pretty much our story. Now, I was disappointed with this film. I really liked the first Scary Movie, so I thought the sequel would be just as good. But it totally wasn't. They should've just stuck with one movie. But they're spoofing all the great horror movies, which all had sequels up the wazoo. I hear they're making a Scary Movie 3. It'll be out soon. But anyway, I strongly recommend you just see the first one. Don't even bother with this one. And there's sex jokes and crude humor up the wazoo! -</fullReview>

I still hadn't seen it, until just today (26 September 2002), I had hired out 'Scary Movie 2' (plus the 1990 thriller, 'Misery'). I sat down and started the movie. I had wasted around 82 minutes of watching a film that was just full of sex and inappropriate swearing. The best bit that I really enjoyed was the spoof of 'The Exorcist'. That was very clever! I loved that spoof plus the 'Charlie's Angels' spoof was alright too. But the rest was AWFUL!!!

		<fullReview>I loved "Scary Movie." It was so absolutely stupid it was hilarious. I still laugh whenever I see it, and I had been so looking forward to an opportunity to see this next installment. My advice to all of you: don't tarnish your memories of the first with this abysmal sequel.One accepts that by the very nature of the series as a parody the story will be stupid, the acting deliberately bad and the humour silly. That was the case with the first movie, but in the first movie it was funny; it worked. Here, it's lost its edge. That's the problem with parodies. It's hard to do them more than once and keep them funny. This reminds me a bit of the "Airplane" movies spoofing airline disasters. The first one was great, after that - why bother? Now, sometimes the parody format can work in a sequel. I'm thinking of the "Naked Gun" movies or "Austin Powers." But "Scary Movie 2" doesn't cut it as a worthy sequel. I'm not sure that I even broke a smile the entire way through. While most of the cast is back (including Anna Faris as Cindy, around whom the sequel also focuses), I have to say that I really missed the character of "Doofy" from the original, and there was no one in this cast to really fill the hole that was left. And this movie needed something to recapture the fun of the first.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perverted pedophile priests performing an exorcism, possessed pussycats, haunted houses, killer klowns, this movie takes every horror film convention and turns it on its head. In addition it manages to poke fun at stuff like girls wanting to be `friends' with a boy, then finding out what it's like when he treats her like a football buddy or frat brother. And of course this wouldn't be a Wayan bros. movie if it weren't chock full of political incorrectness; it's loaded with cripple/deformity jokes, gay jokes, drug jokes, racial jokes, (including a statue of Thomas Jefferson, complete with his black mistress and a half dozen black rugrats), even a joke involving a former president and a stained dress! Perhaps my favorite joke was when one of the girls was running away from a skeleton, and the other girl says, `What are you scared of? This is bones! Would you run away from Calista Flockheart?' To be sure, this movie isn't as good as the first one (the one whose tagline promised, among other things, `No Sequel') but for pure gross-out, turn your brain off fun, it's not bad.6/10</fullReview>

It was so funny at the dinner table when he kept sticking his "little hand" in all the food, grossing everyone out. The opening scene with James Woods was funny too. It was pretty good when Cindy gets into the fight with the black cat. And the way Brenda deals with the skeleton is a riot. I even liked it when Shorty gets smoked like a joint. That was a funny sight gag.(END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT: Better than the original. It's got a short running time, so even if you don't think it is so great, you only lost 83 minutes of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.. Although, it was to be expected. The same goes for this movie being made. The poster for Scary Movie reads "..No sequel." but it was bound to happen given it's opening gross. Even though the sequel offers the same crude humor and cringe worthy moments it doesn't make it a bad film. If you've seen the first you know what to expect, so you have the option to ignore Scary Movie 2.I found the only thing dissapointing about Scary Movie 2 was the deleted scenes on the DVD. In my opinion they were the funniest, and unfortunately, Regina Hall appears in them all. I felt her role in Scary Movie 2 was much smaller than it was in the first film and her best moments were cut. Anna Faris and Tori Spelling also had classic moments erased which would've made the film less similar to the first.Overall the movie doesn't dissapoint as long as you know what you're in for. If you think you're about to see something original you're kidding yourself. The fact that it's a sequel didn't do it any favours, but it delivers just what you'd expect.... whether you enjoy it, or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie was rubbish. Its sequel is even bad. Now the question is: will the 3rd part be worse? Is it possible to be worse than Scary Movie 2?I'm afraid THIS will be possible, because when you have Wayans directing, you don't know what to expect. Scary Movie 2 is a bunch of bad sexual jokes, trying to recreate the humor of "American Pie" or the Farrelli Bros.' style. But the whole film stinks from the beginning till the end. I must admit some gags made me laugh, but they don't compensate the big fat error "Scary Movie 2" is.Please don't rent, buy or even see this movie. You'll be doing a favour to the humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I was expecting a not that bad movie with unbelievable gross out jokes. I was right and wrong. I was right about the unbelievably sick jokes and wrong about the not that bad movie. This was awesome! Sure some jokes were just dumb and the trash-talking parrot didn't help this movie but it was still very funny. The opening part was a hysterical riot. James Woods and Andy Richter were great as the two priests in the beginning. Shawn and Marlon are really awesome in this. keenan Ivory Wayans directed a true gem.Overall the whole movie is mostly excellent with minor flaws. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Scary Movie team are back to make more fun of the horror genre. Oh good. Well it's not that bad. It's certainly an improvement on the last attempt to make us laugh.The survivors of a murder spree are tricked by a professor who is desperate for you-know-what, into staying in a house that once lived a girl who was possessed, and other mysterious things that have happened. The teens are then put up against a haunted house run by a strange care taker called Hanson.The film makes fun of supernatural horror movies this time and has some jokes that can give a giggle and most of the giggles come from Hanson(Chris Elliot), but there are other jokes that are repetitive, unoriginal and just stupid that brings the movie down again. Another problem is that the movie is far too short and maybe this was a good idea as to not to go to far but in the end it's just a movie that will put a smile to your face, if not it will gross you out. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sloppy, disorganized parody if there ever was one. In this sequel the survivors of the first film are lured to a creepy old mansion by a doctor under false pretenses. Unfortunately for them (and interested viewers) the house is really haunted by mischievous spirits who repeat all of the same crude, offensive gags that occurred in the first film. With the exception of a good opening sequence, a couple of clever parodies, and a likable cast, there isn't much reason to tune in for this one; another fast-tracked, badly written sequel that takes its audience for suckers, and tries to cash in on the success of a much better predecessor. What a shame. *?</fullReview>

Didn't the directors realise that Plot and Jokes can go hand-in-hand?Second off? I expect to laugh at a comedy. This is a comedy, so why was I not laughing?Thirdly, not even Tim Curry can raise the film out of being something better than what I've described above.Finally, avoid this movie.

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsPart of the tagline to the original Scary Movie said 'no sequel.'However,seeing how successful (and rightfully so) the original was and seeing how this type of movie usually gets some kind of follow up anyway,this has not been adhered.And,despite many bad reviews,the sequel performed just as well at the box office as the original did.This could well have been because it was released around the time of September 11,when the movie-going public needed something light hearted and funny to keep them going.But the film can actually in this reviewer's opinion succeed on its own levels.It's almost as funny as the first film,just not quite.It begins,however,with a rather unfunny and pointless Exorcist parody (what's the point,Leslie Nielsen's Repossessed had already done that.)But from here on in,the laughs,aided by the wisely short running time and Anna Faris's attractive appearance,flow thick and fast.***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great for teens, and I knew it wasn't gonna be great in terms of direction and plot, but I knew it would be funny.

When we finally rented it and watched it, we laughed many times, but the movie overall wasn't great. What I'm trying to tell the reader's is that Scary Movie 2 is a movie for teens to see, not for adults, because it is concentrating on jokes and less on the film direction and writing, which messes up the whole plot. So, I liked the movie, but wouldnt' say it was a great movie. So this movie is for teens to enjoy, but not by themselves. When watching the movie it should be in a party or with many friends, and I did watch it with my brother and my friend, that's why we enjoyed it. I'm sure my cousin would like it also. So the movie is strictly for teens, and to be watched with many people.</fullReview>

Mainly the same jokes were in this one, and with 8 writers, one would think something better would come of it. Tim Curry it totally wasted in this movie! His talent as a diverse actor cannot even surface.Tori Spelling was actually okay to watch in this. The Wayans really need to get over themselves...They aren't that funny, or atleast not anymore. Stop beating the In Living Color Dead horse, and move on. Scary Movie was Hilarious...this was a chuckle here or there.And I have seen better editing in a Low-Budget movie.

I mean, how funny was the scene where "Reagan" spins her head around and James Woods does a runner? If you can't see the humour in that, there is something definitely wrong. Sure, the movie might not be at the same level of quality that Pulp Fiction or the Godfather are at, but it is a damn fine p***-take of many films.

The pre-credit Exorcist send-up with James Woods is pretty funny, but it's all downhill from there. If you want to watch a film that also stars Marlon Wayans and is equally painful to watch, then check out Requiem for a Dream, it's a way more rewarding experience than this awful pile of crap. 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

I laughed my back off all the way through.The laughs start form the very beginning and go through to the very end. spotting the references isn't difficult, in fact having only seen the trailers for at least two of the films mocked proved background knowledge enough. There is nothing intellectual or taxing about this film. It simply mocks everything in it's path including itself from beginning to end. I would recommend this film to any member of my family including the elderly and infirm. If you love movies and haven't got your head stuck in some sad politically correct mire go and see it. Be prepared to laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the first Scary Movie on video at the beginning of this year, and I couldn't stop laughing. So naturally, when Scary Movie 2 finally came to New Zealand, I was practically lining up for it.I went on the night after it came out, and despite being only 14, I managed to get me and 2 of my friends into the R16 film - it took a while, but damn it was worth it!Undoubtedly, the first scene of the movie, a take off from the 1973 hit The Exorcist, is the funniest scene in the whole film, but I won't give too much away, and I don't think I could describe it to be as funny as it is.But anyway, the sequel reunites half of the cast from the original even though they were all killed! Anna Faris (Cindy), Shorty (Marlon Wayons), Ray (Shawn Wayons) and Brenda (Regina King) all came back to do the follow up.This time, the gang are asked to spend a weekend in a haunted house. The house is complete with ghosts, housekeepers named Hanson that have screwed up hands and pervy college professors.A Scary Movie 2 review couldn't go without mention of the Beverly Hills 90210 element. Bev Hills starlet Tori Spelling is cast as one of the gang who goes to the house and gets down and dirty with a ghost, meanwhile her 90210 co-star, Kathleen Robertson plays the g-string clad seductress of the gang, plus Christopher Kennedy Masterton (Malcolm In The Middle) plays Cindy's sort-of love interest.Still as funny, still as sick, but maybe not quite as good as the original, Scary Movie 2 rocks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think many people who walked out of the theater after seeing Scary Movie 2 were a bit disappointed. It stars some of the same actors of the first, (Shorty and Cindy) and contains the same jokes as the first. But not like the first. There were a few moments in the movie that were funny, but when it comes to the first movie...it's worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, unlike many others who have shamed the original Scary Movie like those would curse the plague, I enjoyed my one viewing of it. It was a packed theater and everyone in it had a good time, though I don't feel the need to ever see it again. However, this is horrible.  I don't ask much from spoofs. I even liked Wrongfully Accused even though it was more than apparent no one was really putting their full effort into it. However, when a spoof is not funny, it fails horribly. What's to go back on? Plot? No. Character development? No. Uh, acting? Nope.  This movie is simply not funny. Nothing in this movie is funny. Chris Elliot's character is not funny, not one of the spoofs on any movie is funny, and added to that, I didn't even get that it was a spoof on M:I 2 until the scene was almost over! The Wayans said they researched through tons of movies to make this one. All it proves is that they've wasted their time watching movies rather than actually MAKING one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks In Structure..Had Some Potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2....Boy wasn't this film made in a hurry? Its pretty obvious, just watch the movie, and you will think they did the whole film in one take. The film is VERY short....Thats what makes it feel very cheap, you would expect alot more, the original was GREAT this sequel had potential but it was far from great.The movie starts off with an Exorcist spoof...Wow.! Well done, that was a good job and left me laughing alot...After that though, many of the jokes just aren't funny or are simply irellevant. Many of the jokes fall flat some examples would be (The clown scene,Nike Ad, Weakest Link,Hannibal,The Haunting) they obviously weren't thinking, after seeing these scenes you would think to yourself "How long did this really take to make"?. The acting was mediocore, the film barely had any dialogue, and it doesent have that precious relationship from the original.....Cindy is with Buddy, thy barely communicate and they're not funny together. Tori Spelling is there for nothing..I mean who is she? And the "I LOVE DEAD PEOPLE" chick...Who is she? Sure the whole movie is a spoof, but there must be SOMTHING, the movie had no plot and it lacked in structure, it was all messed up.On the other hand there are a few jokes that were great to watch (Charlies angels,Exorcist,VITAMIN C,Guy with weird hand) they were good...Yet they dont save the film from its many downfalls. Scary Movie 2 was very sexually crude, i dont reccomend this to anyone under 15 at all....Gross Humor is good in American Pie...Gross Humor in Scary Movie 2...Well..It doesnt quite work.ACTING: The acting wasn't good at all...Acting was barely required in the whole film, it is SO short and there is barely any dialogue, and this is what furthers the gap between this and its worthy original.ACTORS: Most of the original cast is back (Even though half of them died) a few good names...Excluding Tori Spelling, i guess the casting was ok..I wasnt expecting any better.SCRIPT: Very poor, this is what made the film sink....If they spent abit more time on the script, closing pot-holes, making the movie make sense etc. etc. Infact if they re-wrote the whole thing it would have been better...Seriously, they must have written this with their eyes closed.CINEMA: Very poor, lack of locations, its like the movie was made in a few days, i wouldnt be suprised if it wasnt.The lighting was good for the Exorcist but other than that, poor Cinematography.COMEDY: Had alot of potential, didnt really reach its goal. I did expect better, sure you will laugh in the movie, but dont expect many laughs...Just a few official laughs...Not artificial laughs where you are just laughing WITH the audience even though it aint funny to you.MUSIC: Hmmm music? all i really remember is GRADUATION DAY by VITAMIN C...Oh there was "LET ME BLOW YA MIND" by EVE and Gwen Stefani, also the music during Charlies angels was ok..Not bad!OVERALL: Scary movie 2 i recommend you watch ONLY if you liked part one, and i am not promising that you will love this film, you might end up hating it.... Yet i personally think the film had lots of potential, it tried...But not hard enough.** (2 stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite finding the original Scary Movie an incredible disappointment I was dragged to see this much-of-the-same sequel.The opening 10-20 minutes are actually quite funny; there are hit-and-miss moments but generally the jokes hit the spot. I found myself laughing at both the Exorcist parodies and the cringingly disgusting "Caretaker", and was preparing myself to be pleasantly surprised. However I should have known better and the film quickly descended into the same boring junk as the original.What is so infuriating about sitting and watching a film like this is how you can watch it and KNOW in yourself: "I could write something funnier than this". 'Spoofing' is one of the easiest forms of humour yet the writers of these Scary Movie films still seem to be able to miss the spot on so many occasions. The majority of the jokes are lame and predictable and I felt embarassed being amongst fellow adults who were laughing hysterically at the most pathetic scenes. The makers have also managed to miss many obvious comedy moments which - while being predictable - would have at least added some generally amusing moments to this weak attempt at a spoof.I was also ashamed to see the amount of scenes that had been stolen from other films. I am not talking about the parts that had been spoofed but rather the bits that had been taken straight from other COMEDY movies, such as the cat attacking Cindy (remember There's Something About Mary, anybody?). And why was this film given an 18 certificate when it was clearly designed to be enjoyed by viewers in the lower-age teen bracket?I am a young adult who enjoys 'toilet-humour' comedy films, but I did not enjoy this. It just isn't funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 wasn't as good I expected. Maybe, because the script seemed a little rushed. That's not to say the movie was bad though. The film did have some very enjoyable moments. For example, The Exorcist scene with the brilliant Natasha Lyonne and James Wood was quite funny and the cast in the film, including: Tori Spelling, (Who was great here and who fell in love with a ghost.) Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, James DeBello and Chris Elliott (Let's just say his hand....) did a good job here, of spoofing the movies, such as, Hannibal, House on the haunted hill, The Haunting, What Lies Beneath, Charlie's Angels and even Dude, where's my car. The scene where Cindy (Anna Faris.) is singing to the Graduation Song (Friends Forever.) by Vitamin C (Colleen Fitzpatrick.) and then Vitamin C interrupts Cindy by telling her to shut up and let her sing, was funny too. The film obviously had it's gross out moments, some were funny, some were not. Still, if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy this good sequel. I give Scary Movie 2, a 7-8/10.</fullReview>

You will be in stitches at the outrageous characters and impossible situations, from the first shot on. This baby pokes a finger in every star-studded eye you care to mention.

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Amateur Hour!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memo to the Wayans Brothers: That scraping sound you're hearing? It's the bottom of the barrel. Actually, I'm sure you've been hearing that sound for a year now, so it's time to give it up.I'm not convinced that the Wayans Brothers have truly understood parody since the fleetingly amusing "Don't Be a Menace..." A good first rule of parody, you see, is that you shouldn't parody something that was already a parody to begin with. The original Scary Movie broke that rule, mocking the already self-referential Scream movies. And the people loved Scary Movie and for despite being as memorable as glass of water, it still had its moments. A good second rule for parody is not to mock things that were already horrible, trashy bombs to begin with. Well, Scary Movie 2 is a mock-up of the "recent" slate of "haunted house" movies. But nobody liked House of Haunted Hill or The Haunting. They were just bad movies. But in this distinctly sorry sequel, the Wayans Brothers manage to make the awful even worse. There aren't more than half a dozen chuckles in the movie and with the failed jokes coming pell-mell, this movie becomes painful to sit through.The movie opens with a brief play on The Exorcist with James Woods in the Max von Sydow role. Marlon Brando was originally going to play the part. But Woods is fine. Certainly better than anything else in the movie. But that scene is over quickly. It's a year after the first Scary Movie and Shorty (Marlon Wayans), Ray (Shawn Wayans), and Cindy (Anna Faris) are in college. There's a joke at the expense of Save the Last Dance that isn't so bad. But then the movie quickly goes into its "plot." A psychology professor (Tim Curry) has assembled a group of students to go to a haunted house for some kind of study. The house has a knocker shaped like huge testicles. It isn't funny. And neither is anything inside the house.Once everybody is assembled we meet the two disabled characters that the movie will laugh at for the next hour. Chris Elliot plays Hanson, a caretaker with a stupid accent and one baby hand. And David Cross (of Mr. Show) plays Curry's double jointed assistant. Neither character is funny, but they're both plenty annoying. Rounding out the cast we have 90210 alums Tori Spelling and Kathleen Robertson. Neither has any background and their links to the main plot and the characters from the first movie are tenuous. They're just there. As is Christopher Masterson, always reliable on Malcolm in the Middle, totally stranded by awful writing here. Night Court's Richard Moll appears briefly as the least scary, least funny, least interesting villain in the history of cinema (why'd they even bother?).The characters run around in circles and they make jokes that aren't funny to begin with and get even worse with repetition. A pea soup barfing contest in The Exorcist scene is only worth a chuckle at first and then after it's gone on for a minute it's just mind-boggling. Or a trash-talking parrot. I guess it's funny the first couple times, but by the time it does a "Weakest Link" joke, you realize that it's just past its expiration date. There's an amusing take on Hannibal. The Charlie's Angels joke is good for another chuckle. And... I'm trying to think of other positive moments. But it's just too tough.The film is badly directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, but the editing might be its most embarrassing technical feature. What can you say about a movie that runs 82 minutes and still feels like it's laden with too many pregnant pauses. The movie could have been much tighter. That wouldn't have made any of the jokes funnier, but it would have cut ten minutes off the mess.The other alternative is that the three editors were just working with what the actors gave them and they couldn't find any takes that were better. Every performance is awkward and the movie feels badly improvised. You watch the actors and you can see them waiting for their next lines of dialogue or for the next not-amusing prop to come into play. The best of the acting is grating (Elliot and Cross), but Masterson, Spelling, both Wayans Brothers, Faris, and Regina Hall are frequently shockingly bad. I let Curry and Robertson off the hook because he is totally wasted, while she was always my favorite 90210 girl and I firmly believe that given the right material, she could probably act.When I saw the movie, nobody laughed. Sure, there were titters for the first fifteen minutes -- anticipatory good humor, if you will. But the main body of the movie, the haunted house scenes, played to total silence. Nobody seemed grossed out. Nobody seemed offended. And certainly nobody seemed amused. Should have kept that "No Sequels" promise, boys. This one's a 1/10 bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No More Plot. No More Jokes. We Can't Think Of Our Own Ideas ? Honest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of last years Scary Movie it was inevitable that the sequel wouldn't be far behind. So if a spoof is supposed to signal the end of a genre, then what does the sequel of a spoof of a spoof indicate?On the basis of this, the only thing it can possibly mean is that Hollywood movies can't get much worse. Labelled with the tagline ?No More Mercy. No More Shame. No More Sequels - Honest! - We lied', we begin with an Exorcist style errr? Exorcism as James Woods aims to ward the demons away from a possessed youngster. Starting as they mean to continue, the Wayan brothers set us up with much green vomit and rip off plotlines.After our foul opening, we move to some generic college where the professor (Tim Curry) tricks his students into visiting a haunted house for a school project. From there the plot is quite difficult to follow, not because of it complexities, simply because there doesn't seem to be one.There are few words to describe quite how bad this film is. One nonsensical, unfunny, bodily fluid scene leads directly into the next nonsensical, unfunny, bodily fluid scene. The only possible reason for wanting to see this would be to try and spot the scenes from other movies. Even then, the ?spoof' scenes have been done far better before as the Wayan brother writers, actors and director seem to get away with mass plagarism involving everything from Hannibal to Titanic to Crouching Tiger.You might have thought that things couldn't get much worse after perennial teen loser Tori Spelling pops up, but at least she gets a chandelier dropped on her (something she's been asking for ever since season one of 90210).A more ample tagline would've been ?No More Plot. No More Jokes. We Can't Think Of Our Own Ideas ? Honest!' Scary Movie 2 is quite frankly the worst film released this year; if word of mouth carried the first one then we can only hope that word of mouth will bury this and hopefully the dreadful Wayan brothers with it.1/10</fullReview>

You can tell that they cranked this movie out in a year and didn't put much thought into anything except trying to make a quick buck. If you're going to make fun of movies, at least make fun of semi-good ones. But they made fun of the likes of Hollow Man, the Haunting, and the dismal Save the last Dance, threw in some Weakest Link and a basketball commercial. None of it was funny. The casting was horrible. I don't have a whole lot against Tori Spelling, but why was she even in the movie. She did nothing. Well, most of the cast is wasted here. The Wayans can, and have been much funnier. Tim Curry didn't belong. Chris Elliot is usually much better and more effective, but he just wasn't. David Cross is one of the funniest people I have seen, and his comic prowess is wasted in this movie. Just avoid Scary Movie 2. Go see a decent movie for a change. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

There also any many sexual jokes, anti -gay jokes etc, This movie should of been rated NC-17 and never made. I noticed the movie was good at the beginning when it spoofed the "The Exorist". After that spoof it all falls downhill as it spoofs "Hollow Man", "What Lies Beneath" and the storyline of the 1999 remake of "The Haunting". This movie should be avoided at all costs! It stinks and is pure trash! Avoid at all costs if you can! If this what kind of humor Hollywood today likes toilet bowl humor, then I might as well forget seeing today's comedies. I wonder if "American Pie 2" will be as bad as this sequel?This movie left a bad taste in my mouth and to think I helped with it box office!Shame on you Disney for making this trash!!

For 1, they had also said "No Sequels (sp)" perhaps they should have just stuck to the damn idea. I don't know what kind of a dull life the writer of this movie must've lead. As many others have pointed out, the scenes that come even CLOSE to "funny" are already shown in the ads, so if you have seen the ad, its as good as having seen the good parts of the movie (i.e. ones where you wont want to strangle yourself.. cuz for the rest of the movie you will). The plot centers around.. well nothing. This is no plot, just a bunch of really gross scenes that seemed to be shoved in there just to draw cheap laughs from audience who don't know the difference between humor and stupidity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a step down from part 1. I didn't totally enjoy that first installment, but it only just barely missed being on my DVD "to buy" list. I knew about 15 minutes into to this one that there was NO WAY I'd have to consider whether or not to add this to my collection. Aside from the fact that it's not as funny, the direction and editing are atrocious. Angles where the actor is nearly out of the frame or shots that last literally half a second. Wayans has directed a number of movies, so who knows why he dropped the ball here and made this look like a student film. But, of course, above all else, you have to focus on the lack of laughs. The targets this time around were either too old ("Poltergeist" was damn near 20 years ago people!) or too unknown (did more than 10 people actually see that crapfest, "The Haunting"?). Then when they stray away from horror all they do is copy something instead of parodying it. The "squeaky cleets" basketball commercial is basically just re-shot, and the "Charlie Angels" stuff looks like that movie's scenes. Or they just throw in confusing and out-of-place moments like the idiotic wheelchair battle (what the hell was that supposed to be anyway??). Only three cast members return, like poor Anna Faris, a cute and talented actress, who is reduced to bugging her eyes and dropping her mouth every other scene. The unfortunate young girl appears to be trying hard, given the junk script she's working with. And when they can't come up with witty lines for her, they reduce her to getting put downs, or touches, upon her breasts, as well as masturbating a guy till he bombards her with gallons of sperm. Yep, that's right! They even resort to ripping THEMSELVES off here! Everyone else is reduced to swearing (even a trash-mouthed parrot), or is just wasted, like cult fave Curry. This whole thing smells of "rushed into production" as over 10(!!!) writers couldn't come up with more than 2 or 3 good jokes. The opening 10 minutes featuring James Woods in an "Exorcist" spoof actually provide a bulk of the film's big laughs, but don't seem connected to this movie, seeing how awful the rest of it is. And even they ripped off THAT too! An "Exorcist" parody was done over 10 years ago in a film called "Repossessed". Just one last sign that this belongs in the crapper of the year's worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie got me into liking the Wayans brother, but Scary Movie 2 is definitely better than the first. If you saw this movie the first day it came out at 2:40 P.M. up in Fairfax, Virginia then you'd agree with me because everyone that was in the theatre was laughing their butts off during the movie, including me. Heck, the first ten minutes kept me laughing although I'm not much on preachers swearing and not living the Christian life (I'm a very spiritual person), I don't even care if they try to do it just to make an audience laugh, but other than that, hey, the movie was excellent. I may sound this way, because I'm easily amused, but I really loved this movie. Not only do they make fun of movies, but also the Presidential Election recount and Firestone tires and I believe they had every right to. If Al Gore hadn'tve been such a winey-baby, there would be no need for this, but he was, and Scary Movie 2 made fun of it. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes the Wayans brothers and likes comedy. Trust me, you'll get your money's worth on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Send Hollywood the right message: Do not pay to see this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a bushel of peaches left in the sun, Scary Movie 2 quickly breaks down into a stale, discolored, and distasteful piece of film garbage. Unfortunately for those who were lured into seeing this film do to a lack of quality movie alternatives, Scary Movie offers no reprieve from what can only be described as a lackluster summer. It pains me to learn that a movie of this poor a caliber has made over $52 million and that somewhere in that total my $7.50 has been included. A box office take that large will only encourage more ill-conceived sequels. And dare I say it...a second sequel to Scary Movie! I can only hope that will not come to fruition and if it is made people will not see it. And that is why I took the time to submit this comment: Out of hope that people will read this review and others like it and choose to not give their $7.50 to those responsible for this completely awful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was a hoot, my husband and I couldn't stop laughing! Although the ideas weren't entirely original, I feel that the jokes in the movie were hilarious, I mean, who can go wrong with a cast of some very unlikely people doing very unlikely things and making total asses of themselves. I bet the Wayans will be laughing all the way to the bank on this one. Definitely a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst movie I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first Scary Movie. It was clever, funny and just the right amount of gross out humor and gore. In a mediocre year for film (2000) Scary Movie 1 was on of the unexpected highlights and a worthy success.This sequel ranks legions below the worst movie you can think of. Battlefield Earth? The equivilant of The Godfather when compared to this. CHUD 2? Equal to American Beauty. Never have I been so disgusted with myself as after watching a film, if this can be classified as such. There are 2 funny jokes within the first 3 minutes, and the rest of the film is uninspired, unfunny and just plain awful. I warn you all...avoid this film like the plague. Its that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had it all. None of the jokes were bad and the movie had no boring points. If I were to compare this movie to the first there is no contest. Since, I'd seen all the movies they made fun of, (ex: The Haunting, Poltergeist, The Excorscist ec.) got all the jokes making the movie more enjoyable. Even if you have not seen them there definitely be parts where you'll laugh like the Charlie's Angels sequence. The ending left me wanting to see another one. I give it a 10.

		<fullReview>They Wayans Brothers owe me $16.05! That's $7.00 each for two tickets and $2.05 for the popcorn I was forced to fling at the screen. It would appear that the only reason they made a sequel, aside from lots of cash from a slow-witted studio, was to include whatever lame jokes might have been left out of the first one. I spent the first hour telling myself that, at least, the last half would be funny. Little did I know that the "last half" was fifteen minutes long and, no, it only got more inane. I should have known we were in trouble when the opening gag --- no pun intended ---ripped off "The Exorcist", quite possible the most-spoofed-to-death movie ever. This turkey would have been funnier if they had slapped the credits on "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" and played that instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I was not going in with a lot of expectations. As some of the other reviewers so far, I was disappointed. Too much appeal to the least common denominator. Actually, I did approve and enjoyed, especially since over half the audience laughed, the very early joke about the priest teasing a child with candy. However, that joke and the few others were not worth the matinee price I paid for it. It was the worst of the 83 films I have seen this year on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes the first one seem passable by comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll first admit that I absolutely hated the first "Scary Movie," I thought it was just plain gross and not funny at all, with the exception of a couple of moments. So with the first film in mind I went in with very low expectations for "Scary Movie 2" and well, let's just say they weren't met. For reasons never explained, (probably because that meant the Wayans brother might have to come up with an actual story) some of the cast members are back in the sequel, whether they died or not is obviously not a problem. Instead of spoofing horror movies, like in the first one, the sequel spoofs many horror flicks, among them are "Hollow Man" and "The Haunting," but for what seems to be no reason, the Nike commercials, "Save The Last Dance" and "Charlie's Angels." But unlike the first film, in which the scenes at least seemed to go together, many scenes seem to be just poorly shot and put together in a sloppy package that was quickly rushed to theaters so it could make a lot of money like the first one did. Like I said before I didn't care at all for the first one, but this sequel is just plain terrible. I give it -** out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were skeptical about seeing this movie, because you thought the first one was gross. Then you should see this one. It wasn't half as gross. It did have one scene that involved a bodily fluid like the first. Other than that nothing was really that nasty. I found this movie way better than the first. I couldn't stop laughing, and I rarely laugh hard at movies. I could tell everyone in the theater liked it, too! I suggest you should see this movie over the horrible comedies that are out. It was refreshing to see a movie that I was dying to see live up to my expectations and then some, especially since I've had a lot of disappointments this summer w/ movies( Pearl Harbor, Swordfish,Evolution and tomb raider)go see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should've known better! What was I thinking? If the first Scary Movie was completely, disgustingly, sickeningly, undeniably raunchy, what made me think that the sequel would be any different, if not worse? Oh, yeah, if you're a person that has seen Scary Movie 1, but not 2 and think that it could not possibly be any worse than the original, think again. This is definitely not a movie to bring your mother to, much less yourself. Unfortunately, aside from all the racial puns which I found were the only humorous things in the entire movie, I regret the entire 90 minutes of torture that I reluctantly sat through. I could have spent that seven bucks on a Tom Jones Greatest Hits album and had more excitement! Anyway, to all the people who still feel like seeing this flick, don't forget your Pepto Bismol and a couple of paper bags.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a horrible, jumbled, UNFUNNY mess of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big question for the second installment, of Scary Movie, which, I might add, part one- I loved...how long did it take them to write this? A half hour? If it took longer than that, I was fooled. It is amazing how horrible a comedy can be, and I think this one might just take the award for the worst ever. Unlike part 1, there was no coherent story. Granted, the plot in part one wasn't totally solid, but in part 2- it wasn't there at all. It seemed more like a series of skits that made no sense together, and none of them were funny at that. The same old jokes used in the same exact way. Some of the jokes in this movie were IDENTICAL to the jokes in part one...the "sex" scene being one of those. Same fire hose like spray of liquid knocking the very annoying Faris down. That's another thing...if that girl wasn't annoying in the first, in this one- she is so annoying you just want someone to strangle her to get her out of the movie. I am very disappointed in the writers and everyone involved in making the film, because it seems like they thought they had to automatically make a part 2 to make some more cash, and they clearly thought it had to be made, edited, and released within a few days...that's what it looks like. This is a horrible mess that has maybe 2 funny jokes, and the rest is just gross out humor...unlike the first, this gross out humor is not funny, just gross. Miss this one at all costs. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just recently saw many reviews which give Scary Movie 2 bad reviews, but I disagree after just seeing it in fact Scary Movie 2 is just as good as the original. The parody and slapstick is once again found just like in the original which was a parody extravaganza, only Scary Movie 2 is funnier with more sexy and odd moments. Scary Movie 2 does parody not only in the form of horror films, but action films are used as parody which makes great slapstick. Many say Scary Movie 2 went to far as many said the parody scenes are to gross, but I found this film very sexy even more than the first. Just to mention sexy how about Anna Faris she also stared in the first Scary Movie now keep an eye on this cute female in years to come people will see her in film after film. Kathleen Robertson gave a very sexy performance I was once again glad to see her getting some work I'm sure the sexy Kathleen will be seen again. Scary Movie 2 is a great funny movie to go out and see, people had better be glad to have films made like these because they are so much fun to watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The young actress Anna Faris, pale, moon-faced, with crisp blueeyes that recall the "Oh, me!" shock of clean ingenues back to FayWray, is a lovable child who's full of promise. I am getting thefeeling that the Wayans kids have something against whitewomen, because in this sequel--even more so than in theoriginal--Faris is a punching bag for more abuse and humiliationthan a vivisected supermodel in a Dario Argento splatterfest. (If youthink I'm exaggerating and have a sagging sense of humor, justrecall that Keenan Ivory Wayans cuts to a CLOSEUP of asteaming, hissing bowel movement made by Faris...revealed toher "comic" sorrow and shame.) Lazily thrown together in the wake of SCARY MOVIE's monstersuccess, 2 has none of the original's visual slickness or relativeaccuracy of gag-hurling (there, the ratio was about 1 in 2; here,more like 1 in 10). There are a few huge, convulsive laughs, butmost of the movie consists of gag-inducing grossout oneupmanship. Potty humor was once liberating--a protestagainst the decorum of "clean" comedy. Now it just seems puerile--and it really does (as with Chris Elliott's shtik with a witheredhand) make me gag. It's as if filmmakers now, challenged by thenear-impossibility of making a truly riotous comedy, want to get areaction out of us by any means necessary. When that meansChris Elliott inserting snot into mashed potatoes, it's time to stop.</fullReview>

Well, in this case they did.In this movie, Cindy, Ray, Shorty and Brenda from the first film along with some new characters get involved to research an old house that they believe to be haunted. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that it is. Everything that follows is goofy(obviously).I found this movie to be simply delightful. Sure the cat fight and the cursing parrot were annoying and retarded as hell, but lots of other funny stuff and a funny cast make up for it's flaws. I particularly found the Charlie's Angels spoof to be funny, unlike the Matrix spoof in the original. The Wayans brothers, as usual, were funny. I also liked David Cross' character. Funny and enjoyable. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most sequels, "Scary Movie 2" was not as funny and raunchy as the first instalment, but nonetheless, it was still absolutely hilarious. At one point, I laughed so hard that my eyes watered.It's a bit loopy that nearly the whole gang came back to this movie, especially since the majority of them died during the first movie. This is just their way of making fun of movies that lack continuity.Overall, it was a great movie (a "10"), just not as good as the first. It was definitely better than any other movie out recently.If you enjoy movies that portray unrealistic circumstances and (extreme) humour (i.e., the Naked Gun, Hot Shots, Airplane, etc. movies), then this one is for you. If you are wanting to see a drama with character development, then look elsewhere.For those of you who are concerned, there's more than enough pea-soup vomit for everyone!

		<fullReview>How to describe the train wreck of a film that is "Scary Movie 2"? Well, at the screening I attended, laughs were about as far and in-between as a showing of "Requiem for a Dream." The fact that the filmmakers this time out decided to concentrate on the plot instead of the comedy speaks volumes on this sequel's wrong-headedness. No one goes to this kind of movie looking for a coherent storyline, as is evidenced by the first film's blockbuster grosses. And as a fan of the first film, I can say that "Scary Movie 2" fails on every level. It's not humorous, engaging, or even remotely watchable. The desire to flee the theater struck me more times that I can even count, and yet I stayed, hoping for some salvagable, hilarious set piece. No such luck. This 4th of July weekend, or any other weekend for that matter, do yourself a favor, save your 8 bucks, and stay the hell away. Only a masochist could enjoy this bomb. And why was Anna Faris's voice so strangely high-pitched this time out?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever seen a film so bad, so bland, so boring that you wish a hitman would creep into the theater and shoot you? SCARY MOVIE 2 is just such a film! It is hard to believe it took 7 writers to come up with this "script". It seems like they just wrote an outline, went to the set, and then tried to figure out what to pad out the running time with. The best scenes in this film would be the horrid outtake footage from any other comedy. From the dead silence in the theater, you'd think they were watching Platoon! Dirty jokes can be funny but they must be good natured with a wink to the crowd. Shame on everyone involved in this, especially Keenan Ivory Wayans! How could you punish fans of the original with this humorless, dreadful mess? Since you sold out and took the quick buck, could you please send me $8.50 of it with an apology note? Avoid this crap at all costs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of laughs, but pleeeeeease get your minds out of the gutter!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching "Scary Movie" I never thought there would be a filthier R-rated movie ever!! But then the sequel came along and...for all those parents who covered their kids eyes during the original, make sure you keep a thick blindfold in handy if you're planning to take the young ones to this filth-fest!I'm gonna give this movie a mild recommendation, because I did laugh a lot. The first half is hilarious! The opening, I think, is the funniest moment. I don't want to give it away, so I'll just say it's an interesting rendition of the song "Shake That A**." Of course, this is your only chance to see veteran actor James Woods taking an on-screen dump. Who can resist that? Can you believe Marlon Brando actually considered that role initially? It's just refreshing to see a big-time, serious actor humiliate himself like that! So for that: Thank you Keenan, Shawn and Marlon. The film's second half is not as successful, and pretty much sinks to a hit-or-miss level. As I said, Shawn and Marlon (and the many co-writers of the script) didn't once get their minds out of the gutter. So the dirty jokes do get tiresome after a while. Chris Elliot has an obnoxious role as a creepy butler with an underdeveloped hand. He has a few disgusting (not funny) scenes, especially one at the dinner table, that simply made me groan. I don't know what the hell the Wayans found funny about the character when thinking him up. There are some sharp, smartly written scenes that spoof pop culture, just like the original's attempt at spoofing the "Whazzzzuppp!" guys. There's an interesting and wildly funny scene where they spoof a sneaker commercial (I think that's what it is, I can't remember exactly what the commercial was for) where the characters bounce a basketball to a certain rythm, including the guy in the wheelchair. There's also a fine tribute to "Gone in 60 Seconds" and another one to "Charlie's Angels" (Don't you love it when they spoof movies you totally hate?).I think the main actress (Anna Faris), who was also in the original, has totally awful timing and most of her comedic scenes just come off as bad acting. Then again, the timing in this movie isn't exactly priceless. You can usually tell when the next punchline is coming. You don't always know exactly what the joke is, but you sometimes have a good idea (any opportunity to journey into the scatological).My beef with this movie is pretty much the beef I have with a lot of the recent comedies. First of all, most of our recent comedies are aimed towards young people. And comedy writers assume young people will laugh at ANYTHING that deals with sex or bodily functions. The problem is: they're usually right! There are many young audiences (with the exception of me) who crave anything tasteless and crude, no matter how cheap and mindless the joke happens to be. Even dirty jokes should require a certain degree of intelligence. One good example is the Tori Spelling ghost/b**w-job scene. I can't go into detail about the gag without the IMDB staff kicking me out, but the joke was hilarious and original. There was a certain amount of brains behind the comedy, in that instance. "American Pie" is another good example. There are some great, though crude and scatological, gags in that movie. The reason why they worked was because there was intelligence behind the comedy. Let's not forget, even comedy is an art. With "Scary Movie 2" and other past movies like "The Animal" and "The Ladies Man" the writers tend to write things that are dirty, just because they're...dirty. I know there are tons of young people without a brain, who can't handle humor that doesn't journey into that territory, but does that mean you should cater to them and lower all comic standards? You'd think in 2001 writers and directors would've advanced, and learned to write things that are MORE effective comically, rather than slack off and write a comedy/softcore porno flick. But it's the exact opposite. And some of the best comics are still people like Abbott and Costello, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy. They're timeless classics. No matter what age you are, you can crack up watching those old-time comics. There are some great contemporary greats at comedy, but as a general comedians and comedy writers are becoming more and more lazy by the minute.Sorry to be preachy, but it's true. I'm not totally badmouthing "Scary Movie 2" and still feel it's a very funny comedy. I just wish there was more variety in the movie biz. Give us more adult comedies! And if you can't do that, write a teen comedy with SOME sense of maturity and intelligence! If the teens boo and complain you're not giving them what they want--screw them! It IS possible to be funny without being disgusting. I can just hear the comedy writers going, "Really?" Yes, it's true. Get to work!My score: 7 (out of 10), but for the Wayans--try to be a bit more tasteful next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All right movie, but NOWHERE near as funny as the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 basically takes the formula that worked for Scary Movie and exploits the hell out of it. The dialogue and story, although funny at times, does nothing except try to recreate the original. This movie is more of a raunchfest than a spoof. All the situations that made the first movie click with audiences (i.e. sex, drug use, handicapped people, racial issues) are reproduced here, but just not nearly as funny. Anna Faris plays well in this movie, but it would be nice to see her branch out into a project that doesn't involve the Wayans', and give her a chance to showcase her talent away from the genre of gross-out comedy. I give the Wayans' credit for making the attempt, but I can't help but feel that this movie was rushed in production to ride the coattails of the original film's success. Unfortunately, that production rush left little place for funny jokes and laughable situations, and only made room for mediocre screenwriting that was pounded out without thinking about whether it would be funny or not. A big fan of the first movie will somewhat enjoy themselves here, while a mild movie-goer will probably wonder what happened to their 8 bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the Wayans Brothers have done it again. Scary Movie 2 blends right in with its predecessor. The new incarnation, while keeping the same sort of gross-out humor, remains fresh and interesting through its entirety. However much though that Scary Movie 2 is a comedy, it's a twice as good parody. Instead of attacking the slash movie genre however, Scary Movie 2 goes for the heart of horror movies such as, The Haunting, House on Haunted Hill, and The Exorcist. The Exorcist provides one of the best parodies in the film's opening segment. While Scary Movie 2 isn't the best movie to see for cinematography or art direction (see A.I.), it does however provide a good laugh for teenagers and teenagers at heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a spoof of haunted house movies. I think it is the best in the series. But however, there are a lot of great deleted scenes which should be keptin the movie. Such as: "Alex Breaks Up" Cindy runs into alex, and she tells this hilarious story about her boyfriend. "Kids in the hallway" Cindy and Ray run into each other for the first time since Ray and Bobby had tried to kill her in Scary movie 1. "The House comes alive" Probably the funniest one, in which Brenda becomes "posessed" "Stuck in the tub" The ghost scares Cindy, and Dwight and buddy put her in the tub, and then runs the water, what she does to save herself is very funny. "Do you remember that time?" After the chandelier crushes Alex, Theo comes to help her, and Alex tells these stories of what they used to do and how they were really close friends, when they've only known each other since they came to Hell House. "Saying Grace" Alex decides to bless the food, and what she says is funny. I can see why this one was deleted though. "Very Spiritual" It just adds a bit more to the part at the beginning where cindy brenda and alex are walking along Campus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen 4 yet but this is the worst so far - still has some really funny moments, but the gags vary in quality, and a lot of the scenes don't seem to have had a lot of thought put into them. Anna Faris is outstanding - how can one person simultaneously look so gorgeous, and make me laugh so much?! Her mad cow impression is brilliantly, hysterically funny, and her pussy fight another highlight.The scenes at the beginning are amongst the best, but unfortunately that quality isn't maintained throughout. Natasha Lyonne is a real talent and the film would've benefited from seeing a lot more of her. Chris Elliott is a capable actor but his performance here really didn't work for me. Regina Hall has done sterling work alongside Faris in all the Scaries.A bit of a mixed bag. Crude, gross, poorly executed, or plain unfunny carry-on style gags, mixed with moments of sheer genius. This is one that surely wouldn't have worked without Anna, but with her it just about makes the grade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie was a great movie when it came out, so naturally many people were excited with the news of a sequel...Even though the first movie promised there wouldn't be any. Most of the main characters from the first film and a few new ones must spend the weekend in a haunted mansion for a school assignment. The main films spoofed this time around are The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill.Scary Movie was so funny because it pushed the envelope. It was stuff you've never seen in a movie before. Now, in Scary Movie 2 it's old news. There is far too much toilet humour in this movie and it just gets redundant after a while. Of course I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me laugh. It did. The only problem was that it reused many of the same jokes from the first one. That, and it was too short. Everything happens to quickly, and it makes the plot seem sloppy. It's just not as good as the first all around.5/10</fullReview>

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen let alone one of the worst of the year. To be fair, there are a few chuckles and those mainly involve David Cross and Chris Elliot, otherwise--forget it. Pointless 'parodies' abound, and many don't have any reference to scary movies. The script must have consisted of walking on the set each day and one of the Wayans' boys saying "hey, this will be funny, let's throw it in." If you're looking for good parody or satire stick with Spinal Tap or Wag the Dog or Best in Show or even Scream. The only thing scary about this movie is that it was actually released. If I had seen this in the theatre I guarantee it would have been the first movie I ever walked out on.</fullReview>

From there on we get a series of sketches based on various horror films, but none of them up to the same standard - in most cases much poorer in entertainment value than the original.

I had a good time during it, but it wasn't until I got home that realized it wasn't very good. I though the references to other films were really funny, but I was sitting in an audience predominantly filled with people who knew nothing about the films being spoofed and just laughed when Marlon Wayans said something in a high voice. It spoofed films like Hannibal, What Lies Beneath, Hollow Man, but I and a few friends of mine were the only ones who found them funny. It reminded me of the ending to the film's predecessor, Scary Movie, that ended with a spoof on Usual Suspects that was hilarious. Scary Movie 1 is much better, but Scary Movie 2 is funny because of David Cross and Chris Elliot. I love the shriveled hand gag. If you are not looking to think for (It felt like the movie was about an hour long) however long the movie was, then go see it. It has a few laughs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As part of an experiment into the existence of an afterlife, Professor Oldham brings a collection of teenage massacre survivors to an old house on a hill where a year earlier there was supposedly a violent exorcism. The group get together at the house and sit for a meal ? but the work of housekeeper Hanson puts them off a bit and sees them all go off for an early night. During the night the presence of a supernatural presence is evident and is gradually getting more violent. With Oldham's assistant pleading with him to end the experiment early, the others start to twig that their lives might just be in danger.Some how or other this series has now reached four parts and, although I'll acknowledge that part 3 was an improvement on the first film, the second one is just as crude and stupid as the first. Sadly this really put me off and I honestly felt like giving up having watched a poo joke followed by loads of fake vomit in the first, very obvious, five minutes. Sadly this is followed by loads of very obvious spoofs very loosely held together in the "haunted house" plot but mostly it is loads of penis and sperm jokes that were not funny and were actually pretty unpleasant to watch ? not something I wanted from a supposed comedy. It gets no better and I can't remember laughing once, it relies far too much on gross-out stuff that I just found puerile and painful ? but I suppose that if you like that sort of then this will do the joke ? I don't and this didn't.The cast match the material by being sick and childish. For many of them I can understand why they are happy to work at this level but I can only assume that James Woods got a massive wodge of cash in exchange for demeaning himself in the opening scene. Faris is weak and the Wayans brothers are uninspiring and obvious. Hall and Robertson are both sexy but this is all they are used for. Elliott is gross and not funny while Curry turns in a very simple lecherous performance. Nobody is able to lift the material and everyone just swims (literally) in all the bodily fluid gags.Overall a dreary and crude film that I didn't find funny once. Maybe I'm getting older but I didn't even find it offensive ? just puerile. The cast can't do anything to make it better and generally the whole thing falls down thanks to the low aims of the Wayans brothers as writers and director; they are happy with the lowest common denominator and they aim right for it.</fullReview>

Part two was released only a good 10 months after the original and this clearly resulted in a hack job that never should have come out. Apart from a bearable intro, in which a deranged James Woods performs a wacky exorcism, "Scary Movie 2" is nothing but a dreadful series of unfunny jokes, exaggerated graphics and gags that show no insight in the wonderful genre of horror. The complete cast returns and a few fresh ones are introduced (like the sexy Kathleen Robertson and the tasteless Tori Spelling) for spending a couple of nights in an ancient mansion where spirits dwell, cats become kick-boxers and the indoor plants smoke pot. Tim Curry, once the star of cult-classics, lowers himself to playing the horny college professor. This film is vulgar, tasteless and very offensive?yet, I couldn't care less about that!

		<fullReview>How would you define 'film'? If you define it as something that's filmed and put together, I suppose that you could claim that this falls under that definition, but if you define it as something that has structure, continuity and meaning, then this isn't a film. It's just a bunch of gags and scenes(badly) cut together. Every single character that you hated in the first, and was glad to see die, has returned, including a few new cliché characters to hate. The film is entirely carried by stereotypes, and tries continually to make you laugh at stuff that anyone with just a tiny amount of moral wouldn't laugh at if his or her life depended on it. Stuff like homosexuality, the physically and/or mentally disabled, junkies, etc. The list goes on, but I really don't feel like typing it all here. The gags and jokes are powerfully unfunny. I think I smirked once during the film, and that's it. The humor obviously tries to offend, and it certainly succeeds; they just forgot to make it funny, in the process of thinking up stuff that will make plenty of people find the film disgusting(what's wrong with the Wayans', anyway?). The humor consists entirely of tired clichés, worn-out stereotypes, gross-out comedy, and bad spoof sequences. Throughout the entire run-time(which is less than 90 minutes, what's wrong Wayans', did you run out of material?), there was only one single gag that was mildly amusing; a spoof of the Nike commercial that was on TV back in '01, which of course doesn't seem funny now, when they're not sending that commercial. Pretty much all of the movie spoofs in the film don't work, they mostly seem forced, and very weak. I guess you could basically sum up my opinion of this "film" by quoting the very words my father said when he saw the first few minutes of the first Scary Movie; "All that sex and violence... what's the point? Really, it's not even funny, it's just offensive and disgusting." I don't really recommend this to anybody, except, of course, if there actually exists anyone who are *that* big fans of the Wayans brothers, that they actually could sit through this badly edited and terribly unfunny mess. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 was a movie made just for cash, with very little laughs. The script could have been written in half an hour, with very little effort. The movie had a promising opening, a parody of "The Excorcist" where the priest and the possessed little girl have a vomiting fight. I laughed so hard I nearly cried. Surely this was going to be one hilarious movie. Alas, the answer to that was no. The plot moved on to present day (which was a year later) to see the survivors of the previous film now in college and getting on with their lives. But then they are invited to a creepy haunted house for a school project, and they stupidly accept the offer. Once they arrive they meet a creepy caretaker with a deformed hand. They are unaware that they are being spied on by Professor Oldman and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight .The first night they sleep in the old house the creepy hauntings begin (only a few make you laugh, most make you feel sick) and from then on its parodies of all haunted house films like "The Haunting", "House on Haunted Hill", and "The Others".Most of the spoofs were just gross and unfunny. Sure it had a couple of funny scenes that make you laugh no matter how hard you try not to, which included a wheelchair race and a hilarious spoof of the Evil Clown from "Poltergeist", but there were just too many unfunny jokes.This movie is definitely the weakest in the series, and at times is just painful to watch. If you want a few guaranteed good, cheap laughs I suggest you give this one a miss and watch Scary Movie 1, 3, or 4.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the first Scary Movie came out, I thought it looked really funny in the trailers but put off seeing it because I read it was so horrible. Then I saw it and thought it was hysterical. When Scary Movie 2 came out I was going to go but read all these comments that it was just so bad, the first one was much better, blah blah blah, so I only saw it now. And you know what, it was hysterical. It is more tasteless and lowbrow than the first one, and it felt a little sloppier, but it's still really, really funny. I would see I'll go see the sequel regardless of what anyone says, but Wayans isn't doing the sequel so now I'm not sure. But the first two are great, no matter what anyone else says.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely ignoring the first film, this trash takes a step backwards and doesn't really know where it is going. There is no real plot, characters who died in the first reappear and the new characters leave you wondering why they were included in the film at all.The opening scenes are reasonably funny but the film then becomes ridiculous. You will find yourself looking at your friends in complete astonishment as you watch a series of poor jokes and scenes which seem to have been put together randomly. When the credits roll (after just over an hour) you are much more likely to hear "thank God" than "is that it?"I am quite bitter because I can't believe I wasted my Sunday night watching this absolute garbage. I expected more from the team that brought us I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.Avoid it at all costs. A complete turkey. This film was made by profiteers, not genuine filmmakers.

		<fullReview> I have to say, Scary Movie 2 was REALLY funny. Okay, so it wasn't as good as the first, but hey, isn't that how all sequels are??? The cast is even better than the cast in the first. Scary movie 2 spoofs movies such as The Exorcist, House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Hollow Man, Charlie's Angels, and more. Anna Farris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Regina Hall, Tori Spelling, Tim Curry, Chris Elliot, and James Woods were great in the movie. Keenen Ivory Wayans has done it again! I really liked the scene when Cindy was fighting the black cat in the bedroom, and I also liked the part when Cindy was singing along with the radio, and then Vitamin C cut in, and told her to shut up and let her sing the song! That part was really funny. All, in all I give Scary Movie 2 a 10 out of 10!!! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout the movie, it was funny as hell! But, it was not as funnier as the original "Scary Movie." The best part in the movie was "The Exorcist" skit. Everybody, including Father Harris was singing "Shake That Ass" by Mystikal, the demon girl was p***ing on the carpet for 1 minute, Father McFeely was screwing the demon girl, he shots her, out comes the title "Scary Movie 2" and there's Cindy Campbell and Shorty Meeks (the funniest character in "Scary Movie 1 and 2.") Also, another funny part was when Cindy was singing "Graduation" by Vitamin C (a.k.a. Collen Ann Fitzpatrick) and Collen tells her to shut up on the radio. But, aside the sexual gags and gross humor, other than that, it was a great movie. I recommend this movie to anybody who enjoyed the first "Scary Movie" and/or who enjoys the Wayans brothers.IT'S ALL GOOD!!!!!A+ 100/100 ****** stars (out of ******)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel (to a movie that promised "no sequel") opens with an uproarious parody of "The Exorcist" (with James Woods) then goes downhill fast. The "plot" has a bunch of college students (four returnees from the original--never mind that they died--and three untalented others) spending the weekend in a haunted house for some reason or another. They get to the house, the plot goes out the window and it's a non-stop barrage of crude humor and countless parodies of other movies. The big problems with this movie is the plot ceases to make sense halfway through, there are more bad jokes than good ones and the cast members are either annoying (Tori Spelling and especially Chris Elliot) or wasted (Tim Curry--why Tim?). The jokes do ocassionally work, but this seems much longer than 80 minutes. Too bad--the opening was so good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best parody movies I've ever seen. Many people put this film down, because it's "making fun of movies that were dumb in the first place". That's crap. First of all the first film was written by 2 different groups of people and then combined, hence why it was better. The 2nd one, only had 1 of the 2 groups writing it, hence why it was slightly not as good.But this film is funny. You must look at the films that it's making fun of. It's not the slasher films. This time around, they're making fun of ghost films. This is why there isn't as much gore and gross out jokes. The ghost films simply didn't have that in them originally, so there's no reason to have them in this film.Those people who hated this movie should just shut up and let those who liked it write reviews. Cuz this film is as good as the original, and better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keenan Ivory Wayans' Scary Movie 2, a somewhat pale sequel to it's predecesor triumph Scary Movie, has some of the old characters back in a story resembling the Haunting and other spooky haunted house pictures. As far as gags go, once again the film dishes out lurid and often distasteful (however quite funny) batches of them. Some are actually ones that were used in the last film (I guess Miramax thought you can't go wrong with semen and genitals), but while some might say that's a bad thing, I guess if the shoe fits, and can make you cringe as well, it's good. Worthy summer gross out comedy, although not as potent as the original. The best scenes- the first exorcist scene with James Woods and Andy Richter as the old priest and young priest, and the Beetlejuice in the brain gag. Grade, somewhere between B+ and A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no denying that Scary Movie 2 is a bit of a mess. The film, put together in less than year to make its targeted release date, is full of bad and mildly confusing editing, uneven performances, careless writing, and lazy repeat gags from the first movie. At the same time, I can't sit here and that the movie isn't hilarious at times. Just as with the first Scary Movie, the film is absolutely stuffed with non-stop jokes. There isn't twenty seconds in between where one joke ends and another begins. It's hard not to admire the commitment in that sort of comedy. Despite the fact that there are a few scenes that are painfully unfunny and forced, the number of solid, hilariously funny scenes far outweigh the terrible, laughless ones. Scary Movie 2 is about as lowbrow as one can get, but it also has the good sense to mostly spoof bad horror movies that deserve to be mocked. Even the scenes that spoof masterpieces like The Exorcist work better than they probably should. I won't defend Scary Movie 2 as a well made comedy since its rushed production schedule is obvious at every turn, though Scary Movie 2 is well worth watching for fans of the first installment. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first "Scary Movie" was funny enough and had some pretty silly but enjoyable moments, like the "Usual Suspects" gag. It was a crude movie, but entertaining nonetheless.The sequel is ugly, rude, crude, obnoxious, unfunny, lame and totally out of ideas. It spoofs everything in sight - mostly "Exorcist" - but fails on almost all levels.The entire cast basically returns. This time they get summoned to a haunted mansion where possessions are occurring. Weird people - including a creepy owner and a sick chef - turn them off and they soon find themselves being pursued by evil.If the plot sounds lame, that's because it is. The cast is at a loss for words; the Wayans Brothers recycle loads of gags from the first film and manage to make them worse. There are only two parts I laughed at.Most of the film is just crude for the sake of being crude, and that's a problem when none of the jokes are effective. I'd say skip this one and pretend it was never even made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>most of the reviews I've written so far have been glowing or at least grudgingly good with a few criticisms. This is the first I've written where I can find no redeeming qualities about it. So why 2 stars? Well, it is only 79 minutes long, and Anna Faris is reasonably pretty. Thats about it though, and really the only reason it didn't get lower is because i simply don't like giving 1 out of 10 simply because of the work that goes into making any film - but this film comes closer than almost any other I've seen.Whereas the first Scary Movie, whilst not exactly brilliant, was a relatively original spoof of Scream and I know what you did last summer, with some genuinely funny moments, Scary Movie 2 has none of these. Furthermore, the first film stuck to poking fun at horror films, whereas this abomination of a sequel frequently meandered off aimlessly into other films, most notably a Charlie's Angels sequence. With the exception of the Wayans Brothers and Faris, the majority of the 'names' from the first film are absent - not that their presence could have salvaged this road accident of a film. What on earth were Tim Curry and James Woods thinking? The jokes are purile and immature, and their crude nature make the humour from the first film look like an Oscar Wilde play. Surely there are only so many times projectile vomiting and bodily functions can be amusing? and surely they are before the age of 15? (incidentally, this film is an 18, but it surely cannot have been aimed at over-18s).The film starts only reasonably bad with a spoof of the exorcist, and, whilst never approaching the comedy of the first (that in itself not a great challenge to meet), it is watchable. Its all downhill from there though. As spoofs go, Spaceballs it ain't. By the end you are simply crying out for whatever serial killer they are spoofing at present to slash up them or, failing that, you. The tag-line read more laughs, more screams, less clothes - inaccurate on all three counts.I've never given a film such a slating before, so this is a novel experience for me, and oddly a rather calming one too. The only scare to come out of this film is the prospect of a third film, and even a rumoured fourth in the franchise in the works. A truly terrifying prospect indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doesn't it seem like just days ago that we were flogged with the FIRST Scary Movie? What a pile of crap this movie was. There's just no other way to describe it. I hated the original, for obvious reasons, so I was shocked that this ridiculous sequel managed to sneak beneath the abysmal level to which the original sank less than a year ago. The Wayans brothers have returned to the spotlight to remind the world of their immaturity, their sickening sense of humor, and their absolute lack of any type of film-making talent. This is drivel of the lowest order and is completely devoid of redeeming values of any kind.On the other hand, there is a place for a film like this, even among educated people. For example, if you are a professional film critic, or even an average movie-goer who writes reviews for the IMDb (a group of people with whom I proudly associate), then a movie like Scary Movie 2 is worth watching just because it is so much fun to shoot it down afterwards in a review. There's something morbidly satisfying about watching a dumbass movie like this and then tearing it up in a review, even if you already know that not too many people will bother to read it. I can't even begin to satisfactorily convey to you the absolute idiocy of this film, I can only say that there is a total absence of any kind of talent or thought behind it, and it results as nothing more than an hour and a half of blabbering nonsense.Did you ever wonder how many perfectly good careers are ended, some even before they've really began, by hideous movies like this? Tori Spelling's flailing and altogether unenviable career is officially over, Tim Curry is too good an actor to be completely destroyed by movie like this, but this was clearly his version of Travolta starring Battlefield Earth. There can be no doubt about Anna Faris's talent as an actress, and she's beautiful, too, but she'll never be able to overcome the awful reputation that she has established for herself in the Scary Movies. Marlon and Shawn Wayans are the lucky ones here, because neither had anything to lose when they took on these crapfests. This kind of movie is a metaphorical handgun with which various actors can voluntarily commit career suicide. For shame.And one more thing, if any of the people behind the Scary Movies are reading this, I'd like to ask a huge favor for the greater good of mankind - "FOR GOD'S SAKE, NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</fullReview>

Once there they discover the freakish servant Hanson (Chris Elliott) who quickly becomes the least of their worries are they encounter the evil ghost of the previous owner Hugh Kane (Richard Moll) &amp; a whole host of other spooky goings on...Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans Scary Movie 2 was the first sequel to the horror spoof Scary Movie (2000), the series is now up to Scary Movie 4 (2006), &amp; I personally thought it was better than the original &amp; quite simply I found it totally hilarious. The script by Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Alyson Fouse, Greg Grabianski, Dave Polsky, Michael Anthony Snowden &amp; Craig Wayans spoofs just about every well known horror film there is from The Legend of Hell House (1973), The Exorcist (1973), Poltergeist (1982), The Shining (1980), Hollow Man (2000) to Hannibal (2001) &amp; it spoofs all other sorts of film from various genres like Charlies Angels (2000), Harry Potter, Mission: Impossible II (2000), Rocky (1976) &amp; Dirty Harry (1971) to name but a few. I must admit I had a great time trying to spot them all &amp; I'm sure any film buff would, although I doubt many film buffs would agree with the way Scary Movie 2 treats these classic films. There are also some swipes at a few topical issues that were prevalent back then like the Bill Clinton 'affair'. At only 85 odd minutes long Scary Movie 2 moves along like a rocket with a constant stream of bad taste &amp; gross out gags that I just found really funny, I haven't laughed so much during a film for ages, I don't really know what that says about me &amp; frankly I don't care either.Director Wayans keeps the humour coming thick &amp; fast, he seems to want cater for the lowest common denominator with a succession of gross bad taste gags from toilet humour, poo, fart, puke, spunk, sex, masturbation, drugs, paedophile priests, racism, sexism, gay jokes, a ghost helping himself to a blow-job in a pretty female students mouth, plenty of foul language including a funny Budgie &amp; even the disabled aren't safe as Scary Movie 2 is one of the most politically incorrect films I've ever seen. There are plenty of jokes in Scary Movie 2 that I would imagine many would find offencive which is fine I suppose but I will openly say right now that I found the disabled jokes funny, the racist humour amusing &amp; all the bad taste gags hilarious &amp; frankly I have no problem saying that although I would imagine many would. It doesn't make me a racist or look down on those with disability, I think the whole world's gone political correctness mad anyway.With a supposed budget of $45,000,000 Scary Movie 2 very well made with great special effects &amp; loving recreation of various classic scenes from films. The acting was good &amp; everyone played their parts really well whether they were serious or campy &amp; that Anna Faris is really rather hot.I loved Scary Movie 2, I found it hilarious, it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. In a world that's gone mad with political correctness Scary Movie 2 isn't afraid to poke fun at just about anything &amp; seems to have no boundaries, I really can't remember laughing so much during a film, I really can't. If your prudish or easily offended then avoid Scary Movie 2 like the plague but if you like crude juvenile gross out humour then it's an absolute must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go again ladies and gentlemen.When "Scary Movie" came out in theaters in the late summer of 2000, audience members found themselves peeing in their pants as they laughed their butts off in some of the funniest scenes in a parody. The original movie was a parody of the film Scream along with every other popular horror movie both slasher/non-slasher. Some moments from the genitals to the pubic hair might have gagged some audience members, but no matter, the film itself was funny making Anna Faris a star before she would later appear in the entire Scary Movie series prior to making a serious cameo in Brokeback Mountain.Scary Movie 2 crossed out the "No sequels" slogan since more movies needed to come.Keenan Ivory Waynes, director of the first movie of the franchise, returns in the director's chair where instead of slasher films, it's all about haunted houses and things that bump in the night as Cindy (Anna Faris) starts a new life in college where other members of the surviving party from Brenda (Regina Hall), Shorty (Marlon Waynes) and Ray (Shawn Waynes) go with her as well. This time Cindy has a boyfriend (Chris Masterson) where the two of them along with Brenda, Shorty, Ray and other guests are going to a haunted mansion for a field experiment to see about a ghost. Some parts of the film made me laugh from certain pop culture (Raging Bull, Nike Shoes) while some of the sex jokes just didn't work for me. I felt that I was watching a movie where the laughter needed to be forced out of me than seeing something innovated.</fullReview>

If only those two groups of brothers--Wayans and Weinstein--had heeded the last part of that tag-line for the original Scary Movie.Scary Movie 2 is an all new low in modern comedic cinema. Anna Faris's only talent is making men mass-ejaculate. Shawn Wayans is homosexual. Marlon Wayans is a pot-head. Tori Spelling performs fellatio on a ghost, and Christopher Masterson does zip. Yes ladies and gentleman, these are their main character traits.For a supposed comedy, the film fails on every single level.It's quite ironic, because in the first movie, the Wayans brothers wanted to not only parody horror movies but also the countless teen movies that have recently come into existence since the mid 90's. Now, they too, have befallen the same trap that they once set out to destroy through comedy -- they're coming up with half-brain ideas, full of young actors, making a comedy movie simply because they can and in the foolish belief (although at least 60% of the time it's not financially foolish) it will sell lots of tickets/DVD's. Face it, the Wayans brothers have become what they most feared -- cheap writers making teen movies for the mere purpose to make a few bucks.More power to them ? but sellouts nonetheless.83 minutes too long.

		<fullReview>Most of the movies in this series were quite clever, but not this one. It's mostly a bunch of low humor - much of it scatological - wrapped around a loose plot. As it is, there's not really any reason to call this "Scary Movie 2", as it has no relationship to #1, save the presence of Anna Faris (actually, neither 1 nor 2 nor 3 nor 4 has any relation to each other). The only really clever scene is the part about the Florida votes.So, I would recommend watching numbers 1, 3 and 4 before you watch this one. In fact, they kind of got better once Leslie Nielsen joined the cast. Don't let this one bias you. Also starring Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Chris Masterson, Regina Hall, Chris Elliott, Tim Curry, Tori Spelling, James Woods, Andy Richter and Veronica Cartwright; I get the feeling that they don't wish to be remembered for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is in the same boat with Scary Movie 1. It has the bad jokes out-numbering the good ones, some missing jokes they could have done but didn't and some jokes that lasted too long (the scene with the basketball). The sex jokes are seemingly toned down as are the body fluid jokes, but then they must have used up most of them in the first movie. The Excorcist/Amityville Horror spoof at the top of the movie was funny, almost a rip-off from Repossessed with Linda Blair, but it may have done a lot more damage to the Catholic church than the series Dave Allen at Large. Anna Faris is as cute as always, but she is embarrassing herself in some of the scenes. Calling her animal fighting moves for one and in her spoof of the cat fight scene from the Legend of Hell House are two examples. Kathleen Robertson is an obvious sexpot, but Tori Spelling ruins every scene she is in. Annoyingly grating as a middle-aged college student, she just doesn't belong in this movie. Regina Hall, Shawn and Marlon Wayans steal every scene they are in, and Chris Elliott and Tim Curry show the more tolerable range of their talents. The disability jokes between Elliott and David Cross are a bit tactless and tasteless and Chris Masterson is funny to watch in this full feature away from his role as a Malcom in the Middle second stringer. For me, the ghost effects are superb even if some of the simulated phenomenon was too over the top. I am definitely waiting for a Scary Movie 3; I only wish I could star in it too !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not everything is bad, but still...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Scary Movie" was a parody on all those teenage slasher/horror movies that we got in the nineties, like for instance "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Scary Movie 2" is a parody on famous horror movies like "The Exorcist" and "Poltergeist". Knowing this in advance, I certainly had a few expectations about this movie. Not that I thought this would be an intelligent movie, because when you are about to see a comedy with the Wayans brothers, you know what you can expect: a lot of vulgar and pre-teen humor. Still, that doesn't mean that they can't be good fun from time to time and seeing a parody on about every famous movie is a nice pass-time, like the first "Scary Movie" already proved a year earlier.In "Scary Movie 2" four teens are tricked by their professor and his paralyzed assistant into visiting the haunted Hell House for a school project about sleep disorders. In this house a bad exorcism took place and the ghost still lives there. Chaos starts as soon as they arrive. They meet the creepy caretaker of the house, have to face the evil spirit and will have to solve some dark secrets, no matter how disgusting they are...I admit that I liked "Scary Movie" and normally I'm also a fan of other spoof movies like for instance "Hot Shots" or "The Naked Gun", but this movie certainly didn't do it for me. This wasn't just vulgar, it just wasn't very good. The beginning with the exorcism was quite funny and the movie certainly had its better moments, but the overall quality of the story and the acting were so low that it really started to annoy me. Take for instance the fact that all the characters from the first movie are back, even when they died in that one. That can only mean that the story and the sense of reality (although that is perhaps not the exact word for this kind of movies, but you know what I mean), weren't of any importance. The only thing that mattered was the extra profit this movie would be worth. They didn't even have the time to come up with something new or original, making this movie feel like it was written in a couple of weeks time with a crate of whiskey and 10 joints per man...The jokes and gags that the Wayans brothers and their enormous team of writers, producers,... came up with were clearly inspired on the first movie. Never change a winning team they say, but sometimes the audience wants to see an underdog win. They don't want to see the same thing over and over again, they want something new and that's where this movie failed completely. I give it a 6/10, because not everything was awful, but it could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A matter of taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you loved 'Scary Movie' you will probably only like 'Scary Movie 2'. If you hated the first film, you will hate this one even more. One stupid sex related joke after another makes a film that is so much a matter of taste it is sort of impossible to review. The film spoofs films such as 'The Haunting', 'The Exorcist', 'Hollow Man', 'Hannibal', even 'Titanic' and a sports commercial (a pretty funny sequence). Some of them work, most of them don't, although I am ashamed to say that I was smiling pretty much.So if you are normally able to enjoy films like 'Hot Shots!', 'The Naked Gun' and the original 'Scary Movie' you must be able to like this one. Prepare for a little more sex and language though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weakest in the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 was a movie made just for cash, with very little laughs. The script could have been written in half an hour, with very little effort. The movie had a promising opening, a parody of "The Excorcist" where the priest and the possessed little girl have a vomiting fight. I laughed so hard I nearly cried. Surely this was going to be one hilarious movie. Alas, the answer to that was no. The plot moved on to present day (which was a year later) to see the survivors of the previous film now in college and getting on with their lives. But then they are invited to a creepy haunted house for a school project, and they stupidly accept the offer. Once they arrive they meet a creepy caretaker with a deformed hand. They are unaware that they are being spied on by Professor Oldman and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight .The first night they sleep in the old house the creepy hauntings begin (only a few make you laugh, most make you feel sick) and from then on its parodies of all haunted house films like "The Haunting", "House on Haunted Hill", and "The Others".Most of the spoofs were just gross and unfunny. Sure it had a couple of funny scenes that make you laugh no matter how hard you try not to, which included a wheelchair race and a hilarious spoof of the Evil Clown from "Poltergeist", but there were just too many unfunny jokes. This movie is definitely the weakest in the series, and at times is just painful to watch. If you want a few guaranteed good, cheap laughs I suggest you give this one a miss and watch Scary Movie 1, 3, or 4.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sicker and even less funny than the first one(4.5/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>aside from one hysterical recurring sequence,this movie is not very funny.it has a few other funny moments,but not very many and they are mostly mildly amusing at best.this movie is sicker than the first one,and not in a good way.i found it too sick for my tastes,but i did watch to the end.thankfully,it has a short running time of less than 90 minutes.it's also slower than the first one.again,it's not for the easily offended.i wasn't really any different from the first,other than it is not as good.but,just like the first,it would have worked as a horror movie,more than a spoof.this is a movie that i have no desire to watch again,for a very long time.for me,Scary Movie 2 is a 4.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Crude To Be Successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple find their daughter has been possessed by Satan so call in Father McFeely: " Our daughter won't let us near her Father " " Well I find giving them candy helps " There you go I've just given away the only halfway funny joke in the whole movie and I was totally puzzled why someone of James Woods stature was doing appearing in rubbish like this when he's not starring in TV movies or doing voice overs in video games . The rest of the cast are far less well known and long may that continue . I'll say one positive thing for them though and that's that they give performances that a dire and crude comedy like this deserves , either that or they're just a fairly poor cast . There might be some entertainment spotting what movie is being spoofed with everything from THE SHINING to DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS being targeted ( This gains an extra star ) but what ruins the movie is the ridiculous near the knuckle brand of comedy involved . It's not as bad as say FREDDY GOT FINGERED ( Another star in that case ) . I've nothing against bad taste comedy and one of my all time favourite comedy is THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY but that movie was genuinely funny , here we have a movie that is ridiculous , silly and rather offensive and got 3/10 because it didn't feature Tom Green and I'm a film buff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rushed into production sequel: Scary Movie 2.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 2 (2001) was obviously rushed into production. The humor was nothing more than a bunch of dated jokes and references. It's a shame really because the story had promise. They should have waited until Marlon Brando was well enough to perform the part of the Exorcist Priest. His presence alone could have saved this movie. The part was written for him. When an out of place James Woods took over the role, the movie was doomed from the start.The film makers should have just waited for a little longer to release this sequel. I heard of striking while the iron is hot but this was ridiculous. But this movie is a classic compared to the horrible third film (that the Wayan Brothers wanted no part of).Mediocre effort, worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did used to like the Scary Movie films in a rather immature way, now only the first film is the one I can say good things about, because as they go on the sequels get worse and worse, and the spin off films from the same makers, e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie and Vampires Suck are abysmal, this was the second film in the near pointless continuing horror films, television and popularised celebrity news spoof series. This film predominantly parodies the haunted house movies, specifically the remake of The Haunting and Poltergeist, as well as spoofing or referencing The Exorcist (the opening), The Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House; Save the Last Dance, Dude, Where's My Car?, Paulie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Wild Wild West, the Nike basketball advert, Child's Play, Stephen King's It, What Lies Beneath, Thir13en Ghosts, Ghostbusters, The Weakest Link (quoted), Hollow Man, Titanic (quoted), Days of Thunder, Mission: Impossible II, Dirty Harry (quoted), Hannibal, Charlie's Angels; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Twister, Final Destination, The A-Team, Alien, Alien: Resurrection, Big Trouble in Little China, Carrie, Cats &amp; Dogs, The Changeling, The Convent, Gladiator, Gone in 60 Seconds, Jumanji, A Knight's Tale, The Mummy, A Nightmare on Elm Street, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Pet Semetary, Poltergeist II: The Other Side, Red Heat, Rocky IV, Scream, The Shining, Snatch, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back and The Usual Suspects. Basically the film opens at Hell House where a Mother (Veronica Cartwright) is concerned for her sick daughter Megan (American Pie's Natasha Lyonne), so Father Harris (Andy Richter) and Father McFeely (James Woods, apparently the part was to be played by Marlon Brando) have been called in to perform an exorcism, which sees the possessed girl's head twist all the way round and masses of vomit going on each other. A year later, charming but perverted teacher Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paraplegic assistant Dwight Hartman (David Cross) have invited a group of clueless college students to spend a few days inside a large mansion, Hell House of course, in the hope of witnessing paranormal activity, the students include previous film "survivors" Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), Brenda's stoner brother Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda's gay boyfriend Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), as well as idiotic Buddy (Christopher Masterson), deluded Alex Monday (Tori Spelling) and sexy Theo (Kathleen Robertson). The house has a foulmouthed parrot in a cage there to mock and antagonise the guests, and there is also disgusting caretaker Hanson (Chris Elliott) with his badly malformed hand, but soon enough one by one the guests start to realise that the various spirits that inhabit the house, their voices echoing in the corridors, causing inanimate things to come to life and possessing. After various events, like finding out about the main ghost of the house Hugh Kane (Richard Moll), Alex wanting to have sex with the various demons, Cindy fighting with possessed black cat Mr. Kittles, Ray wrestling with a possessed toy clown doll, Shorty being frightened by a growing and living marijuana plant, and the Professor being killed, the remaining guests are ready to defend themselves against the evil forces. In the end, after a fight with the possessed Hanson and the ghost of Hugh Kane being destroyed by the device the house curse is lifted, and the group go their separate ways, and two months later Cindy and Buddy are a couple, and he suddenly disappears when she sees Hanson at a hot dog stand, he antagonises her until he is hit by a car, being driven by Shorty who is receiving oral from the female demon with a bag on her head. Also starring Cordelia Reinhard as Father Harris' Mother, James DeBello as Tommy and Lester 'Beetlejuice' Green as Shorty's Brain. The film is sadly no longer reminiscent of the classic spoof films, like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, the character stupidity and most of their personalities are unbearably irritating, the ridiculousness is unfunny, the gross and disgusting material is unpleasant, Cindy is far too clumsy and accident prone to be amusing, Shorty is still relatively amusing but becomes annoying at times, Ray is okay being obviously gay but oversteps the mark in moments, Curry and Woods in their moments are alright, stars Cross and Masterson are not very likable, and Elliott and Spelling are the worst. You may recognise the films being parodied, and The Exorcist parody is a not bad start, but the repetitive and predictable jokes do not work, the story is pointless, it feels trashy and is a waste of time, and sadly this feel was to continue for one or two of the following sequels, a rubbish and rather unfunny horror comedy spoof film. Pretty poor!</fullReview>
