		<shortDescription>Gets a bad rap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film gets a bad rap because it was not a suspenseful blockbuster in the vein of "Psycho" and "The Birds". The fact is, is that after Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedrin did battle with seagulls in 1963, Hitchcock never again approached the heights of a major director and he dramatically slowed down his film output.Still, this movie, along with 1964's "Marnie" and '72's "Frenzy" represent a decent effort by Hitchcock to stay current and hip with modern audiences. That he was still directing films at all in the 1960s and 1970s is quite remarkable for a man whose film work began in the silent era."Family Plot" is a fun, neat little comedy-thriller much akin to the NBC Mystery Movies of that era... i.e., "Columbo", "McMillen and Wife". Blanche is a phony psychic who, along with her reluctant boyfriend Frank, played hilariously by the underrated Bruce Dern, run afoul of big time crooks Karen Black and William Devane.The plot does get a bit convoluted, but Hitchcock was smart enough to lay off the heavy-handed dictatorial directorship that categorized his earlier work and let the actors and their characters move the plot along. Unlike Cary Grant's Thornhill in "North By Northwest", we care about Blanche and Frank because they really are like us, the viewer. As much as we all adored the women in Hitch's films... Grace Kelly, Tippi Hedren, Kim Novak, and wanted to be like the men,Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewert, Ray Milland, Rod Taylor, Farley Granger, etc., none of these characters were remotely like US, and in his dotage, Hitchcock was still keen enough to realize that Cary Grant in 1956 was an admirable figure walking down the street... in 1976 he was apt to be pointed at and laughed about. Hitch knew INSTINCTIVELY that the gray suit and slicked back hair era was gone forever. In this film, it doesn't even look like Dern showers.That's part of the charm and why it was so refreshing, at this late date, to go into the movie theater and enjoy an Alfred Hitchcock film without having to sigh that it was all about nostalgia. This film, in his humorous approach has much in common with "The Trouble With Harry" than "Psycho" or "Shadow of a Doubt". Hitch didn't go out with a classic, that's for sure, but he went out with a modern film that showed he could still produce an entertaining flick. That was all he was ever about anyway. No higher praise is needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen "Torn Curtain" about a year ago, I wasn't all that enthusiastic about seeing another of Hitchcock's "late" works (indeed, his final film). "TC" was absolutely abysmal, as reflected in my comments there, so I had no great expectations for "Family Plot." I was pleasantly surprised, however. Although true Hitchcock buffs may not rank "FP" alongside the "classics" like "Psycho" and "NxNW," "FP" is an evenly-paced film with strong central characters, an interesting supporting cast, good acting, humor, innuendo, mystery and, of course, suspense. A good all-around film by the master in his final effort. It won't leave your palms sweating and your blood running cold, and there are a couple of flaws that a younger Hitch might have caught (I, for one, wonder how Blanche's car got fixed so quickly -- hard to believe it wasn't totaled in the first place).Nonetheless, Family Plot will hold your attention and keep you guessing until the very end. I'm glad I took the time to seek it out and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, not great Hitchcock, but entertaining nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family Plot differs from all the other Hitchcock films. It lacks suspense, for the most part, and it is not as funny as many of his films. Instead, it is just an amusing little yarn. I like the way the film starts with two separate plot lines which gradually merge. Even if it is not the most original thing in the world (especially since two of Family Plot's stars were main players in Robert Altman's Nashville), it still makes the film interesting. If anyone else had made this film, it probably would be more fondly received by the public, although I doubt anyone would still be watching it today.The two characters with whom we begin the film, whom we would consider the heroes, are the best, and are played lovingly by Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern. She's a hack psychic milking old ladies out of pensions, and he's a cabbie who cannot find enough time both to drive his cab and participate in Harris' schemes. Although the characters aren't as well developed as those in numerous other Hitchcock ventures, they're entertaining.The other couple, Karen Black and William Devane, fare less well. They're more crafty in their crimes, perpetrating large-scale kidnappings for enormous ransoms. Karen Black's character is very underdeveloped, hardly showing any depth. What character she does have is not entirely believable, since Karen Black seems too nice to play a hardcore criminal. William Devane is decent as the sinister mastermind, but the history provided to his character is far more brutal than is believable (he locked his adopted parents in their bedroom and set fire to their house).I liked the idea of the small time crooks clashing with the professionals, and I liked the outcome of the film. All in all, it is decent and worth watching. It does not feel anything like a Hitchcock film, so I wouldn't expect anything like Vertigo or Rear Window when approaching this, his swan song. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Hitchcock swansong (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Family Plot' is generally regarded as a disappointing entry into the Hitchcock canon, further burdened by the fact that it became his final film ? whereas other lighthearted Hitch pictures like `The Trouble With Harry' (another underrated gem) could be accepted for what they were, `Family Plot' buckles under the critical weight and expectation of what should constitute the final film of a cinema master.Once you throw all that in the bin, however, `Family Plot' is a marvellous, light-hearted comedy/thriller.Hitchcock had begun, in his later films, to cast lesser-known actors because (a) having been established in the era of the studio system, he saw no need to pay exorbitant sums for actors whom he viewed as just as important in the film-making process as technical crew who were paid less and (b) he wanted to avoid the audience making assumptions about character based purely on who had been cast in a role.The performances of the four leads in `Family Plot' are consistently excellent. Barbara Harris is hilarious, showing touches of Madeleine Kahn in her role as fake psychic Blanche, Bruce Dern is endearing as her flakey sidekick Frank McBride, Karen Black brilliantly plays it straight-down-the-line (despite the silly disguises she wears) as a partner in crime to kidnapper-jeweler Arthur Adamson, played with deliciously subtle menace by William Devane.The music, provided by John Williams in a first-time collaboration with Hitchcock, works a treat, avoiding the bombastic overtones of some of his worst Hollywood-esque scores and harking back to the classic days of Bernard Herrmann.Being drawn into the web of the intricate plot that sees these four characters being drawn together, and seeing the sparks fly in the witty dialogue (penned by `North by Northwest' screenwriter Ernest Lehman) is enough ? but the set pieces (a rollercoaster ride in an out-of-control car in the mountains, the kidnapping of a priest in the middle of a service, to name a few) elevate this film to a delightful popcorn experience that you will want to return to again ? there are subtleties and layers in the performances that will be guaranteed to keep you coming back for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder Mystery as Comedy: last Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get ready for the tricks and suspense you've seen in other films, but be sure to get the commentary on DVD. Barbara Harris looks just like Hitchcock's daughter, as you'll see from the interview, just a younger version. A extra lesson: You will never get a facelift once you see the interviews with Karen Black. If she had allowed herself to age naturally, she would have been so much more attractive than the gargoyle you'll wince at seeing.Here's a treat: the winding mountain road and no brakes scenario as never you've seen it. I loved the comic touches and the risqué language. It is indeed a unique film. If you happen to love the mountain of California and San Francisco, you'll also love the cinematography. The stills are mostly of Hitchcock in the graveyard, which makes you wonder if he wasn't a little clairvoyant himself. The whole movie centers around a phony psychic and her attempt to cheat an old woman out of her money.In our cynical world of today, you'll expect them just to dress Dern up as the missing heir, but nope, they play it straight. Having read of Hitchcock's misogyny, you'll appreciate the cuts and slices between the lovers. Both pairs of grifters have their own love thing going. Rather touching to see the fidelity among the crooks. Inspired writing, indeed.Hitchcock did have a pacemaker installed while this movie was being made, so you have to wonder if his own thoughts of his impending death might have caused as much concentration on the graveyard scenes. Buy the DVD; the added features will make the movies itself 3 times more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale Of Two Con Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's final film Family Plot is a story of two male and female criminal partnerships. The first pair is Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris who are a pair of small time grifters and we meet them in the process of fleecing a rich old spinster Cathleen Nesbitt with a phony psychic act.The second pair are William Devane and Karen Black who have a lovely line in ransom kidnappings. They've really got it worked out to a science, including a soundproof hidden room in Devane's basement where the victims can be stashed until the ransom is paid. Nesbitt confesses that she had her late sister give up an out of wedlock child during a séance and now she'd like to make amends by finding him and making him her heir. So with a finder's fee in mind Dern and Harris start digging.Their paths cross Devane and Black as the police are hunting them so it becomes quite an interesting set of circumstances as Devane and Black suspect the others of being police operatives.Hitchcock cleverly interweaves the stories of the two couples into a very cohesive plot. The players all hit the mark with their roles,] especially Devane, a smooth talking killer in the Hitchcock tradition of Otto Kruger in Saboteur, Tom Helmore in Vertigo, and James Mason in North By Northwest.The ending is a bit of a surprise though, it comes rather abruptly. I have to confess I didn't like it at first, but it does kind of grow on you with repeated viewings.Family Plot is a good for the master of suspense to go out on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think if you approach this movie beforehand knowing it's not going to be a "Vertigo" or "Rear Window," you'll have some fun. Sure it's fluff, but it is entertaining nonetheless. Even kooky, vegetable-like Karen Black aka "The World's Worst Actress" seems to have benefited from working with Hitch and pulls off an adequate performance. Never cared for Bruce Dern and here he's his usual Willard looking self. Barbara Harris was a true delight, "Don't blaspheme, George." and found her character of Madam Blanche quite amusing. I even found the run away car scene entertaining, if not a bit over the top. All in all, I liked the story and liked the way it wrapped up in the end. Hitchcock's last gift to us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Family Plot" is remembered only for being Hitchcock's last film. The ending to his successful career could be have been more honorable. "Family Plot" is merely a light entertainment movie - nothing more, nothing less. But it works as that. The plot is enjoyable to follow and the members of the cast (especially William Devane) do a creditable job. But remember that the director was no longer at his peak, so don't expect anything in the lines of his masterpieces, like "Vertigo" or "Psycho". And John Williams' barely memorable score pales in comparison with Bernard Herrmann's masterful accomplishments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. It's a great little story that's fun to watch. This is Hitchcock's last movie and I think it's as good as any. I guess you could call this a mystery with a little humor injected into it. Does it have suspense? I don't know. But what else would you call it? I think it's a pretty good mystery and all the characters are quite believable. I think the choice of actors for each part was good. I give this movie an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. I'd rate it higher, but it's got some mild swearing and a bit of sexual innuendo. But all in all it's worth seeing next time you find it on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Swan Song of a Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trickster Madam Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) lures the elder millionaire Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt) that believes she is a spiritualist. After a séance, she discovers that Julia is tormented by her past, when she forced her sister and single mother Harriet to deliver her baby for adoption to avoid a family scandal. Julia promises the small fortune of ten thousand-dollar to Blanche if she finds her nephew and heir of her fortune using her phony powers. Blanche asks her boyfriend George Lumley (Bruce Dern), who is an unemployed actor working as cab driver, to investigate the whereabouts of Julia's nephew. Meanwhile, the greedy jeweler and collector Arthur Adamson (William Devane) kidnaps wealthy people with his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black) to increase his collection of diamonds with the ransom. When George concludes that Arthur Adamson might be the heir of Julia Rainbird, the reckless Blanche gets in trouble with the kidnappers."Family Plot" is the swan song of the genius Alfred Hitchcock. The entwined stories are in general very funny and enjoyable, with the exception of the ridiculous and overacted sequence of Blanche while George is driving downhill the car without brakes. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is a shadow at the "registrar of births and deaths" when George is seeking the death certificate of Edward Shoebridge. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Trama Macabra" ("Macabre Plot")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Domesticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Hitchcock's movies that is centered on homes (like A Shadow of Doubt, Rear Window or The Trouble With Harry). There are no murders, no wrongly accused people, no big open, hostile spaces, no deep disturbances or sorrows. Family Plot delivers a ?domestic" and humorous mystery story. Seems to be enough for many people to call it a lesser Hitchcock effort or even an outright failure.The main characters have stable domestic situations and make occasional outings. The set designs of the different homes are important, and the people responsible for it did a really great job. Actually, the homes almost fuse with the people who live there and seem to be a reflection of their minds.At the center the story are two couples whose paths intersect. The action switches from one couple to the other, and the director really succeeded in creating an almost perfect balance. Family Plot is a strangely harmonious picture, with characters who are (were) at the same time contemporary and timeless. The choice of the actors and actresses is dead-on. Thank God Al Pacino and Faye Dunaway weren't available! In a strange way, both couples are comfortable: Blanche and George, however down on their luck and crooked they may be, appear to be reasonably happy and seem to know each other inside out. Adamson's and Fran's relationship has a somewhat darker note, but even they seem to have a good partnership relation. An atmosphere of familiarity prevails, the title is well chosen.The best scene of Family Plot: The garage door opening on that god**mn white Ford Mustang which comes as a complete and very bad surprise for Anderson and Fran. It not only blocks the exit (they are in a hurry) but comes with the person they least want to encounter: Blanche. What's more, totally unsuspecting Blanche thinks that she has very good news for the two and reacts with the appropriate amount of overdrive excitement. A well embedded, perfectly scripted, constructed and acted out scene. Here's masterful movie-making for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tepid final bow for director Alfred Hitchcock, an overlong comedic mystery without much of the Master's notorious wit and charm. Phony psychic Barbara Harris and partner Bruce Dern get mixed-up with jewel thieves while attempting to solve a missing persons case. There's far too much of icy villains William Devane and Karen Black and not enough of spunky Harris, which flattens out the comedy, while the jewel heist-angle is never very involving or exciting. The script isn't desultory--it shows evidence that details and plot-devices were all carefully considered--but the end result is smoothly banal, a manufactured product. Harris displays her frazzled chutzpah and is very appealing (she brings the picture whatever bounce it has), though Hitchcock doesn't seem to know how to use her properly; as a result, many of her scenes fail to flourish. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother defending this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regret to say that while it has a fair amount of merits, I find "Family Plot" to be one of Hitchcock's worst films. Had he used the exact same script and made a dark thriller with an able cast, it would have worked much better. Instead, it's played for laughs, and it's just not funny. I have serious issues with the four principal actors and their ability to convincingly portray their characters. Barbara Harris' "kooky" persona is as dated as that bouffant, bubble hairdo that looks like a wig. She was completely out of step even in 1976. Bruce Dern is annoying in his forced attempt at a comic performance. Karen Black's acting is tentative and uncertain (she was too awestruck at being in a Hitchcock film). William Devane's grinning mouthful of capped teeth is similarly a turnoff. It's the same sort of miscasting that ultimately doomed Gus Van Sant's unfortunate "Psycho" remake. The John Williams score, with its tinkling harpsichord (more befitting a Disney children's adventure) is excruciatingly trite. Hitchcock's misjudgments at that late stage of his career, when he probably shouldn't have been making movies anymore, can be forgiven in light of the remarkable legacy of masterpieces he left behind.</fullReview>

The plot is as convoluted as ever, except that it borders on the silly.As a stand-alone movie, it's beautifully shot, but too ridiculous to take seriously, without managing to be actually funny.But if you take the plot as simply a line to hang the parody on, it's nicely amusing. It's a kaleidoscope of scenes from other Hitchcock movies which were scary the first time round, but this time they're caricatures. Relive bits from North By Northwest, Psycho, To Catch A Thief, and many more, grinning as you recognise where they came from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's a wrap for the Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, alongside things like Notorious, Psycho, North By Northwest, Frenzy, and Foreign Correspondent. Though Hitchcock applied the magic directorial touch to many of the sequences, I can't help but feel it is a small team of performers who make this a fun film to watch over and over again: William Devane, Barbara Harris, Karen Black, throw in Ed Lauter too--and most of all, of course, the marvellous Bruce Dern. I know that some of them were not first choices in the casting process, but what you end up with here are two teams of schemers who collide in splendid ways, all because one man's horrid past starts to intrude on his equally despicable present. You can hide, but you can't run.I love the strong element of coincidence in the film, normally the mark of a tacky film. And how many of these serpentine machinations on display really do stem from coincidence? The first coincidence is a real one: Bruce Dern almost hits strolling stranger Karen Black with his car--and of course these two are destined to cross paths several times throughout the film. But Dern and Harris, as this wonderful contrast to the other sneaky pair of the film, Devane and Black, appear as ditherers, scatterbrains, goofs, even. We have the precise, cleanly- executed super-calm approach of Devane and Black versus what looks like a losing side in the bumbling obliviousness of the admittedly lovable Dern &amp; Harris dysfunctional combo.Or not dysfunctional, after all! Under all the histrionics, bickering and clowning around, Dern and Harris manage to function as plodding yet determined detectives--and they have an advantage over Devane's superior intellect: they are coming at him, slowly, from an angle he does not expect...his past. The few scenes with cops--wonderful scenes, playful scenes-- just indicate that if George (Bruce Dern) and Blanche (Barbara Harris) don't succeed in tracking a criminal (and his reluctant female accomplice) to his lair the hard way, no one will. The kidnapping-for-swag will go on and on because the villains are too perfect. Enter successful dysfunction, in just the most wonderful way shown in any movie.I love all the intertwining, and I love Ed Lauter coming in from the sidelines and being that cool fifth-guy-in--and I love a last Hitchcock movie that has, of all things, self-absorbed faceless teenagers in a car, who--after accidentally forcing an oncoming car off a cliff, just sort of drive off to continue their partying. After all, who cares? Whimsy in death. And I do cherish the little wink at the end--as if it's Hitchcock himself taking the first brick out of the "Fourth Wall" and saying 'I'm just about done pretending". I love Frenzy, but I prefer a charming, breezy exit. With just a hint of menace. Vastly under-appreciated movie.</fullReview>

Well, I saw it and I think it is great!It is a light movie, that mixes comedy with suspense and it's an enjoyable surprise. All of the comedy/light movies that Hitchcock made are underrated (see the example of "The trouble with Harry"(1955)) and I can't understand why.This has some scenes that demonstrate the mastery of Alfred Hitchcock, notably the car scene where one couple is inside a moving car with the brakes sabotaged.That scene is so well constructed that you actually can feel like you are in the car... Amazing!I watched in the "Making of" this picture someone saying that, at that time, people knew this would be the last Hitchcock movie it would have been received way better by the audience.

		<shortDescription>A lighthearted suspense thriller? Yes, a la Hitchcock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Family Plot (1976)It all is a playful gag by the end--not the end of the movie, but of the career, the long cat and mouse movie-making career of Alfred Hitchcock. This, his last film, is both cute and clever and a tiny bit suspenseful. It reuses some of the same kinds of tricks we've seen from him before, with a twist here or there: the innocent protagonists, for example, are themselves up to a little bit of a scam. And in Hitchcock fashion, the antagonists, a parallel couple, are lighthearted in their murderousness. Their angst over crime is theatrical.There are usually moments in his movies that are vividly disturbing, and he contrasts these with either lightly comic scenes, downright silliness, or charming, everyday life. Think of the family in Shadow of a Doubt or Cary Grant in North by Northwest for starters. In this movie, beginning even with the pun of the title (the family plot is a cemetery plot), everything is chipper. The hair-raising runaway car scene is so scary and absurdly silly at the same time I think a lot of people will give up on the movie as just plain "stupid." Part of me agrees, but I laughed out loud through the whole scene in appreciation, and not because of comic timing or original sight gags or whatnot, but because I could imagine the director laughing. Movies are supposed to entertain, he would insist (supposedly saying to the impassioned Ingrid Bergman once, "Ingrid, it's just a movie.") Hitchcock wants it to be carefully silly and disarming at the same time. I mean, he's winking at us just as we are supposed to be scared.The evil-doers are really not very evil here, though the man does propose some pretty ruthless behavior, and the people out to do good (eventually, anyway, with dollar signs in their eyes all the same) are truly fun and natural as a couple. The plots of the two couples are separate at first, and once they join it gets complicated but never confusing. The Mustang is already eleven years old for this film--a sign of how far into our current era Hitchcock has come, and perhaps a reminder that his style of making movies is starting to look like just that, a style, something artificial and quaint when hard edged, elegant realism has stormed back into Hollywood (from Chinatown to the Godfather to, in 1976, uh, Rocky). If Hitch is out of touch with the times, he's completely in touch with his own approach. This is a Hitchcock film, through and through, and if you are tired of me saying that, it's because I think you might hate it without knowing how much it depends on knowing, liking, and understanding that kind of movie. It's totally enjoyable. Not his best, but enjoyable and well made and almost heartwarming, of all things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Family Plot is Alfred Hitchcock's last film, and what a way to end an extremely successful career. While competing with Jaws and The Exorcist, you can say that suspense was changing, yet Hitch decided to stick with what made him famous - CLASSIC suspense, that is, innocent people in dangerous situations, misfires, MacGuffins, and iconic ICONIC villains. You wonder why some people don't care for it, or even never heard of it. Family Plot includes all that makes a great motion picture.

		<fullReview>Though not as bland as The Trouble with Harry, or as ludicrous as Marnie, or as dull as Torn Curtain and Topaz, Hitchcock's last film is one of the masters least. Family Plot feels more Disney than Hitchcock; a combination of That Darn Cat and The North Avenue Irregulars. The plot, especially the crisscrossing of the various characters, is clumsy, and the film takes too long to set it all up. Hitch and screenwriter Ernest Lehman did it all better in North by Northwest. Family Plot lacks the sophisticated humor, suspense, and stellar performances that one associates with Hitchcock. The cast, Karen Black Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern are fine if somewhat lackluster, and the Hitchcock touch is rarely in evidence. Mildly diverting, but nothing memorable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable mystery movie involves a fake psychic, and her fiancé who attempt to locate the son of a wealthy and guilt-ridden old woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's final film , it was his fifty-third when made this lighthearted suspense story about a phony psychic/con artist named Blanche (Liza Minnelli, Beverly Sills, and Goldie Hawn were all considered for the role , Barbara Harris eventually was cast in the role ; apparently, Alfred Hitchcock was happy with the casting of Harris as he had apparently tried to hire her before)and her taxi driver/private investigator boyfriend (Bruce Dern who had previously worked with Alfred on episodes of Alfred Hitchcock presents as well as having had a small role in Marnie) who encounter a pair of serial kidnappers called Arthur (William Devane , though Roy Scheider and Burt Reynolds were considered for the part) and Fran (Karen Black) while trailing a missing heir in California . As an aging widow (Lillian Gish wanted to test for the role of Julia Rainbird but had been promised to Cathleen Nesbitt) to find her nephew who was given away for adoption many years earlier following a family scandal . Meanwhile, an extremely clever couple, an astute jeweler (Roy Thinnes was originally hired to play Arthur Adamson, but Hitchcock's first choice William Devane became available so Hitchcock fired Thinnes without a reason and hired Devane) and his enticing girlfriend are behind a series of kidnappings of various VIPs in the San Francisco area .Entertaining mystery movie packs thrills , humor , suspense and ordinary Hitch touches . This agreeable picture has some 'screwball comedy nature' that evokes Alfred Hitchcock's earlier flick ¨Mr. and Mrs. Smith¨. Alfred Hitchcock's films have become famous for a number of elements and iconography : vertiginous heights, innocent men wrongfully accused, blonde bombshells dressed in white, voyeurism, long non-dialogue sequences, etc. In this his final film, one last iconographic element was added to the canon: the woman in black . Karen Black plays a villainous character whose outfit is the antithesis of the blonde dressed in white , her costume comprises black hat, black dress, large black sunglasses obscuring the face and a long blonde wig . This menacing character image was notable in this movie and its image dominated in the film's printed promotional material and movie posters. The malevolent character-image has since been re-used in such famous movies as for character Bobbi in 'Brian De Palma''s Dressed to kill' and in Italian movies , the Giallo genre . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks such as Mount Rushmore in North by Northwest and the Statue of Liberty in Sabotage. Hitch apparently decided to leave this movie location unspecific and without recognizable landmarks and filmed it in the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco . Spectacular runaway car ride , although the famous car chase in this movie isn't technically really a car chase as the downhill car sequence only involves one car. The final shot in the movie, a wink by the Barbara Harris character was a jokey reference that was not planned but Alfred Hitchcock decided to leave in , this was arguably a fitting coda to his career exemplifying the black humor that was prevalent in his movies . Alfred Hitchcock once said of this film: ¨It's a melodrama treated with a bit of levity and sophistication , I wanted the feeling of the famous director Ernst Lubitsch making a mystery thriller." .The motion picture was well directed by Alfred Hitchcock , he was famous for making his actors follow the script to the word, but in this movie he let the characters improvise and use their own dialogue . After this movie was completed, Alfred Hitchcock worked on the film script for the spy thriller 'The Short Night'. Alfred Hitchcock was seriously in ill-health during the production of this movie , this lead to this picture being his final ever film. He never got to direct it due to his ailing health and it was not made. It would have been his fifty-fourth film. 'The Short Night' still has never been filmed to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Last Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is a staple in cinematic history. From spy thrillers to horror films he is hands down one the greatest film makers of all time and a lot can be said about him. Pretty much every single movie he ever made is good. I haven't seen one director where you can actually watch all of his movies and then say, "All of them were good". Hitchcock gave new life to suspense films and advanced film making as we know it today by his unique build ups of tension and interesting sense of direction, as well as an entirely new approach to film making. Alfred Hitchcock began making movies as early as the late 20s all the way up to the mid 70s. Never making a less than satisfactory film. Even in the 60s he had his own television series called Alfred Hitchcock Presents which followed in the same spirit of The Twilight Zone. Most film makers when nearing the end of they're career start to make movies that begin a gradual slope down hill and he begins to loose touch, however Hitchcock is the exact opposite.The Family Plot would be Alfred Hitchcock's last film before his death in 1980. The film follows a phony psychic Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) and friend George Lumely (Bruce Dern) who get caught up in a case of stolen diamonds and an unsolved murder mystery. When one of Blanch's clients explains of a family jewel getting lost over the years she gets her friend George to act as a private investigator to try and track down a man by the name of Eddie Shoebridge. A man no has heard of or seen. In fact no one even knows for sure if he's dead or not. With criminals riding on their tale and time running out, this movie is an excellent suspense builder and is very satisfying.Alfred Hitchcock's dedication to his movies are amazing. He was 76 years old when he made this ! And yet with old age catching up with him he still doesn't fail in keeping you entertained and intrigued by his movies. RIP Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, You Really MUST See this Twice - At Least!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FAMILY PLOT has earned a permanent footnote in cinematic history simply because it turned out to be Alfred Hitchcock's last production. Unfortunately, it did not do very well on its initial release because many found it too comic and lighthearted in tone and not "suspenseful" enough. Even Stephen King described it as a "turkey" in his book DANSE MACABRE! I think the real problem with this underrated delight is that this is one of Hitch's most complex, densely-written stories - Ernest Lehman's script is awe-inspiring, almost novelistic, and chock-full of double meanings and implications which may not strike you on a single viewing. Like all the characters in the movie, FAMILY PLOT is not what it seems to be. On the surface, we have a light, comic thriller involving a psychic (Blanche/Barbara Harris) and her actor boyfriend, Lumley (Bruce Dern) who have been hired by a rich old woman to find her missing nephew, the heir to a huge fortune. The missing nephew turns out to be the thoroughly repellent Arthur Adamson (William Devane, in a role originally intended for Jack Nicholson - who would have been PERFECT in the part but who wanted too much money!), a sociopath who, with the help of his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black), kidnaps important people and holds them for ransom. But Adamson is not just a thief - he is also a killer. When he realizes Blanche and Lumley are trying to find out information about him, he assumes - incorrectly and ironically - that they are undercover agents looking to arrest and expose him as a kidnapper. Of course, Blanche and Lumley know nothing of Adamson's crimes, and thus put themselves in great danger without realizing it. In a way, I consider FAMILY PLOT to be Hitchcock's most perfect work of sheer suspense - after the first 10 minutes, the audience always knows more than any of the characters, and all we can do is wait for them to come together, which makes for some very anxious moments! FAMILY PLOT'S comic tone is belied by some dark moral undercurrents rife with unsettling implications. The dominant characters, Blanche and Adamson, are in fact very similar people, although in dramatic terms one is the heroine and the other the villain. Adamson is a liar, a thief, and a con artist. Blanche (a fake psychic who bilks lonely old women out of their money) is also a liar, a thief (she essentially steals from her clients by faking her "powers") and a con artist motivated by greed. Both heroine and villain also dominate their lovers - Blanche uses her sexual hold over the rather naive (but smart and loving) Lumley to get him to adopt all sorts of identities to further THEIR plot, and Adamson does the exact same thing to Fran, forcing her to assume false appearances in the course of furthering HIS plots. Although one couple is labeled as "good" and the other as "bad", morally, they are not so far apart from one another. Indeed, everyone in the film manipulates and lies to others to achieve none-too-pleasant ends. Even old Julia Rainbird, whose guilt over ostracizing her dead sister and the girl's illegitimate child sets the story in motion, has used and deceived others for her own selfish goals. The vision of humanity in this film is essentially dark - people are monsters of greed and deceit, willing to use anyone and everyone for money, and even risking the lives of those they love in the process. This makes the film's undeniable humor even more disturbing - what are we really laughing at when we laugh at these sad and confused people? The performances by the four principals are top-notch, especially by Harris as the ditzy "psychic" who isn't the dumb blonde she appears to be, and by Devane as the evil killer who presents himself as a respectable businessman. The movie also contains two truly spectacular Hitchcockian "set-pieces" - the justly famous scene where Blanche and Lumley are trapped in a speeding car (has me on the edge of my seat every time!) and a brilliant sequence which begins with the "drop-off" of a kidnapping victim and ends with the long-awaited meeting of Blanche and Adamson. Hitchcock always gave us what we didn't expect, and FAMILY PLOT is no exception. This movie was way ahead of its time and deserves a better reputation than it has. My favorite bit of dialogue: "You're a Capricorn, aren't you?" "No, I'm a Leo." "That's what I thought."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enigmatic but intriguing end to a long career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, "Family Plot" is what "The Trouble With Harry" should have been. One reason is that in the late 1950s Americans were uncomfortable with British irony - particularly when it concerns death! In that film, the acting was rather stilted; casting seemed to have been dictated more by the front offices than what Hitchcock might have preferred. The "studio-ness" of that film is pretty obvious by today's standards. For that matter, audiences of the late 1950s would not have been prepared for "Psycho" and "Marnie"."Family Plot" is made for a more sophisticated America, and also benefits from some unusual casting. For instance, using the rangy Bruce Dern as a sexy male character. Look at his scenes with Barbara Harris, where food is a metaphor for sex! Interaction between this dubious couple, as well as between William DeVane and Karen Black are priceless. So is Harris' (unintended) wink to the camera at the end of the film. This film has a lightness missing from most of Hitchcock's work since "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith" (with a strong performance from Carole Lombard yet a facile performance from Robert Montgomery).Other films were planned, but Hitchcock's health was failing; a series of strokes had robbed him of energy and focus. As "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" was his first Hollywood film and "Family Plot" his last, the circle is closed with two comedies of slightly dubious nature. With both of these films, the joke is on nobody: we can laugh with everyone...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's last film ? a smooth and satisfactory end to his illustrious career.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half a century after releasing his first film (The Pleasure Garden), Alfred Hitchcock here releases his last (Family Plot). An intricately plotted thriller taken from a novel entitled "The Rainbird Pattern" by Victor Canning, this film reunites Hitchcock with his North By Northwest script writer Ernest Lehman. While the magic of that earlier masterpiece may be missing, Family Plot remains an enjoyable and intelligently crafted film. It has its share of flaws, but a flawed Hitchcock is still preferable to most directors working at the top of their game.Fake medium Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) makes a living by pretending to help people speak to their deceased relatives. Secretly, she assigns her boyfriend and chauffeur George (Bruce Dern) to carry out background investigations upon her clients, thereby gathering enough details about them and their beloved dead to make her act seem convincing. The plot thickens when Blanche starts performing clairvoyance for a woman named Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt). Julia has been suffering from nightmares, having long ago given away her sister Harriet's illegitimate baby son. In a fit of guilt, Julia now wants to track down the long-lost nephew and shower him with the family wealth by way of apology. The plot thickens even further when a pair of kidnappers enter the frame. Jeweller Arthur Adamson (William Devane) and his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black) have become masters at abducting wealthy folk and demanding a ransom in priceless diamonds for their safe return. Arthur and Fran learn of the Rainbird fortune, and plot to target Julia and her missing nephew as their next victims. After a series of complicated events, the two kidnappers (Arthur and Fran) learn that they have opposition in the shape of Blanche and George, and plan to bump them off. But the battle of wits between the two parties is never as straightforward as it seems?.Hitchcock encourages wonderful performances from his stars. Dern gives possibly his career-best performance as the oddball anti-hero, while Harris is thoroughly entertaining as the fake medium and Devane silkily sinister as the villain. The film is somewhat overlong, and the plot threatens to topple into incoherency at some points, but just as things are in danger of coming apart Hitchcock manages to rein them back into a cohesive whole. John Williams provides a classy music score and the photography by Leonard J. South is excellent. It is sad that Hitchcock was unable to make any more films after this one. Coupled with his penultimate film Frenzy (1972), there were promising signs here that he was on his way back to form, following a couple of back-to-back '60s disappointments (Torn Curtain and Topaz). While Family Plot might not be absolute vintage Hitchcock, it still emerges a polished, smooth and playfully suspenseful thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good closing to a great career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family Plot, Hitchcock's last film, is a good movie. It's engaging and interesting. It has decent acting, the directing is solid. Of course, that's a pretty bland description, which matches the movie quite well.The problem with Family Plot is not that it isn't good, but that it isn't GREAT. Because when Alfred Hitchcock was behind the camera, GREAT was usually the least one could expect.Hitchcock's success was not because of those he surrounded himself with, as someone below so ignorantly suggested. It was because he was a master at manipulating the audience and drawing them into his films. Granted, Herrmann's scores helped, but Herrmann didn't do every American Hitchcock movie (Rebecca won Best Picture without the talents of Herrmann). Neither did Hitchcock's favorite cinematographer. Not to mention The Lodger, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps are considered some of the greatest movies ever: all were made in Britain while Hitchcock was being considered the greatest director in THAT country.But by the time Marnie was made, and Hitchcock feuded with star and object of his obsession Tippi Hedrin, his heart went out of movie-making, and the films afterward seemed to lack a general Hitchcockian quality. Instead, flashes of the Hitchcock genius could be caught only in particular scenes (The murder in Torn Curtain, the purple dress in Topaz, the stairway in Frenzy). Unlike Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Strangers on a Train, Notorious, Rebecca, etc., where the whole movie seemed inspired, Hitchcock only showed flashes of his original genius.Family Plot effectively shows no signs of Hitchcock's genius, creating only a "good" movie with no classic scenes to make it distinctively Hitchcock. It is a sad ending to a glorious career. Sad, only in that a genius' final movie can "only" be called good.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Hitchcock movie that I have seen so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My headline says it all. After seeing some a mixture of masterful, entertaining,and occasionally mediocre Hitchcock films, I saw this "Family Plot" on television awhile back. This was admittedly last Hitchcock's film so I suppose I should give him some slack.There always tends to be some elements of humour in his films, although its usually dark humour. If I am not mistaken this his first attempt at real comedy, and sorry to say he fails at it. Perhaps this is mostly due to the actors. And I apologize if I am offending anyone here but I don't find Bruce Dern or William Devane to be very good actors on the whole, and none of the other actors/actresses seem to bring too much to the project either.Hitchcock even was very disappointed in this film the way it turned out, and I can see why. To put it simply, it's not funny and the story isn't very engaging the way it's presented. There is bound to many people that disagree with me, but that's my assessment.If you are a Hitchcock fan, I would check it out just to say you have seen it and make your own assessment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last One, From the Master of Suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt, Notorious, Rope, Strangers on a Train, Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho &amp; The Birds comes the final feature film of his great &amp; glorious career. And although it may be no match to any of the above mentioned films, it nonetheless works as what it is in the first place; a dark comedy.Alfred Hitchcock's Family Plot tells the story of two couples; one consists of a fake psychic &amp; a cab driver who together make up as petty con artists while the other couple kidnap rich people for ransoms. The plot concerns the search of a missing heir that brings the petty criminals in conflict with the smooth professionals leading to some unexpected consequences.Finely directed by Hitchcock, the film suffers when compared to previous classics in the director's impressive filmography but it is clever &amp; strong enough to stand on its own. It is a crime thriller but a very light-hearted one that benefits from fine dose of performances from its cast as well as crew. And throughout its runtime, it manages to keep a very playful atmosphere even when the events become suspenseful.On an overall scale, carrying the same elements of suspense in its plot that has virtually defined almost all Hitchcock films, Family Plot embraces his usual storytelling technique with enough measure of thriller &amp; mystery in its bag but this time it's also blended with smart flair of light- hearted &amp; well-executed humour. Not a memorable movie by any means but destined to be remembered as the last one from 'The Master of Suspense'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable film, but definitely not one of Alfred's best, or even in his top 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it's definitely not one of Hitchcock's best probably not even in his top 10, but still an enjoyable film. I think this is first time I ever heard a curse word in one of his films. It felt terribly out of place within the film. The plot was interesting, and I found myself on the edge of my seat a couple of times. The car crash scene was certainly a highlight very thrilling, however, the actions of the Blanche character were very irritating. All the little attempts to add humor into this film were a complete failure IMHO.Overall, if you're a Hitchcock die hard like myself, you must watch it. But if you haven't ever seen 'Vertigo', 'Psycho', 'Marnie', 'The Birds', 'Dial M for Murder', 'Rear Window', etc., watch those first. This can definitely be considered one of his "weaker" efforts for lack of a better word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film doesn't have any "meaning" beyond the obvious. As in "39 Steps" it is fun all the way through. There are no dark hues as in the remarkable "Vertigo", "Rear Window". "Psycho" or similar films during Hitch's great period. This one is as light as a soufflé and wonderfully amusing. The episode in the runaway car is one of the funniest on record and a joy to behold over and over. The musical score is sparkling and the actors are perfect in their roles. With so many heavy-handed, belabored comedies made at the time it's amazing this one got passed up. I suppose the people who continually think of Hitchcock as "The Master of Suspense" or, to the other extreme, the "Searchers of Meaning" it might fall a bit short, but it's not aiming in that direction at all. How can there be a pint to miss at all if there never was one in the first place? It's top-rate entertainment, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blanche and George (Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern) are small time operators who use Blanche's supposed abilities as a medium to con trusting old souls out of a few dollars. Their latest mark has agreed to give them $10,000 if they can help her locate a long lost family member. Meanwhile, successful jewelry merchant Arthur (William Devane) and girlfriend Fran (Karen Black) have made something of a career of kidnapping wealthy individuals and ransoming them for diamonds. As luck would have it, the trail of the missing relative leads to Arthur. Not knowing what the pair of would-be detectives is up to and assuming the worst, Arthur quite naturally decides that he and Fran must put a stop to Blanche and George's snooping.I'm joining the chorus singing the praises of Family Plot. Like a lot of others, I think it gets a bad rap. Sure, it's not the best thing Hitchcock ever directed, but come on, it's still a very entertaining, funny movie. It may lack the nail-biting, gut-wrenching suspense of Notorious and the horrific elements and images of Psycho, but it was never meant to be like those two films. Besides, I don't want to see the same movie over and over anyway. What's wrong with a little diversity and a change of pace? I've always thought Hitchcock did a great job with Family Plot. He manages to take two completely different plot lines and seamlessly and expertly merge them together. He mixes just the right amount of generally understated comedy with a thrilling conclusion. Ernest Lehman's screenplay is smart and filled with some terrifically dark humor that almost always hits the nail on the head. The film may run long for a comedy at 121 minutes, but I can't think of a wasted scene or moment that should have been cut out. I also like the way the audience is allowed to play along with the movie. The audience discovers plot points right along with the characters. There are no "cheats".But as much as I enjoy the script and as talented as Hitchcock my have been, it's the cast that makes Family Plot really special. From Karen Black's cool entrance in the black trench coat and hat to William Devane's toothy and creepy smile to Bruce Dern's wild hair and constant fidgeting with his pipe to Barbara Harris' hysterical and manipulative séance scenes, I really cannot pick a favorite. They are all equally fantastic. And, I cannot imagine Family Plot without even one of this quartet of actors.In the end, Family Plot is a neat little movie. It may not be Hitchcock's best or most suspenseful or most horrific or most dramatic, but it just might be amongst his most fun.</fullReview>

None of the leads have the charisma to carry a film and--it being Hitchcock's last when he was in ill health--you have to wonder whether the master himself was simply not up to the job.It's a mixed bag of plot elements thrown together with comic moments and occasional bits of suspense, but none of it is anything you're going to remember after seeing the plot unwind, unlike other Hitchcock films that stay with you for a long while.Unless you must see every Hitchcock film, this one can rest in its vault where it belongs in a plot of its own gathering dust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phony medium Barbara Harris and her bumbling boyfriend Bruce Dern set out to find a customer's lost heir in order to reap rewards of their own. They soon cross paths with jewel thieves William Devane and Karen Black. Misunderstanding ensue.From the opening titles to the final wink at the audience, this film has Alfred Hitchcock written all over it. What sets it apart from the other films from the end of his career is a somewhat zany sense of humor ? easily the most intentional humor since "The Trouble with Harry." The film is highly uneven at times ? Harris, for example, goes obnoxiously over-the-top (perhaps at Hitch's direction) during a drunken car ride ? but like any film Hitch directed, the pros outweigh the cons. The cast appears to have had fun with their roles, the visuals are generally striking and the story features a lot of clever twists. While it's hardly a masterpiece like some of the other films that Hitchcock directed, it's a fun way to pass two hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grifter vs. grifter in Hitchcock's last hurrah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though not one of Hitchcock's best, this dark comedy is well worth watching. Bruce Dern is at the peak of his dumb smart guy or smart dumb guy form. William Devane makes a terrific heavy. Barbara Harris is a dandy overly stimulated sex kitten psychic. And Karen Black has a field day playing what is almost a parody of the traditional femme fatale. Hollywood was just opening up for more explicit screen sexuality in 1976 with the newly created rating system feeling its way around the moral fabric of the movie industry. So the sexual innuendos were much more titillating when "Family Plot" was first released than today. The expletives sound tame now but were still somewhat shocking coming from the big screen in 1976. Otherwise, the film has lost none of its punch.Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernest Lehman rework their scene down the California mountain highway from "North By Northwest," making it into a screamingly hysterical runaway automobile sequence with Blanche (Barbara Harris) nearly choking her paramour George (Bruce Dern) to death with his own necktie (with shades of Hitchcock's two necktie murder films, "Young and Innocent" and "Frenzy").A weakness in Hitchcock's final outing is the music of John Williams. I know that as a composer he is highly praised by many and received kudos for his "Star Wars" scores, but to me all his music sounds about the same, mainly variations on his "Star Wars" theme. His score for "Family Plot" reminds me of Ron Goodwin's music from the four Miss Marple films of the early 60's. Bernard Herrmann where are you when we need you? Alas, he had passed away while "Family Plot" was in the making.Hitchcock always had a way with words, making wild use of double entendre. The title "Family Plot" speaks for itself. A novel approach is used by pitting one grifting couple against another grifting couple, one involved in nickle and dime chicanery, the other in more serious business such as kidnapping and murder. Ed Lauter does a good job as the deadly but not overly bright henchman for Arthur and Fran (Devane and Black). Hitchcock had a tendency to make his films overly long which at times slowed down the action. This holds true for "Family Plot." Many of his fairly abrupt endings worked. The one for "Family Plot" is a little too abrupt, all the pieces falling into place much to conveniently. Besides this nitpicking, "Family Plot" is not a bad way to end a distinguished career as a master director of suspense and disseminator of creative movie making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I should be much more exposed to Alfred Hitchcock's films (I have seen "North by Northwest" and "Vertigo"), and I've heard that a number of great scenes from his earlier films are echoed in this, his last film. The film was interesting, and had a complex plot of two scheming duos whose schemes intersect. I saw it on videotape today, Dec. 27, 2000.Blanch Tyler (Barbara Harris), a poor psychic, can win $10,000 if she can find a lost nephew for a client, and enlists the help of her taxi-driver friend George (Bruce Dern). In the meantime, a diamond merchant, Arthur Adamson (William Devane) and his wife Fran (Karen Black) are involved with kidnappings and amassing a fortune of rare diamonds. Throw in a mysterious gravestone, a car going down a mountain-side with its brakes tampered with and no longer working, and an attempted murder, and we have the material for Hitchcock's magic to go to work. I don't know why the film was billed as a comedy, but it was a thriller. It was entertaining, and I enjoyed one scene where Hitchcock's trademark silhouette is seen. I'm glad I saw it, but it doesn't seem to have the greatness of the few other films of Hitchcock's that I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**GRADE: B+ / 79**WARNING: IT MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERSAccording to the critics and moviegoers in general, the last film of a famous director before his death is one of his weakest works. Maybe because he is old and tired, maybe because there's no great idea on his mind. Well, I don't think the same. Just take a look at Kubrick's mesmerizing "Eyes Wide Shut". And also at Hitchcock's "Family Plot", a lighthearted, amusing comedy/mystery, that may be one of his most entertaining films.Far from a PERFECT movie, "Family Plot" is not among the master's best pictures ("Psycho", "Vertigo", "North by Northwest" and others), but is certainly a very good film. With 77 years old, Hitch still had creativity and irony to build one interesting story about two couples of cheaters who get connected after strange facts happen. A fake psychic (or not) named Blanche Tyler is given the opportunity to win $10 thousand dollars by one of her clients, Mrs. Rainbird, but she wins the money only if she finds Rainbird's sister's lost son. Blanche's boyfriend George, a taxi driver, will help on the mission. While that happens, Arthur Adamson and Fran, a rich couple, are getting a rare diamond by blackmailing the police and kidnapping a rich man, hiding him in a secret room on their garage. This seems to be a common process to win easy money for them. After some investigations, the first couple finds out that Arthur is Rainbird's nephew, and things start to get really dangerous because of some past secrets. And there's much more to come. Confusing plot? Not at all, if told by Hitch. Suspenseful, entertaining, funny, yes!Hitchcock had a grand finale with "Family Plot", because it is an easy film to follow, uncompromising in a good way, with a well told story that only goes down a little in the end, but it doesn't matter. The screenplay is great, the direction... I don't even need to say, and the acting just helps to get into the right tone. Here we have Karen Black and Barbara Harris together again, only one year after Robert Altman's masterpiece "Nashville". Karen was a country singer there, here she is Fran, the villain. Barbara was the rising star who shined in the unforgettable end of "Nashville", here she is the "good cheater", Blanche, on a very funny performance.In resume, "Family Plot" is not a masterpiece, but has many merits. So watch this delightful film and let the master rest in piece.--&gt; NOTE: Hitchcock had his strangest cameo in "Family Plot". His silhouette appears on a door... Inside a place where you catch birth and DEATH papers. Spooky, isn't it, considering that this was his last film before his death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock has the last laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Hitchcocks last movie. He was very ill on set, and he did well to finish this. There are more "sexual innuendo" lines than in any of his other movies. Perhaps he was telling us.......I do have a naughty side and a sense of humour. Bruce Dern and Karen Black are pretty good and the pace is always fast. This last Hitchcock film was not well received (particularly in America). One of the reasons was Alfreds VERY English &amp; naughty sense of humour. There are vast differences between American humour and British humour. Hitchcock finished his great career ..............with one for the Brits. Well done Alfred.....we all know American humour is....ummmm not at all funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock movies are not known for their poignancy. They may have been at turns exciting and funny, but he is one of the few legendary directors whose work can never be said to have shed a tear. And yet, Family Plot is just a little poignant in its context, as this is the last picture Hitch would ever make, and he probably guessed it himself due to his failing health. There is a certain sadness in seeing this old man of classic cinema doing things his way in New Wave Hollywood. He was among the last of his generation still around, and while he had long since made his last masterpiece, Family Plot contains all the cunning craftsmanship that earned its creator the soubriquet "Master of Suspense?".The screenplay for Family Plot is by one of Hitch's old collaborators, Ernest Lehman, who also wrote North by Northwest. It's based on a serious novel by popular English writer Victor Canning, but at the director's behest Lehman spoofed it up into a comedy. You can see why. As a basic plot it's a bit of a by-the-numbers thriller, and there are some dreadfully corny moments like the slowness with which Bruce Dern deduces that one gravestone is newer than the other. The story is so formulaic it becomes silly, so why not acknowledge and exaggerate that? But Family Plot does not descend into outright farce, and is in fact rarely really laugh-out-loud funny. Instead it contains just the right balance between a lightly comical tone and a genuine thriller to be fully enjoyable. The end result has many of the qualities of 1973 hit The Sting, with likable petty con artists getting one over on serious big-time crooks, and all the easygoing lightness of the earlier picture.That leading duo of tricksters are played by Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris. Apparently at one point the roles were to have gone to Al Pacino and Liza Minnelli respectively. Now, while Pacino and Minnelli are two of the most talented stars of their generation, and certainly adept at comedy, there is something about the imperfect competence of Dern and Harris that makes them better for these parts. Dern has this good-natured irritability, and his wonky features make him an appropriately homely hero. Harris too is such an unpretentious player that her switching in and out of demented psychic performance seems natural to her person, and not the hammy bit of scenery-chewing it really is. On top of that the two of them have a really wonderful chemistry that I cannot imagine between Pacino and Minnelli. As the villain of the piece we have William Devane, who appears like a slightly crazier version of Robert Shaw in The Sting. His performance is serenely laid back but with an air of suppressed energy, as if he could explode into maniacal anger at any moment.But ultimately Family plot is a Hitchcock piece, and it is his masterly presence that drives the picture. He may be dealing with the actors, settings and language of a modern generation, but his cinematic design still follows the principles he developed thirty years earlier. It's his ability to lead the audience through the plot visually that has always been his greatest strength. You can see this in the opening scene, where the mid-shots show us Harris's psychic act duping old Mrs Rainbird, while a couple of sly close-ups show us what she is really thinking. In a really clever shot the chandelier in Devane's lair is given prominence, apparently coincidentally, but this pays off a minute later when we are gradually drawn in on it to realise it is the hiding place of the jewel, while the conversation between Devane and Karen Black about the jewel being hidden where everyone could see it continues offscreen. This is Hitch's cheeky nod to the audience ? very deliberately and obviously showing us something whilst we hear a character being contrastingly evasive about it. Hitchcock remains a very influential director and hundreds of youngsters have tried to emulate his style, but by and large they fail to achieve the sense of personality that the Master of Suspense? puts through the camera. It is the touch of the true storyteller, to be able to step outside the narrative and give us some little aside, a "by-the-way" moment or a knowing wink, all without breaking the spell of the story. This is what makes Alfred Hitchcock the cinematic icon he is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It plays like a made for TV movie with a lot of obscenities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris are looking for the long-lost nephew of an old rich lady. That's because during a phony séance orchestrated by Harris, the lady revealed that she was feeling very guilty about forcing her sister to put up her illegitimate child for adoption and she'd be willing to pay $10,000 to find him. At the same time, there is a seemingly unrelated plot about master thieves who kidnap rich folks and seem to make no mistakes at all. How the two plots eventually converged and the trip along the way was rather pleasant--and a bit light-hearted from time to time. But, still there was no magic and the performances, at times, were pretty broad and overly silly.Aside from a lot of cursing (far more than I would have expected from the usually classy Hitchcock), this movie looked a lot like a made for TV movie. That's because the usual Hitchcock polish and plot just aren't to be found in this film. While it's a pleasant little mystery, Bruce Dern, William Devane, Barbara Harris and Karen Black seem to lack the class and quality of old-time Hitchcock actors such as Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Robert Donat, Joan Fontaine, etc. Because of this, it was a sad ending to the director's long and distinguished career. Now this ISN'T to say this is a bad film--I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. It just showed no evidence of greatness--something most people come to expect from this director.By the way, for those looking for the "hidden Hitchcock", you see his silhouette relatively early on in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice note to retire on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A charming light film - better than many others by Hitchcock, who often fails because he acts as though he doesn't know HOW to be light-hearted. (But if you ask me the best thing he ever made was "The Lady Vanishes", way back in 1938.) It's fitting that for his last work he makes something of a return to his British style. He hadn't done so on earlier excursions back to London: "Stage Fright" (1950) is American through and through, and incidentally the worst film of his I've seen, likely to be exceeded in awfulness only by the early silent films that nobody ever watches, while "Frenzy" (1972), although it's one of his best films, is also his grimmest."Family Plot" is tightly constructed, yet told with pleasing nonchalance. It takes a couple of unusually poor crooks and a couple of rich crooks, who happen to be tied to opposite ends of a very long piece of string, and it slowly winds them together until they bang against each other. It contains at least two first-rate Hitchcock set pieces: one seemingly conventional (a car without brakes), and the other decidedly unconventional (an almost slow motion "pursuit" through a cemetery, which is compelling even though it's not easy to say why).The cast is neither bad nor particularly impressive - but, let's be honest, that's often the case with Hitchcock. The art direction and use of colour photography is competent without being masterful (again, this is typical, although in this respect, Hitchcock's films had until 1976 gradually been getting better). In many ways "Family Plot" is like Powell and Pressburger's last full-length collaboration, "They're a Weird Mob" - a pleasant, cheery film that has almost no connection whatever with anything they'd worked on beforehand, and which is often unfairly dismissed for that reason alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Family Plot", a plot to satisfy Hitch fans' family, the fitting conclusion to one of the greatest cinematic oeuvres...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Murder can be fun", said Hitchcock to the then-rising composer John Williams, unsure about the use of playful theme for ominous situations. Well, after watching "Family Plot" again, I would say that anything handled by Hitchcock can be fun. And it is not surprising that the original novel titled "The Rainbird Pattern" saw it dark material turned into a lighthearted comedy by Ernest Lehman's inspired writing and Hitchcock's wicked sense of humor, in the same vein than "To Catch a Thief" and "The Trouble With Harry". And I think this says a lot about a fascinating mix of self-confidence and humility that -I guess- only experienced directors can demonstrate at the twilight of their career. And I'm convinced that it took the two 60's misfires "Torn Curtain" and "Topaz" to put Hitchcock on the right track and allow him to make movies that would be more fitting swan songs. So Hitchcock was back to his roots (in every meaning) with the wonderful "Frenzy", a thriller certainly not devoid of macabre humor. Indeed, who can ever forget the villain's struggle to get his pin off the hand of his last victim, hidden in a bag of potatoes, and the whole action set in a moving truck? Frenzy was a legitimate thriller but its darkly comedic undertones worked as the perfect transition to a more relaxed and upbeat "Family Plot", definitely a comedy, with a good balance of thrills and suspense.The film starts in a wealth elderly woman's house, Blanche Tyler, a psychic in trance, tries to communicate with the woman's sister, using different voices, howling, screaming, giving such an over-the-top performance we suspect she belongs to the fraudulent side of the business, but it takes some great acting to perform the bad one, and Barbara Harris, whenever she's in that state, is a delight to watch, she'd be even funnier in a similar scene later with her boyfriend. The comedy is integral to the film's appeal, because the opening is extremely talkative and provides a vital flow of information and Harris' lively and funny performance catches our eyes, and inevitably our ears, and mind.So, it all comes down to the woman asking Blanche to find her sister's illegitimate son, abandoned to wanting to find her sister's illegitimate son, given for adoption, so she can clear her conscience and allow him to inherit her fortune; in exchange, Blanche will receive ten thousand dollars (and I just love Harris' cute response when she tries to pretend that money doesn't matter). Blanche is a small-time fraud and her boyfriend George, a cabdriver and wannabe actor, so the reward means a lot. But what an unlikely, non-glamorous, goofy yet charming couple to lead a Hitchcock film. But the chemistry between them, with all the talks about the 'plot', sex and their job, feels genuine and real.There is though another couple in the film, more in-line with the class and icy correctness we're used to deal with Hitch. A jeweler (David Levane) and his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black) specialized in kidnapping dignitaries and rich figures, leaving them up in exchange of precious gemstones. They hide their victims in a cellar and are so professional they make impossible any identification. The first transition from Blanche and George to Arthur and Fran is abrupt and disconcerting (although creatively done) but once we get it that the film centers on the two couples, the pros and the small-time crooks, we know where the film is going, two plots coming across each other, in other words: a confrontation.The thrill in "Family Plot" is to see these couples getting closer to each other, and even play a sprinkled-sprinkler game when George's lousy attempt to pass a lawyer raises the suspicion of Adamson's former accomplice (he's obviously the lost heir, as it's the only way the two plots would converge). So the cat and mouse's role are reversed and Fran and Arthur spy George and Blanche, thinking they want the reward for their capture. Which would lead to the first life-threatening sequence with a high-speed descent in a mountain road, and as much I enjoyed it, I can't get over the hilariously distorted face of George, crushed under Blanche's shoe, while she tries to climb her way out of the vehicle.Just like the plot swings back and forth between two couples that couldn't have been different, it does the same thing with thrills and comedy, the result is splendid and entertaining. Hitchcock also provide some pretty memorable moments: Adamson delicately taking a lint off a cop's suit, Fran putting parsley in the hostage's plate, a dazzling aerial view on a cemetery and a great kidnapping scene in a church where a bishop is taken away without any of the people reacting. Adamson knew that church-people are so polite and inhibited they wouldn't react, and we believe him. This level of confidence echoes Hitchcock's, he doesn't go to intricate and lengthy extremes to get a specific job done. And only Hitch can get away with it.This is a film for the fans, his cameo doesn't bother to show his face and yet everyone immediately recognizes him, this is why his last cameo is one of his most inspired. Hitchcock have built so much confidence that only he could conclude such a film with a climax relying on something that a child could have done, but knowing the childish Blanche and her slow-witted boyfriend, it could work. And although the film wasn't intended to be the last, it couldn't have had a better final shot than a wink at the camera. Hitchcock always did movies with the audience in mind, it's all natural to end with what a friendly farewell to those he toyed with their emotions for half a century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An oddity in Hitch's filmography .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Al Pacino,I read that you rejected the lead role in this Hitchcock film. You went and made Bobby Deerfield instead. It would have been cool to see you in a Hitchcock film. Even though this is nowhere close to Hitch's best.Two sets of criminal couples (one murderous and the other one just small time crooks) are at odds with each other in this mysterious comedy.The film is a bit of an oddity in Hitch's filmography. There are some great directorial flourishes. The séance scene at the beginning is very mysterious and funny, John Williams score was pretty good. The scene in the car with the fake background that followed the séance was also great. The car going crazy was a great action scene. But some of the scenes go on for too long, the background score was unremarkable in places. De Palma did say that Hitch breaking up with Herrmann affected his last few films.Karen Black and Barbara Harris are beautiful in their own right, but when you consider all the beautiful women filmed by Hitch, they are right at the bottom of the list. I've never been that big a fan of Bruce Dern. I would have loved to see you in his role, Al. William Devine looked menacing with his toothy sinister smile.Overall, I'm not surprised you rejected this.Best Regards, Pimpin.(6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing storyline throughout with a sub standard climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well as most people would say...they just don't write screenplays like this anymore. But for good reason. When you invest the better part of two hours in watching a suspenseful film unfold and the five main characters show us who they really are we look forward to a strong film ending. Instead, what we receive for an ending is unfortunately below par for an Alfred Hitchcok directed film. Please don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed this film and it is well worth watching even a second time as the performances of the top five characters certainly did not disappoint. William Devane is a standout in the dual role as the missing heir Edward Shoebridge and as his hidden identity as high stakes con man named Arthur Adamson, a well dressed jewellery store owner. His partner in crime is the mysterious blonde wig and six inch high heels wearing femme fatale' named Fran. These two high priced grifters who make a great living kidnapping wealthy people and holding them for ransom in their secret basement fortress indicates that they are shrewd and tactful in planning their kidnappings and reaping the rewards for diamonds as their preferred ransom payment.William Devane and Karen Black play polar opposite to the other two low class grifters played by Barbara Harris as Blanche Tyler who eeks out a living as a spiritualist bringing back the voices of the dead for living family members who get suckered in to this old con game. Her boyfriend is a Taxi cab driver named George Lumley played superbly by the great character actor Bruce Dern. Now George will do just about anything for Blanche so when Blanche tells George she has a rich client that is trying to find a bastard nephew birthed 40 years ago by her now deceased sister and there is 10 grand in it if they find him we immediately assume that George will play the part of the missing heir Edward Shoebridge to claim the reward money of 10 grand. Instead George laces up his private gum shoes and goes on an expedition to try and locate this missing heir named Edward Showbridge. George does not exactly find Edward Shoebridge but he finds the next best thing. George finds a guy named Joseph Maloney played very well by then 38 year old Ed Lauter.As the plot becomes more complex the comedy relief kicks in between Blanche and George arguing amongst themselves how far they should go to recover the 10 grand reward. In the meantime the high class grifter team of Arthur Adamson (William Devane) and Fran (Karen Black) continue kidnapping high profile wealthy clients with well thought out plans that leave nothing to risk for their big rewards.As the low class grifters Blanche and George continue to get closer on to the heels of their missing heir Edward Shoebridge (alias Arthur Adamson) Arthur and his childhood friend Joseph Mahoney develop a plan to get rid of these two low lifes Blanche and George for good. There is a scene where Blanch and George get baited by Joseph Maloney to meet him out in the remote highway roadway diner for $200 and for that price Joseph Maloney will divulge how they can locate the missing heir Edawrd Shoebridge. The meeting though never transpires and Blanche and George leave the roadside diner empty handed and very disappointed. Little do they know that their vehicle has been tampered with and the next two minutes takes George who is driving and Blanche who is hilariously hanging on to George for dear life as he attempts to take the long and winding hilly roads without killing the two of them. This scene is worth watching the film for alone. It is both suspenseful and oh so comical. I could envision Ms. Shullivan hanging on to me for dear life if we were caught on a windy road with no brakes.I won't divulge the ending, rather I will leave you with this cliffhanger both literally and figuratively. I did mention the climax was a bit disappointing but this adventure/suspense/crime/comedy film has much to be satisfied with. I give it a high 7 out of 10 rating. Well worth a watch...maybe even twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but not great -- an interesting swansong for a master director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And now for something completely...different? Although he probably didn't think this would be his last film, Hitchcock certainly picked an interesting project to go out on. FAMILY PLOT is about two criminal couples who paths happen to cross in a surprising way. Perhaps more than any film in his corpus (that I've seen so far), FAMILY PLOT has a lighthearted tone while maintaining that edge that Hitchcock was so well-known for. The plot is a bit convoluted, as is to be expected, but the way in which it all comes together at the end was something to behold. I may have criticized his earlier films for their endings, but he seems to have come up with the perfect one here. Not to mention, the final sequence was as suspenseful as anything he did in his prime. Here, he collaborated again with writer Ernest Lehman, who he worked with on NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Perhaps that's why the films feel so similar, at least tonally. There's also a hilarious car chase sequence which fares much better than Cary Grant's in NXNW, although the process shots/rear projection was just as noticeable. However, he worked with a new composer this time: a pre-Star Wars/Superman John Williams. While I wouldn't count this as one of his best, or most memorable, scores, it certainly fit the quirky tone of the film. If I had to describe it, the score (and the film) is somewhere between Monty Python and Matlock, if that makes any sense. As with his last couple pictures, this one doesn't really have any star power behind it, although I did recognize Bruce Dern from his small role in MARNIE. They all give decent if unspectacular performances, and their characters were reasonably developed. Of course, I loved all of the Hitchcockian touches in the camera-work and editing. Despite being advanced in age, he still could put together a great set-piece. Overall, this isn't top-tier Hitchcock, but it certainly made for an entertaining and satisfying swansong to an incredible career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Family Plot is definitely most famous for one thing. And that is that it was legendary director Alfred Hitchcock's last movie. It isn't generally considered amongst his better films; in fact many outright dislike it. For me, while I agree it's uneven, I find it very enjoyable and not such a bad way for the great man to bow out all things considered. It's about a con artist couple trying to get rich by means of having the woman pretend to be a psychic. Through this they are offered $10,000 by a rich elderly woman if they can find the son she put up for adoption forty years before. Their inquiries into the mystery put them on a dangerous path.You could say that this is a film about two crooked couples - the good-bad couple and the bad-bad one. The paths of both ultimately collide through fate and I suppose we are invited to compare both. The con artists are played by Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris, while the kidnappers are William Devane and Karen Black. All are good in their respective roles. As for Hitch himself, well it's not one of his most inventive films with not too many moments typical of him; although the introduction of the Karen Black character is very well done. Replete in blonde wig, shades and clad head to toe in leather, she looks very striking, she first appears when she steps out of the dark and is almost run over by Dern, thereby neatly inter-linking both strands of the story early on.If there is a clear weakness in the film, it's most probably that it cannot maintain both strands of the story without sacrificing the mystery element. For this reason, it's better earlier on. For the remainder of the movie Dern and Harris try to uncover what is going on but seeing as the audience know already it doesn't have much of an impact. I wonder if they had played up the mystery more, then this could have been a better film over all. But no matter because it still basically works. It essentially is a comedy-thriller. Sometimes combining both genres in one scene, for instance the sequence where a car with no brakes is hurtling down a mountain road. In this example, though, the combination of comedy and thrills doesn't entirely work because it's an exciting scene that is somewhat marred by Barbara Harris ridiculous comedy acting. In the main though, the comedy and suspense are kept apart which works far better. You could probably argue, however, that maybe the thriller side of the story doesn't go as far as it could. For example, the ending is very rushed and could have probably been thought out better. But, minor issues aside, I like this one.</fullReview>

He was quite ill and in his 70s. His skills are somewhat dated like the driving scenes. The pacing is quite slow early on. Once the two couples' paths intersect, the story gets much more compelling.

		<shortDescription>The Master of Suspense's swan-song, and a good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is nice to see that Family Plot is getting more recognition other than being the swan-song of one of the most influential directors in cinema. Despite Hitchcock being my favourite director, I wasn't sure whether I would like Family Plot after hearing from people, both on IMDb and outside, that it was one of his weakest. I'm glad I did see it(and I would have done anyway) because while it is not among Hitch's best(Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca) it is nowhere near one of his weakest(Jamaica Inn, Under Capricorn, Topaz, The Paradine Case). True, the film is a little long, the story is convoluted and a few scenes are incoherent as a result and Karen Black's character could have been much more developed. Family Plot does look good though(if not one of his best-looking films like Vertigo, To Catch a Thief and The Trouble with Harry), both audacious and gritty and the photography services these very well. John Williams' score is jaunty and haunting, and sensibly more restrained than some of the bombast of his very best scores.The dialogue has strong bouts of fun and tension with good interplay between the cast, the humour though is more a subtle blend rather than busting-your-gut every minute. There is also a lot of innuendo that surprises you at how much the film gets away with. The story is convoluted but still intriguing and doesn't feel dull, there is still a good amount of mystery and tension amongst the fun. The sequence with the car out of control was the film's most memorable one, and it seemed that Hitchcock was paying homage here to all his previous work(ie. the attempted murder with the neck-tie almost reminiscent of Frenzy, to me anyway). Hitchcock's directing was taut and sly, I didn't detect any evidence that he didn't have his heart in it, yes maybe Dern and Harris' characters are much more developed than those of Black and Devane's but I put that down to the writing too. The acting is fine, none of the four lead players give performances that rank among the best of any Hitchcock film but I didn't expect that. I don't think Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris have done better since, William Devane is very chilling and quite brutal and Karen Black seems to be having fun despite her character not being as developed well as the rest.In conclusion, a good swan-song, and while not among the Master of Suspense's best I do think it gets a bad rap for either the viewer having too high expectations, or that it was a noble but failed attempt at doing something different or bad timing in a decade of disaster movies and with the likes of Spielberg, DeNiro and Pacino(I personally think it's a bit of all). And of course there'll be people who didn't care for it, and that's understandable, as while I did really enjoy Family Plot I can definitely see why people will find fault with it. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final film directed by the great director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, before his death in 1980, may seem an unusual choice, but it is interesting enough. Basically fake spiritual medium/psychic Blanche Tyler (Nashville's Golden Globe nominated Barbara Harris) and her taxi driving boyfriend George Lumely (Bruce Dern, Laura's Dad) make a living conning people with her fake powers. They find the perfect scam with wealthy ageing widow Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt), who wants to find her nephew given up for adoption many years ago, and the next heir to her fortune. Meanwhile, diamond merchant Arthur Adamson (Marathon Man's William Devane) and his girlfriend Fran (Nashville's Karen Black) carry out many VIP kidnappings in San Francisco, demanding diamonds for the ransom. As Blanche and George search for this nephew, and Arthur and Fran do their thing, their paths eventually cross and chaos ensues. Also starring Ed Lauter as Maloney, Katherine Helmond as Mrs. Maloney, Warren J. Kemmerling as Grandison, Edith Atwater as Mrs. Clay, William Prince as Bishop, Nicholas Colasanto as Constantine, Marge Redmond as Mrs. Vera Hannagan, John Lehne as Andy Bush and Charles Tyner as Wheeler. This is a very light thriller with some supposed comedy in places, I have to say it doesn't feel completely like a regular Hitchcock film, but it is alright. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch Lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's curtain call has its moments but is certainly not one of his better efforts. The script is somewhat convoluted and far-fetched and lacking in suspense. It gets off to a bad start, as the opening scene, where Harris pretends to be a medium trying to bilk an old woman, goes on far too long. Then Harris and Dern engage in a long, uninteresting conversation. The first 15 minutes are a drag, which is surprising for the master director known for hooking his audience from the get go. There are two main plot lines that are executed somewhat clumsy, and the ending is unsatisfying. Harris and Dern are likable as small-time crooks, but the film is little more than a slight diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad pun, much better film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not his best by a long chalk but 'Family Plot' moves from one interesting set piece to another and mines entertainment from familiar Hitchcock themes.I thought the performances were fun and the idea of a medium was used effectively plus it tied in to some tension in a stale, bickering relationship. I particularly enjoyed listening to the John Williams music that echoed North by North West, Psycho and so on. There are also some motifs that found their way in to 'Star Wars' which gave the film a depth for me. Hitchcock's ear for good dialogue remains. Considering how late in his career this was made, it stands up as good comedy thriller. Hitchcock uses 2 sets of villains, one set more heinous than the other to explore his familiar themes of greed, guilt and identity. In this sense it is hardly fresh but the way he manages to keep being so watchable is remarkable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the lower tier of Hitchcock's work,this comedy-mystery is still solid entertainment by most standards. The pair of Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern deliver a great performance that will have you grinning or howling with laughter as a blue-collar couple who pursue a $10,000 pot of gold. Karen Black and William Devane play a higher stakes game of making money from stolen diamonds. The lives of these two scheming couples converge and we are into another suspense drama with a lot of laughs along the way. Hitchcock's film-making techniques do not shine but are still evident; however, the performances of Harris, as a madcap psychic, and Dern, as her taxi-driver boyfriend, go a long way to give great viewing pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Really Was Clairvoyant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The master of suspense, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, chose to bow out of movie making after this film. Appropriate indeed is his image in this which appears on screen but not his face. While he was excited about another story &amp; was formulating another film after this, he suddenly decided he could not go on.While not on a par with his best films, this film has some decent suspense &amp; a good cast. Ironically, with the exception of the lady who plays Blanche, all the other major members of this cast have film roles in production for 2008, 35 years after this film. Bruce Dern is very good in his role in this one. The film weaves 2 main stories together into one Plot taking 4 unrelated people &amp; having their paths cross at first &amp; then later meet. There are kidnappings, diamond ransoms, accidents, murders &amp; attempted murders along the way. With all of this you'd expect a lot of action but the action sequences are short. Hitch takes pains not to tell viewers where the film is taking place though locations give away that it is shot on the west coast, around San Francisco. That might be why the Golden Gate Bridge is not used as a backdrop in this one.The film leaves us with clairvoyant Blanche giving the viewers a smile &amp; a wink. In a way that is Hitch leaving us to storyboard &amp; plan his afterlife. While not the masters glorious best, not many great film makers last efforts are as good. The wink is because there are no murders in his last film, just a couple of attempted ones &amp; an accidental death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Family Plot," Hitchcock's last film, is about as zany as the legendary director would ever get. It's a very fun if lightweight entry in his canon. It holds a special place for me, because it stars two of my favorite actresses, Karen Black and Barbara Harris. I think both of them were underused by Hollywood, maybe because both were just a little too quirky to ever land mainstream roles. Here, Hitchcock doesn't ask them to be mainstream, and they're both delightful, especially Harris in her scenes as a histrionic medium.Good fun.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock wrapped up his one-of-a-kind directorial career in fine style in the 1970s, first with a film, "Frenzy", showcasing his hard edge, then with this, a movie in the vein of Hitchcock's great comedy-thrillers. Neither is among his greatest films, but both are fitting grace notes for those who love him.That is especially so with "Family Plot". Madame Blanche (Barbara Harris) is a spiritual medium of dubious merit ("She's a fake" says Hitchcock in the trailers) who discovers one of her suckers, an elderly rich woman, 40 years ago forced her long-dead sister to give up an infant son. Now the old biddy wants the boy back, and Blanche sets out to find him, with the help of "the Great Beyond" and her taxi-driver boyfriend, George (Bruce Dern), who must do the legwork......Meanwhile, in a seemingly unrelated situation, another couple operate more dangerously outside the law. He (William Devane) collects diamonds from an array of bold kidnappings. She (Karen Black) picks up the diamonds, which gives her a tingly sensation he likes."Family Plot" is very much in the spirit of classic Hitchcock light thrillers like "The Lady Vanishes" and "North By Northwest." "Family Plot" was even penned by "North By Northwest" screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who turns in a facile but clever effort. Lehman, along with a light score by composer John Williams and Harris in what amounts to the lead role, are more of a presence in this film than Hitchcock."Family Plot" lacks a grand setpiece in the Hitchcock tradition, or bold establishing shots. There's a lot of exposition dialogue, as if Hitchcock figured no one else would be able to remember anything for five minutes, some of it quite inane in a "Paradine Case" kind of way."You've been calling yourself 'the Trader', so we thought you were a man," someone tells Black's character, Fran, appropos of nothing when she shows up to collect a diamond.Fran is dressed in black sunglasses, big black fedora, and a long blond wig, and when we first see her we might mistake her for Patty Hearst. Hitchcock is at pains to show himself in tune with the times, whether with the occasional profanity or digs at church and state. Yet the decade's freewheeling anarchy probably suited him better than the 1960s, as does the low-rent George and Blanche, rich in charm but not money. Edith Head spent a lot of time at Woolworth's dressing this film.What "Family Plot" has is charm, and more room for its actors than Hitchcock usually gave. Probably he was beginning to tire of pulling in the reins at age 76, but it works well with the "new-breed" actors he was working with at the time, who give better ensemble work here than Hitchcock ever got after "The Birds." Dern is a delight especially in his off-kilter role, awkwardly using his pipe around a gas station."Better be careful with those matches," says evil attendant Maloney (Ed Lauter), the only character who seems to know he's in a Hitchcock film."Family Plot" is a good Hitchcock film, even if it takes time to get going. You'll enjoy the way the film draws together its two disparate plot strands, and how you warm to Blanche and George despite their icky ways. And you will treasure the way this film ends, a fitting capstone to a stellar career. If he couldn't close it out with an Oscar, at least Hitch let everyone know he still had a trick up his sleeve to the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's final film "Family Plot" is actually somewhat confusing, as some con artists try to play tricks on each other. If nothing else, we can say that Hitch - who appears as a silhouette - had one last noticeable movie before he croaked. But he certainly had passed his prime by this point. Still, I found it a fairly interesting flick; an OK way to pass time. Starring Karen Black, Bruce Dern, Barbara Harris and William Devane.Oh, and I read in the trivia that Faye Dunaway wanted the role of Fran, and that they offered Al Pacino the role of Lumley.

		<fullReview>Once again, even though I felt that this was a little off the Hitchcock styling, I still over all enjoyed Family Plot. It had an interesting plot, great actors, and it kept me watching the whole way through. I couldn't believe that Karen Black was in a Hitchcock movie! She was so cool. I know that this was also kind of Hitchcock's last film, so we owe him some respect for a well done picture.Basically, this movie is about a con artist couple eventually find themselves being hunted by jewel thieves, because they may know a little bit too much information, or at least the jewel thieves think they do. Not to mention the thieves have kidnapped a minister for a hefty ransom, and when the girl con artist finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong times, things turn grime for her. But we'll see who has the last laugh in this twist at every corner type of movie.Like I said, over all Family Plot is a very decent movie that deserves a little more respect. It does loose a little extra Hitchcock styling, but I think he knew what he was doing and needed a new film, or at least a new look. So sit back for our genius' real last motion picture and enjoy! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Compelling Sense Strangeness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, as the viewer you have two basic choices with this Hitchcock film, 1) You can either hold on to expectations for a film with the power and intensity of Vertigo and be quite disappointed, or 2) you can sit back, put your feet up, get comfortable and enjoy a rather humorous, visually satisfying and strangely charming motion picture. The main problem with Family Plot is that it is a Hitchcock film! Therefor the movie is subject to the inevitable comparisons with Hitchcock's masterpieces. The problem is, that Family Plot was clearly never intended to be in the same category as Vertigo, Rear Window or North by Northwest. It is a very different type of film for Hitcock. If anything, it is a comedy weaving together the unfolding stories of two very different couples. On the side of good are Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris. They play a somewhat sloppy, definitely lower rent district pair with Dern as a sarcastic, wise cracking cab driver and part time bumbling sleuth and Harris as his phony psychic con artist girlfriend and side-kick. Representing the darker side are the suave, sophisticated and disciplined criminal pairing of William Devane and Karen Black. No one in this movie turns in anything close to a great performance. In fact overall the performances are lukewarm to modestly good. However something else makes this a really charming movie. Running through the entire film is an undercurrent of a deeper sense of an almost mystical quality of intrigue and the strangeness of coincidence and synchronicity. There is a high level of attention paid to nearly continuously inserting odd details and weird little mini-vignettes into the film. One gets the distinct sense that there are several layers of such nearly hidden details giving the film a feeling that, at times, hints of almost occult mysteries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Swansong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blanche and George are a couple of small-time grifters who stumble on a big score. All they need to do is find a guy named Eddie Shoebridge. Unfortunately, what they don't know is Eddie happens to be a ruthless diamond thief who doesn't want to be found.Many critics are disparaging of Hitchcock's final film, dismissing it as lightweight, but I'm rather fond of it. What they all miss is that it was always intended to be a whimsical, fun, kooky mystery of the kind he liked to make (The Lady Vanishes, The Trouble With Harry), not some heavy doom-laden drama. Scenes like the amusingly ridiculous high-speed dash down the mountain, where Blanche does everything possible to make things worse, are a gleeful Hitchcock chuckling to himself. While there is a clever cross-plotted intrigue, he keeps weaving in humour, from Blanche's occult histrionics, to our heroes' crass but endearing lovers' spats, to the central joke that Arthur/Eddie will be a hundred times richer if he comes out of hiding. The four leads are all good, with a pipe-smoking Dern especially getting the tone right (trivia - he had a bit part years earlier in Hitch's Marnie) and the supporting cast has several fine twitchy performers like Lauter and Helmond. I also like the continual contrast between the two couples; Blanche and George have got no class, bicker all the time, eat hamburgers in her tiny kitchen and are more than a little small-minded. Arthur and Fran on the other hand are distinctly upmarket and already want for nothing, but are slimy, calculating, vain and vicious. It's clear where our sympathies should lie and for all their faults, Blanche and George are fun to watch. With an agreeably overenthusiastic score by John Williams and great jazzy costumes by Edith Head, this is a very pleasant way to spend two hours and a fine coda for the career of perhaps the most prolific and influential filmmaker of all time. Based on the book The Rainbird Pattern by Victor Canning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a minor work from Hitchcock; however good it is sad that it was his last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family Plot is about a con-psychic, her cabbie boyfriend, another con-man/thief, and a diamond thief as his squeeze, who all come together unwittingly in a yarn surrounding a search for a son, a 10 grand reward, and some diamonds, plus lots of other small-time shenanigans. In any other hands this would be a very respectable, even near excellent feature (or, as a TV movie, a big one for the mid 70s). And it is, on its own terms, a good, light thriller with a few laughs, some strong if two-dimensional characters, and solid dialog (some of it, unlikely usually for the director improvised). But this director, of course, is Hitchcock, and after the flawed but monumental craftsmanship of Frenzy he falls onto material that is, frankly, not quite up to his level of sophistication and mastery of the medium Then again, maybe that's the way he wanted it, which is just as well. By this age of his mid-late 70s, he probably wanted to work on something that was only so much demanding, and could have some relaxing time while still having his total control over the production (and at that age and after so long, he did earn the right to a few minor works, albeit after a slight slump in the late 60s). There's some good laughs to be had by way of Hitchcock's casting- Bruce Dern is always great, and Karen Black and William Devane and Barbara Harris put in their bits of effort too- and there's even a couple of near-brilliant scenes and flashes of the Master's style; the cut-away from couple 1 (Harris/Dern) in the car following the start of the movie to the "blonde" Black walking across the road is a great little narrative leap. The climax, however 'old-hat' it might be for some, is also sort of thrilling and with a final wink that says "hey, it's all in high spirits." Nothing great, and almost, if you're a purist, a disappointment for the die-hard Hitchcock fan. But if you've got nothing else to do on a Saturday night, pop it in and see what it can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>movies are SUPPOSED to be fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read most of the comments here I find it disappointing that more people don't just relax and see where the ride takes them before they decide about a movie. One of the great things about Hitch was he was always trying new and different things. Take two films from his "hayday" Psycho and NxNW. Two of the very best films of all time and so completely different from each other. Every movie including Psycho has an awful lot of humor in it because that's how Hitch saw everything, with a macabre sense of humor. He tried straight humor just once with Mr. and Mrs. Smith. It wasn't fun for him and you can see that in this drab movie. So when he went for humor he did it in the form of "black humor". And he was a master. The Trouble With Harry is brilliant. And for his final bow, Family Plot not only is funny in and of itself but he filled it with laughs at his own (or his movies) expense. It's one of my favorites and gets better every time I watch it. I do have to agree I could have done w/out Ms. Black but Barbara Harris more than makes up for it. And Bruce Dern and William Devane were great as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Isn't it touching how a perfect murder has kept our friendship alive all these years?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It goes without saying that Alfred Hitchcock remains one of the most influential and fondly-remembered directors of all time, having spent his half-century career producing a wide-range of inarguable masterpieces. However, following his release of 'The Birds (1962),' many have speculated that the director's work began a noticeable downward spiral, gradually dwindling in quality as Hitchcock inevitably aged and began suffering various health-related problems. Though, of course, I'm yet to watch all of his post-1962 works, I disagree markedly with this assessment: 'Torn Curtain (1967)' was an entertaining espionage thriller with multiple great scenes, and 'Frenzy (1972)' was one of the director's all-time best, a riveting old-school thriller with an irresistible dose of his trademark black humour. Hitchcock's final completed film, 'Family Plot (1976),' was released when he was 77 years old, and is an enjoyable ? if inconsequential ? light-hearted mystery/thriller, much in the same vein as 'The Trouble with Harry (1955).' Drenched in droll humour, veiled sexual innuendo and no small amount of irony, it's the sort of picture that reminds you of Hitchcock's incomparable skill with the camera, even if the film itself is too light to prove especially memorable.If there's one thing more difficult than making a living as a psychic, it's making a living as a fake psychic. Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris), despite her extravagant performances before clients, has about as much talent for communicating with the dead as her taxi-driver boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern), whom she sends out on fact-finding expeditions prior to each session. After a remorseful old lady (Cathleen Nesbitt) secretly offers her $10,000 to find, using her psychic abilities, her sister's long lost child, both Blanche and George are falling over themselves to uncover the missing son, whose name and whereabouts are completely unknown. As fate would have it, twenty-six years earlier, young Eddie Shoebridge murdered his adoptive parents, faked his own death, changed his name to Arthur Adamson (William Devane) and now makes a living as both a jeweller and by kidnapping important citizens and demanding priceless diamonds as the ransom for their return. As Blanche and George, with surprising efficiency, begin to follow the trail leading towards Adamson, their target nervously plots their assassination, not knowing that they merely wish to offer him his family's considerable inheritance.What ultimately makes 'Family Plot' work is the film's well-chosen cast, with the four main actors understanding the comedic tone of Ernest Lehman's screenplay {adapted from Victor Canning's 1972 novel, "The Rainbird Pattern"} and basically playing the story for deadpan laughs. Bruce Dern {who I've previously seen in 'Silent Running (1971), and also had a brief role in Hitchcock's 'Marnie (1964)'} is excellent in the role of the taxi-driver/private investigator boyfriend, as is Barbara Harris, whose shamelessly exaggerated psychic episodes nonetheless convince her hopeful and vulnerable elderly clients. Hitchcock had originally wanted William Devane for the role of Arthur Adamson, but was forced instead to settle on Roy Thinnes when scheduling clashes proved problematic. However, several days into the shooting of the film, Devane suddenly became available and Thinnes was unceremoniously discarded from the picture, an unfortunate occurrence for any actor, though several seconds of his performance still remain for the sharp-eyed to enjoy. Karen Black is merely adequate as Fran, Adamson's girlfriend and kidnapping accomplice. Though 'Family Plot' doesn't add anything new to the Alfred Hitchcock oeuvre, it is, after all, a Hitchcock film, and that alone makes it essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When compared to the films made during his creative peak, Alfred Hitchcock's "Family Plot" pales. But seen as the final work of an aging, exhausted master incapable of location shooting, it's a remarkably engaging concoction loaded with delicious Hitch moments. The downhill runaway car scene works far better than it should, and the solid cast of character actors, particularly Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris, are clearly having a grand time. While not as significant a film as "Rear Window," "Psycho," even the underrated "Marnie," it remains enjoyable fluff, especially when compared to the sluggish "Topaz," Hitch's only true late-career misfire. If you can watch this on the DVD, don't miss the documentary on the making of the film.</fullReview>

Most of the actors seem like sitcom or soap opera stores, but Duvane in particular plays his role exquisitely, I often rewind my vcr to re-watch him in one scene or another. This is a good film. Together with Frenzy, it demonstrates to me that Hitch was finally managing to come up with films for a new generation, having finally shed the 1950s elegance which followed him into such misplaced 1960s disasters as Marnie. He was ready for more, but unfortunately Hitch couldn't hold out. This was his last film. Appropriately, Hitch references older films throughout, as a memoir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every five years or so, I get on a Hitchcock kick and yearn to go back and revisit some of his greatest films, particularly the period beginning in 1954 with DIAL "M" FOR MURDER, REAR WINDOW, etc. Hitch ran up an impressive string of 15 straight hits over nearly a quarter of a century before his death, shortly after his last film, FAMILY PLOT in 1976.Although far from being his best film, FAMILY PLOT is still a Hitchcock Classic, employing many of the devices of telling a suspenseful story in a way only Sir Alfred could do it.The story involves Blanche Tyler, played by Hitchcock's latest blond, Barbara Harris. Blanche is a phony psychic trying to bilk her wealthy clients out of their fortunes. One of them, Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt) is willing to pay Blanche $10,000 to locate her long lost nephew so that she can make him her heir.The nephew turns out to be Arthur Adamson (William DeVane), a respected jewel dealer with a darker side. It seems Adamson murdered his step-parents and faked his own death. He now operates a kidnapping ring with his partner, the mysterious Fran (Karen Black), collecting rare diamonds as ransom in exchange for their well-known victims, including a politician and a Catholic Bishop. William DeVane later gained fame as Greg Sumner in the long-running prime-time soap opera KNOTS LANDING (1983-1993).Blanche's boyfriend is George Lumley (Bruce Dern), who makes his living as a cab driver, but does a lot of the investigative legwork for Blanche to make her "psychic powers" appear legitimate. Why he was wasting his time driving a cab I can't figure. He would have made an excellent private eye.Sound complicated enough? It really gets intriguing as the two couples' paths eventually cross, with Blanche trying to track down the presumed-dead nephew to tell him the good news of his inheritance.The highlight of the film is, of course, the car sequence. With Blanche and Lumley hot on his trail, Adamson sends his "hit" man, Joe Maloney (Ed Lauter) to meet them at a mountaintop cafe. Maloney never shows up for the meeting, but while Blanche and Lumley wait inside, he drains all the brake fluid out of their car. After giving up on the meeting with Maloney, the couple start to drive back down the mountain, suddenly realizing they have no brakes on the steep mountain grades.This sequence is classic Hitchcock. The entire episode, which lasts for several minutes, is filmed entirely within the car, making the audience a part of the ongoing event. The expressions and reactions of Blanche and Lumley, plus the views out the front window as the car careens around sharp curves, passing all the other vehicles recklessly and with abandon, is done with comedic tongue-in-cheek as well as high drama. Many have copied Hitchcock's techniques. Compare Robert Zemeckis' filming of the plane crash scene in CAST AWAY.Comic relief is one technique often employed by Hitchcock to break the tension of constant suspenseful action. NORTH BY NORTHWEST is another good example of this. Two other films come to mind, though, VERTIGO and PSYCHO that keep you on a wild ride of suspense from beginning to end with NO relief--NO chance to even catch your breath. Ironically, I consider these Hitchcock's two greatest films.I'm glad we still have access to all of The Master's old classics, via the magic of VHS and DVD. I never tire of watching them.</fullReview>

For Hitchcock last film, he remains true to suspense and thrillers but changes his style of acting for the new 1976 audience.It doesn't seem right to me. The film lacks a certain Hitchcockian element that he is so loved and respected for. The ending is neither funny or scary.It just ends?

		<fullReview>The music score was written by John Williams, and, although he at times approximated the spikiness of Hitchcock's favorite composer, Bernard Herrmann, part of the rosiness of the film is due to the trademark Williams style.In fact, listen for the main theme (best heard right at the closing as the credits roll): its harmonic and melodic material is very close to the "magic" theme of Williams' score for ET, and is strikingly close to the first part of Anakin's theme in Star Wars Episode IV (the Phantom Menace).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not as deep as some of his other classics, Family Plot which was done when he was 76 was a fitting movie to end his career. Bruce Dern, Barbara Harris, William Devane, and Karen Black all give fine performances especially Devane and Black. The plot is sort of far-fetched but watch this movie without trying to compare it to Rear Window, North by Northwest, Vertigo, etc. A very good stand-alone movie.

		<fullReview>Barbara Harris leads the cast as a phony psychic who is asked to use her "power" to find a man that apparently is dead. If she succeeds in her task she will be payed $10,000. She hauls her twisted actor/cab driver into the deal and asks him to find information on the supposedly dead man. They are led through ups and downs on their mission to find the man. Finally finding out that the man faked his death, changed his name and now is living as a jewel salesman/jewel thief. The climax is typical Hitchcock, awesome ending. And great performances by all performers. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that is in the mood for an action - mystery - comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another unusual experiment from Hitchcock, this is not a suspense thriller, but combination jewel heist/ kidnapping plot, with a pair of smalltime cons crossing paths with kidnappers (with a hidden room behind a brick wall in their basement, clearly inspired by Poe) It has its moments of effectiveness, particularly an out-of-control drive down a winding, mountainside road, and a daring kidnap in front of a congregation. Also benefits from a good cast: Bruce Dern is wonderful, Barbara Harris is good also, as his phony medium of a wife. William Devane does well also, but he looks like a 1970s porno version of Rod Serling, and Karen Black's character is just merely there, leaving little impact considering she is a main character.Hitchcock adapted well to the 1970s, he appears to be moving forward, rather than just go for nostalgia, and the film is all the more better for that, rather than resorting to more chases on Mount Rushmore. But I still prefer his penultimate, Frenzy, because overall, this looks like an extended episode of Columbo, minus the old guy in the raincoat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misfired send-up by Hitchcock on Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wouldn't it have been great if Hitchcock had lived to see this day and age of taught, psychological thrillers with their unrelenting visual style. He gave us something years ahead of it's time in "Psycho", and I'm sure he would do just the same today if he was still with us. The year 1976 was the last time Hitchcock did direct however, and in "Family Plot" he has turned his attention to comedy.Ernest Lehman's script (based on Victor Canning's novel) has an interesting double-sided plot, yet Hitchcock allows the connection 'twixt the two to be revealed early on. It's not time for mystery and suspense, the master is targeting our funny bones. Madame Blanche (Barbara Harris) is a would-be psychic who takes advantage of lonely elderly people who just want to contact their dearly departed. When a client offers her and boyfriend George (Bruce Dern) $10 000 to locate a lost heir, they believe that they may have finally hit the jackpot. Danger is what we know they'll get from the mysterious man they seek, who looks like being more trouble than he's worth.Long time fans of Alfred Hitchcock may be disappointed with what is a slightly misfired spoof of many of the great man's own works. This 'ordinary people in an extraordinary situation' story has very few genuine laughs, and there are no surprises of a comic nor suspenseful nature. "Family Plot" gives testimony to the fact that Hitchcock is infinitely more effective with his blacker humour that this light-hearted fare.The cast are never inspirational (Harris an enjoyable exception) but they do manage to keep the show afloat most of the way. There's little else of interest except for the fact that John Williams scored a less than memorable piece of music to accompany Hitchcock's curtain call.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-paced but oddly dull thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A basically satisfying but low-key thriller. It doesn't always look great. It's a largely location-shot piece and there's a sense that Hitchcock is out of his depth working outside the studio. One also feels that the actors are straining at the auteur's leash. The verismo of 1970s American cinema would have been a considerable gravitational force in opposition to the outmoded technical demands of the director.The men of the cast are more striking in general than the women. William Devane is a nasty baddie but Bruce Dern, though a comic protagonist, is also a menacing figure. It's a pity that more is not made of this - in the same way that Hitchcock misses the really big trick of the flick by failing to work the psychic plot thread into the film more thoroughly. 4/10</fullReview>

The scene where Blanche and George get in the car wreck kept me laughing for 10 minutes straight.Bottom line: Don't let people talk you out of seeing Family Plot. Ignore any negative comments.

Barbara Harris is very good as Madame Blanche and Karen Black is very cool as Fran. But, the star of the movie has to be William "Bill" Devane. His over-acting is particularly well placed and does never annoy. Alfred Hitchock directs in his last picture, which is head over heals better than any of his previous movies since "Psycho" and "The Birds". The 70's seem to be Hitch's second to best decade with "Frenzy" and "Family Plot" being two of his best pictures. Plot to check this one out! 9.9/10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A minor Hitchcock outing, but consistently entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Family Plot", Hitchcock's last film, is nearly forgotten today; even when later Hitchcock films are discussed, "Frenzy" and "Torn Curtain" come to most people's minds. But it is an entertaining, thoroughly watchable, consistently absorbing film. Lehman wrote a very clever plot, carefully structured and filled with ironic twists, and he also provides some witty dialogue. Hitchcock's direction just doesn't have the pacing and zest you might expect (after all, he was 77 years old when he made this), but technically it's excellent and the sequence with the car that goes downhill in a twisty mountain road and has no brakes is exceptionally well-edited. Unlike "Frenzy", this film also has engaging performances by all the actors involved (Dern is the standout). The only disappointment here is the finale, that comes more or less as an anticlimax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically relevant only by association!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's film Family Plot is significant only because it was his last effort, and because it starred a cast of players that today begs the question "Where are they now?"Family Plot stars Barbara Harris as a fake spiritualist named Blanche who is asked to find a missing person. She and her boyfriend George (Bruce Dern) are enticed into taking on the task only because of the reward involved. Little do they know, they are on to something dangerous. Arthur Adamson is the man they want. He is a gem dealer by day and a nasty jewel thief by night. Teamed up with his accomplice, Fran, played Miss Karen Black (still donning the big blonde wig she wore in Nashville) they kidnap millionaires and dignitaries in an effort to get their precious gem stones. Arthur Adamson, unbeknownst to Fran, George and Blanche, has a shady past. Apparently Arthur killed his parents and faked his own death. Family Plot is interesting to watch, mainly because of the historical significance of it, but aside from its association it really is nothing more than a thinly layered television movie. Some of the Hitchcockian elements are there. Of course we get his own cameo (an important ingredient to all of his films) and of course we get a few neat scenes (the cut away at the beginning from Blanche and George in the cab to Karen Black, who they almost hit at a crosswalk was great). On the other hand, the characters are two dimensional. We don't really know why Arthur killed his parents, and frankly we don't care. Blanche is an over the top fake as a spiritualist, and the scene that showcases her work is comedically boring. Not only are the characters lifeless, but they don't fit in with the mood of the film. I gather that this was to be a black comedy, but the characters are more suited to the slapstick genre, only you get the feeling they are confused as to whether they should be toning it down or camping it up! It seems evident that Hickcock's film making and 1970's sensibility simply do not mix well.And speaking of 'Black' comedy, Miss Karen gets top billing for a film that she is not the star of. Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris get much more screen time than she does and their characters are far more relevant to the plot. Karen's Fran is nothing more than a moll for William Devane's Arthur. You can clearly see who had the best agent back in 1976!Luckily Family Plot is not too terrible a film that it would tarnish the image of a great director. For great Hitchcock work check out Rebecca from thirty six years earlier. And Harris and Black can both be forgiven for their effort in this picture as I am sure they were busy working on their fine performances in a classic from 1976, Nashville!</fullReview>

I thought it was TOTALLY an implausible plot point that jewel thieves would hold a poor church mouse for ransom when I viewed FAMILY PLOT, until I saw this week's headline about the "Bishop of Bling" over in Germany. That does not change the fact that when you see the highlight reel of the fourteen Hitchcock flicks offered for sale in Universal Studio's "Master of Suspense" collection, the scenes from FAMILY PLOT sort of stick out like sore thumbs (and that includes the sticking of the aforementioned bishop with a hypodermic needle during his mid-Mass kidnapping; common sense would suggest NO congregation anywhere would sit still for such an incident, but as this week's offering at the multiplex--JACKASS PRESENTS BAD GRANDPA--proves, the American public has little if any common sense, and pranksters or evil-doers can get away with pretty much ANYTHING in front of a crowd as long as they seem either self-assured and\or too much trouble to interfere with).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film very much. Interestingly enough, I never would have guessed Hitchcock directed it.The problem with the film is that too much emphasis is on the convoluted plot and too little on the characters. While the protagonists are likable, more time should have been devoted to fleshing out their characters. As for the antagonists, they are somewhat difficult to relate to because while they are very likable the character of Shoebridge is also supposed to be sinister. This results in an ambiguity of his character and ends up confusing the audience. At the end of the film one does not know whether to cheer or boo when the antagonists are finally trapped. At the same time, the lack of development of the protagonists diminishes the satisfaction of their triumph.I can't give it more than 6/10, but I have to reiterate that I do find the film quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than you'd think but worse than you'd like, Alfred Hitchcock's "Family Plot" stars Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris as a couple of likable losers out to get their hands on a fortune. In their way is another couple, jewel thieves played by William Devane and Karen Black."Family Plot" was Hitchcock's last film. He suffered severe health problems during its production and would die four years later. And like most directors' final films, "Plot" seems to sense its author's own imminent demise. It's filled with gravestones, cemeteries, exudes an aura of death, and is littered with allusions to Hitchcock's past features. Close up shots of eyes, for example, recall similar shots in "Psycho", a gas station banner references Norman Bates, a cab driver's dialogue conjures up 1963's "The Birds", lines from "Marnie" are repeated wholesale, talk of 53 carats serve as a reminder that this was Hitchcock's 53rd film and a female kidnapper uses a blonde wig reminiscent of "Vertigo's" platinum blondes. Hitchcock's on-screen cameo is also given a morbid touch: his silhouette is shown above the words "Registry of Births and Deaths", a one line summation of his career as a master of murder.The film opens with several overlong, overly talkative sequences. We're then hit with a great Hitchcock moment, a moving crane shot which watches as a blonde woman crosses a street. It recalls similar shots in "Marnie". Tarantino would homage it, and other similar Hitchcockian grace notes, in several of his films."Family Plot's" central portion is relatively low-key. It then becomes a detective tale, Bruce Dern inadvertently becoming a gumshoe who goes rummaging through the past. A terribly shot car "chase" ruins things somewhat, before a fairly good suspense ending restores some pride. What's remarkable about "Family Plot" isn't its suspense, though (there's very little), but the effort Hitchcock puts into contrasting the film's two couples. Scenes granted to one pair echo scenes granted the other pair (this symmetry extends to the film's opening and closing bookends), and Hitchcock spends a lot of time filming banter which explores the weird relationships of these four characters. The rest of the film, like "To Catch a Thief" and "Marnie", then seems to draw connections between theft and sexual excitement; Dern and Harris have sex, lots of sex, but theirs is a warm relationship. He's a drab guy, she's a drab gal, he's practical, she's a bit delusional, but of all of Hitchcock's couples their love seems the most healthy, less built on games of power and domination than simple, casual acceptance. One scene, for example, sees Dern and Harris sitting at a messy table eating hamburgers. More than most Hitchcock couples, they're at ease with one another, placing no demands or expectations on their partners. This is a far cry from Hitchcock's previous film ("Frantic"), which was packed with rape and hate-filled couples. Some contend that this is why Hitch made "Family Plot". He couldn't go out on such a morbid note.Hitchcock's later films tend to take pot-shots at the Church. Here a priest is shown on a scandalous "date" with a woman in red. Earlier scenes at a church recall similar sequences from "The Man Who Knew Too Much". Meanwhile Dern and Harris' bumbling antics, which prove successful despite the couple's ineptitude, recalls Hitchcock's underrated "The Trouble With Harry", another film in which buffoonery and happy endings go hand in hand.Also interesting is the film's "Psycho-like" structure, which develops two seemingly isolated stories and then brings them to collision. Note how the two plots initially intersect with a car and moving crane shot. Shades of Welles ("Touch of Evil"), perhaps the first director to do this. Hitchcock fanboy Brian De Palma would also bring three plots to a meeting point with a similar crane shot in his underrated "Black Dahlia". "Family Plot" itself feels like something directed by a De Palma or a Spielberg. It was released in 1974 - when a new generation of directors were building upon Hitch's work - and lacks the classy modernism of his best films. It's messier, less formally focused, and perhaps signalled the death of a certain brand of filmmaking.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course it's not on par with NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO, or REBECCA, but what is? Hitchcock's last film is fine entertainment from beginning to end. Two sets of grifters collide when their schemes to rip off a rich family got awry. Hitchcock assembles an unusually quirky cast and gets the most out of them. Karen Black and William Devane are one set, Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern are the other. They're great! Black looks terrific in a blonde wig and Devane and Dern are both alternately clever and inept. The acting prize really goes to Harris as a medium who may or may not be a fraud! She graced a few movies during the 60s and 70s like NASHVILLE and A THOUSAND CLOWNS, and it's fun seeing her with such a meaty role. The equally strange supporting cast includes Katherine Helmond and Ed Lauter. The film itself is perhaps not quite as stylish as one would expect from the master of suspense, but there are a few scenes that are vintage Hitchcock including Dern and Harris in an out of control car as well as a particularly clever shot of Dern "pursuing" Helmond in a cemetery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated film by Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family Plot is a funny and great crime flick, though not a typical Hitchcock movie, of course. This being his last, it holds some of the classic Hitchcock drama, but this US also quite funny. You recognize how Hitchcock creates suspense and humor, in an interesting story which is entertaining. Hitchcock is arguably the greatest director ever. He is topping more than one kind of lists, bot with his films as well as himself as a director. When Hitch made this, he was 77, and in his late autumn of his film making. Not only that, he became ill during the filming, leading up to this becoming his last film, though he was actually working in another, which he never got to finish.Still the master pulls a great film out of his hat. There are more than one scene to remember, but the car without the brakes downhill is really a classic movie scene, and impossible to forget! Not only greatly filmed, but also great excitement!The con artist Madam Blanche Tyler is conning the elder millionaire Julia Rainbird that believes she is a spiritualist. After a séance, she discovers that Julia is tormented by her past, when she forced her sister and single mother to adopt away a child to avoid a family scandal. Julia promises the small fortune to Blanche if she finds her nephew and heir of her fortune using her fake powers. Blanche involves her boyfriend George Lumley, who is an unemployed actor working as cab driver, to investigate the whereabouts of Julia's nephew. Meanwhile a greedy jewel collector Arthur Adamson and girlfriend Fran kidnaps wealthy people to increase his collection of diamonds. The story entangles into a great ride of a story.The cast does a great job. Karen Black and Bruce Dern has got the great timing needed to make a light hearted suspended crime thriller like this. In this film Hitch allegedly allowed the actors the improvise, something he was known for never doing, but rather demanding that the actors where to precisely follow the script in every sentence.There's more to mark this film with, as well. The last of Hitchcocks iconic elements in films was introduced here, the woman in black, later used by many others, just like other of his iconic elements. The score is by John Williams, well suited, and actually the only movie Hitch and Williams did together.A great film, which entertains immensely, and is way underrated as I think most had so huge expectations to Hitchcok's work. Thus is at least a 7,5 here in IMDb. A forgotten gem, only rated by 12.000 though this is a late film. Please, do yourself a favor, and get hold of this In honor of a film icon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A phony psychic(though this will throw hints that maybe she is "real"... it's really irritating) and her boyfriend, a taxi driver who is her fellow con-man, try to find the missing heir of an aging wealthy woman. Simultaneously, a pair of jewel thieves... or, well, they abduct people and then claim ransom to be paid in diamonds(d-don't ask, please, I have no clue) are, well, doing... that. The plot is convoluted as usual, and other than the bits that are far too ridiculous to take seriously, it's among the best of this(it's certainly engaging). For a (black?) comedy, this is remarkably unfunny(I'm barely sure it's trying to deliver jokes and gags, honestly, or at least only the occasional one). It's odd, as Hitchcock(this was his last film... R.I.P.) was a hilarious man, if much of his humor was sardonic(and not everyone likes that... I personally love it). I haven't read the novel that this is based upon, but I understand that it was darker and not lighthearted. This does sort of work as a parody of the earlier movies by the master. I guess it's supposed to be part of the material that both couples have bad relationship, and the women whine(especially Blanche... man, is she obnoxious throughout this), well, so do the men. Other than Devane, he is smooth and cool. I like Dern, and he is fine in this. The dialog(containing very direct sexual innuendo for when it's from and who it's by) is good, at times clever. I understand they were allowed to improvise in this, unusual for Alfred. He brings his marvelous cinematography and editing along for the ride, and this has some suspense and tension, and one exciting scene(with a letdown conclusion). While it helps, this is ultimately just not up to his standard. There is a little moderate language and disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a 48-minute making-of featurette(that I will review on its own page here on the site), storyboards, an art gallery and two trailers. I recommend this to the biggest fans. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Family Plot" is most notable as the final film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The master moviemaker seemed to be on an artistic upswing with "Frenzy" (1972); that film, in hindsight, might have been a more intriguing way to end one of the greatest careers in motion pictures. But, "Family Plot" is neither bad nor embarrassing, and should be considerably appealing to anyone interested in either the starring quartet or Hitchcock's work. There are fewer Hitchcock "touches" than in any of his 1960s films, however. The DVD sleeve synopsis gives away the connection between the two seemingly unrelated couples in the film; recommended reading, as the revelation, when it happens, has little dramatic impact anyway.***** Family Plot (4/9/76) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Barbara Harris, Bruce Dern, William Devane, Karen Black</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Balzac,like Dickens,like Clouzot,like the other great artistic benefactors of the humanity,Alfred Hitchcock presented us with a new manner of watching and of analyzing.Released 20 years ago,Family Plot (1976) has some noticeable features:(1)he used only antipathetic, churlish, base-hearted, vulgar,dishonest-looking (but also very talented) male leads,faces denoting Baselessness,anti-stars,as this kind of actors was called in the '60s;he wanted them to look like two bums,two fiends,two repulsive louses,miscreants, wicked quacks, cheerful curs;later,these guy made great careers as villains;as for the actresses,in vain one would try to make Mrs. Barbara Harris or even Mrs. Karen Black be an equivalent for Grace Kelly,Ingrid Bergman,etc.,or suggest that Hitchcock thought them to be so;very far,indeed,from his almost Stendhalian feminine beauty fetishism,his exultation before women's beauty;who could say that H. took Barbara Harris and Karen Black for a new Grace Kelly,when only a Miss Kelly was good enough for him and for his best movies?;(2)Hitchcock made a commercial and conventional movie,that is lacking any ambitions and technical inventiveness,if compared with his movies like Rope (1948),Rear Window (1954),Vertigo (1958),Psycho (1960);(3)as such,Family Plot (1976) is above the average production of the '70s.Family Plot (1976) has in abundance Alfred Hitchcock 's qualities:sarcasm,caustic irony,sardonic comic.I see no sign of a talent's decline in this film,only different purposes.His talent's elasticity and malleability were amazing. He taught the '70s cinema how to make '70s suspense movies!His "Plot" is very amusing,very well acted by the 4 actors,very thrilling and sharp.What is the explanation ,what is the "secret" of H. career's apparent degrading,in the '60s and '70s?(a)First,Alfred Hitchcock renounced to film (with his paradoxical ardor) the womanly lavish beauty,and he ceased to use bright leading actors (Cary Grant,Connery);his final several movies lack both the glamorous women and the handsome leads;(b) simultaneously,his shows became plainly conventional and commercial.Hitchcock moved from the womanly beauty's poetry,womankind's charm and handsome actors,to banal,anodyne, ordinary looking characters,roguish physiognomies and even churlish faces (Hitchcock himself was the first to blame the actors for his movies' failures:e.g.,Stewart,Clift,Cary Grant,Otto Kruger,Peck, Cotten,Jane Wyman,Granger,Anne Baxter were accused by him of having spoiled the films,of spoiling I Confess (1953),Strangers on a Train (1951) ,Stage Fright (1950) ,Under Capricorn (1949),The Paradine Case (1947), Saboteur (1942) ,Suspicion (1941),etc.,etc.,etc.,he always blamed it on "compromise casting";Truffaut was the opposite,he did not do that,he didn't pick at his actors the movies' failures);his movies became thoroughly commercial (meaning they lack the technical innovations from his previous movies) and conventional,and I do not say this as a blame,on the contrary,it is a fact that,as such,Hitchcock's post-Marnie (1964) are,nonetheless,way better than the average thrillers of those times,and also better that some much famous thrillers;it looks only as if Hitchcock would have deserted the lavishing show,the movie as he understood it in the '40s and especially in the '50s.The poet of Grace Kelly's glamor began working with ...;the passing was,of course,gradual.Of all his many films,Hitchcock liked much (or,al least,did not criticize) Murder (1930),The Thirty-Nine Steps (1935),Secret Agent (1936),Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Lifeboat (1944),The Trouble With Harry (1956).Since we discuss this,let me specify something about Alfred Hitchcock's prestige and renown.It has been claimed by some IMDb user that "Hitchcock's "Psycho" was not a masterpiece. That's a myth created by a generation of film writers and professors who enjoyed popular culture when they were kids and were concerned as adults to elevate it to the status of art to befit their newly acquired pretensions."-This is strikingly fake and foolish.Let it be reminded that Psycho (1960) was warmly received by the greatest writers:Henri Agel;François Truffaut and the Cahiers registered Psycho (1960) in their ten best list for '60!So,it is obvious that Psycho (1960) was hailed as a masterpiece from the very year it was released,and by the most famous critics.Let this be stated,against all kinds of "demythologizing" now prevailing.In '60,Truffaut and Agel were not "kids".Henri Agel included Hitchcock in his list of British great creators,and included "Psycho" among his best movies.Agel also included "Psycho" in his list of all-time masterpieces.And Agel's book appeared in the '60s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to believe that two masters like Hitch and Lehman could have come up with this dreadful little piffle. It would have sunk without a trace immediately upon release if those two names weren't associated with it.To go from Bergman, Grant, Kelly to Harris, Devane and Dern - wow. And the movie has a sad, mid-70s feel to it as the studio system is crashing down. The cinematography (to be generous) is lackluster and pale, as others have noticed the car out of control scene is absurd, like an outtake from It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, and it's obvious that someone told Lehman that he had to throw some sex and a little cursing into this film since it's the '70s baby, so the first time we are introduced to both couples all they can talk about is oh boy, wait until we get in the sack, hot patooty boy we're going to have sex now, yes sirree. Please.I had to IMDb Barbara Harris just to see what her credentials were, and surprisingly she has some. Her "performance" here consisted of little more than an attempt at a third-hand Madeline Kahn impersonation. Dern and Devane are creeps, one just dresses nicer, neither is of any interest or concern. Karen Black gets to wear fancy disguises, yeah so what. Kidnapping the priest in the church - an odd idea to begin with, and executed with no wit or charm. Frankly, the only scene that seems to be even a bit like prime Hitch is the opener. It features actual acting, scoring, art direction and writing, all qualities sadly lacking from the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tongue-in-cheek Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to other Hitchcock films, "Family Plot" is something of a dud. It comes across as a cheap, made-for-TV movie of the week. And the main problem is a poor script.Instead of one major plot line, we have two, involving two different sets of characters. Eventually, these two strands join into one unified story. But the first thirty minutes or so is confusing and annoying. The Maloney character isn't really needed. And except for the Blanche character (Barbara Harris) none of the major characters are interesting. The underlying premise isn't believable. I think Hitch was starting to run out of story ideas.But the film is not without entertainment value. Through sheer performance alone, Barbara Harris makes Blanche come alive with small-town charm, even though her motive regarding Mrs. Rainbird is deceptive. The most entertaining segment, despite its implausibility, is a three-minute car sequence in the second half wherein Blanche and George (Bruce Dern) careen down a mountainside sans brakes; some good tension there.Casting is acceptable except for the oily William Devane. One of the reasons I chose this film to watch is that I like Karen Black. She does a fine job here, though the script doesn't give her much to do. Cinematography is okay, but the rear screen projection is some car scenes renders the film dated. Also making the film dated are Karen Black's bell-bottoms. Overall prod values are minimally acceptable, but nothing special.If you like tongue-in-cheek thrillers, "Family Plot" will appeal to you. But the underlying humorous tone dilutes suspense and mystery. And the two-for-one plot line conveys the impression that neither plot was strong enough to stand on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good finale to Hitchcock's career.Family Plot was Alfred Hitchcock's last movie. He died four years after it was released. While not anywhere near the dizzying heights of Hitchcock's best movies (Rear Window, Psycho, among others) it is reasonably good.Interesting main plot with some good twists along the way. Some inconsistencies though, especially in some of the sub-plots. Not everything entirely makes sense. Also, giving away the secret so soon in the movie removed a lot of the potential mystery in the movie.As always with a Hitchcock movie, what sustains the movie is the suspense. Hitchcock keeps you hooked the whole way through.Also has some good humorous moments. Good performance by Bruce Dern as George. Barbara Harris was a touch unconvincing and irritating as Blanche. William Devane is okay, and suitably devious, as the criminal, though his 70s moustache was a bit too creepy.RIP Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's Final Bow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wealthy elderly lady hires a spiritualist (Harris) to find a long-forgotten man to whom she wants to leave her fortune. Harris enlists the aid of her cab-driver boyfriend (Dern) to track down the now fortyish Edward Shoebridge, tell him of his good fortune, and receive the reward for finding him. Dern acts as detective, finds that Shoebridge has been buried, but then uncovers evidence that he may have faked his own death and be living under a pseudonym. The pursuit intensifies.Well, Harris and Dern are the "good" couple. They are recognizable working-class people who have arguments over money and strategy and are sometimes amusing in their stupidity, though sometimes clever as well.It develops that good old Eddie Shoebridge (Devane) is in fact alive, acting as a salesman in a fancy jewelry shop in San Francisco, and consorting with Karen Black. They're up to no good, however, being in the business of kidnapping and collecting ransoms. They're the "bad" couple. There is a climactic confrontation.Hitchcock has given the film a couple of good moments. Especially notable is the abandoned spin of Dern's car down a steep mountain road while Harris screeches in terror and climbs all over him. The director wisely avoided any sort of chase on the city's hills, that already having been done to death, beginning with "Bullett", and he made a point of not including the car's hood in the point-of-view shots from behind the windshield.There's also a neat scene in which Devane and Black kidnap a bishop during a service in front of a congregation of hundreds and no one tries to interfere. Well, nobody would. It's an instance of what psychologists call "pluralistic ignorance." Everybody thinks everybody else knows what's going on.The story, though, is weak and not really worth Hitchcock's attention. It might have made an exceptional black-and-white B feature in the 30s or 40s. It's filled with implausibilities and it's difficult for a viewer to get caught up in a disorganized search involving money.Hitchcock's inspiration was flagging and he was doing a lot of booze by this time. At the very end, when Harris finds an extraordinarily valuable diamond, she turns to the camera and winks. That reflects poor judgment.But the director had been demonstrating impaired judgment for some years. He'd had some trouble with Paul Newman on "Torn Curtain" and decided that from then on he wouldn't use bankable stars, whereas they might have helped hold this kaleidoscopic tale together. He'd had a fierce argument with his usual composer too, Bernard Herrmann, and had ended their long and fruitful collaboration. The screenwriter, Ernst Lehman, did what he could in adapting a novel for the screen -- he'd written "North By Northwest" earlier -- but it remains a weak effort. Hitchcock's declining discernment extends to the wardrobe. Dern's cab driver wears one of those stiff, peaked military caps with Capitol Cab on the front. In interviews at the time, Dern of course pimped the movie, but informally made offhand remarks about the hat, asking when the last time was that a taxi driver wore a formal cap. Maybe Jimmy Cagney in 1935.The performers, on the whole, are their usual reliable cinematic selves, though maybe with more obscenities and sexual allusions that in any other Hitchcock work. Ed Lauter, for example, is a typical low-brow ungrammatical heavy who does wet work. But both Barbara Harris as the dizzy spiritualist and William Devane as the remorseless hissing villain are outstanding.It's worth catching. It's just a shame that Hitch didn't bow out a bit earlier because, after this was released, all his movies, some of them masterful, were behind him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely little film! I'd never heard of it, although I was overly familiar with all the well-known Hitchcock titles. Let me let you in on a well-kept secret: this is a much more entertaining, amusing, exciting, intriguing and suspenseful piece of film-making than famously over-rated bores like Vertigo or The Birds, clunkers which are nothing like as great as they're cracked up to be.This story is beautifully plotted, wittily written, excellently acted, charming and keeps you guessing all the way. I suppose it's old-fashioned, but I never felt that to be a disadvantage. Everything gets wrapped up nicely, the villains get theirs, and the good guys get theirs. Can't think how I'd never even heard of it until today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Hitchcock fan and I've seen most of his work. Maybe not all of the very early films but most of it. And this.....is not great. The production to me seems low budget. The characters really didn't seem like Hitchcock characters. Barbara Harris plays a psychic with a goofy side that just didn't feel right. Same for Bruce Dern's character. Just kind of slapstick. Also, the blue screen scenes in this just seemed surprisingly obvious and low budget. No way would this film hold up today. This is more comedy than suspense or mystery and most of the comedy isn't that funny to me. I think it would have been better had they followed the book more closely. This is a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fake medium Madam Blanche (Barbara Harris) and her taxi driver boyfriend George (Bruce Dern) make a living by scamming people with her phoney powers. They are hired by an aging widow, Julia Rainbird, to find her nephew who was given away for adoption many years earlier following a family scandal. Meanwhile, an extremely clever couple, diamond merchant Arthur Adamson (William Devine) and his attractive girlfriend Fran (Karen Black), are behind a series of kidnappings of various VIPs in the San Francisco area. The two couples paths soon cross and chaos results in Hitchcock's last film.A disappointing film from Alfred Hitchcock. After a terrific crime scene, the film drags into conclusion. But good acting anyway.Rated PG for Violence and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat and Occasionally Dull As Dust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that has a touch of Hitch in this, His last Movie, is the Tone. The Master Visualist is nowhere to be seen. The Film looks like most from the Seventies, flat and washed out. Yes, there is the Dry Wit and some Whimsy, buy most things here are uninspired and at worst Dull.First, the casting of Bruce Dern, a delightfully demented Character Actor, can not stretch it enough to be a Leading Man, even if said Man is a bit of a Flake. He is just too odd looking to be a constant quest as a Sex Object. Second, the investigation part is so talky and bland that it brings the Movie to a halt early on.It isn't a Bad Movie and the intertwining Story of the two Grifter Couples is intriguing enough, but the whole thing just lays there with an occasional spark of Excellence to prop things up and move it along. However, there isn't enough to maintain its length and although there are some Fun Bits, it really is nothing more than an Entertaining, Puff Piece done by a Talent suffering from Health Issues and the Film seems like a bit of a struggle.Worth a look and has enough going for it to make it rewarding, but is among the Hitchcock lower tier and while not a Failure it is a hardly a Grand Success. Truth be told, Alfred Hitchcock never made an Awful Movie and has one of the best Won-Loss Records in Directorial History.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's bury the plotter in a cemetery plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This nice psychic thriller must have been done by a complete pervert, and everyone knows of course Alfred Hitchcock was THE perfect pervert. Such a plot only happens in the USA, not to speak of California of course. No proper records of births and deaths. One can navigate from one identity to the next in a jiffy. But then imagine two sisters. The younger one gets pregnant out of wedlock. The family is a big name on the local urban stage. So the child had to disappear. It is adopted into anonymity by the chauffeur of the family. But no luck the kid with his local friend, and accomplice, set the house on fire, killing the two adoptive parents, and the child, but no one finds the body, but who cares? So he is considered dead though never officially recorded as such. He gets a new life under another name and becomes, who knows how but we can imagine, a rich jeweler. But to be rich is not enough. He has to get richer but by dangerous and exciting ways. So he becomes a professional abductor of rich people that he gives them back against big diamonds. A big professional first and then the bishop of the local city, Los Angeles probably, at least that's all we can see. The main character though is a psychic who is dealing with the older sister of before who is going to die and she wants to clean up her plate, and her soul not to speak of her mind, before going into the ground. So she is managed into revealing her secret and the son of her sister has to be found. And the surprises are going to start there. Good luck and enjoy the rest of the film. Of course there will be a lot more innuendo, qui pro quo, salmagundi and baloney. And the prize will be so much more than the initial payment envisaged for finding a lost heir because of the two criminals and the latest two diamonds. Why did Alfred Hitchcock bother to produce such an entertaining little thriller at the end of his life? Because there is a tremendous amount of humor, like the rodeo or chase or crazy gig on the winding road in the mountains over Los Angeles, and they will manage to survive their dead brakes and the killing mechanic will end up in flames in the scenery. And the scenery is really beautiful. Humor in how a priest gets a rendezvous with his girl friend up in the mountains by taking four kids on a hike up there. And the poor taxi-driver cum private-eye cum chauffeur of the psychic cum savior of her cum catcher of the criminals is so funny in his multiple unpaid professions and his multiple perambulating over-exploitations by his own girl friend. And so many other funny little situations. But the film has another charm: it is the social irony and light sarcasm that Hitchcock aims at this hypocritical society of California and Los Angeles. Alfred Hitchcock was settling some accounts then with his adoptive country, without burning the house to kill the adoptive parents: they did not deserve that much. And of course he managed to get us lost and give us a complete vertigo with his favorite tricks of staircases going up and down, right and left, to and fro, front and back and even catty-corner and all around. It is of course a metaphor of the society he is depicting but it is also a representation of his inside and crooked mind. Stairs are an obsession in that man and he is trying to entangle us into them to enslave us to their steps, to his steps, and we just can follow, enjoying each step and all the mezzanines between the flights, and fly we do, quite a lot indeed, with the perverted wings of that psycho psychic.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sour note for Hitchcock to depart upon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am under the firm belief that Alfred Hitchcock never made a single bad film. Some, of course, were lesser than others - but even his worst (such as the romantic comedy "Mr. and Mrs. Smith") are above average films.Unfortunately, after the delight of 1972's violent and macabre "Frenzy," which was a return to form for Hitch, he embarked on one more directorial effort - 1976's "Family Plot," which I believe was actually released posthumously.The movie involves the escapades of two con artists (a fake psychic and her boyfriend) who swap paths with two jewel thieves in the San Francisco area. Of course, as per typical Hitchcock, the movie has darkly comical elements to it, lots of bantering dialogue and mistaken identities.However, overall this is probably my least favorite Hitchcock film, which is disappointing given that it was his final picture. Perhaps his poor health restricted his abilities as a director - I'm not sure - but it doesn't altogether even feel like a Hitchcock movie all of the time. The performances by the likes of Bruce Dern and Karen Black never rise above simply being "OK" and the direction is Hitch's weakest - possibly ever.I didn't think the humor worked as well as usual and the entire film just failed to engage me. It's still an interesting movie in some ways, and I'd recommend it because it's not by any means a completely BAD movie - but, when compared to Hitchcock's usual features, it ranks as being notably inferior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie about a couple--Blanche (Barbara Harris) and George (Bruce Dern)--searching for the long-lost nephew of a very rich woman. Unfortunately they get involved with two kidnappers--Adamson (William Devane) and Fran (Karen Black)--and Adamson is VERY evil.Hitchcock's heart wasn't in this one--and it shows. He was in ill health all during the shot and kept butting heads with Black and Devane--they were Method actors (which Hitchcock hated) and drove him crazy asking what their motivations were for every scene. He got along well with Harris and Dern though. The plot itself is (to put it nicely) pretty light-weight and needlessly convoluted. Also the film is indifferently shot (only a few sequences look even remotely good) and it's far too long. To be honest, I was dozing off halfway through! The only things keeping this from being a total bomb are good performances by Harris and Dern, a hair-raising ride in a car with no brakes down a twisting road, John Williams' jokey score and Harris' final wink at the camera. But, all in all, this is overlong, boring and sub-par piece of work. Hitch should have stopped with "Frenzy" (1972). I can only give this a 5.</fullReview>

Their search for the missing man leads to a pair of ruthless kidnappers (played by William Devane and Karen Black) who are none too keen to have people prying into their business.It took Alfred Hitchcock four years to follow up his excellent psycho-sexual thriller Frenzy (1972) with Family Plot, during which time the director suffered from several bouts of ill health that clearly took a toll on his creativity: Hitch's final film is an unremarkable crime caper from an ailing film-maker whose heart no longer seems to be in his work.Gone are the brilliantly orchestrated scenes of tension and suspense for which the distinguished director is renowned; instead we get something that feels like a TV movie-of-the-week, complete with corny characters, hammy performances and ill-advised humour (Blanche losing her cool in a careening car with no brakes is desperately unfunny, a real low-point in Hitch's career).</fullReview>

I may admit the plot seems very interesting and original, from the get go, but the outcome just doesn't deliver. You know, for a plot two hours long, spectator REQUIRES some surprising twist or something, but in this case, filmmakers end this with no big events or anything. One of the some good scenes is when Blanche and Tyler go down on the road-- it's pretty agonizing, be careful. Other than that, there are good actors that truly engage the story, but that isn't enough to fill out the seek for a complete story we all expect.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITAfter his great hit "Psycho" Hitchcock never made an excelent outstanding masterpiece again (with the posible exception of "Frenesi"). In fact he made rather bad (bad not only for Hitchcock's standards) films like "Torn curtain" and "Marnie".This one, fortunately, is a little better. In fact it's not bad at all but being Hitch's final good-bye to the world of cinema makes it a disappointing film. All in all is an amusing thriller/comedy about two couples of crooks fighting each other with some funny scenes like the one where the phoney psychic gives the keys to her lover while she pretends to be in contact with the dead. Fun stuff.Watch this movie if you're already familiarized with most of Hitchcock's truly great work (and I'll not provide a guideline- most of his best films are famous enough to be already known by everyone). If you've never watched a Hitchcock movie before you'll get the wrong idea about them.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After parting company with Robert Burks and Bernard Herrmann in 'Marnie' (even though Herrmann wrote a score for 'Torn Curtain' which was rejected), Hitchcock as we know and love him had peaked and exhausted all of his creative potential as Cecil B. DeMille had done with 'The Buccaneer' in 1958. Although he managed to recruit the talent of Paul Newman and Julie Andrews in 'Torn Curtain', and Rock Hudson in 'Topaz', the quality of his films overall after 'Marnie' was lost. He did not have the engaing cinematography of Robert Burks to take the audience into the story, neither did he have the scoring of Herrmann to engage the audience emotionally and psychologically in the plot. Without Burks and Herrmann, Hitchcock was the director that he was before he arrived in Hollywood. The only redeeming quality of the film is not the film itself but the fact that Hitchcock managed to enlist the talent of John Williams to score the film. With this alliance it is as though the tradition of Hitchcock was handed over to the new phenomenon of 'Star Wars' in the following year. In conclusion then, throughout the whole of Hitchcock's life, he never received an academy award as a 'Best Director'. Having watched 'Family Plot', you can tell why he did not receive such an award. He did, however, get a 'Best Picture' award as a producer because he could enlist talented people around him like Robert Burks, Bernard Herrmann, Frank Waxman, Miklos Rosza, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Laurence Olivier, Cedric Hardwicke, Dimitri Tiomkin, Doris Day and Sean Connery. It was only in his Hollywood years that he could pool together talent as a producer, and even in his last film he enlisted the talent of John Williams, demonstrating that he is a better producer than director. Without the talent around him, as a director, he is relegated to mediocrity.</fullReview>
