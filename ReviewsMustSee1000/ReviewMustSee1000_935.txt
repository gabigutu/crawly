		<shortDescription>Striking '40's Prison Drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal International's BRUTE FORCE is without doubt one of the finest prison pictures ever made. Outstandingly directed by Jules Dassin this brutal brooding and dark drama, has never been, or is ever likely to be, equaled. Produced for the studio in 1947 by Mark Hellinger the stunning black &amp; white cinematography by William Daniels, together with his amazing use of light and shade, perfectly highlighted the bleak grimness of being shut away on the "inside" where injury and death lurks from every crevice of the thick walls. Based on a story by Robert Patterson it was turned into a brilliant screenplay by Richard Brooks and composer Miklos Rozsa once again supplied one of his high octane tension filled scores.Hardened convict Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) is a "lifer" in the maximum security prison of Westgate Penitentiary. Together with his old boss Gallagher (Charles Bickford) - who is also doing time as the prison's newspaper editor - he plans an elaborate escape. But tyrannical head guard Captain Munsey (a brilliant Hume Cronyn) suspects a breakout is afoot and will go to any lengths to prevent it. In one intensely harrowing sequence in his office he interrogates inmate Louie Miller (Sam Levene) about the impending escape and savagely beats him with a hosepipe as Wagner's Tannhauser plays full volume on the phonograph. But Louie endures and tells him nothing. However through another informant Munsey learns the date and time of the escape and prepares his guards accordingly to thwart the breakout. With Collins getting even with the "stoolie" the picture ends in a bloody and vicious battle between the guards and convicts with many deaths on each side including Collins and Munsey who have it out in a climactic and spectacular fight atop the gate tower.The acting is nothing short of superb! In only his second movie (after Hellinger's "The Killers" the previous year) Lancaster is especially good as the recalcitrant and difficult Collins ("You're not fit for civil life and you won't accept prison life" Munsey chides him.) Good too is Charles Bickford, Roman Bohnen as the weak and ineffectual Warden and really excellent is Art Smith as the kindly but perpetually hammered prison doctor ("Yes Capt. Munsey - I'm just a very ordinary man. I get drunk on whiskey but you sir - you get drunk on power".) But there's little doubt the picture belongs to Cronyn. In a powerful portrayal of the highest degree he simply chews up every bit of scenery there is as the sadistic and dictatorial Captain Munsey. Also of note is the score by the great Miklos Rozsa. Almost eclipsing his music for "The Killers" his brooding score here pinpoints the seediness and the ever present potential for danger and death within the prison. His sombre main theme, heard in its broadest rendition under the titles, is a slow dirge-like piece reflecting the despair and hopelessness of those incarcerated in a high security establishment. BRUTE FORCE is one of the composer's best noir scores.The picture only has one drawback - the various and needless flashbacks depicting the women in some of the prisoner's lives. These scenes are merely padding and quiet unnecessary. They do nothing really for the movie except break the atmospheric continuity that already had been so well achieved and established. But thankfully they don't last very long and they make up what is only a minor quibble and does not prevent BRUTE FORCE remaining one of the finest gems from Hollywood's golden past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brute Force is a knockout!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read recent reviews of this film that condemn it for being "outdated" or not "relevant". Um, hello? This movie is is fifty-seven years old! As such, we are treated to typical 1940s Hollywood stereotypes and acting methods, not to mention references to the recently completed war. Yet, even within the pitfalls of the studio system, this film shines as a great example of film noir. Director Jules Dassin is brilliant with light, and sets the example for the French "new wave" of cinema. Lighting Burt Lancaster from the side, or from underneath, makes him and the other actors look almost surreal.Most of the dialogue is "clipped" and preposterous, but films from this era often suffer from this same problem. Yet "Brute Force" retains its original power simply by virtue of the dynamite performances, the stirring score, and the gritty techniques of Dassin. I had to smile during the scene where Hume Cronyn's character turns up the Wagner on his hi-fi so the guards outside his door won't hear the inmate he's about to beat scream. This was mimicked during David Lynch's ground-breaking TV series "Twin Peaks" when a character turned up his radio before he beat his wife. Of course beating people isn't funny, but seeing obvious references in cinema is always a kick. I highly recommend "Brute Force" to anyone who appreciates the art of film, great directing, and fine performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody Can Ever Escape From the Prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Westgate Penitentiary, the Warden A. J. Barden (Roman Bohnen) is a weak man, and the institution is actually ruled by the ambitious and sadistic Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyon), who uses violence, fear and treachery to control the prisoners. After the suicide of Tom Lister (Whit Bissell), one of the inmates of cell R17, provoked by Captain Munsey, the prisoners loses their privileges and rest of the group of cell R-17 leaded by Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) is sent to hard and insalubrious work in the drain pipe. Joe uses a successful strategy of war trying to escape, attacking the tower of the penitentiary from the outside with his men, and from inside with the team leaded by the leader Gallagher (Charles Bickford). However, the plan fails, ending in a bloodshed.Sixty years after the original release date, "Brute Force" is still a great movie of prison. The story is very well constructed, with flashbacks showing the connection of three inmates with his women. The violence is not explicitly disclosed like in the present days, but the cruelty of Captain Munsey can be understood even by the most naive viewer. The direction of Jules Dassin is outstanding with many memorable scenes. Yvonne De Carlo has a minor participation, but a strong role. The moralist message in the end, when Dr. Walters (Alt Smith) tells that nobody can escape from penitentiaries, does not spoil this great movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Brutalidade" ("Brutality")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, dark drama. Great performance by Cronyn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BRUTE FORCE This intense, powerful drama stars Burt Lancaster as Collins, a prisoner who's got to find a way out, and Hume Cronyn as the sadistic Captain Munsey, who delights in torturing the inmates. Cronyn is masterful -- cast wonderfully out of character, his slick, soft delivery takes on a skin-crawling menace. Lancaster is appropriately hard and driven, but the fact that he's breaking out to be by his dying girlfriend's side seems facile. The weakest elements of this film are the flashbacks to how his cellmates got locked up. (It seems obvious these scenes are contrived to introduce women into an otherwise all-male cast.) It turns out none of them are really bad guys except Lancaster, who appears to be some kind of gangster. We aren't given much insight into his character; we know he's smart and a leader, but he's clearly got a tendency toward violence. Ultimately, however, it's not about how they got there, but who they are when they get there. It's about what pushes a man past his breaking point and what happens after that. Weaknesses aside, this is a worthwhile, thought-provoking film with excellent performances all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best prison movies ever made.Jules Dassin's direction is so strong ,so precise,so mind-boggling it packs a real wallop.Hume Cronyn gives a subdued but extremely scary portrayal of a sadistic brute.Always in a suave voice,always saying "I want to help you",there's only one way for him:the hard one.Burt Lancaster is equally efficient as a tough inmate .But the whole cast cannot be too highly praised.The cast and credits read :"the women from outside" .There are four flashbacks which really fit into the movie.All of them last barely two or three minutes but they could provide material for four other movies. The first one (Flossie's ) verges on farce ,it is the comic relief of a desperate movie and we need it!Then the "fur coat" segment which is some kind of Cinderella turned film noir.The third one,perhaps the less interesting (everything is relative!), features Yvonne De Carlo as an Italian girl during the war the former soldier was in love with .And finally Burt Lancaster's story, he tries to find money to pay his girlfriend's operation.These flashbacks are not gratuitous:all that is left to those men is memories .Besides,the last line tells us something like that:"nobody will escape!nobody!" More than ten years before ,Dassin had shown what French director Jacques Becker would do in his famous prison movie "le trou" (1960) : the prison as a metaphor of the human condition.There are lots of scenes which will leave you on the edge of your seat.My favorite scene: the informer's death while Lancaster is securing his alibi with the doc.But the final is awesome too,something apocalyptic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, ok, I will give away a tad bit of the ending here, but not much. This movie builds decently towards the eventual climactic ending. But wow, what an ending!Rewind and check the camera shot of Burt giving the go-ahead to begin the escape, and see Jeff Corey (the fink) tied to the front of the tram (and thus first to take the machine gun bullets).Also don't miss the smoke that comes out the back of Jeff Corey's shirt as he is riddled with those bullets. And it takes a quick eye to catch the guard's shotgun blast actually pierce part of the iron cell bar as he kills Duff from above. How about the bleeding bullet hole in Burt's back as he fights with his new warden? And the strength he shows when tossing him off the tower. The small stuff helps the realism of this oldie!Burt, you were so cool! I wish you had accepted the Ben Hur and Patton role you were offered!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prison Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Westgate Penitentiary, the Warden is a weak man, the prison is practically run by the cruel and highly ambitious Captain Munsey. But the prisoners are no walk overs, they deal their own justice to those that don't tow the line, tired and fed up of mistreatment, and fuelled by the Munsey influenced suicide of a popular inmate, the prisoners, led by big Joe Collins, plot a break out, the fear of failure not even an option.Brute Force is a cracking moody picture directed with innovation by Jules Dassin and starring Burt Lancaster (brilliant as Joe Collins), Hume Cronyn (Munsey), Charles Bickford (Gallagher) and lady support (shown in excellent flashbacks) from Yvonne De Carlo, Ann Blyth, Ella Raines and Anita Colby. We open in the pouring rain at the monolithic gates of Westgate Penitentiary, Dassin's camera looking up at the gate like some foreboding warning, William Daniels black and white photography is stark and making its point, all this as Miklos Rozsa's score thunders in our ears, it's clear that this is going to be a mean and moody prison picture.So it proves to be, sure all the formula traits that lace most prison films are in here, but Dassin and his team have managed to harness an oppressive feel to put us the viewer within the walls of Westgate as well. This is a bleak place, there are six men to a prison cell, their only chance of staying sane is memories of loved ones and a unified spirit to not be put upon by the vile Munsey, we are privy to everything, we ourselves are part of the furniture. Brute Force thankfully doesn't disappoint with its ending, the tension has been built up perfectly, the mood is set, so when the ending comes it's explosive and a truly fitting finale to what has been a first rate prison melodrama. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Most Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster in his career made two classic prison story films, Brute Force and Birdman of Alcatraz. Both have their share of fans. Birdman though is much longer and it is solely about Lancaster and his long incarceration. In Brute Force Lancaster heads a good ensemble cast and it is as much about the incarcerators as well as the incarcerated.One of the things that can't be overlooked about prison films and in this case Brute Force does is that all kinds of anti-social folk go into prison. Just why are they there? Notice there seem to be no sex crime perpetrators in the population, not a realistic picture by any means. Or any narcotics offenders among them either and that was changing right around the time Brute Force was made.Still director Jules Dassin gets some great performances out of his cast. From the jailer's point of view, the politics of the penal system never got as good a portrayal until Robert Redford's Brubaker came along over 30 years later. I like the performances of weak and burned out warden Roman Bohnen, the alcoholic doctor Art Smith and of course Hume Cronyn who got his career role out of this film.Once seen you will not forget Hume Cronyn as Captain Munsey. He is a type who unfortunately is attracted to corrections work, a brutal sadist who probably tortures animals in his spare time. Now that is not an indictment of all prison guards not by any means. Still people like that do make their way into that line of work.Which raises an interesting question. Being a corrections officer is one of the toughest jobs going. You are in fact going outnumbered among a group of very antisocial people and going among them unarmed. For your own survival you have to establish a reputation for toughness and fast. Bearing the necessity for that in mind, is there a point where that job will turn you into a Captain Munsey? Brute Force coming out as it did post World War II with the holocaust discovery fresh in everyone's mind is disturbing and terrifying. How easy is it to slide in brutality when you have that kind of authority over people? I think that's the question director Jules Dassin is asking of his audience.The coordinated prison break at the climax of the film still almost sixty years later still has a powerful jolt to it. With the odds very much stacked against them the men still do it, even after they know they've been informed on. You won't forget it or Brute Force.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of It's Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the era it was made(late 1940's),BRUTE FORCE is surprisingly brutal and vicious in places,pre-dating similar antics from James Cagney two years later in WHITE HEAT. The majority of Hollywood prison movies seem to have riots in them and this is no exception,but BRUTE FORCE has arguably the most explosive of the lot,with tear gas,shootings,and killings galore. Mind you,with a warder as brutal as Hume Cronyn(who sadly died recently)in charge,it's no wonder.His psychological bulling of mild-mannered inmate Whit Bissell leads to the former's suicide,and savage beating of Sam Levene results in near death. The misery,waste,and isolation of prison life is well observed here,with fine performances all round,but especially from Cronyn and Jeff Corey,as a cringing,cowardly informer,both of whom incur the rage of the intense Burt Lancaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a deeply strange movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)"Brute Force" is a prison drama, directed by Jules Dassin, who was soon thereafter blacklisted in Hollywood, went abroad, made "Rififi," married Melina Mercouri, made "Never on Sunday" etc. etc. "Brute Force" dates from 1947, a moment when the Stalinist line on the arts was taking a particularly sharp turn toward the crudest formulas--in that year there was a sharp debate in the CPUSA's cultural magazine, Masses and Mainstream, between the screenwriters Albert Maltz and John Howard Lawson (both of whom later served time in Federal prison as members of the Hollywood Ten) over whether art must always be viewed as a weapon in class struggle. (Maltz suggested maybe not, Lawson insisted yes; the dispute was eventually closed by a declaration from V.J. Jerome that Lawson was right, and Maltz was obliged to engage in "self-criticism" for his Browderite errors.) So here's Burt Lancaster as prisoner "Joe Collins" (and if the assonance of that name is an accident then I am the Grand Duchess Anastasia.) In a back story we learn that he's serving time for organizing bank robberies (students of Stalin's biography, or legend, please note); now he's masterminding a mass escape. The prison warden (Hume Cronyn), made up to look uncannily like Goebbels, struts around his office in jodhpurs and a black Sam Browne belt; when he gets ready to torture a prisoner for information, though, he strips to the waist--no, I'm not making this up--and puts on a recording of Wagner.Then we have Charles Bickford, editor of the prison newspaper and clearly cast as the voice of misguided reformism; he opposes the prison break, arguing that publicizing the warden's brutality will eventually win better conditions, but is cruelly betrayed, and comes to see the wisdom of Collinsism. Jeff Corey plays one of Lancaster's subordinates but shows his true colors in a key scene: when Lancaster asks the others what position they want to take up in the actual breakout, Corey answers "I'll go last, to cover our back," which sounds plausible until you realize that the others all give the only right answer, which is "Wherever you want me, Joe." Of course Lancaster immediately grasps that Corey is the traitor, presumably because he displays the capacity for independent thought, and so indeed it proves.Wait, there's more. There is only one Black prisoner, whose job in the joint is to sweep the floors; known as Calypso (I *swear* I'm not making it up) he sings all his dialog in rhymed couplets. And there's the prison doctor, the spineless petit-bourgeois intellectual, who sympathizes with the prisoners but is bullied into inaction by the warden; he drinks and utters despairing commentary.Pervading this tale is a misogyny so deep and unquestioned that the filmmakers would probably have been astonished to have it pointed out to them. Yet all the prisoners whose stories we learn are there essentially because of the perfidy, greed, lust, or other vices of women in their lives--all except for Joe, who in a scene calculated to induce whiplash smoothly exits a long black getaway car to a house with a white picket fence, where dwells his sweetheart--a crippled girl, in a wheelchair, her nether parts covered by a thick plaid blanket. He swoops her up in his strong arms and carries her about, doll-like, while she squeals with delight--she is, in other words, completely desexualized and infantile, the only kind of woman (the script seems to be saying) that a man can trust.The square-up is the ancient device whereby dubious themes or images are cleansed in the last few minutes by some clumsy explanation: it was all a dream, or the lurid images had a sober educational purpose, or some such. But what's the square-up in a Stalinist parable? It's a noir dead end! The prison break goes off the rails, the warden gets his fiery come-uppance but the prisoners don't get out, the state cops retake control with great bloodshed, and the prison doctor gets the last word: "They didn't escape. No one ever escapes." In short Hollywood endorses this bleak Sartrean view by way of trumping the rest of the movie's pitch for the wisdom of Comrade Collins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a shadow of a doubt, Brute Force is a classic movie that still stands today, as a powerful piece of film-making. Everything about this movie is top notch - the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the pacing are all essential ingredients in this superb film. Although there's not a weak link in the entire film, special mention must go to Burt Lancaster, Art Smith, John Hoyt, Charles Bickford, Sam Levene, and Hume Cronyn as the evil &amp; sadistic Munsey. The deft touch of Jules Dassin is there for all to see, and the film builds to a tremendous climax. In 1947 this must have been an extremely powerful and hard-hitting film, and it remains so to this day. For anyone who appreciates movie-making at its best, this is hard to beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutality, Futility &amp; Despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This powerful drama is totally uncompromising and provides a convincing account of what life is like in a prison which is being run in a particularly brutal and autocratic manner. The consequence for the inmates is that they live in an oppressive and overcrowded environment where hard labour, poor quality food and harsh treatment are the norm. Furthermore, they are also subjected to a cruel system which leads to many of them being abused, tortured or even killed as a result of actions taken by the officials in charge.As well as the extreme brutality that they experience, the prisoners also suffer the deep level of despair which comes from the knowledge that there's absolutely nothing they can do to improve their circumstances, as even the prospects for rehabilitation and parole are taken away from them. The sheer desperation of these men who can't get away from either their pasts or their current tribulations inevitably creates a need for an escape plan to be developed and Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster), the leader of the convicts in cell R17 is a man who has more reasons than most for wanting to get out.Joe is released from a spell in solitary at the same time as the body of one of his cell-mates (who was a victim of the regime's evil practices) is being taken away from the prison. Joe's wheelchair bound wife is also suffering from a life threatening illness and is not prepared to go ahead with the urgent surgery she needs unless Joe is with her. He wants Gallagher (Charles Bickford), who is the editor of the prison newspaper, to help with the organisation of a breakout but Gallagher refuses because he believes that he has a chance of being given parole in the near future.The prison Warden's methods are criticised by his superiors and he's swiftly replaced by Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyn) who is the sadistic Chief Guard whose lust for power has finally won him the top job. The practices that Munsey puts into operation to achieve greater discipline include the indefinite suspension of parole hearings and this leads to Gallagher changing his mind and getting on board with the attempt to escape.Dr Walters (Art Smith) is the ageing prison physician who drinks too much and despairs about the amount of brutality that he sees. When he openly accuses Munsey of torturing the prisoners, he gets struck to the floor by his disdainful colleague in an act which highlights both Munsey's intolerance and his pleasure in inflicting pain.The escape plan is eventually put into action but because Munsey had already been tipped off by one of the inmates, the element of surprise is lost and what follows turns out to be an incredibly violent full scale riot with the men on both sides suffering a huge number of injuries and fatalities and the whole endeavour proving to be an absolute failure.The characters in this story are very memorable. Joe is tough, full of controlled anger and completely focused on what he wants to achieve. Munsey is vicious, merciless and manipulative as he fosters and uses a network of informers and even uses psychological methods which, in one case, leads to an inmate's suicide. Gallagher's discretion, integrity and diplomacy gain him the respect of both the guards and the convicts and Dr Walters is a humanitarian whose disenchantment with the system is profound. Lancaster and Cronyn are outstanding in their roles and the performances of the rest of the cast are also consistently good.The allegorical nature of the story is strong as it shows Munsey as a dictatorial monster who plays Wagner recordings as he tortures a helpless prisoner and some of the Nazi imagery is also quite striking. Bearing in mind the timing of the movie's release and the political leanings of its director, none of this is particularly shocking. What is more surprising is how this kind of depiction of the prison's officials was sanctioned under the strict censorship constraints which were in force at the time."Brute Force" isn't a story of good guys and bad guys as not all the guards are bad and clearly not all the convicts are good. Both groups are perpetrators of appalling brutality as the prisoners' punishment of stool pigeons provides a couple of the most sickeningly cruel scenes in the film. What it really illustrates most strongly is how much hopelessness the people in the institution feel, how futile the self perpetuating brutality is and how inevitable it is that (to quote the philosophical Dr Walters) "nobody escapes, nobody ever really escapes".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hume Cronym's Best Remembered Role Before Old Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight Turner Classic Films were showing five films in honor of actor writer Hume Cronym (whose birthday is July 18). Cronym has only been dead now for five years, but he was an impressive character actor in comedy and in drama. I was lucky twenty years ago to see the Broadway production of THE PETITION a two person play Cronym played with his wife and partner Jessica Tandy, and I can vouch he was a crisp and fine a performer on stage as he was in his films.Captain Muncey is one of the most detestable villains in motion pictures, turning his prison into a private torture chamber, with the apparent acquiescence of his guards (note Ray Teal, his personal guard and assistant). He has his way in the prison due to the weakness of the burned out warden Roman Bohman and the bullying of a political hack from the Governor's office (Richard Gaines) who is impressed by Muncey's claims of the need for discipline. But as the wise but alcoholic doctor (Art Smith) points out, while discipline has a place the Warden has never given an order to Muncey telling him to crucify the prisoners.It's a rather pitiful prison system we see here, and sad to say it remains a problem. The warden keeps bemoaning his failure to come to grips with rehabilitation and punishment, but he has no real suggestions in him, and he is really more upset about what he will do when he is forced out for the rest of his life. The doctor tries to give a degree of humanity to the prisoners lives (interestingly enough, like the alcoholic doctor played by Dudley Digges in MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY), but he is aware that he has no place to work outside the prison he is in either. Muncey, in fact, taunts him as a surgical butcher, suggesting something he did went terribly wrong. Muncey and his guards seem to fall into dominating and assaulting the prisoners at the drop of a hat. When Whit Bissell is walked into accidentally by Cronym in the lunchroom, Teal starts clubbing him until even Cronym points out it was his own fault not Bissell's. Only at one late point in the film, when Cronym is beating up Sam Levene in his locked office, do we see some of the guards react - but none intervene.The film (well directed by noir specialist Jules Dassin) follows the last week of Cronym's system before it collapses. There have been increasing numbers of prisoners dying because Cronym has purposely put them into unsanitary and deadly work, especially in the main drains of the prison. One prisoner, Burt Lancaster, has refused to crack so far (he has been put in solitary due to a "shiv" being planted on him, with the connivance of Cronym and Teal). He returns to his cell and the prisoner who was the collaborator on this is killed later on in a stunningly good scene in the prison workshop. Lancaster is determined to escape and learns from a dying prisoner that there is a route through the drain. It has to be used in a timed escape that requires a riot in the prison yard and the use of an armed truck. To coordinate Lancaster need the help of the prison trustee (Charles Bickford), but the latter is up for parole.Lancaster plans the escape with his cell mates (Howard Duff - in his first film, John Hoyt, Whit Bissell, Jack Overman, and Jeff Corey). In the course of their discussions they each tell stories about their lives, showing that the economic forces of the world frequently force them into crime (Bissell embezzles to help him and his wife; Duff takes the blame for a murder his wife - Yvonne De Carlo - committed to help him when he was being arrested for giving food to the Italians in the war; Hoyt, a colorful confidence man, is robbed with his own gun of the proceeds of a swindle and a visit to the gambling tables by an attractive woman who also steals his car; Lancaster has been keeping his crippled, cancer ridden wife (Ann Blythe) from knowing he is a criminal and prisoner). One gets a feeling that these men did not have to become criminals but were forced into it.This is the weakness of the film, forgetting how many criminals in prison deserve to be in prison for their actions. As was pointed out in another review on this thread, there are sexual criminals who we never see, and the ones sentenced to death (the film is set in 1947) are never even mentioned. Nor are problems among male or female prisoners in their own prisons dealing with sexual predators among their fellow prisoners (and the guards sometimes). However, one can safely say that no prisoner deserves a set of guards controlled by an ego-maniacal sadist like Cronym's Muncey.The film was shot shortly after World War II, so it is notable that Muncey likes to play Wagnerian music (so long established as music for Nazis) in his office. In fact, when he beats Sam Levene in his office he has the Wagner music playing loudly to drown Levene's screams (oddly enough the music is not from the "RING" Cycle, but from TANNHAUSER, and it is the "Venusburg" music which was supposed to be sensual!). Still the film shows the cruel, power-mad Captain as an unforgettable villain. He is as aware at the end of Lancaster's plans as he can be - but he is also aware of the warning Art Smith gives him - that power mad people end up being destroyed by their power. In his last few moments (as one sees in the film) Captain Muncey does find out how true this comment is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster and cellmates plot a daring breakout. Okay, sounds like a thousand other prison movies, but what makes this the top of the prison genre are the elements. Watching the characters in this gem is like staring down a cobra- they're so fascinating. There are the unique cellmates: meak accountant Whit Bissell driven over the edge, a learned, elder prisoner (Charles Bickford) the tough Burt Lancaster, etc. etc. Most memorable is Hume Cronyn (his greatest film performance) as the soft spoken, neat-nick psychotic Captain Munsey, a prison official who takes so much delight in beating prisoners, he plays his favorite music and strips to his t-shirt during beatings! Grand screenwriting by future director Richard Brooks. Cellmates have only one wall decoration, a picture of a glamour girl. She reminds each cellmate of a different woman who caused them to do time. The dialog crackles loudly: (Sample- Bickford to Lancaster about a cellmate plotting a break: "He said next Tuesday is the day of the break. He's been saying that about every Tuesday for the last twelve years. Twelve years from now, he'll be saying the same thing....") Hey Universal, put this wonderful classic on VHS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burt Lancaster-Hume Cronyn Celebrity Deathmatch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prison movies (and prison TV shows) are a genre unto themselves, and there are many genre requirements:- a good shiving- a good shanking- a machine-shop revenge-shiv-shanking (usu. w/ blow-torches)- lingering close-ups of cement- tastefully-filmed male rape (after 1970)- the insistent stage-whisper, "It's gotta be tonight!"Well, Jules Dasin's Brute Force has almost all of the above. Burt Lancaster stars as Joe Collins, a hardened con in a cruel penal system who lives for only one hope: escape. Burt's nemesis is Captain Munsey, a sadistic guard played by Mr. Jessica Tandy himself, Hume Cronyn. Now, the very notion that Hume Cronyn could ever pose a physical challenge to Burt Lancaster is silly, so director Dasin wisely keeps them apart for most of the movie, until the extremely violent conclusion.Lancaster shares a cramped cell with five other convicts, including Charles Bickford and Howard Duff (in his film debut). Their cell is adorned with a calendar featuring a picture of a girl so non-descript that each of the boys can see their own long-lost loves in her face, and we are treated to flashbacks showing how each of these losers got where he is today. Duff's flashback is the best ? while a soldier in Italy, he took the rap for a murder committed by his beautiful war-bride, Yvonne De Carlo. Howard Duff with an army-issue machine gun is but one example of how this movie goes above and beyond the usual prison fare.The preachy scenes involving the prison's resident conscience??I mean doctor??are worth fast-forwarding through (unfortunately those scenes are also genre requirements), and Burt tends to lapse into that sensitive Frankenstein acting that he does so well, but man, what a climax to this movie. It's this life's only opportunity to see a clench-teethed Hume Cronyn firing a gattling gun into an unarmed crowd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster has great stage presence, and it's interesting to see how the other prisoners pay obeisance to him, but most of this movie made me want to escape from it. Hume Cronyn's sadistic prison guard was so repulsive I finally had to fast-forward through the scene in which he pummeled a handcuffed inmate. Did anyone else find it peculiar that each of the plotters had weird relationships with women? One is hoodwinked by a moll, another goes to jail for trying to buy his wife's love with a stolen mink coat, yet another takes the rap for a father-killer, and Burt lusts after a lady in a wheelchair.I did admire the performance of Art Smith as an alcoholic prison doctor who may simultaneously have been an inmate (it wasn't really clear). This exceedingly odd film is definitely not a date movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overly sentimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't find this to be a bad film at all, but based on my previous viewings of Jules Dassin's movies I found the style of this one to be surprisingly sentimental and melodramatic. I think the extent of our identification with the character played by Burt Lanchaster was too great, he's far too much of a "hero" for the film to be really interesting.Nonetheless there are a lot of interesting elements here. Hume Cronyn's performance is definitely a brave one and a very effective one. There's a kind of pettiness that hangs about him that makes his sadistic guard captain very chilling and at the same time convincing. For example, he fancies himself an expert at torture but doesn't manage to get good information from the one suspect we see questioning, nor does his treatment of the Lancaster character result in the kind of intimidation he images it will. And the way he's dressed down by Art Smith's character (by the way, Smith deserved much higher billing relative to his importance in the film) makes him seem very vulnerable.The thing I most disliked in the movie though was the flashback sequences which made the whole affair seem corny. All of them deal with women who the men in prison have left on the outside, and all of these guys are basically angelic in the flashbacks. There's one with a guy stealing supplies for his Italian girlfriend. And then there's Lancaster's which is saved for the end, the most ridiculous of all because he's got a woman in a wheelchair who he's trying to save from some disease. It was like the most horrid kind of 1800s melodrama stuck into a supposedly hard edged prison movie.Jules Dassin did a good job of making the movie and all the actors played their parts very well, but the thing was undone from the beginning by that script which called for undue sentiment. I didn't think it made it a truly bad film, but it's a very mixed bag to me and I'm surprised it's been hailed by so many as a "hard boiled" film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story of the half-dozen inmates in Cell R17 of a prison that looks something like Sing Sing is pretty earthy stuff. What a cast. Burt Lancaster is the leader of the attempt to break out. The other cell mates include Jeff Corey, Howard Duff, and Whit Bissell, and John Hoyt -- who was the Martian with three arms in a "Twilight Zone" segment, as well as Decius Brutus in MGM's "Julius Caesar". Charles Bickford is the prison's newspaper editor and Sam Levene is the prison reporter.On the staff side of the cast list, Roman Bohnen is the weak-willed prison warden, Jay C. Flippen and Roy Teal are corrections officers, and Hume Cronyn is superb as the Captain of the Guards.I kept thinking how easily this could have been a film about Stalags or concentration camps in World War II Germany. Escape is hopeless. (The code in 1947 would never have permitted a successful escape from prison.) And Cronyn is a kind of Nazi figure. He's smooth and ingratiating when necessary but his real character is revealed during a hair-raising scene in which he tries to get Sam Levene to spill the beans about the escape plans. Cronyn interrogates Levene and taunts him, while Wagner is playing on the phonograph. When Levene isn't forthcoming, Cronyn pulls down the shades, dismisses the witnesses, and begins beat the handcuffed Levene with a rubber hose.The inmates are all essentially good guys. Flashbacks fill in their back stories. They were either dumb and impulsive or committed a crime to help their marriages or to get money for a girl friend's operation. Either the writer didn't know much about inmate culture or that culture has changed a great deal in the years intervening since its release.At one point, the weakling warden has an interesting, if brief, exchange with the placid Cronyn. Cronyn remarks, "You set the rules, but I have to enforce them." He's right about his awkward position. He belongs to a class that the sociologist Robert Park called "marginal people," along with top sergeants, head nurses, and factory foremen -- not management and not quite labor. Of course, not every person occupying a marginal status needs to caress his rubber hose with such relish.There are a couple of murders, a suicide, and a riot. There's plenty of action. At the same time, prison movies are by their nature depressing. The clothing and surroundings are so bleak and grating that, no matter what happens, one's spirits sink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BRUTE FORCE (Jules Dassin, 1947) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I'd only previously watched this movie once almost 25 years ago on a long-defunct Sicilian TV channel called Antenna 10, some scenes have stuck with me to this day and being able to reacquaint myself with the film was a long-cherished prospect which, thanks to Criterion, I now have.The film is the epitome of the great, hard-hitting prison dramas of the 1930s, but the style in which it was filmed also makes it fall in the "Film Noir" category. This was only Burt Lancaster's second movie but he is already a tough, powerful screen presence and his character is one of the most respected within the prison community. The casting (in characterizations which would be much imitated in subsequent prison films) is perfection: pint-sized Hume Cronyn is very effectively cast against type as the quintessential brutal prison captain of the guards, Charles Bickford is the bigwig inmate who gets things done, Sam Levene is his reporter sidekick. Lancaster's gang includes Howard Duff (making his film debut), Jeff Corey (as a surprising 'rat'), suave ladies' man John Hoyt and Whit Bissell as the most vulnerable and least likely inmate who falls victim to Cronyn's "brute force". There's also Jay C. Flippen as an easy-going prison guard, Sir Lancelot as a happy-go-lucky jack-of-all-trades whose songs often sarcastically comment on the action, Vince Barnett as an old-timer who brings food (and messages) to the most dangerous inmates currently serving in the drainpipes, and an uncredited Charles McGraw as an arms dealer. Actually, one of the best roles in the film ? the alcoholic, philosophizing prison doctor who is the only one genuinely interested in the fate of his "patients" ? is splendidly portrayed by an actor who was unknown to me, Art Smith, and his confrontations with Cronyn offer some of the film's quiet highlights.While the film itself offers relatively little new in terms of plot ? a few of the prisoners are planning a breakout, the sadistic and power-hungry captain is more evil than the inmates themselves, an informer is punished during a staged scuffle, a traitor is present within Lancaster's gang, the climactic escape is a botched massacre, etc ? and some of the plot points rather contrived ? Sam Levene being sent to the drainpipes, which results in his being tortured by Cronyn ? but Dassin's assured handling still makes all of these situations work superbly well. Ironically, after a period directing mostly light fare, this was the start of a peerless run of five noir classics ? culminating in his celebrated caper film, RIFIFI (1955), made while exiled in France. Curiously enough, another Hollywood exile would later on basically make the British equivalent of BRUTE FORCE ? i.e. Joseph Losey's exceptional THE CRIMINAL (1960) ? while the failed prison break (in similar circumstances) also brings to mind Jacques Becker's masterful swan song, LE TROU (1960).Like THE KILLERS (1946) before it, this was a Mark Hellinger production (it features no less than four actors from that film) and so would be Dassin's follow-up ? THE NAKED CITY (1948). Miklos Rozsa's music is very good and subtly underscores the action. Unfortunately, the four flashback sequences added to the film to show that the hardened criminals here are good-natured people at heart, are mostly redundant and basically only serve to provide some female interest to the story; still, they are brief enough not be detrimental to the film's overall uncompromising bleakness. Incidentally, while screenwriter Richard Brooks was involved in this capacity with several noirs ? the others being THE KILLERS itself, CROSSFIRE (1947), KEY LARGO (1948) and MYSTERY STREET (1950; which I recently acquired via Warners' fourth "Film Noir Collection" but have yet to watch) ? he never revisited the genre once he graduated to the director's chair (though some sources do list his Mexican Revolution-set CRISIS [1950] and the crusading newspaper story DEADLINE ? U.S.A. [1952] under this flexible banner).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the overcrowded tough Westgate Penitentiary. Capt. Munsey (Hume Cronyn) is the hard-nosed guard who actually runs the prison. Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) refuses to bend to his will. He's let out of solitary after getting set up by Munsey. Joe's wife Ruth is unwilling to get an operation for cancer without Joe being there. He has a plan to escape.The prison movie has been done all the time. This is an early brutal vision of incarceration. The flashbacks of various prisoners are unnecessary and distracting. In fact, most of the flashbacks can be eliminated. Prison is a tough place where there is little hope. Lancaster and Cronyn serve as good foils and it has an action packed battle in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In every society, there are certain men who for lack of a Good Attorney, or perhaps, a bad decision on their part, they find themselves at the receiving end of court inflicted judgment. One thing societies forget or may be they don't want to know, is that the men they have imprisoned, will eventually get out. The harshness of their punishment at the hands of the Warden or the Prison Guards is what drives inmates to remember how to treat their next victim when they do get out. In this Robert Patterson story, " Brute Force " our hero is one Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) who comes to the attention of a most sadistic Captain of the Guards named Munsey (Hume Cronyn) (superior acting) who prides himself in knowing how to rule. His egotistic style pits him against Collins and every other prisoner at the prison. Directed by Jules Dassin, this early Black and White movie is a great example of find casting of superior talent. Men who will make their mark in other superior movies. Men such as Jeff Corey, Jay C. Flippen, Howard Duff and Whit Bissell. Throughout this story, audiences hate to root for the hero, as he is a convict. Nevertheless, when it comes to Burt Lancaster, we cannot help but feel that he may yet succeed. The end result of this memorable film is the making of a Classic and in looking back, few can argue otherwise. Superb Movie. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where else would you find so many helpless flies to stick pins into?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Brute Force (1947)' was the first in an impressive run of film noir pictures by Jules Dassin, prior to his trouble with the HUAC. It is perhaps the father of the prison drama. Certainly, without it there couldn't have been any 'Escape from Alcatraz (1979)' or 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994).' Burt Lancaster plays Joe Collins, a convict bent on escaping the seemingly-inpenetrable Westgate Penitentiary. Collins quietly recruits fellow inmates, while avoiding the watchful gaze of chief guard Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyn), a sadistic, power-hungry authoritarian who is ultimately more dangerous than the prisoners in his charge. Cronyn's performance is brilliant and unusual: despite an otherwise unintimidating stature, he nonetheless represents a vicious force of reckless authority, frightening and loathsome. While ruthlessly beating a prisoner for information, Munsey drowns out the noise with a recording of the opera "Tannhäuser," perhaps a reference to Hitler's fondness for Wagner. In comparison, the prison's warden A.J. Barnes (Roman Bohnen) is meek and impotent, a tired old man clinging to the familiar.Though undoubtedly a hard, tough drama, with several intense and confronting moments, Dassin punctures the film with tender flashbacks to the convicts' lives before prison. One inmate recalls with fondness the one time he was swindled by a crafty dame. Another laments the lover he left behind in Italy during the War. Collins remembers the innocent, wheelchair-ridden girl whom he loves, and who is doomed to die herself while he serves his prison sentence. These occasional flashbacks not only humanise the prisoners (especially when compared to the cold, spiteful Capt. Munsey), but also suggest the reason for their crimes, and their enduring lust to break free -- in true noir style, of course, a woman is usually the catalyst. This humanisation of the characters is ultimately heartbreaking, as we come to realise that their efforts are meaningless, their fates doomed. The Production Code would never have allowed a successful prison break, and, for once, the film is better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all-time great prison films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most prison films, "Brute Force" is exceptional because it features some wonderful psychological portraits--not just the typical stereotypical hoods. In fact, the biggest villain in the movie is not even one of the inmates but the captain of the guards (Hume Cronyn). Cronyn manages to create a thoroughly despicable yet restrained character who you hate but who also is rather complex and gritty. He manipulates and pushes the prisoners to such lengths that you can't help to start to root for them instead of the sociopathic guards! This is an interesting twist and Cronyn can be credited for exceptional acting.It also helps that the film has so many excellent actors. The star is a young Burt Lancaster, but she's ably assisted by the likes of character actors such as Charles Bickford, Whit Bissel and John Hoyt--as well as some flashbacks involving actresses Yvonne De Carlo, Ann Blyth and the ill-fated Ella Raines. While most of these are not household names, all were very accomplished supporting character actors--and made the film classier and more interesting.The theme of the film is Cronyn versus all the prisoners. He spends much of his time playing mind games with the men--pushing them until they break. His efforts, however, are pretty subtle--he is not an obvious sadist but delights in pushing the men over the edge--either pushing them to kill themselves, become an informer or attempt to break out of prison. One example is how he delights in pushing embezzler Bissell about his wife--telling him that she is going to divorce him. Nice guy, huh? Eventually, though, he pushes too hard. So hard that his machinations make the men snap--then, even the brilliant but sick Cronyn has lost control.Exceptional acting, script and direction (with a stronger than typical film noir style to it) make this exciting throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time sure passes slowly in prison!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone seems to have covered most of the bases on this one, but I'd like to add that Brute Force, despite its many fine qualities, must be the slowest and talkiest prison drama ever made. Whole life sentences seem to pass by without a hint of action, though the three violent set-piece sequences are shockingly well done.Politically, I can't agree with one erudite and entertaining contributor's claim that it's a Stalinist allegory. Uncle Joe would have packed its makers off to jail themselves for the sin of bourgeois pessimism, not to mention for making a hero of a criminal, a member of the parasitical lumpen-proletariat.Romantic existentialist gloom is more its line, along with similarly doom-laden and vaguely left-wing period gems such as Gun Crazy (alias Deadly Is The Female) and The Lady From Shanghai. If you want a truly Marxist 1940s film allegory, try Abraham Polonsky's magnificent Force Of Evil, if a film so politically transparent can be called an allegory at all.I wonder if this defiantly uncommercial film sold many tickets on release? If it was even a minor hit, that would suggest some interesting differences between 1947's audiences and today's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Fine Noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jules Dassin ("Rififi"/"Naked City") directs this hard-hitting but outdated crime drama concerned about prison conditions. Its social commentary seems more like a mixture of bleeding heart liberal talk and Hollywood's melodramatic interpretation about prison life than a true questioning of the prison system, though its concerns for prisoners' rights might at the time have seemed relevant-- modern society is now concerned with the rising crime rate and questioning how to get tougher with the inmates. Brute Force is based on a story by Robert Patterson; the screenplay is by Richard Brooks.Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyn) is a sadist on a power trip, clubbing prisoners for information to the strains of Wagner. He takes pleasure in torturing prisoners and in having a network of stoolies, suggesting that society commends his actions to get order by any means possible. Munsey's ambition is to become warden, replacing the inept old-timer Barnes. The politician prison big boss McCollum warns that if there's any more trouble from the prisoners he will replace the warden, which prompts Munsey to secretly work against the warden.Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) is a prison leader who was sent to solitary because a shiv was planted on him by a stoolie named Wilson, on orders from Muncey. When Joe gets out the inmates execute a plan to eliminate the stoolie, as the men start a diversionary fight in the machine shop and then Wilson is forced by blow-torches to his death in a large steam press.Flashbacks of the inmates on the outside are used in an attempt to show the reason for their imprisonment and to introduce some female interest, unfortunately this ruins the fast-paced rhythm of the claustrophobic film.Joe and his cellmates plan to escape. When the top-dog prisoner Gallagher (Charles Bickford) realizes he won't get parole, he joins in the breakout. Gallagher's men cause a diversion in the prison yard, while Joe and his men plan their escape through a mine. The breakout turns bloody, as the guards are ready for them because one of Joe's cellmates is a stoolie. The sympathetic Dr. Walters (Art Smith), the frustrated alcoholic prison doctor, says after the bloodbath "Nobody ever escapes." Which is the allegorical message the film draws, comparing the brutality of war to the prison. Munsey is viewed as a fascist, who has the support of the top prison officials. The inmates are seen as helpless captives, subject to the whims of how Munsey interprets the law. This prison film speaks for all such prisons and the sense of hopelessness that prevails behind bars. It is only the violent actions that seem to give the men some hope to be free again. The point hammered home is that the prison system reflects the values of society, as Dassin castigates society for creating and then turning a blind eye toward the brutality and insensitivity of a prison system that offers no chance for rehabilitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still powerful today...an absolute masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to say about this movie, it's hard to know where to begin. I'll confine my remarks to a few characters and scenes. SPOILERS AHEAD: The great scene in which the alcoholic prison doctor ( Art Smith) mocks the egotistical Captain Munsey ( Hume Cronyn), who is sitting in the warden's chair, pretending to compare him to Alexander the Great and other conquerors. Munsey becomes infuriated at the too close to home sarcasms of Doc, and knocks him down. Doc gets up with a smile and says, " That's what it comes down to, Munsey. Not cleverness, or shrewdness ,or cunning, just force...brute force. But remember this, Munsey: force does make leaders. But it also destroys them." The Hitler-like character of Munsey and his neo-fascist attitudes can hardly be coincidental, in a movie released just two years after the end of World War Two. In fact, critics have described the screenplay by Richard Brooks as being essentially like a classic prisoner of war escape movie, with the prisoners as the good guys, and the guards like the Japanese or Germans. This must have been fairly controversial at the time. The warden, brilliantly played as a weak, pathetic man by Roman Bohnen, is a career bureaucrat with nowhere else to go, bullied by his prison authority bosses on one hand, and the Machiavellian scheming of Munsey on the other. The prison system does not come off looking too good. The individual vignettes that show us the backgrounds of the main characters are nicely done, and there are some fine performances by strong character actors, including Howard Duff, John Hoyt, Charles Bickford, Sam Levene, and many more. And the women in the back stories! The incredibly beautiful and sexy Yvonne DeCarlo, the oddly charismatic Ella Raines, the sweet young innocent Ann Blyth ,are all a welcome relief from the macho harshness of all male prison life. This film is just so incredibly powerful that it stands the test of time well. A young Burt Lancaster is simply overwhelming as the rugged, determined leader of the convicts. His anger and unbreakable will are so raw and vital, they burn up the screen. You have never seen another old prison movie just like this. It has stock characters and situations, but the main characters and their stories are so vividly presented, that the story transcends prison movie clichés, to become a raw and deeply moving experience. The bleak ending, with world weary but compassionate old Doc gazing out a barred window at the dark, gloomy night ,and muttering a line that's close to pure existentialism ,is unforgettable. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.</fullReview>

But no other performance in the film holds a candle to Hume Cronyn's depiction of the sadistic Cpt. Muncie.

		<fullReview>Who doesn't like the old prison movie flicks from the golden years of the 40's and 50's? This be one of them. Add some really good actors, a decent story, the age old tale of men wanting their freedom and here you go. Note how the warden is all powerful and has a free hand to do most anything he wants and the cons know it. Today, the cons run the joint and everyone knows it too. But not in this movie and that is why we are entertained. We actually root for the inmates and see them as the good guys and the warden and his bunch as the bad. The emotions are triggered because we want to see justice served in the end and we get irony where you least expect it. As usual, rats are looked down on, some cons are more well known than others and there is a nice little set of flashbacks by a set of convicts on how they got into their mess and why. I thought the flash back scenes just the right length to take us away and then put us back into the movie theme timed perfectly. Good movie to eat while watching, have a snack and tasty drink.

The central plot was well thought out and made for a good story. However, the stories of how all the main prisoner-characters got there sometimes seemed unnecessary and felt like padding.Solid work by Burt Lancaster and Hume Cronyn in the lead roles.

There are no redeeming qualities about him.I haven't seen too many prison flicks where I rooted for the prisoners but this one you'll be on the edge of your seat hoping these guys get outta that place. Hume Cronyn plays a deputy prison warden and is just absolutely brutal to the prisoners. He does everything he can to make their lives miserable...in his sneaky little way. The warden is a fair guy but just cares about keeping his job and leaves everything up to his deputy warden. Big mistake.Burt Lancaster is one of a handful of prisoners who have had it and decide to hatch a plan to get out...at any cost. When you see it, you can't blame em. The ending of this film is just fantastic and ultra violent. Even for the year this was made.I can't recommend a prison flick higher than this one. It'll make you think twice about committing your first crime because if you do, you may get a guy like Hume Cronyn the rest of your life wakin' you up.</fullReview>

Very shockingly violent to me for being a movie made in the 40's which is part of what made it impressive. Not very often do I watch a movie and find myself staring with my mouth open not even realizing that my jaw had dropped. The acting was also very good. The actor who played Capt. Mumsey was the perfect villain and Burt Lancaster and his co-stars all portrayed their characters very well. Definitely one of the best films I'd seen in a while. Also probably the best prison break movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances and direction highlight this prison film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Brute Force" is a 1947 film directed by Jules Dassin with a wonderful cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Hume Cronyn, Charles Bickford, Whit Bissell, Richard Hoyt, Howard Duff, Jeff Corey, Ann Blyth, Yvonne Decarlo, and Ella Raines. Lancaster et al. are in a prison overseen by a humanitarian warden, but his enforcer (Muncey) is another story. He doesn't believe in anything but discipline and beatings. The worst thing that can happen to a prisoner is to be dispatched to work in the drainpipe with its filthy conditions and foul air. Lancaster and his buddies, however, think they can use their latest assignment to their advantage and break out.On the wall of their cell is an image of a beautiful woman, and to each man, she represents the woman he left behind - for Lancaster, it's the crippled Ann Blyth, for Bissell, the greedy Ella Raines, for Duff, an Italian woman (DeCarlo) he met during the war.Richard Brooks wrote an excellent, compelling script that makes us care about these men, even though they're criminals, and want them to succeed. One of the main reasons we want them to succeed is the incredible performance of Hume Cronyn. Cronyn underplays and makes Muncey the iron fist in the velvet glove. He speaks softly, almost caressingly. Be invited to his office, with the classical music playing, a large picture of himself, and artwork, and see what happens to you. Not pretty. An absolutely brilliant portrayal of a sadist by one of the greats.The hunky Lancaster gives a compelling performance as a desperate man who will do anything to escape.The ending will knock your socks off.Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but strong prison film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film about the (fictional) Westgate Penitentiary. It's overrun by a weak warden who lets sadistic Capt. Mumsy (Hume Cronyn!) beat and torture the prisoners. A bunch of them led by strong Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) plan a breakout--but is there an informer among them? In terms of violence and language this is dated--the violence is never shown or heard, there are no rape scenes and none of the prisoners ever swear. Still this is pretty strong stuff especially for 1947. The acting is good, the pace swift and Cronyn has got to be one of the most evil, cruel prison guards ever put on film. Also this film was the breakthrough film for Lancaster--it made him a star. The clichés are all in place here including the obligatory flashbacks showing why the guys are in prison (and also to get some beautiful women on screen) but they're done so well that you won't care. SPOILERS!!!! The two best sequences are when the alcoholic prison doctor (beautifully played by character actor Art Smith) tells off Mumsy and when Mumsy gets just what he deserves at the end (you'll cheer). Dated but tough and good prison drama. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brute Force is hard-hitting and ultimately quite tragic because the director, Jules Dassin, and his screenwriter Richard Brooks don't go for a simple, self-righteous "bad guys always lose" policy that movies had at the time thanks to the Legion of Decency and the Hayes Code. By the end of Brute Force, without giving a whole lot away, our 'heroes' in the prison cell R-17 don't get away scott-free, but there's a greater indictment called upon that makes the film ultimately a lot richer than it would be in other hands.The film examines a penitentiary that has a warden but is basically run by cold-blooded, tyrannical Munsey (Hume Cronyn, perfect for this weasel who is a true-blue torturer), and the convicts in cell R-17, including Burt Lancaster in an early role as Joe Collins, among a handful of men who have committed crimes but are portrayed in flashback as not being particularly ruthless or horrible in their acts or deeds. If anything, Dassin and Brooks set up a particular sympathy for the criminals that might have just skirted by the strict side of the Hayes Code (I wonder if the last words of the film, however crushing in existential tone, were forced on the filmmakers by the Hayes people) by making the situation not really black and white at all.On the contrary, Brute Force is an alive and harsh piece of film-noir with some searing scenes of melodrama because there's some gray territory (i.e. if it was black and white the Warden, too, would be ruthless and corrupt, but he just wants to run an orderly prison that his inmates will respect, unlike Munsey). Many scenes have that edge of a thriller, those surprise scenes that keep you talking after the picture ends like the guy getting crushed under the gears of the machine, or the torturing of the 'reporter', or even those somewhat predictable but heart-rending flashbacks that the prisoners have to their sweethearts on the other side (some, sadly, divorcing, others sick and need care). All the while the performances are top-notch, especially from Cronyn, Lancaster, Bickford and Levine as Louie Miller.Sometimes it's hard to pull off a really surprising prison-break-out flick, but Jules Dassin treats it with the same entertainment value, as well as general tragic pathos, that made films like Rififi so memorable. It's a tough "guy" flick that has a heart. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping prison film where the cast overcomes the flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BRUTE FORCE has everything a prison movie needs: a warden under pressure from politicians, a sadistic guard who's the power behind the throne, and a wonderful selection of prisoners led by a young Burt Lancaster.Burt's roommates (how did they all cram into that little cell?) include newbie Whit Bissell (who has a very emotional scene), first-timer Howard Duff (making the transition from radio), an intense John Hoyt, and lovable mug Jack Overman (whose all too short career included a fine small role in the noir FORCE OF EVIL). The convicts mean business; those who rat on others at guard Hume Cronyn's instigation find themselves getting intimate with dangerous machinery. Cronyn wants more crackdowns; the warden fears a total crackup. And of course, someone's planning an escape. The final scenes of this film were quite brutal for the time and still pack a punch.A strange script device is the use of a pin-up calendar in the cell as a catalyst for four convicts to relate the stories of their incarceration. These flashbacks help to provide background on some of the main characters (and provide for the appearance of some female faces), but become formulaic and slow down the main escape plot. Scriptwriter Richard Brooks also wrote the screenplay for Lancaster's ELMER GANTRY and became a celebrated director as well. All in all, an exciting film with a few digressions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster and Hume Cronyn are at the center of the story about a prison on the verge of exploding. The viewer gets beaten over the head by the by now standard argument: What are prisons for, rehabilitation or punishment? In this movie we find out they're really about revenge. After suffering under the cruel, sadistic reign of prison warden Hume Cronyn, a bloody revolt ensues. This may be Hume Cronyn's most memorable role. He's the perfect choice to play the character of the undersized warden with a length of hose to beat prisoners with as they're strapped to a chair in his office while classical music drowns out their screams.The photography and editing tie together the intensity leading into one of the best prison riots ever done and rescuing this prison soapboxer with a stunning, violent, and fitting conclusion. Cronyn has probably the most memorable part, strutting around like a little nazi, but Lancaster as the quiet, calm, and ruthless leader of a breakout is great.</fullReview>

The sadistic Captain Munsey (brilliantly played by Hume Cronyn)seems to know about it before its even started! Munsey, using psychological and physical torture gets the information through informers that he beats or destroys to the point of suicide. The pressure is on the prison warden to subdue the unrest amongst the prisoners or Munsey will get the Wardens job - exactly what Munsey wants. Will he succeed?

The scene where Hume Cronym is beating the prisoner with a rubber tube while some classical music is playing in the background, this is perfectly matched when Hannibal is beating the security with his own nightstick while the same classical music is playing in the background.A ten out of ten.

		<shortDescription>Hard Hitting Prison Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brute Force is just that...a swift late 1940's kick in the head. The characters are gritty, determined, and rough. Sure, all the prisoners are slightly stereotyped, but the performances carry the baggage of the typing and things end up working quite well. The story, involving an attempted breakout, is pure fantasy. What compels are the people and the messages of the film. Prison is shown to be a place where criminals are only made worse. Politicians, concerned only with order, are forcing the situation to get even more brutal. When faced with brutality, the men respond in kind.The head guard in the film is a great 1940's character. He is painted like Hitler throughout the film and is clearly meant to be seen as a homosexual. The film subtly hints that this will send him to hell at one point and that it is the source of his rage at others. The prisoners are all completely straight, but if they are ratted out, they respond with violence. In fact, ratting seems to be equivalent to consenting to sexual relations with the head guard. Only the prison's doctor is a friendly face. Sure, he is a drunk, but he cares about men in a way that society must not if they let prisons go on the way they are. The film has some parallels with the Shawshank Redemption, with the sadistic guard, setting, record player, and breakout plan, but its view of the world is the polar opposite. As the doctor says at the end, we never escape. The film reflects the hopelessness that followed WWII in light of the holocaust. It was a time when it seemed that men could be unimaginably cruel to each other everywhere, not just in the prison. In fact, the prison is our creation and one that just brutalizes us. An interesting message today, where most conservative politicians simply want to send everyone to jail.</fullReview>

It features an impressive cast of familiar faces, led by Lancaster in just his second film, but his is essentially a one-note performance. Cronyn makes an appropriately slimy villain. Women are featured in brief flashbacks, which add little to the film. The corniest flashback features an encounter between Lancaster and a crippled Blyth. The lovely De Carlo is wasted in a cameo role. The script by future director Brooks is not very interesting and Dassin tends towards the melodramatic.

		<fullReview>A terrific prison melodrama, brilliantly directed by Jules Dassin with a fine script by Richard Brooks and surprisingly violent for its time; it's got a mean streak of sadism running through it and a literally explosive finale. It is marred very slightly by a series of flashbacks to the outside world and the women the men inside have been involved with and these scenes don't add anything to the picture. But for most of the time Dassin keeps things at a high octane level and he's got a great cast.This was one of Burt Lancaster's better early performances. He makes Collins a wild, hungry animal. (Another reason the flashbacks don't work; the dichotomy between Collins in his scene with Ann Blyth and the cold-hearted killer inside is never explained). There is fine work, too, from Charles Bickford, Sam Levene, John Hoyt, Whit Bissell, Jeff Corey, (he's an insidious little stool-pigeon), and best of all, Hume Cronyn as the sadistic prison guard Munsey who likes to torture prisoners. At times Cronyn may appear too lean and small and insubstantial for the part but he is a perfect embodiment of evil. You get the impression he'd make a great Iago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's with all the breathless 10 ratings? Ridiculous! What's snowed everybody is the great performances, but they're all in the service of a cliché-ridden melodrama, with a downbeat, portentous ending, to make the audience nod their heads gravely.Here's the pitch (remember, it's 1947): Penitentiary as Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, complete with warden as weak commandant, chief guard as sadistic Gestapo officer, and brutal guards and, of course, an escape. They even play Wagner! The convicts are all good guys (except for the squealers), with tiresome flashbacks to tell us they were mostly done in by women. There's a single black con to pointlessly sing calypso. The parts are caricatures, but the acting is great -- with fine debuts by Howard Duff and Whit Bissell -- and there are some good lines.There are also pretty good production values. Mark Hellinger knew how to produce "raw, gritty" stuff (and he died far too soon), and Jules Dassin, who would do Hellinger's last movie, The Naked City, and later the seminal caper flick Rififi, was good at directing it. But the story is really nothing more than the "prisons make criminals" same-old same-old. "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" did it much earlier and far better.This movie didn't make Burt Lancaster a star. Like Brando would later, this electrifying new star made the movie a success. He and the other fine performers have obviously made the movie seem better than it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ugliness of brute force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Jules Dassin was placed on the Hollywood Blacklist in 1950 during the making of Night and the City, the director was on a roll. Along with Night and the City, which he filmed before being banned from the production studio, bringing his flourishing career to an immediate halt, Dassin also made The Naked City (1948) and Thieves' Highway (1949), now classics of the noir genre, and Brute Force, possibly the weakest of his noir quartet but a thrilling, insightful film nonetheless. Although set entirely inside prison walls - with a few flashback cutaways - Brute Force is pure pulp noir, featuring a towering lead performance from Burt Lancaster and a tour de force by Hume Conyn as the film's main antagonist.Joe Collins (Lancaster) has just done a stint in solitary. Being lead back to his cell by chief of security Captain Munsey (Conyn), Joe maintains his innocence and that the knife he was found with was planted on him. It turns out that Joe is indeed innocent of his alleged crime, and along with his friends from cell R17, knows who the culprit is. Their own brand of justice involves guiding the offender with flame-throwers onto a huge plate press while the guards are distracted by a brawl. With so much violence occurring inside the prison walls, Warden Barnes (Roman Bohnen) is put under pressure to control the inmates through strict discipline and the guards enforcing their authority. This catches the attention of the ambitious Munsey, and the likable Dr. Walter (Art Smith), who although constantly inebriated, can see the bubbling tensions and inevitable explosions of violence that are due to come.The film's title is suitably apt for the attitudes of the two opposing factions. Joe and his crew plan their escape by taking the prison with an arsenal of weapons at their disposal, while Munsey, using the warden's wavering support as an opportunity to rise through the ranks, starts to manipulate the prisoners into becoming informers and gleefully beating upon a prisoner when he refuses to talk. It's about the ugliness of brute force, and disastrous results that come from employing it. Munsey is a small man, but delights in imposing his authority on the weak and the restrained like a bullying victim getting revenge on the big boys who stole his lunch money. It's riveting throughout, but could have done without the flashback scenes, where it is revealed that the gang are all locked up as a result of some femme fatale or other. It builds to a ferocious climax, where the inmates fight the guards, ending on a note as suitably grim as it's portrayal of the durability of the prison system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jules Dassin is best remembered for his seminal heist movie Rififi, which he made in Europe following his Hollywood blacklisting. Before this, in the immediate postwar period, this American director made a series of high-quality noir films on the other side of the pond, one of which was this bold prison break drama from 1947.The plot focuses on Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) and the inmates of intimate cell R17. Sick of their ill treatment by the cruel Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyn), and conscious of the impotence of Chief Barnes (Roman Bohnen) as well as the hopelessness of decent-yet-drunk Doctor Walters (Art Smith), they plan to take matters into their own hands, overthrow the governance, and escape.The film earns its title. This is a brutal, bleak, and violent yarn by the standards of any era. But it was particularly shocking at the time ? not least, perhaps, because it sets aside the basic crime-doesn't-pay moral and asks the audience to sympathise wholly with the prisoners and hate the guards. This is achieved by portraying the prisoners as plucky underdogs. No trashy exploitation here, but something closer to the conscientious social outrage of Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront. Lancaster's performance doesn't approach Brando, but the style is similarly smouldering. Repressed rage; the power of the trodden man waiting to be unleashed.The theme of power is personified by Munsey. "Kindness is actually weakness," is his mantra. Hume Cronyn is gloriously slimy in the role. Munsey is the most complex character, embodying the dangerously contained ambitions of the middle manager. Meanwhile, Doc Walters reckons the prison system is inherently flawed; that men emerge more broken than when they arrived. Then there's Overlord Barnes, weary and anxious and without strategy, responding to mass unrest by threatening to withdraw privileges from all, suppressing the inmates' individuality from the distant comfort of his office. The prison is run by this dysfunctional trio. No wonder a breakout is imminent.The good guys are the chums of R17. Some are embellished in flashback. There's the tragic story of the man ? reminiscent of poor cuckolded George Peatty in Kubrick's The Killing ? who steals three grand to buy his materialistic wife a fur coat. Another wound up in the slammer after taking the rap when his wife shot her father dead to save their marriage. It's all melodramatic; all about trouble with women; all great black 'n' white storytelling with a few shades of grey. As for Joe, his gal needs an operation to fix her crippled legs, but she's not going for the operation until he's out. We get to see the sentimentality behind the main man's stony façade.So, R17 is populated by lovable rogues and victims of circumstance. The rawness of Dassin's picture ? its relative naturalism for the time ? ensures that the setup isn't hopelessly idealised, but it is certainly romanticized, which is something that's matched by the rich aesthetic. The film looks glorious. The external sets are plausibly looming and stark, recalling the Expressionist roots upon which noir was built. The drama is frequently shot from awkward angles, giving the sense of confined spaces and enhancing the releasing power of the flashbacks. It's memory that sets the men free.Finally, there is genuine tension and excitement in the final breakout sequence. Its violence is earned and its outcome is startling. It's a fittingly intense climax to a film that grips early and tight and doesn't let go. This is persuasive, fierce filmmaking.</fullReview>

If Brute Force is ever remade by Universal, the brutality would have to seem more real, and the threat to the men more real, so that their plans to escape seem more essential for their very freedom. What aids this story are the flashbacks. The viewer gets to see how and why the men got to prison in the first place. The background information helps to understand the predicaments more clearly. It helps to see the moments in which their love for women almost redeemed them. The story seems to indicate that if you're going to die, there needs to be that dream which a man must cling to, that salvation somewhere in his head, even if it's no longer attainable.</fullReview>

Not much hope displayed just revenge and the possibility of a near impossible escape.It is a metaphor for Nazi Germany and Russian Stalinism.

Add the fact that he speaks in soft feminine tones leaves little doubt.Prison reform had been a progressive movement for some time, and although some improvements had been made there were still concerns in 1947, and the Director's political leanings were in evident here. He would be a victim of the HUAC witch hunt and would be branded a Communist sympathizer and leave the Country. Ironic, because there is much here that is anti-authoritarianism and anti Stalinism as well. This is a very violent and tender film with a great cast and has only a few flaws. The singing inmate and the obligatory post ending (code required) wrap up. But this is such a powerful film filled with unforgettable scenes and images that sears the conscience with its riveting recitals and brutal but hopeless breakout.</fullReview>

Munsey finds out about the plans of the prison break and sets up guards to stop it, with Collins the prime target for a bullet or two. Munsey puts the fix in to delay Gallagher's parole; so the savvy prisoner decides to join Collins' escape attempt. A very violent finale with a good measure of brute force.

		<fullReview>Although somewhat dated, the movie offers an interesting and often compelling glimpse of the attitude toward prisons in the 1940s. Ity was tough being a prisoner. Not only were the inmates jammed into small cells, they had to deal with sadistic and ambitious guards who made life difficult for those inside, especially of you didn't play ball with the powers in charge. Of course, there were those prisoners who refused to play ball and for them there was only one option - escape. But how? With all the snitches working for the guards, how was a prisoner supposed to keep an escape secret? That is the question this movie poses. There are some who may read into this movie a political message, but remember, this is a Hollywood movie and first and foremost a commercial product. Hume Cronyn is great as a sinister and unscrupulous police captain. He carries the movie. The rest of the cast, including Burt Lancaster, ham it up as inmates who want to go from the inside to the outside. Charles Bickford is also excellent as one of the leaders of the inmates. An interesting feature of the movie is the repeated use of flashbacks explaining how the prisoners wound up in jail. Of course, in each case, a beautiful women was involved. Could Howard Duff be expected to let Yvonne De Carlo take the rap? Of course not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sixty Years Later-- Still Searing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a feverish undercurrent to this prison film that occasionally erupts into outright delirium ( the prison break, the interrogation scene). As delivered by blacklisted director Jules Dassin and screenwriter Richard Brooks, the film's anti-fascist message is put in your face, not in your lap. Still it's exciting stuff, except for the draggy domestic scenes that are meant to humanize the cons, but instead disrupt the film's relentless pace and super-charged atmosphere. Burt Lancaster gives a career performance, while Hume Cronyn is surprisingly effective as the sly Nazi-like warden. There are many familiar faces in the supporting cast, especially Art Smith as the humane but feckless doctor and Sir Lancelot as his calypso assistant.I suspect there's a provocative parable lurking somewhere in the subtext, something about the inability of liberals (the old warden and the doc) to contain the brute force it takes to keep people in prison. This is revealed at film's end when the camera dollys back to reveal the doc behind office bars and speaking toward the camera. Then we know the movie is about more than a bunch of desperate convicts trying to break through prison walls. Despite its many flaws, this stark melodrama keeps coming at you with the mesmerizing force of an uplifted hammer and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jules Dassin's hard-hearted dramatic thriller opens on a gloomy, rainy morning. Prisoners are crammed four to a small cell and watch out the window as Burt Lancaster's quiet, internally intense protagonist leaves solitary confinement, angry, and seriously contemplating escape. The warden is under strenuous pressure to enhance discipline. The doctor cautions that the prison is a powder keg and that there is not much rehabilitation happening.This intense drama casts Hume Cronyn cleverly out of character, his slick, soft delivery takes on the menace of a cold, calculating disciplinarian. Lancaster is fittingly brutal and single- minded, but that he's breaking out to be with his failing girlfriend seems too easy.The movie's limitations are the flashbacks depicting how his cellmates wound up sitting there with him. They are entertaining, yes, but they provide solace, which is exactly what a prison movie must avoid, especially a prison movie about an escape from a prison. Brute Force was not as memorable as Dassin's other films noir like Rififi or Night and the City because it was not claustrophobic, and it needed to be in order to be impactful. However, it does have a darkness and relentless depiction of violence and the ruthlessness of authoritarian abuse, and that edge induces its provocative degree of entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the forties when I was small boy. The only impression then was that it was quite terrifying. Now many years later I watched it again, this time after retiring from working in a prison for 33 years and found a lot of it quite realistic. Some of it was stupid of course, like the ending but overall I could relate to a lot of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Talky And Too Bleak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one bleak, prison movie that goes under the heading of "film noir." I love many, many film noirs but I didn't find this appealing enough to remain a "keeper" in my collection. It's too much talk, for one thing, and sadistic prison guards and a depressing setting don't do much for me, either.I have nothing but praise, however, for the photography and for the all the facial close-ups. The cast also is outstanding and deep with the likes of Burt Lancaster, Hume Cronyn, Yvonne DiCarlo, Charles Bickford, Ella Raines, Howard Duff, Jeff Corey and Walt Bisssell. Wow - that's a lot of "name" actors to us film noir fans.In between the jail scenes, we get flashbacks to various male-female relationships. In all, I was disappointed in this because I expected so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Prison Industrial Complex complexities...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BRUTE FORCE begins with some beautiful rain-drenched establishing shots of Westgate prison. We hear "Calypso" (Sir Lancelot, a face- and voice- familiar to fans of Val Lewton's films) singing a rhyming introduction (which is infused with the kind of irony we find in his songs in I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE); he attends to the needs of the sadistic captain of the guards, Munsey (Hume Cronyn). Warns the prison doctor: the prison is "one big human bomb," just waiting to be triggered. Collins (Burt Lancaster), fresh out of solitary confinement, turns out to be that trigger. Collins times a visit to the doctor to coincide with the murder of the stool pigeon whose testimony landed him in solitary (and thereby provides himself a foolproof alibi). Collins later snarls, to Gallagher, who runs the prison newspaper (who points out that the stoolie killing will bring down the authorities on everybody in the prison): "I don't care about everybody else." "That's cemetery talk," replies Gallagher. "There's no such thing as a short stretch," Lancaster states flatly. He's determined to get back to his wheelchair-bound girl as soon as he can (as she's taken a turn for the worse). BRUTE FORCE is a beautifully crafted, uncompromising movie with an unforgettable ending. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How movies should be made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic story is not original, and you always have a feeling that you know how things might go, but ...This is a movie that comes together the way that movies should.Excellent acting by an array of capable performers, great pacing that keeps you hooked but let's you breathe, back-stories are filled in so that you can relate to the prisoners as well as the warders.Burt Lancaster is young and full or fire. Hume Cronyn plays the 'little' captain well as a man with power beyond his capabilities. Given the year of making there may have been more than a dig at Nazi sympathizers. The black and white video makes the conditions all the more stark - as are their options.In an era where movies need to have lots of explosions, fantasy creatures or, pointless swearing to attract an audience it is good to see how a 'proper' movie can be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Metaphoric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title says it all in this nihilistic view of life with the prison as a metaphor for the whole world- one is reminded that in the words of the prison doctor Dr. Walters as played by the great character actor Art Smith : "Nobody escapes. Nobody ever really escapes".In many ways this escape can be measured against the personal recollections of men of happier days before they did what they did to bring them to this prison. The severity of conditions in the crowded cell of men is buffered by the anonymous picture of a woman's face on an old calendar that each man looks to reverentially as some goddess that allows him to remember his own lost love.One is reminded of Cool Hand Luke in his personal Hell that extends to the work camp he has been placed in- Westgate is a prison without any idyllic traits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noire Goes to Prison!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Brute Force" is an excellent prison film noire. The dark, grim setting and the hopelessness of the inmates makes for powerful drama.The story opens on a dark rainy night (what else for a noire?) as the body of an inmate is being taken away. Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) was the man's close friend and cell mate. With him is the brutal Captain of the guards, Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyn) and his assistant Jackson (Ray Teal). Collins is returned to his cell, which contains six, count 'em six, residents. They are Soldier (Howard Duff), Freshman (Jeff Corey), Spencer (John Hoyt), Lister (Whit Bissell) and Kid Coy (Jack Overman) who has replaced Morris' friend.Several of them have back stories involving women. Soldier has taken the rap for Gina (Yvonne DeCarlo) for the murder of her father; Lister is in for trying to provide his wife Cora (Ella Raines) with an expensive fur coat; Spencer has been taken for a ride by Flossie (Anita Colley) and Collins is in love with a cancer stricken girl, Ruth (Ann Blyth) whom he is trying to convince to have an operation through his lawyer because Ruth is unaware that Collins is in prison. Each of the ladies are in their own ways, femme fatales, a staple of film noire genre.Collins is tired of the brutality and conniving of Munsey and the guards. Warden Barnes (Roman Bohnen) is under the gun to stop the unrest within the prison. When Muncey tells Lister that his wife is going to divorce him, he commits suicide. This is the final straw for Collims and he plans an early escape. All of his cell mates agree to go. He also enlists the support of Gallagher (Charles Bickford), the editor of the prison newspaper and his reporter Louie Miller (Sam Levene).Muncey learns of the plan from an informer and tortures Miller to find out the details. Finally, all is ready and the men make their move and...................................................Director Jules Dassin gives us a hard look at life in an overcrowded prison. The escape sequence is very well done and the performances are excellent. Lancaster, just coming into his own, plays Collins with an air of hate and desperation. Cronyn, despite his slight stature, is excellent as the brutal Munsey. The rest of the male cast convey the desperation and hopelessness of prison life. The ladies only appear briefly but they add to the background of the story.Also in the cast is, Sir Lancelot as Calypso, the singing convict and in various roles, Charles McGraw, Vince Barnett, Jay C. Flippen, Edmund Cobb, Kenneth MacDonald, Francis McDonald, Gene Roth and Glenn Strange. Edmond O'Brien is supposed to be in there as a convict, but I missed him.An top flite prison drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***You would at first wonder why the men involved in the suicidal prison breakout in "Brute Force" were willing to risk their lives in this deadly and foolish venture with virtually no hope of surviving. Even if they made it outside the prison grounds where would they go without being hunted down and either killed or captured within hours after their escape. Yet when you see how their being treated by the vicious and sadistic captain of the guards Capt. Munsey, Hume Cronyn, you begin to realize, like the prisoners, that even death was more merciful that being alive and under his sadistic thumb. It was death, instead of freedom, that they wanted but not after giving Capt. Munsey everything that he had coming to him and giving it to Munsey in spades.Gut wrenching prison movie with Burt Lancaster as the leader of the gang of escaping convicts Joe Collins who after being framed by Munsey and put in the hole, solitary confinement, for it is now more determined then ever to break out of prison, even if it kills him. Together with a dozen or so other prisoners who are of the same opinion that he is; a quick death before a lifetime of torture. Collins getting his cell-mates involved in the breakout has to deal with not only Capt. Munsey and his prison guards but also a rat-fink in his group. Tortured by Munsey the squealer revealed the time 12:15 PM and place, the prison pipeline, when and where the escape would take place. Collins, keeping this information from his fellow escapees as well as the unknown squealer, decides to go at it anyway knowing that it would be certain death for him and those involved with him in the prison break. Collins has only one thing on his mind; to get his hands on Capt. Munsey before he gets blasted by the sharpshooters stationed on and along the prison walls.Munsey normally would have not had the power that he had at Westgate Penitentiary but because of a weak and ineffective prison administrator Warden A.J Bearns, Roman Bohner, he was in fact the man who ran the place and did it with sadistic glee. Munsey to physical torture the convicts in the way he brutalized and tortured the helpless Louis Miller, Sam Levene,in trying to find out about the impending jail-break, which Miller knew nothing about. Munsey also enjoyed to mentally the men, or prisoners,in the way he drove the meek and mosey Tim Lister, Whit Bissel, to hang himself when he falsely told him that his wife Cora, Ann Blyth, whom he ended up going to jail for, was divorcing him.Manipulating as well as brutalizing the men to do his bidding as well as for his own sadistic pleasures Capt. Munsey was even despised by his own staff the prison guards and the prison physician the kindly and sensitive Dr. Walters, Art Smith. Smith was driven to drink in order to forget what he saw in the prison infirmary of what Munsey did to the beaten down and helpless convict under his care. It turned out that the prison-break coincided with what would have been the pinnacle event in Capt. Monsey's career with poor old Warden Barnes being forced to put in his papers and retire and Munsey who wanted that job, as prison warder, more then life itself replacing him.Outraged and incensed at Capt.Munsey becoming warden and what to expect from him the men behind bars spontaneously revolted and caused Munsey to have his guards open fire on them only to give the badly wounded Joe Collins, who was shot by Munsey's guards during the confusion, just enough cover and time to stagger up to the guard tower, where Munsey was both directing the fire. A vengeful Collins put an end to Capt, now Warden, Munseys tenure as the Warden of Westgate Penitentiary which when it was all over lasted less then 15 minutes.Far ahead of its time in making a statement for prison reform "Brute Force" didn't make Joe Collins and his fellow convicts into good guys or heroic figures. Collins &amp; Co. were were bad and violent men who were made to pay for the crimes that they committed on the outside. Still at the same time they didn't deserve to be abused and brutalized by the likes of a Capt. Munsey who, from his actions, should have been put behind bars himself together with them. P.S In the end even prison, after Collins and the men got their hands on him, would have been an all expenses paid Caribbean cruise vacation compared to what Munsey got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hume Cronyn- fey and tightly-wound- plays Munsey, a sadistic wanna-be warden who gets off on torturing and abusing the inmates in his prison. Burt Lancaster plays Collins, an lionhearted inmate determined to break out. This forgettable little picture just kills time until the inevitable finale, when good and evil finally duke it out during a riot/escape sequence.A question: Why does Collins go ahead with his planned escape even after the prison doctor warns him that it's a setup? Unless you're a Lancaster freak you can afford to miss this prison drama with very little going on. A mess.GRADE: C-</fullReview>
