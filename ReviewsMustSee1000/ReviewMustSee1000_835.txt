		<fullReview>A musical comedy action fantasy should not work, especially when one considers that it is the first SNL skit-to-screen adventure (which, history has shown us, is a decidedly mixed bag). But this one does. Two of the best car chases in cinematic history bookend the film, and in between there are show-stopping musical numbers, raw humor, Illinois Nazis, and a seriously disgruntled ex-fiancee. And it all makes perfect sense in the context of the universe created by Aykroyd (who co-wrote), Landis (who directed), and Belushi (his barely contained zeal provides the battery pack for this film).Jake (Belushi) and Elwood (Aykroyd) are the former front men of a broken down blues band (actually a stunning collection of blues talent) which disbanded after Jake was arrested several years before. Upon his release, he discovers that his boyhood orphanage home is about to be foreclosed upon for non-payment of property taxes. Beaten up by a nun, sung to by James Brown, and touched by God, Jake sees the light and seeks to put the band together for one last show -- a charity benefit to save the orphanage.Their journey takes them from James Brown to Aretha Franklin to Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker to Cab Calloway. The movie showcases the overwhelming talent of singers, musicians, and genres long out of vogue with popular musical tastes. Indeed, this movie is a vehicle for giving these performers a chance to shine -- to bring their music back to the masses and ultimately into pop-culture immortality (to go along with their more prestigious musical immortality).This film is guaranteed to make you tap your feet, laugh out loud, gasp as both a mall and and entire fleet of Chicago police cars are destroyed, and believe in the magical powers of an old cop car. Like I said, it's a musical comedy action fantasy.And it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're On A Mission...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started out as a bit on Saturday Night Live, and grew into probably THE most successful movie ever to have had it's genesis in that particular medium. And who would've thought that a couple of character actor/comedians would emerge from an innovative four-or-five minute act as `legendary' bluesmen of their era? Which is exactly what John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd did after first taking their show on the road as an opening act for the likes of Steve Martin, and then parlaying it into a feature length motion picture, `The Blues Brothers,' directed by John Landis. When Joliet Jake Blues (Belushi) is released from prison, his brother Elwood (Aykroyd) is there to pick him up, in-- of all things-- a used police car. And it doesn't bode well for this particular pair of out-of-work musicians, who on a visit to the orphanage in which they grew up discover that it is about to be shut down unless some taxes are paid on it, and soon. But what can Jake and Elwood do to help? They're broke. Well, after a bit of pondering and a couple of good production numbers later, Jake sees the light (literally), and it all becomes perfectly clear: They have to put their band back together and stage a concert, the proceeds of which should more than pay for the taxes on the orphanage. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it, and don't tell Jake and Elwood it's not possible, because they're on a mission from God... It's a fairly simple plot, told in a straightforward manner by Landis, who creates a visually stimulating and aurally satisfying movie that follows the adventures of the Brothers Blues as they travel around the good state of Illinois, seeking out the members of their former band and formulating their plan to save the orphanage. Along the way they run afoul of a country/western band, incite the ire of some Illinois Nazis, ingratiate themselves to the diners in a classy restaurant, wreck an entire mall and generally wreak havoc wherever they go. It's a total rush of excitement, backed with a blur of real blues, served up by some of the truly legendary performers of our time, like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway (doing his trademark `Minnie the Moocher') and John Lee Hooker. Not to mention the `band' itself, comprised of Steve `The Colonel' Cropper, Donald `Duck' Dunn, Murphy Dunne, Willie Hall, Tom `Bones' Malone, Lou `Blue Lou' Marini, Matt `Guitar' Murphy and `Mr. Fabulous' himself, Alan Rubin, all there to back the incomparable vocal stylings of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, who are determined to save their old home, now under the auspices of `The Penguin,' Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman). But one question remains to be answered: Who is Camille Ztdetelik (Carrie Fisher), and just what is she trying to do to Jake? Without question, this was a great gig for Belushi and Aykroyd, who to millions of people ARE, and will forever be, the `Blues Brothers.' And forevermore shall they be linked in the memories of anyone who has seen this movie, heard their records or caught their act on SNL. Dan Aykroyd has gone on to have a successful and varied career in movies, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (for `Driving Miss Daisy' in 1989), while John Belushi, of course, left us quite suddenly and way too soon, just as his career was on the rise. Were they great singers? Of course not; but they were accomplished performers who sagely surrounded themselves with the best of the best, a `band's' band that really made this gig work, because the music worked. Add to that the energy, excitement and passion they themselves brought to it, and you have their formula for success, which can be measured by the strong following they still enjoy to this day. And what a pity that Belushi isn't around to realize it. Memorable in supporting roles are John Candy as Burton Mercer (who uttered the unforgettable line, `Orange whip? Orange whip?--); Henry Gibson as the steel-eyed head Nazi; Steve Lawrence, as agent Maury Sline; Charles Napier as Tucker McElroy, `Lead singer and driver of the Winnebago'; and Jeff Morris, who will always be remembered as Bob, owner of `Bob's Country Bunker,' the place with `both' kinds of music, Country `and' Western.  The additional supporting cast includes Steven Williams (Trooper Mount), Armand Cerami (Trooper Daniel), Layne Britton (The `Cheese Whiz'), Ralph Foody (Police Dispatcher) and John Landis (Trooper La Fong). Also, watch for cameos by Paul Reubens (Waiter), Frank Oz (Corrections Officer), Twiggy Lawson (Chic Lady) and Steven Spielberg as the County Clerk. A thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable movie, filled with memorable scenes and lines you'll be quoting for years to come (Aykroyd, in that `clipped' Elwood Blues delivery, to Tucker McElroy: `We'll, ah-- we'll talk to Bob--'), `The Blues Brothers' is a great film-- not in the sense of a film that should have walked away with a bagful of Oscars, but great for what it is and for the special place it holds in the history of the cinema. And, yes, it does have a place all it's own. Because a movie doesn't have to be `Citizen Kane,' or `Gone With the Wind' to be `great.' It's the ones that make you feel something for whatever reason, or make you laugh; the ones you remember because they're unique or have left their imprint on our culture in some way. So, check `All of the above,' or add your own reasons. For all that it's worth, this is the magic of the movies. I rate this one 9/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin? I WISHED the adults in my life took me to see it when it first came out! But alas, it would be years later when I'd first see it, on TV, and on VHS, then many more times on TV. READ the list of cast from start to end! You will be amazed who was in this movie! Including Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia in Star Wars), and even Steven Spielberg acted in this movie too!Everyone should be required to see this movie, as kids, teens, and adults! Every age group will enjoy this movie. NICE family movie too! The kids and adults will 100% enjoy watching it. It is sooo sad that many of those music legends are forgotten, are not taught about in any school, and remain unknown! I never knew who Ray Charles was until I finally saw this movie! Possibly the first ever movie in which the soundtrack sold as well as the movie. There is even a tribute to Elvis at the very end. The re-watch factor is NICE - one never ever gets tired of re-watching this movie over and over! Which is unheard of with present day movies.</fullReview>

So, tell me, why do some musicals have crappy music?Anyway, i turned to 'The Blues Brothers' and first time in my life my musical ears have been cleaned. How can such a music genre be so... excellent. Blues music is influential, and so is this film. Since watching this movie, i have found myself engrossed to the world of Blues music. How can a movie be anymore influential?This movie is not for the faint hearted, because it will grab you and shake you up real good.10/10Dr. Pineapple</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't you miss comedies like this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is definitely in my book one of the best comedies of all time. I couldn't believe my eyes that this film is not on the top 250, well, John Landis doesn't get enough credit in all. He brought us the most memorable comedies of all time: An American Werewolf in London, Trading Places, Animal House, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. He brings us The Blues Brothers, two popular characters off of Saturday Night Live who were at the height of their popularity. John puts them in Chicago(this is the best Chicago movie to watch next to Ferris Bueller by the way)and makes this into one of the greatest comedies ever. The great thing about this film is it's not gross out, it's not the obvious silly humor, it's just humor that keeps you laughing every minute. Dan and John are such a great comedic duo, they are without a doubt the most memorable duo off of SNL I would say.Jake and Elwood go to the orphanage where they were raised and learn that it is being shut down due to insufficient funds, so they want to reunite their band and put on a show to help save the place. On a mission from God they claim, they gather up their old band members to put on the show of the decade! But along the way, Jake and Elwood get into quite a bit of trouble with the police, the Illinois Nazi party, a girlfriend of one of their band members, and a girl who just seems to keep going after them and wants them dead.With great and endless cameos from great people like Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles, terrific Chicago landmarks, endless hilarious jokes, The Blues Brothers is the perfect comedy that is one of the best movies of all time. The concert scene is unforgettable and the scene that will always get me down on the floor in tears is where they go to the restaurant, John's line of "How much for your women?!" was just too priceless! You really have to see this movie, I guarantee you, you will die of laughter.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Eccentric Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This definitive cult classic combines two of the pioneers of Saturday Night Live in a hilarious comedy, indulging into their characters from the show. John Belushi and Dan Akroyd are Jake and Elwood Blues, two eccentric brothers who are "On A Mission From God". They seem to inevitably find themselves in large amounts of trouble. The most fun is living vicariously through them as they stick it to the police and other authority figures and evade the consequences. Blues fans will rave over the fantastic soundtrack full of classic blues tunes from the biggest stars. This film is one that will have you quoting lines, singing along, and quite possibly dancing like Elwood. By the way, sunglasses can be worn at all times, black never goes out of style, and dry white toast is quite possibly the world's perfect food.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great all round movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie, rich with comedy and music. It's about 2 corrupt brothers, who wish to help a nun. The story starts with Jake (John Belushi) being released from prison, where Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) picks him up. The story proceeds with them trying to honestly earn 5,000 dollars. They start by getting a little "churching up" and then try to put "the band" back together. With them continuing, and playing shows for meager amounts of money, finally get a break, and make a huge gig in a fancy hotel! While avoiding hundreds (literally) of cops, and "They can't catch us--we're on a mission from God". While making friends (and enemies) along the way, providing a side-busting movie! A must have for all good DVD collections!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild "musical comedy" offers long-lasting fun and excitement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an impressive following this large movie is recently having! It would've been just another cult classic to begin with! THE BLUES BROTHERS is easily the best film collaboration with Dan ("Dry White Toast") Aykroyd, and John ("4 Fried Chickens &amp; A Coke") Belushi. While it gets too overly far-fetched with the action plot, there is reason to sit back and chow down on the comical hilarity and nonsense thrills that only John Landis can master perfectly into a comedy.This is such a big deal after all because it offers a walloping combination of soul tunes, car chases, special effects, and crazy characters like female assassin Carrie Fisher and Nazi leader Henry Gibson. Put everything else together and you have one of the wildest experiences ever. If you want to know why it's so wild, the supporting cast of dancers, prison inmates, and law enforcers really shows that the movie itself is very hard at work! The music was supposed to be the main attraction in the first place, with real-life singers James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, and Cab Calloway. They add to the theme of this "bluesy" movie with their own style of performing familiar tunes. The real stars are Aykroyd and Belushi who can be both funny and talented on and off the stage. Probably the duo's all-time best performance is the singing numbers. But after the singing, we await the sudden amazement of car crashes and smashes that make up the excitement, with the largest impact ever since the 1974 cult classic GONE IN 60 SECONDS. It certainly has "Made In Chicago" stamped all over this picture! There are tons of entertaining moments that never go blind. Just sit back and watch it all go boom!Aykroyd and Belushi would have fared well in GHOSTBUSTERS had there been more movies produced, but this remains to be THE comedy classic for the wild SNL pair. DVD owners must not miss this one as it makes a valuable addition to your library. It's not really the masterpiece of a genius, but it is a good-natured effort in using different film genres in one complete package. Definitely recommended for Landis lovers out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone found the fountain of youth and doused this baby in it, 'cause it sure ain't getting old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't tell you how many times I've watched this. I can say truthfully that me and my father have sat down and seen it together for over ten years. And I can assure you, it never seems less enjoyable. Every scene(honestly, find me a single one that should be taken out, and I will be utterly baffled) is great, and holds something to look forward to, most even something to reference and quote. The acting of the band members, and possibly some of the musicians(though, for my money, they do pretty darn good jobs), aren't necessarily the best actors, but it's seldom that obvious or annoying, and, come on, what kind of performance are you looking for in them in this, a role to take on, or some fantastic music? This is a movie that should be viewed by anyone who loves one or more of the following: Blues, car chases(this held the record in the number of vehicles crashed in a film, until, I believe, it's less impressive sequel), Aykroyd, Belushi, Landis and their work and comedy, all three shine. Heck, no matter what, this is likely to entertain you, thoroughly, continually and masterfully. The pacing is amazing, off the charts action and speed, yet it never, for a second, overwhelms or leaves you exhausted from it, and this has the rather important "buffer" portions, where you can relax. The script and plot are excellent. The songs are well-chosen, well-done and set up well. Brown, Charles and Franklin are incredible in this, with very different pieces. The cinematography and editing are spot-on. There is a little language, and it does get harsh. There is no real eye candy, this doesn't stoop to that for more than possibly a few seconds. The Collectors' Edition DVD holds 18 minutes of new footage, of varying quality, but I'd say it's worth attention of those who already dig the film. It also has a theatrical trailer, cast and crew listings, production notes and a making of. I recommend this to anyone, especially those who are either already familiar with(and into) the kind of tunes it's packed with, or those not, who are open to them. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greates Epic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the greatest epic comedy ever. It the only one of it's kind to my knowledge. The best part is the final chase sequence that combines all the elements of the film and gives many laughs. When Steven Spielberg shows up as the accountant at the end I was put out out in the floor in a fit of laughter. Beside Austin Poweres In Goldmember this is his only comedic role. Other cameos in the film gave equal laughter. Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Carrie Fisher, Cab Calloway, John Candy, Bill Murray all provide memorable roles in the film. John Belushi is at the top of his game in the role of Jake Blues. He takes his talent earned from SNL, 1941, and Animal House and takes it the next level. Dan Akyroyd does no less as Elwood Blues the other half of the Blues Brother. His one liner "We can't be stopped, Were on a mission from God." Will live forever to future generations. John Landis makes this film his masterwork and has never again reached this scale of greatness. That is not to say I don't like other things he's done since it just means I feel that he will never top the intensity of this. See this before you die. You must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest, funkiest, coolest film on the planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it must be an age thing, but at 40 myself and my peers often find ourselves quoting Jake and Elwood. 'Would you like to come out for like, er, a date'; 'I hate Illinois Nazis'; '..get a new cigarette lighter'.In isolation these quotes don't make any sense, but in situ they are classic lines by the masters that are Belushi and Ackroyd. This is a film paying homage to some of the best music ever made, that steals classic comic performances from Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles and if I am not mistaken beats Michael Jackson to the punch by a mile with a massive group dance using the 'chicken' (the zombie dance in the Thriller video is a direct copy of the dance routine in the street while BB King is performing on the sidewalk, wearing incredible shoes).This is a film that every house should own. Not only is it extremely funny due to script, timing from the Bro's and quite frankly the total sex that is John Belushi, it is also heaving with classic tunes. I have often had/been to parties where it is played in the background rather than putting the record/tape/CD player on (parties through the ages).As an education in how to put music and comic genius together to make a film that is timeless this is it.Let me give you an example. I spent three years in South Africa as an expat from 1993 - 1996 and, of course, had this film on video (age again) as part of my collection.SA is a sociable place and often new found friends from office, pub etc. would collect at my house for a meal (almost always a Braai). "What's this?" one such person says one evening as I am tossing food on the barbecue, "I've never heard of the Blues Brothers". "Put it on" I say, with quizzical looks from other guests that the TV should be switched on while we are out in the garden. "and turn the volume up".Rest history. 20 Captownians turned on to music they were never allowed to hear, gravitating indoors to see where it is coming from and then screaming with laughter while they danced in front of the TV.This film, in my experience has changed lives.Buy it, watch it, tell your children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that, in my opinion, has it all. A star studded line up that can actually act and not just attract celebrity-hunters, incredible chase scenes, witty one-liners that do not border on the verge of malignance and some of the best songs ever written.After watching this film over 30 times, it honestly never fails to disappoint.John Belushi and Dan Akroyd work so well together, and really act as if they are their characters, as opposed to actors paid to be them. And car chase scenes that would make Minis salivate, and an array of side plots that work so seamlessly with the "Mision from God".The on-screen chemistry between the band is frictionated and therefore completely accurate for anyone who has been in a group, but when the music starts, always a guaranteed classic throughout the film, then the magic of the film really happens.A film that borders genius and then creates a whole new country, and one that may be re-attempted, but never rivalled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wild ride! This film was full of music, action scenes, dancing, comedy and Left Wing loony politics, of course. For a comedy, I was sorry to hear all the profanity and usage of the Lord's name in vain. Too bad they had to make and R-rated film of this. A little toned down and more people could have enjoyed all the antics of Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi and the others. Speaking of names: what a strange cast. The above two with John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson and singers James Brown, Steve Lawrence, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin! It's a lot of fun to watch with some memorable scenes. Most memorable to me was the incredible car chase scene through an indoor mall. I laugh every time I think about it, almost as much as I laugh when I pictured Aykroyd and Belushi doing back flips down the aisle!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A critique of the criticisms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to go into why the movie is great, that's already been done a thousand times here.Just for yucks, I actually sat and read EVERY review here (about 260), and mostly they were good reviews. But some of them are just from planet Mars.People complaining about the music are just flaunting their own ignorance. No matter what else one might say about the movie, the music is terrific and anyone who says otherwise is just *wrong*. I'm on my second CD of the soundtrack because I wore out the first one. And it's not like I'm a particularly big blues fan, either, this is one of about three blues albums in my collection.People complaining about the comedy, well, I suppose comedy is a matter of taste. But I think the movie is hilarious. Nobody even mentioned one of my favorite gags: the last shot of Twiggy. :)But what I *really* want to respond to is a couple ridiculous claims that peoples' love of this film is in-genuine, that it's either a result of sheepish devotion to what they've been told is good, or else pure nostalgia for Belushi. That, my friends, is a first class CROCK. First of all, you'll never find *anyone* who's less go-along-with-what-the-crowd-says than me, and to be told that that's why I like the film, is so insulting, I could spit. And as far as Belushi nostalgia, also utter nonsense. If that were true, I'd love all the other Belushi films too, and in fact the only other one I really like is Animal House. Indeed, I consider Neighbors to be among the worst films I've ever seen.But for those who appreciate the Blues Brothers, I'll close with a tiny personal anecdote: Today I received a package in the mail, from some friends from Boston, who I used to be in a band with, and who I left behind when I moved to Washington. I don't really see or hear from them anymore, although I try to hook up with them on the rare occasions I get back to Boston. So I was surprised and delighted when I received this package. The contents: a can of cheeze whiz. :) :) :)</fullReview>

So they try to get the band back together.My review: This movie is very long and very slow, but the slowness actually helps it for some reason. The direction is excellent and looks beautiful and the music is very good. The plot could have done with some tuning up, but if you think about it, this film is kind of a setup to show the wonderful singing talents of Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway and even Belushi and Aykroyd. As for action, this film is full of it. There's more explosions and car chase scenes that most action flicks. So, I do recommend this musical comedy to all! my rating: 3 out of 4. rated R for language. 133 mins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Blues Brothers" is a good comedy and a great musical, featuring James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and Cab Calloway as "guest" musicians (i.e., not members of the BB). The BB band is composed of excellent musicians such as Lou Marini, Alan Rubin and Donald "Duck" Dunn among others. One interesting aspect of the movie I haven't read about in other reviews (so far) concerns spoofs of other movies and TV shows. For instance, when Jake gets out of prison he walks through a blinding white light and out the gate, reminiscent of the kidnapped earthlings disembarking from the giant UFO near the end of "Close Encounters." The interview with the "Penguin" (walking up a long flight of stairs, and the Penguin floating back into the room) is a spoof on "The Exorcist." Jake and Elwod's interview with the landlady is a spoof on the old TV show "Dragnet." The car chase under the El spoofs "The French Connection" car chase and even uses several seconds of footage from the movie. The scene in which a police dispatcher authorizes "the use of excessive force to apprehend the Blue Brothers" spoofs the old TV show "Highway Patrol" and I believe the movie dispatcher was in the TV show as well. I'm not quite sure how the Nazis chasing our heroes is a spoof of "Apocalypse Now" but the music (Wagner's "Flight of the Valkyries") in this sequence was used in both films. I susect there are more spoofs of other movies and/or TV shows present that I'm missing; if anyone out there can name more I'd like to know about them as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 30 years this movie has not lost a single step.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Ebert called The Blues Brothers "The sherman tank of musicals". I couldn't agree more! This movie has the perfect combination of Music, action, and comedy, that propels it along at a perfect pitch. The story is fun and engrossing the direction is spot on, kudos to Mr. Landis, and the cast couldn't be better. John Belushi and Dan Aykrod play the sunglass wearing soul brethren duo with a minimalistic approach that really adds to their performances. The real genius of the casting in this movie has to go to the supporting cameos. The producers were smart enough to get the legends of soul, like Areatha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, and most notably the very underrated soul pioneer himself Cab Calloway. There contribution really enhanced the entire tenor of the film. The musical numbers in this movie are just downright infectious. Even if you have never been a fan of old soul music you wont be able to not tap your feet or sing along with the movie. I personally believe that the best musical number was when Cab Calloway did "Minie the Moocher". Having him dressed up in that white tux and the stage all lit up, transported us back to the hey-day of soul music. As for the Blues Brothers themselves, I can understand how they had sold out concerts back when this movie came out. They really had something, musically, there. The action in this movie was very surprising. Remember that this was decades before the invention of CGI. They must have trashed of 100 cars and countless buildings during the making of this film. But, man did it ever pay off. Remember the scene where the cop cars all end up crashing and piling up on one another. It was executed so fearlessly and boldly that you almost felt like it was like watching a perfectly executed dance or gymnastic maneuver. All in all if you have not scene this movie...you should! I never get tired of watching it and highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth getting the DVD for restored footage and documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is only about the content of the DVD version vs. the VHS. Editors seem unable to resist tinkering when a movie originally on VHS is reissued on DVD. Even excluding Directors' Cuts, etc., half the DVD reissues I see have noticeable changes. Many are minor, but much too often they're substantial and ruin the movie for me.The Blues Brothers DVD has substantial edits, but they make the movie better. Cuts made to shorten total run time -- four or five complete scenes, many small snippets, and some longer snippets -- are restored. Nothing was cut from the VHS version. The soundtrack is remixed in a few places; to my ear the original was better. Some restorations add little to the movie, but none make it worse. Most of the restorations enhance the movie, adding humor or rounding out the story. Best of all are the restorations, small but noticeable and pleasing, to performances: more James Brown, John Lee Hooker, Good Ole Boys, and the Brothers. Alas, no more of Aretha, Ray, or Cab. We can't have everything.To top it off, the "Making Of" documentary alone, with the back story of the Blues Brothers (the characters and in real life), and the birth and making of the movie, makes the DVD worth getting</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, a great parody of Western Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the Blues Brothers recently I was struck by so many great touches that make the film not only a film of its time, but a film that has great relevance even now.From the very outset, the grimyness of late 70s Industrial Chicago, and it's seedy underbelly become almost a character in their own right.Jake and Elwood Blues live out their lives either in half-way houses, or prison, both have only a small room for their meagre possessions.The fact however that despite being broke and owing all of their friends money, they still have plenty of goodwill bestowed on them by their loyal musical colleagues.The plot is that an old orphanage previously funded by the church, the church now wish to demolish, Jake and Elwood need to find $5000 to prevent the local authority granting easy planning permission to do so.Pulling in more than a few favours from their friends with help from God himself, the Blues Brothers turn in one final grand performance as free men before being hounded down by The Police, The Army, The Military Police, a group of Nazis who believe Hitler is immortal and The Good Ol' Boys as well as Bob, the owner of a bar that plays both Country and Western.The parody of course is that the Army and almost the entire state of Illinois' Police force have been called to capture two guys for breaking some john-q laws whereas a banker loses $1 billion and nary a word from either the police or the media is aimed at him, and certainly time in the cells.Summing up, an unbelievable film, with an almost unheard of quality of supporting cast including most likely the biggest female star of the time in Carrie Fisher who is literally dumped by Jake as well as Soul Music Legends James Brown, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker and Ray Charles to name a few and leave out many more greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got the 25th Anniversary Version. It has the director's cut which adds several scenes not in the movie edition. I had never seen them before. First the question is answered why Jake was in prison and for how long. Some of the songs are extended as my favorite, "Sweet Home Chicago." You will also see Elwood without his glasses, a scene which needed to go for that reason if no other. You will see where Elwood puts the Bluesmobile at night The only question I have about the movie is, "why were the Good Old Boys and Bob so mad when The Blues Brothers filled in for them when they were late to the gig?All I am saying is, if you love this movie like I do, YOU GOT TO GET THE 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time recently after having no desire whatsoever to see it, but after the T.V remote broke and my T.V being a whopping 3 meters away i had no choice but to sweat it out and watch it.I have to say i was pleasantly surprised, starting with the opening dialog of monosyllables between Jake (the wonderful Belushi) and Elwood (a surprisingly young and slightly sexy Dan Akroyd)to Jake getting hit with a stick by a nun because he swears and then it turning into a beating for both Jake and Elwood because each time the nun hits them they yell 'jesus' or 'christ', to Carrie fisher randomly turning up and pointing a rocket launcher out of her car window. I couldn't stop giggling.However there were parts in the movie where i tended to lose focus, where it seemed to get a bit over the top - like when ray Charles is playing piano in the music store and 50 people start synchronized dancing outside the store. or the too long car chase in the mall, don't get me wrong, i love me a good mall car chase - just not one that seems to last 25 minutes. and i wasn't a big fan of the Aretha Franklin music number in the diner - at the time of watching i had no idea what Aretha looked like and as i was watching i couldn't help but note that the women singing was doing a bad lip syncing impersonation of Aretha - only to find out - it was Aretha franklin.but for those small pitfalls - the acting and gags couldn't be better - i couldn't imaging anyone else as Jake or Elwood and there are too many good scenes to name but here are a few, in the restaurant scene (one of my favorites where Jake offers to buy the little girl ' how much for the little girl, i want to buy the little girl' classic), when the blues brothers are singing rawhide, the Nazis in the car ' I've always loved you', the end scenes where it seems all of Chicago are after Jake and Elwood and they just stand in the elevator calm as you please.All in all you know its a good movie when you continually remember little bits here and there and they make you laugh - which this movie does. i know that from now on all costume parties i attend will be as one of the blues brothers.Its also a movie that will make you wonder, i know it made me wonder... 'was that really Steven Spielberg at the end or was i just imagining it?' Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blues Brothers (1980)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dan Aykroyd is now a UFO kook and John Belushi overdosed and left behind a crappy brother, but they did do one thing very, very right: they made The Blues Brothers. Although there have been occasional (usually lame) attempts in the past 30 years, this is really the last great entry in the genre of musical comedy... and probably the only one to engage in such enthusiastic, rampant destruction. It's true that many of the jokes have lost their punch after some 15-20 viewings, and the movie is proof that just because you're a great musician doesn't mean you can act. But it's such a gleeful, exuberant, infectious film. My heart leaps with joy when I watch it, particularly during the musical performances. Never mind that it taps into 30 year-old nostalgia for me, it's just wickedly fun from the opening stings of "She Caught the Katy" to the fading notes of "Jailhouse Rock." They don't make them like this anymore.</fullReview>

But alas, it would be years later when I'd first see it, on TV, and on VHS, then many more times on TV. READ the list of cast from start to end! You will be amazed who was in this movie! Including Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia in Star Wars), and even Steven Spielberg acted in this movie too! Everyone should be required to see this movie, as kids, teens, and adults! Every age group will enjoy this movie. NICE family movie too! The kids and adults will 100% enjoy watching it. It is Soto sad that many of those music legends are forgotten, are not taught about in any school, and remain unknown! I never knew who Ray Charles was until I finally saw this movie! Possibly the first ever movie in which the soundtrack sold as well as the movie. There is even a tribute to Elvis at the very end. The re-watch factor is NICE - one never ever gets tired of re-watching this movie over and over! Which is unheard of with present day movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not surprised this movie is not on IMDb's Top 250 and I can't really argue with people who think it's no great shakes. It's their loss. For me, it's one of the most fun movies ever made.I don't know what make movies great, but I think if I enjoy my 2 hours, it makes the cut. The Blues Brothers has a great 'repeat value', in the sense that it gets more fun to watch every single time. The soundtrack is great, the little cameos will keep you interested throughout and the shots of Chicago will make you want to be there.But above all, it is the whole attitude of the movie that makes it so special. Fans of the movie know what I'm talking about. And for those of you who haven't seen it, I'm not giving away anything. You either get this attitude or you don't. But do watch it, you might just be lucky enough to pick it up and become a fan. Elwood asking a random girl to meet him 'if her date don't work out' and her actually showing up is exactly the attitude I'm referring to.It's a longish movie and I've seen it a few hundred times. But still, on any given day, I am likely to fast forward to the bit when Jake and Elwood enter the arena for their final performance through the ladies' washroom and watch the movie down to a very exciting, exaggerated and thoroughly uplifting ending. I think IMDb's top 10 is roughly accurate, I wouldn't debate. But none of those, and I do adore each one, is a movie that make me want to 'be' the main character. This movie does. I'd give up whatever I have going to be Jake or Elwood, any given day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musical with a Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not very often that a musical also contains what would be a pre-recquisite for an action packed Bruckheimer epic. Full credit to Director/Writer John Landis on this piece of work (possibly the best he has ever done) as he has not only inter-weaved a good storyline into a gutsy blues/rock musical, but he has also added intense drama and action into what is one of the funniest films of its time.Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison. He is greeted outside the prison gates by his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Ackroyd) In an effort to stay on the right side of the lord, Elwood holds Jake to a promise that he made to the Catholic Nun that brought them up many years ago when they were living in the Catholic Parish as adopted children. When visiting the nun the boys realise the church parish will be shut down unless they are able to pay taxes worth $5000. This is their Mission from God, a quote which has been made famous by the 2.My favourite character in this film was that of Jakes Mysterious Woman Friend (Carrie Fisher) This was a dark part, which was never really explained until right at the very end when we see that Jake may have a soft side... more to the point he is just trying to escape from her, as well as the Nazi's and Police that will provide both Jake and Elwood with sum what of a headache making it to the county assessors office in time to pay the money and rescue the church.I personally was really impressed with the Art department in this film.... Every set was perfectly decorated. Possibly Harry Larrecq 's best work too (Also did Art Direction for The Munsters-1964, Manhunter-1972 and The Thing-1982) One aspect that can't be beaten is the soundtrack. Possibly one of the most instantly recognised themes of all times- The Peter Gunn Theme. When fortunate enough to work with a cast and crew of songwriters such as Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, Elmer Bernstein, Ray Charles and James Brown- with Stephen M Katz as Choreographer, there is absolutely no surprise that the music and dance in this film is nothing short of exceptional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Their Mission is Our Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies just kind of have a lingering,"living" effect on the people who watch it. It's a fairly rare breed of movie,to be sure,but they're out there. I submit this film as one.Perpetually shade-wearing bad boys Jake and Elwood Blues(John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd) reunite upon Jake's parole on an undisclosed(?)rap. Barely able to figure if they can adjust life on the outside,they become informed that their old CAtholic orphanage is about to be foreclosed. Around this point in time,God gives them their mission:get the Blues Band back together and tour,raising money to stave off the impending shut-down of their childhood home. The ensuing odyssey has the boys traveling about Illinois and the region,seeking out old band-mates,foiling Illinois Nazis,duping a redneck bar and its patrons and avoiding a homicidal woman(Carrie Fisher),and that's all WHILE they're finding ways to run afoul of the law. Again. There's no simple way to describe just why this show is so special. I mean is it the music,featuring performances(acting as well as music)such luminaries as JAmes Brown,Aretha Franklin,Cab Calloway and Ray Charles? Or is it the action,with no fewer than two car chase scenes for good measure? How about the dry,button-down chemistry of Belushi and Aykroyd(in full "Shee-KAH-go" accents,no less!)adding weight to the spare,well-chosen screenplay? Is it the ace Blues Band,themselves no slouches at music? Or is it a combination of any to those? Maybe everything? There are no wrong answers here,though my choice would be all of the above,since the fusion of about two or three different movies in one. Director and co-writer(with Aykroyd)John Landis has a great eye for broad comedy born out of ordinary,even boring,slow-paced situations.It seems like its somewhat of a chore of finding this on DVD(or even on tape),which is a shame. I mention how films are keepers;this one is the definitive of the term! In the meantime,I(and anyone else who enjoyed this show) guess I'll just have to content myself with seeing this in reruns on various fine cable networks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A diamond between the comedy films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For me it will be a toast and for my partner here, 4 fried chickens and a Coke""The Blues Brothers": A really basic film for anyone who likes comedy films. It's like the Bible in the Catholic religion, like "Don Quijote" in a Literature class, like Darwin's "Natural Selection" in a Biology class. What I mean is, that "Blues Brothers" is the referent film in the most recent comedy films. This film marked the end of the old-style comedies that were already too used.If right now, you're thinking that I'm exaggerating, that means you've never seen the film. It mixes all the possible elements that can be used in the perfect comedies: 1.- Good jokes: not too silly, but simple enough to not thinking much about their meaning. 2.- Very good actors and remarkable invited stars: Two words: John Belushi. He's the film. I'm not underrating Dan Aykroyd, but without John, this film would have been a disaster. And of course let's include the very famous invited stars: Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, James Brown, Carri Fisher, etc. 3.- The songs: This element isn't necessary in all comedy films, but it helps. Unforgettable songs like "Everybody Needs Somebody", "Jailhouse Rock" or "The Rowhide Theme" make this film unique.So let's resume this article with 5 words: "This is THE comedy film".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a well known fact that around half of the classic movies faired poorly at the box office. The Blues Brothers belongs in that half, though thanks mainly to home video and re-releases in cinema, The Blues Brothers finished up being the sixth highest grossing musical of all time and a huge cult classic. The number of devotees and "average Joes" who spend their days quoting The Blues Brothers from front to back to back to front is, for a lack of a better word, scary- but that's another movie! Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi are perfect as brothers Elwood and Jake who for the majority of the film are on the run from too many police officers to count. Despite the spectacularly over the top, but nevertheless entertaining car chases, rock and rolling music numbers and supporting roles from such prominent musicians as Ray Charles (who in a slide-splitting moment hangs a poster upside down) and James Brown and Chicago scenery, the real stars of the film are Aykroyd and Belushi of Saturday Night Live fame. It's a shame though that Belushi died soon after and the sequel turned out to be a mediocre effort. Nevertheless, the Blues Brothers continues to attract new audiences.Many factors can be attributed to its success, including the now classic black suits and sunglasses look, as well as the music, though being a Musical/Comedy, it was and always will be humour that ensures its freshness for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixture of action, comedy, and romance, all in this famous Chicago-related flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This famous of all Chicago-related movies was better than "Code of Silence" and even better than the recent "The Lake House".The movie seems to be in two big parts. There is the famous duo, John Belushi and of course Dan, who play Joliet Jake Blues and Elwood Blues. Of course, the scene starts at the infamous Joliet Correctional Center where Jake is going to be out on parole for an armed robbery conviction, with Elwood in an old police car to pick him up from prison walls. Their mission (where the famous "Mission from God" phrase occurs over 5 times in the flick)---to get the Penguin (which is actually Katherine Freeman, who owned the St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud Orphanage in Calumet City, Illinois), called that because she was dressed in white and black like a penguin (she is actually a nun) to pay a property tax bill of $5000. When the Penguin refuses to pay that money (because she considered the brothers as sinners who were not able to repent) and kicks both of them out of her room and out of the building, the only way they can accomplish the mission of raising funds for paying the tax bill is "to put the band back together"---The Blues Brothers Band, of course.Carrie Fisher, who plays the "Mystery Lady" or "Mystery Assassin" (the latter is better), had other plans. She had a death wish on the famous two-man duo.She had a variety of weapons for the assassination of the Blues Brothers, which the two men dodge bullets, explosions, and fire by this hard-headed lady. The first assassination attempt used a rocket launcher at the transient hotel's entrance where the two men were; the next was detonation by dynamite of a transient hotel, thwarting even the police dynamic entry to the room where the two singing men slept. The next attempt was using a flame thrower at a propane tank near the telephone booth where the two man were talking in. The tank blows, causing the booth to go up and then tumble down, but the two men survive all that. Then, getting out of the Palace Hotel Ballroom in a water logged tunnel, the lady uses a semi-automatic weapon but the two men's verbal pleadings saved them from murder.</fullReview>

And because of this they both decide to get there old blues band back together to raise the money, and so intern they go on a wild goose chase across Chicargo with meeting such famous blues performers as James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker and Cab Calloway. And on the way the mystery woman (Carrie Fisher) tries to kill Jake countless times and they also get slowed down in there mission by Det Burton Mercer (John Candy) who's constantly after the Blues Brothers.This film is a must buy DVD and it will make your sides spilt in that much laughter while your dancing around the hose to some great blues soundtracks.But don't worry "There on a mission from God!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers has been my favorite movie for over 20 years, ever since I first saw it at a drive in theater. The music (yes it is blues, just not delta blues), the comedy, the cameos, the car chases and the story are all superb. It is just too bad it didn't do as well at the box office as it should have. Belushi and Aykroyd are comic geniuses and their chemistry on screen is bar none. Some of the musicians, while not comedians, have some great scenes as well (Ray Charles, Aretha, etc). It was also quite exciting to see some of the gold of blues such as Johnny Lee play a role. The book gives a little more history into the "brothers" and the band but the movie did a good job. I believe this movie has some of the greatest "movie lines" of any made and the settings and locales fit well. There are however a few bits, such as the exploding hostel and propane tank that are too far fetched but with the rest being so enjoyable I forgave them. Do yourself a favor if you have not seen this one and rent it, you will likely buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to not like this movie from the days before political correctness, self-conscious movie making. It is innocent and pure about its story. There is no pretense. The actors are the characters (The Blues Brother Band) and the characters (Jake and Elwood Blues) are the actors (John Belushi and Dan Akyrod).The jokes are still funny, and Belushi shines in this story. The Blues Brothers were created as a SNL skit, and then developed into this movie. I am guessing that if it wasn't for the untimely death of John Belushi (1982), this would have rocketed his career into super-stardom.The singing is Belushi's and Aykroyd's. On their hit album Belushi suggested that you go out and buy every blues record you hear. That's kind of impossible - but maybe it tells us something of Belushi, his love of the blues, and perhaps ... his heart. It's funny how you never get over missing someone - even a distant star like Belushi (and Radner) ... b/c their star keeps on shining.-LD_____________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/</fullReview>

When they perform in the film it is classic stuff. You can watch this film over and over again just to listen to the music. To listen to James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and the Blues Brothers. The songs are all brilliant. And the ending that must have been one almighty wage demand. It must have cost a lot of money to destroy all the glass, cars and just everything. Then add that to the cameos from huge stars and the actual cast in full. But one of if not the best bit is the car chase. All those cars piling up the chase in the mall, through Chicago and all the cars getting destroyed. Falling from a great height and creating a huge hole in the road, crashing into trucks, flying into lakes it has everything. Humour, action, fabulous music, what more do you need in a movie. At two and a half hours might test the patience of some people but it was totally worth it. One of my favourites, one for the ages. Great writing by Dan Aykroyd and John Landis and great directing by Landis. And another great way to remember Cab Calloway, Ray Charles but mainly John Belushi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rented the extended version, and was reminded of what a landmark, memorable film this really is. Sure, some of the car crash stuff is a bit over the top, but this film really is a rare documentary of some of the great blues and R&amp;B artists of the later part of the 20th century.One part in the extended version I particularly enjoyed was an expanded scene with the late, great John Lee Hooker on a semi-fictionalized version of Maxwell street, which has since been rehabbed and is now upscale housing, just south of Chicago's University of Illinois Circle campus. (If you look closely, you can see a sign for Esquire J-Town Clothing for Men and Boys..."J-Town" being a slightly more politically correct way of saying "Jew Town", a nickname for Maxwell street from way back). Anyway, John Lee is doing his thing accompanied by several members of Muddy Waters' blues band, plus the very colorful Big Walter Horton on harp. Before entering Aretha Franklin's diner, Jake and Elwood are just taking in the scene, and I gotta believe that John and Dan (the alter egos) were really enjoying themselves at that moment.As a musical comedy, I don't think anything came close during that time. While some critics were not happy with what they considered gratuitous exploitation of R&amp;B giants like James Brown and Ray Charles, I for one am happy that someone like John Landis captured something as "cool" as Cab Calloway performing "Minnie the Moocher" with the very accomplished Blues Brothers band.If you can't have fun with this movie, you just ain't much fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those sneaky film makers. Here's a movie starring John Belushi, of Bluto fame in Animal House, and Dan Aykroyd as two bums who lead a blues revue band who try to outrun the police and is the cause of many car wrecks, and it's a musical!!! Men aren't supposed to like musicals, yet here is one that any man, and women, especially those who have any positive feel for rhythm and blues music, will enjoy this film. It's funny, involves things blowing up, men in tacky Western outfits, and features many outstanding performances by great R&amp;B singers. Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Cab Calloway all lend their great musical talents to this otherwise fun movie about two guys who dress alike who want to raise money for their former orphanage. To do so, they reunite with their former blues band, one they left to serve time in jail. After a rocky first outing at a country bar, one with chicken wire to protect the band, they are able to get one more gig at a hotel outside of Chicago. Everything is all set, that is except their car runs out of gas. It's little moments like that where the movie succeeds, where it is funniest, and where the considerable talents of Belushi and Aykroyd come through and shine. Carrie Fischer plays a crazed ex-wife of one of the Blues Brothers, i suppose in a break from her Princess Leia past, and look for Frank Oz and Steven Spielberg in small, yet noticeable roles. Music, cars crashing, and humor carry this musical into the "success" category.</fullReview>

From the brilliant over the top humour to the neat way Divine Intervention destroys the Illinois Highway Patrol without hurting anyone, to the Fantastic music, this has to be my favourite movie of all time. I first saw this on a Friday night after a hard week at school, and it just made all the worries disappear with its wonderful, easy humour. Favourite part? When they're in the office building, and the SWAT truck pulls up, the blokes pour out the back going "hut-hut-hut-hut", and then we see one bloke by himself abseiling, quietly going "hut-----hut-----hut" to himself. Simple, yet bloody funny. Great entertainment. Not a date movie, who wants to miss a second with kissing and all that other unimportant crap??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated and ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always felt this movie was extremely overrated by fans of SNL at the time. By the time the movie came out, people were so in love with the whole Blues Brothers phenomenon on SNL, that it really wouldn't take too much of a quality movie to capitalize upon that. The script, which included some of the most idiotic chase scenes in cinema history, seems like it was written in a single night of chemical indulgence. By the time you get to the end of the movie, you get the feeling that John Landis knew the movie wasn't really working - so he decided to just make the scale of the chase scene completely ridiculous in order to try and make someone laugh at something.The music numbers are what saves the movie from being a complete failure. They're so good that they will make you forget about just how stupid the rest of the movie actually is. Side note : I think it's worth noting that John Landis is completely overrated in himself. Sure, he directed "Animal House", and "American Werewolf In London". But, his failures FAR outweigh his successes. Just to name some of his other flops : "Spies Like Us", "Three Amigos", "Oscar", "Beverly Hills Cop 3", and of course "Blues Brothers 2000". I've always felt that "Trading Places" could probably have been a better movie with a different director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not easy to evaluate this movie, as it is full of nice surprises but failed to meet what I expect from a movie.I will start with the good things: 1. Music: excellent numbers and songs. 2. Excellent acting from the blues duo. 3. Brilliant cameos (John lee hooker presence was an unexpected nice surprise).The negatives: 1. Most important thing: the story is not good at all. 2. It is not entertaining, no suspense and only few scenes are funny. 3. The chases are long and ridiculous.I give it a 6/10 because of the music and acting performances. But a movie is expected to be based on good story and this one simply is not !!! I definitely recommend its soundtrack or to watch its musical numbers but skipping the scenes in between.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally saw "The Blues Brothers" because I got tired of people saying that no true film buff, let alone a film buff who lives in Chicago, can be taken seriously without having done so. I'd seen bits and pieces on T.V. and knew what kind of movie it was -- also that I didn't like what I had seen and wasn't very excited about sitting down and watching the whole thing. My reservations were well founded."The Blues Brothers" is a set of skits loosely strung together to resemble a plot. There are a lot of car chases and crashes, lots of things being destroyed, and lots of musical numbers. It could have been fun, but it's full of dead air and long stretches where nothing much of anything, not even something funny, is going on. You'd think if anyone could make a skit movie funny it would be two actors who cut their teeth on SNL, but that's not the case. No doubt its popularity relies heavily on its anti-authority theme, since that seems to be something people, or maybe it's just American viewers, seem to instinctively respond to. Cops are buffoons, petty criminals are cool. I don't have any objections to this if I think the actors playing the petty criminals are cool, but I personally don't much like either Aykroyd or Belushi.The highlights of the film are the cameos by famous singers like Ray Charles, James Brown and Aretha Franklin, though I've almost never seen anyone do a worse job of lip-synching (to her own song, no less!!) as Aretha Franklin.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies are always subjective. What is funny to some people may be offensive to others. I have always found slapstick comedies to be pointless films that literally don't require any brain power to get through. But take what I say with a grain of salt because I am usually harsh on these movies. With that being said i'm from Chicago and I adore the music in the movie so you would think I love this movie, you're wrong.There are only certain movies that can truly pull off this type of tone. Having ridiculous over-the-top action sequences is fine once in awhile, but when you have them in 50% of your movie and have the scenes go on for 10-15 minutes at a time, you have a problem. To me the film just got stupid after awhile. There wasn't a single laugh out loud moment, just a few chuckles. People have always told me that Aykroyd and Belushi were the greatest comedic duo ever on screen. While they had great chemistry, nothing they said together really made me laugh.I wanted to love this film. In fact it goes against my blood to dislike this film. I live in the Chicago suburbs and grew up listening to these songs play on the streets of Chicago so it pains me to say this film is ridiculously not funny. It was cool seeing celebrity cameos and hearing the songs being played but in all, it was a huge letdown.+Cameos +Music -I didn't really laugh -Unnecessarily long runtime-Over-the-top action sequences -Scenes would drag on for far too long5.0/10</fullReview>

The relentless vision of the main characters to round up and reform the band in order to try and save their orphanage from closure is superbly portrayed. Also I am astounded that so many great actors and talented musicians were brought together to be part of this film, it's like a time warp of blues/soul history which captures so much of life at that time,especially the market blues festival scene with John Lee Hooker singing in the street.

		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is one of my all time favourite movies. I've grown up watching this movie, and I still can't get enough. Every time it's on TV, I have to watch it, even though I can pretty much quote the movie the whole way through whilst watching it. Filled with humour, action, music and more, this movie will stay in your heart forever. The musical showcase, like many other reviewers have said, is just amazing, and will have you singing and dancing along. No wonder this is one of the best selling soundtracks as well. I'll admit to having it on my iPod. You just cant watch the Blue Brothers without remembering all the classic jokes and one- liners, and the songs that come along too. Some of these are standard quotes in my house, when a particular moment will arise. I mean, that's probably enough said - quoting Blues Brothers in your own home? Definitely a movie that's been watched many many times! From the start when the Peter Gunn theme comes on, til the end when Jailhouse Rock is being performed, you'll be all things on the edge of your seat, singing, dancing, laughing and begging for more. After all, The Blues Brothers are on "A mission from God".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about the Blues Brothers? Well, it's definitely a weird movie but I'll be darned if I said that I didn't enjoy it. I practically loved how over-the-top the film was and how it managed to be so graceful and enjoyable. I liked the improbable car chases and I especially loved the musical numbers sung by nearly everyone in the film.John Landis, known for his excellent Animal House, directs a tale about the Blues Brothers. Joliet Jake has just been released from prison and he and his brother, Elwood decides to visit their old orphanage where they grew up. They found out that the place will close if they cannot raise five thousand dollars, so the bros decide to bring back the band together while being chased by cops, Nazis, and country singers.This film is led by the impeccable charms and chemistry of Dan Aykroyd and the late John Belushi. Both were incredibly funny, but none more so than Belushi himself. Then there was Carrie Fisher who is some mystery woman that existed to terminate Joliet Jake. Then there were soulful cameos by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, and James Brown.Overall, The Blues Brothers is an excellent, over-the-top cult classic. I really loved how at the end of the chase, there were just so many people after the Blues Brothers. I was laughing nonstop and I couldn't help but enjoy the action. The musical numbers were a blast as well. As it has been told, this movie is, "on a mission from God." I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

(There are a lot of police in this film!) and on the way, they try to make money with their music to help keep The Church open. There is a lot of great music in this film, there is even a singing of Robert Johnson's "Sweet Home Chicago!" The film ends with The Blues Brothers entertaining the prisoners with their hit Rock'N Roll dance song "Let's Rock!" and The End Credits involves a reprise of their best songs!

		<fullReview>Granted, this has been a criminal oversight on my list of viewed movies but at long last, I can tick it off. Astonishingly, it also appears to have been worth the wait. I'm not a musicals kinda guy at all but this film and its soundtrack are absolute belters, fuelled by not just an electric lead duo but by shameless cameos from some genuine legends and a love and warmth for the production that shines through. No wonder sunglasses are essential! Jake Blues (John Belushi) is picked up by his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) as he's released from prison. Returning to the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they discover that they need to settle a $5000 tax bill within a few weeks and the boys ill-gotten gains are not wanted. But after visiting their local priest (James Brown), Jake has an idea - get the old band back together and put on a show, donating the proceeds to the orphanage. But getting the band together isn't as easy as they suppose especially as they are pursued in their battered Bluesmobile by the state police, a bunch of disgruntled Nazis, some redneck musicians and a mysterious woman (Carrie Fisher) with some serious firepower...Plotwise, "The Blues Brothers" is pretty threadbare as you'd expect from an idea generated for "Saturday Night Live". But what it lacks in cohesion, it makes up for in abundance with energy and enthusiasm. The music is just wonderful, with performances from the likes of John Lee Hooker (who all-too-briefly appears) to Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles alongside the likes of Brown, Cab Calloway and of course, the Blues Brothers themselves who perform with po-faced gusto and glee. The other notable aspect of the film is the numerous and extremely well-staged car chases which, despite having a whiff of "Smokey And The Bandit" about them, are brilliantly shot and thoroughly entertaining - if a little far-fetched. There is a surreal element to the movie in general, none more so than the moment when Fisher reduces Elwood's flat to a pile of bricks and rubble whilst he's sleeping only for him to wake up and declare that it's time to go to work, oblivious.It's not the smartest movie ever made but almost everyone will enjoy it. I can't mark it down because the car chases are ridiculous or the plot makes little sense or the fact that the Bluesmobile does things no car could possibly do. It's simply a wonderfully entertaining musical smash through the very best music America had produced up to that point. It's fun in a way few movies seem to be these days and even a weak sequel doesn't ruin what is probably the musical I've enjoyed more than any other I can think of. It's a movie that I not ashamed to admit to liking and that, quite frankly, is as much praise as any musical is gonna get from me!</fullReview>

Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi lead us from one ridiculous situation to another as they proceed on their mission from God. James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, and the Blues Brothers Band fill your ears with some of the greatest rhythm and blues hits of the 50's and 60's, complete with choreography and dance that is sure to please. The stunts are amazing, the acting excellent, and the plot is cohesive and well thought out, as ridiculous as it is. This is a classic film for the entire family, even though there is some profanity, a few off color jokes, and a lot of overt violence that is all played for laughs. Probably more for the 13 and older set, but frankly, a fun film that is too ridiculous to miss. A definite collector's item as one of the top live action comedies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do I really need to put my two cents in on one of the all-time "classics"? Hasn't this been talked about to death already? I was coerced into seeing this movie I never, ever wanted to see from a friend that said I wasn't a movie-lover (I am) if I've never seen this. And when I plugged in the movie and saw it was 2? hours, for a movie I'm not that invested in, I began questioning our friendship. For the first hour or so, I chuckled a little, though it did keep my interest. Then, BAM, it seemed to take off and I got giggly for the rest of the extremely fun and funny ride. One thing that shocked me was: how much faith they had in a five-(or less)-minute sketch on SNL. They must've had this huge budget ? blowing up buildings, destroying malls ? and the length was far too long. But?at the same time, that was the biggest problem: it was far too long and it took far too long to get going. That said, it was thoroughly worth the journey of the men in black once it did build steam ? especially from the comic genius John Belushi (check out the fantastic nonchalantly they handle the out-of-left-field situations they find themselves in) and the "guest appearances," my favorite of which was, believe it, Carrie Fisher. The funniest segment, that made me pause it since I was laughing so hard, was the soaring cars in the climax. 4/5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's 106 miles to Chicago. We've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses." - Elwood. "Hit it." - Jake.Director John Landis can make a great movie out of the most simplistic premises. After working with the late John Belushi on National Lampoon's Animal House in 1978, he returns to give us the funny, satirical, wickedly hilarious Blues Brothers. At first glance, the blend of music and comedy may throw many off, but if you're willing to go back to a time when movies were movies, The Blues Brothers is quite a throwback.The film's greatest accomplishment stems from its unlimited energy and desire to have fun. Jake and Elwood (played by Dan Akroyd and John Belushi) are one of the most enigmatic duos who ever made it on the big screen, and provide inseparable chemistry especially when at the mic. Even when they aren't at the mic, they are either doing some of the funniest fight sequences or claiming to yet another strange they're on a mission from God.A formal storyline is almost nonexistent. It's best to just go along for the ride. After getting out of the big house for an armed robbery, "Joliet" Jake is forced by his brother Elwood to go see a nun at their old home. They both learn that the orphanage will be closed if they do not pay their dues; $5,000 in property taxes. Ultimately, Jake gets the genius idea to reform their old rhythm and blues band. From there on out spawns a sea of insanity and a never-ending line of one liners.The Blues Brothers is lengthy and about twenty minutes could've been set on the scrap floor. But the execution is near perfect. There are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them.Fun not only stems from the enigmatic protagonists, but the extremely well acted music numbers. The theme from Rawhide, the classic ladies-hit "Think," and even that hometown classic of "Sweet Home Chicago" are all played ecstatically throughout the film. They surely won't get out of your head anytime soon after hearing them.The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see.By the way, how do you knock a film that has two lead characters on a mission from God? Starring: Dan Akroyd and John Belushi. Directed by: John Landis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie merits classic status because it showcases five giants of American popular music -- Cab Calloway, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin. But by 1980, America's musical taste had been so pasteurized by disco and country (Bee Gees vs. Kenny Rogers) that these blues and R&amp;B legends might have been relegated to a PBS documentary if it weren't for the admirable efforts of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi to present their brilliance to a wider audience. To do that, however, they had to stitch together a knockabout comedy with a threadbare plot and loads of car chases which stops every 15 minutes or so for an awesome musical number. If that makes "The Blues Brothers" sound like an extended, excessive, extremely expensive episode of late-70s "Saturday Night Live," well, surprise, surprise, that's exactly what it is. But between the sketchy schtick and the fantastic musical guests, "The Blues Brothers" is as loaded with entertainment value as a stuffed Chicago pizza is with calories, and both are equally satisfying.The plot, so to speak, centers on "Joliet" Jake (John Belushi) &amp; Elwood Blues' (Dan Aykroyd) attempts to raise $5,000 for back taxes on the orphanage where they were raised. (Warning: the orphanage is run by the Catholic church. If you stop to wonder why a religious institution has to pay property taxes, you're really not going to get into the spirit of this thing.) They reassemble their old band, which fell apart after Jake went to prison, and embark on a lunatic journey across the greater Chicago area, destroying malls, alienating law enforcement and enraging Nazis along the way. You're distracted from the improbable storyline by director John Landis' gift for piling overkill on top of overkill, which in this movie even includes firebombs, machine gun fire and other pyrotechnics, most of it launched by a mysteriously enraged Carrie Fisher, who sleepwalks through this cameo like she's prescription-drugged into near catatonia (which she probably was). The comedy is broad but funny, and the Blues Brothers' numbers featuring Aykroyd and Belushi are surprisingly gritty considering the routine was always more about attitude that authenticity. But what elevates "The Blues Brothers" above the level of a well-made dumb comedy is its guest stars.Big kudos to scriptwriters Aykroyd &amp; Landis for naming Jake &amp; Elwood's backing ensemble the "Blues Brothers Rhythm &amp; Blues Band," a subtle acknowledgment that the Jake &amp; Elwood characters always parodied more R&amp;B (or, in the case of their "Gimme Some Lovin'" cover, phony R&amp;B) than actual blues. They pay an even greater homage to bona fide electric Chicago blues with a scene featuring John Lee Hooker, performing his classic "Boom Boom," that has absolutely no connection to the rest of the movie (but is, nonetheless, excellent). As for the rest of the musical guests, none of them are famous for blues -- Cab Calloway was a jazz singer, and Ray Charles invented the kind of gritty soul which James Brown and Aretha Franklin perfected. But if you're the kind of purist who lets these kind of distinctions ruin your fun, you should probably skip this movie and go hang out at Buddy Guy's Legends. The rest of us can enjoy Calloway as the Blues Brothers' mentor, Brown as a charismatic preacher, Charles as a blind, gun-toting music store owner and Franklin as a soul food restaurateur. As actors, Cab and Aretha do pretty well, Ray is commendable and the filmmakers were wise enough not to give JB any dialogue (his control-freak tendencies might have prompted him to rewrite the entire movie). But that's all just a bonus, since their musical numbers are the great highlights of "The Blues Brothers," beautifully sung and enlivened by choreography that manages to look both polished and spontaneous. Aretha's version of "Think" is especially moving, since she's trying to convince her no-good husband, Matt "Guitar" Murphy, to stay on the straight and narrow and not take off with the Blues Brothers on their ridiculous adventure. She looks good, moves well and sounds just fine, even if she doesn't quite reach the high notes she hits in the recorded version. (But I'm going to assume that was her choice -- watch the credits and listen to what Aretha does with her throwaway line in the "Jailhouse Rock" number. Damn.) ReRe was in a career slump at the time and "The Blues Brothers" primed her for a return to superstardom. Nice work, Aykroyd &amp; Belush.By the way . . . skip "Blues Brothers 2000." It's pretty lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the classic SNL skit of the awesome duo John Belushi and Dan Akroyd they finally get there shot on the big screen! After getting out of Jail Jake reunites the band to save their hometown!But they have lots of people who want them dead. The cops, Some crazy bitch who tries to kill them at every turn, and even Nazis! That's right Nazis!What really was the highlight was not the Epic chase scene at the end or the car falling from the sky no it was the catchy, energetic and fast paced music and dance scenes! Hell, even I felt like dancing a bit &lt;3Not to mention you got cameos by Aeretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, and Carrie Fishers gad freakin' zooks!That all said this is one hell of an enjoyable movie from start to finish I definitely recommend you watch this with your friends.PERFECT 10/10Oh and by the way I could have SWORN I saw these guys in Earthbound. I think they were called the runaway 5 and I tell ya the blues bros. were Definitely in there.Heck I think they had a brief appearance in Smash Bros. Melee's intro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So funny and amazing music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in high school, and thought it was the funniest film I had seen. I would watch it over and over on my own and with mates, and just be in absolute fits of laughter. And now, many years out of high school, I can still put this movie on and find myself rolling in laughter still. It is just one of those movies that never ceases to be funny. Its just awesome.But no matter how funny this movie is, it is still the music that does it. Putting legends like Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway, and John Lee Hooker in one movie is just amazing. Add to that the musicians in the Blues Brothers Band, and the under-rated voice of Belushi, and its just a complete new level for this movie.Pretty much, if you have any liking of movies that make you laugh and/or amazing music, this is a movie you must see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Fulfilled Misson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 13 years old when I first saw 'The Blues Brothers', and ever since that chilly December day in 2002, I've been hooked.This clever, madcap comedy stars the late John Belushi as Jake Blues and Dan Aykroyd as Elwood, two men who provide the vocals and harmonica for their powerhouse blues band, the Blues Brothers. After getting out of prison for armed robbery, Jake reunites with his brother Elwood and they head back to whence they were brought up, an orphanage that is about to have its doors closed unless the money needed to save it can be scrounged up. Henceforth, the 'Mission from God' was born.There is no shortage of greatness in this movie. That includes cameos, the script, the music itself and the acting. Add in a few outrageous car chases, some bitterly ticked-off Nazis and more cameos by Blues greats than you can count, and you'll really have your tail feathers shaking'. Belushi and Aykroyd can certainly carry a tune in a basket and there is no doubt that they are talented, and you have to give them credit: they delivered a fire-powered performance that I think could've been Grammy-worthy (but that's just me personally). Every number they cover is a toe-tapping, hum-worthy tune, and the albums they've put out (Made in America and Briefcase Full of Blues) are just as catchy and soulful as the movie soundtrack itself.The individual personalities of Jake and Elwood are a pleasure to follow along with throughout the film, and each band member offers at least one great, laugh-worthy line that you can't help but quote every now and again. The smart appearances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Cab Calloway also generate a lovely feeling of bluesy nostalgia and a reminiscence of the good ole days when music was actually high-quality. While it is really a shame that Belushi (who happens to be my favorite comedian) passed away two years after this film was released, there is no doubt that his memory will be fondly upheld in what is unarguably his best work.The most famous of all the quotes is the classic 'We're On A Mission From God'. Trust me, whatever the mission our suit-laden heroes were in, it was definitely fulfilled.My grade: A+, 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blues Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being released from prison, Joliet(John Belushi) rejoins his brother, Elwood(Dan Aykroyd) and while they are attending a Holiest Church "sees the light" and decides that they must "get the band back together" in order to raise 5 thousand bucks to keep an orphanage up and running. Things get complicated which could thwart their plans to raise the needed cash, but The Blues Brothers will find away because "they're on a mission for God." One thing's for certain, a LOT of property and vehicles will be damaged/destroyed along the way, particularly in the climax as Joliet and Elwood must outrun the law enforcement, an angered country music band on tour in their Winnebago, and a group of disgruntled Illinois Nazis! Yep, Chicago and the outskirts of the city will lend itself to quite a few "vehicle skirmishes" as the Blues leave much destruction in their wake, with no mall, street corner, or highway safe. Director John Landis proves here he can sure develop impressive musical set pieces and has some talented performers(..like James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles just to name a few)to work with. You could say that The Blues Brothers was a precursor of sorts to Landis' masterpiece, Michael Jackson's Thriller.But, the movie seems to live and breathe on the Blues Brothers evading those out to get them with cars of all kinds driving through buildings and windows, as if you were watching some sort of implausible live-action loony toons cartoon with adults instead of artistically rendered animals. I've never seen so many police cars stockpiling on top of each other. Between this and Smokey and the Bandit, I can just imagine the millions spent on vehicles purchased just for wildly orchestrated stunts where they are used primarily as bumper cars. And, the inclusion of the foxy Carrie Fisher as a vengeful young woman out to kill Joliet for reasons we discover towards the end, including one dynamic sequence where she detonates Elwood's minuscule apartment with walls and ceiling caving in yet the Blues escape unscathed! And, how could one not forget the attempts of The Blues Brother Band to win over a raucous bar full of hicks gathered to hear country music(..the only song they can come up with to appease the crowd is Rawhide!). Under the suit, tie, hats, and dark shades, Belushi and Aykroid, are understated as can possibly be considering the hi-jinx that result from their choices, and it's because of this clash between their behavior and the madness around them that really makes the movie work. The Pinto scene where Henry Gibson and one of his Nazi followers fall from a high distance in the sky is a riot(..particularly the landing!)as is the sequence where the Blues finally arrive at the bank in the hopes of paying for the orphanage, regarding the fate of their long-suffering car. Marvelous musical number for Cab Calloway as he and the band members await for the Blues arrival from numerous hardships that kept them from getting to the theater on time for the concert. I definitely recommend, that is if you are like the one person who hasn't seen this as of yet, preparing to suspend disbelief because this movie is beyond the realm of realism. There are so many gags, you, I reckon, will always find something new when you watch The Blues Brothers.</fullReview>

Superb music , great comedy and fabulous stunts along with some truly unbelievable cameos roles by Frank Oz and Steven Spielberg as well as Ray Charles , James Brown etc,etc. If you haven't seen this film Watch It !! If you have, why not Watch it again !! I now own it on VHS , DVD and now HD. Will probably have to buy it in 3D when it arrives someday in the near future. The only pity is that they couldn't easily make a sequel that deserved to sit alongside the original and Blues Brothers 2000 isn't a bad film but was always going to struggle to please the fans of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film to be viewed if only for the preservation of performances by icons of American culture, including Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and the inimitable Cab Calloway.Far and away the best of the NBC's Saturday Night alumni films, though that is to damn with faint praise. Only 'Caddyshack' is in the same level of merit.Fantasy and music in perfect proportion, though the unstinting use of filthy language makes this a production unsuitable for children or adults easily offended.The National Socialist White Peoples' Party could have been deleted without loss of any kind to the film. While Skokie Nazis may have been topical at the time of the filming, their inclusion is not amusing or entertaining in any way now.Background traverses wrong way when the Bluesmobile is revolving during first police chase scene, though this has been amply discussed.No shootings, stabbings, the only violence is comic. No nudity, no sexual situations but repellent language galore. No drug abuse but much tobacco consumption and some ethanol use.View the musical scenes if not the entire film.jHh</fullReview>

I've yet to meet anyone who didn't enjoy this -when they watched the DVD or older VHS theatrical release. The 'edited for TV' version is just so much wasted time and space -they really managed to steal all of the soul and heart out of the movie -and thats not easy! It has virtually no 'dead' parts -but its not one of those 'up tight' movies where you have to pay absolute attention to everything or you miss the point, either. Any who are old enough to have been a fan of the 'blues brothers' when they were on saturdaynight live, will truly enjoy this. If you just want some good laughs, plenty of great one-liners with perfect delivery, its still an excellent choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Landis just got to have the credit for making this movie a big hit. "The Blues Brothers" is musically funny, and such a thrill to enjoy. Here you got Jake Blues(John Belushi, 1949-82) and his brother Elwood(Dan Ackroyd) who are sent on a "mission from God" to build up the Band and save the orphanage from being sold. Jake is out on parole from a Joliet,Ill. prison, Elwood drives a old Dodge Police Car , and they carry their mission along the way. They would run afoul of the State Police, Neo-Nazis, a Country &amp; Western band, and a woman(Carrie Fisher) who was jilted by Jake. While trying to make friends, they make enemies as well. The car chase scenes are a classic, the State Police and The Chicago Police were after the Blues. High speeds and sirens can be deafening, yet in this movie, it's all fun. Not only them, the Fire Dept., The National Guard, and S.W.A.T. came after the Blues, right after the car died. That mission was not to be interrupted by anyone, or anything. The cast members of the movie was great: James Brown, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, etc. I mean it was great! A huge keeper here. 5 stars! for star power!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blues Brothers = The Best Musical Comedy Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just love everything about this movie, from the comedy of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd (the straight man's straight man), to the fabulous music, the stellar cameos, and most especially the car chases. I just love seeing all those police cars getting smashed up. BTW, did you know that TBB held the world record for the most cars destroyed in one film until it was surpassed by its own sequel? (I got that from Wikipedia, which has great articles on both the movie and the band.) My favorite scenes are early in the movie. The first is the scene with Sister Mary Stigmata, aka "The Penguin", where she's whacking them for using foul language. The other is the scene where the brothers find themselves stuck in a line of cars stopped on the road. When the ask a passing policeman what's going on, and find out it's a march of "the f#&amp;%ing Nazis", Jake utters my favorite line in the movie, "I HATE Illinois Nazis", and they charge the Bluesmobile straight towards those f#&amp;%ing Nazi bastards and force them to jump off the bridge. Every time I watch that scene, I shout, "YES! Illinois Nazis, IN THE WATER!!". Now, I'm a tolerant Christian man, and I belong to a large multicultural church, and they teach "hate the sin, not the sinner", but I feel EXACTLY the way the Blues Brothers do about Nazis of all stripes. This movie really has it all! I could go on and on about this musical farce, but space is limited, so I'll just say YOU MUST SEE AND BUY THIS MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is the greatest movie ever made. The movie starts quiet, and slow, entering joliet prison. Elwood (Dan Akroyd) picks up Jake (John Belushi) from prison, after serving three years for robbery. Jake is then dragged to the orphanage, that he and Elwood grew up in, which owes back taxes in the amount of five thousand dollars. Jake and Elwood search for their band, and meet up with some of the greatest Artists of all time, such as Areatha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Callaway, and John Lee Hooker to name a few, all performing musical numbers at the top of there game. Once their band is essembled, The Blues Brothers try to put on the greatest show on earth, so they can raise the money owed in back taxes for the orphanage. Look for cameo appearances from Carrie Fisher (the mystery woman with a PHD in explosives), Paul Ruben (Before He Was Pee Wee Herman, and Steven Spielberg (on his lunch break)! This movie starts as a sniffle, and ends like the black plague in suits and sunglasses. This 25th anniversary includes an outstanding documentary behind the creation of the Blues Brothers, both the movie and the band! Starting with a guest spot on Saturday night live, and their first album, "Briefcase of blues," ( the highest selling blues album of all time!). Also included is a touching tribute to the late great, "John Belushi," by the people who knew him best. The Blues Brothers 25th anniversary DVD is a must for anyone that enjoys great music, great action, and big laughs.</fullReview>

With the perfect backdrop of Illinois and Chicago scenes of law enforcement being abused and terrorized, anyone around the blues scene that was reborn in Chicago after this movie will fully appreciate the sarcasm. O yeah, the MUSIC, nothing to say but "outstanding"! And Ray Charles,"i'll throw in the black keys for free" says it all ... if you can SEE the humor in that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about the blues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After John Landis had directed John Belushi in "Animal House", and after John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd had co-starred in "1941", all three collaborated on a movie with which they will forever be associated: "The Blues Brothers". The plot of course has Jake (Belushi) and Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) on "a mission from God" to save the orphanage where they grew up. This necessitates reassembling their blues band and going on tour. By going on tour, I mean making a mess of everything. Whether it's their boorish behavior in a ritzy restaurant, the demolition of a mall, or an infinite number of car crashes, these guys are the bane of orderly society.Of course, the real star is the music. Making guest appearances are some of the twentieth century's most renowned artists. Ray Charles plays a music store owner, James Brown plays a preacher, Aretha Franklin plays The Soul Food Cafe owner, and there's many more. This movie reminds us why the blues remain an integral part of our national heritage. The big concert is probably the best example (especially with Elwood's crazy dance).Also appearing are Carrie Fisher as a woman out to kill Jake, John Candy as the police chief chasing them, Henry Gibson as an Illinois Nazi out to get Jake and Elwood after a most unusual encounter, and Steven Spielberg as the Cook County Clerk. All in all, this is one movie that won't disappoint you. Because everybody needs some movie to love (some movie to love/some movie to love). It needs you, you, you...</fullReview>

The blues Brothers is a musical/comedy with some of the greatest musicians in the world. The late Ray Charles , Aretha Franklin late Cab Calloway and James Brown.. We shall not forget the band that also is very good.Its a shame that we never could see more of John Belushis fine work but while we still can lets go out and buy the new 25th Anniversary DVD and enjoy this masterpiece from this two comedy legends that Brought Blues To A New Age!</fullReview>

This is not true in the Blues Brothers, as the songs still sound fantastic 25 years on and the songs naturally fit into the story and are part of the plot rather than set-pieces. The film is hilariously funny and there is a natural chemistry between John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd that makes their roles as near perfect as possible.The car chase and subsequent crashes are among the most impressive that I can remember and the supporting cast offer up some great songs, most notably in my opinion Ray Charles.I would include this in my top 10 films ever, and as someone who normally hates musicals with a vengeance, that says a lot.</fullReview>

Jake and Elwood might not be everyone's (or anyone's) idea as heroes but despite all of their faults they have an endearing quality about them. I like this film because to me it has humour, sensitivity, sadness, great music and a fine cast. The big getaway is something that appeals to kids especially (the rating of 15 is ridiculous and would probably be PG nowadays). Even though this film was panned upon its original release it has shown through subsequent years its enduring popularity. I, for one, am in no doubt that this is a genre defining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catholics Joliet Jake Blues (the late John Belushi) and his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) were once a hot Chicago blues band, but their glory days came to an end when Jake robbed a gas station to cover their band's room service tab. Let out three years early for good behavior, Jake is horrified to discover that Elwood lied to him about the band going their own ways and both are unhappy to hear that the orphanage where they grew up is going to be bought out and torn down, even if the nun or "penguin" running the place used to smack them with rulers. Encouraged by their surrogate father Curtis (the late Cab Calloway) to get the money needed by the orphanage to keep it aloft, they go to church and Jake sees the light: "The band!"In other words, they must reunite their band, play a few quick gigs and make a lot of money fast. Unfortunately, Elwood angers the Chicago police when they pull him over for allegedly running a red light (even though it was clearly yellow) and later they anger the Illinois Nazis by running them off a bridge during their demonstration, and even later they anger a country band by stealing their gig at Bob's Country Bunker and anger Bob too by refusing to pay him for the obscene amount of beer they drank. And to top it all off, Jake is being pursued by his jilted fiance, Carrie Fisher (her character is billed as "Mystery Woman" in the film, but according to one source her name was supposed to be Camille). Chaos and mayhem ensue along with some very good music that includes "Everybody Needs Somebody To Love", "Jailhouse Rock", "Think" (Aretha Franklin as the cafe owner and wife of Matt "Guitar" Murphy), "Minnie The Moocher", whatever those songs are that are sung by Ray Charles and James Brown, and the theme to TV's "Rawhide". The late John Candy plays one of the cops chasing Jake &amp; Elwood, and Twiggy appears as a customer at a gas station that Elwood hits on.Memorable moments include Jake and Elwood being attacked by the nun, Jake seeing "the light", the car chase in the mall and the Nazi car chase among the other various car chases, Carrie Fisher's various attempts to kill Jake &amp; Elwood, the Jailhouse rock ending, the restaruant scene, and the "Everybody Needs Somebody To Love" number.Did I mention that buddies John and Dan are hilarious as the deadpan brothers? Shame that John died so young, and a shame that they got Dan Aykroyd to write "Blues Brothers 2000". The special edition DVD includes lost footage like Elwood quitting his job at the glue factory, Elwood's secret garage for hiding the "Blues-Mobile", the cigarette packet that Elwood had jotted down the various names and addresses of the band, more dialogue between Elwood &amp; Jake in general, and - GASP - the destruction of the gas station! Either version is a fun time though, but don't let your kids watch it by themselves on account of the profanity.</fullReview>

It does everything required to make it a true cult movie. Its totally over the top, the music is fantastic and the car chase is great fun. Not as good a car chase as the original "Gone in sixty seconds" done by the late great HB Halicki, but still a worthy holder of the "Most car wrecks in a movie" record.Its a shame John Belushi isn't with us still today, as his comedy timing and presence would have made some of our other classic movies very different (for the even better) "Ghostbusters" for example :)Anyways, this movie is and always will be a 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time can only tell how many times I have seen this movie, and like good wine it only gets better with age.The Blues Brothers is just one of those timeless movies. Due in part to the comic timing of both Aykroid and Belushi and the direction of John Landis. The soundtrack is just phenominal. Even if you are not a big fan of Soul, RNB, or Blues.This is not just a buddy comedy, it is a musical, a comedy, an action film of epic proportions. I have yet to see a movie that could juggle all of these elements in such a way as the Original film did. The sequel tried and failed miserably!So if you want to take in an entertaining movie one night, check it out, or reaquaint yourself with it. It is definite popcorn fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To deride the movie as 'silly' is to miss the point - it's a backdrop to great old blues/rnb/soul music. It's a superb movie to cheer you up, and can be watched repeatedly.No, it's not perfect, and it does require that you like the music to derive real enjoyment, but just sit down and relax, drink in the music, crack a smile at the one liners and while away a couple of happy hours.8/10 in case something better comes along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Landis and Dan Akroyd have created a milestone of comedy and music. The plot is simple and yet so intriguing, two lowlifes desperately trying to save an orphanage on the order of a sadistic nun. The way in which the Blues Brothers manage to offend just about everyone in chicagoi is half the fun of this movie, whilst the superbly chosen soundtrack provides the rest. The gags, are fantastic, ranging from quick one liners to brilliantly well handled visuals. John Landis' style and camera control is impeccable and blends perfectly wiht the mood of the film. The finale scene is also a groundbreaking feet in combining unbelievable action with insanely clever comedy. The way in which all the actors and actresses don't take it too seriously adds to the light heartedness of the piece and still makes me smile every time I see it. A classic comedy movie with some of the best use of soundtrack I've ever seen (or heard). People working on the blues Brothers; well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a real classic, cult movie. Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi blows the screen with great music, fantastic comedy and the best police-car-crash ever made. To aid them there are blues classics like...James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Mat "Guitar" Murphy and many more...The movie is about the Blues Brothers: Jake and Elwood Blues. Jake has just got out of the Juliett (Jail). To aid a nun they decide to get their old band back together, and raise $5000. Against them stands the Illinois nazis, and the law - who remember what happen the last time they played.The soundtrack is amazing...probably the best up to now. It includes great blues-sound - actually The Blues Brothers went-on and made a couple of more albums where they feature some more blues-classics. Watch-out for "Briefcase full of Blues"My rating of this movie is 11 out of 10 possible. And my advice is: WATCH THIS MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are you bothering to read the heading?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film on TV three years ago, on the recommendation of my dad, and as it was on late in the morning (with swear words still deleted I might add), I taped it and then intended to tape over it afterwards. I've never done that. It has since become my all time favourite film, but it didn't start out that way. After seeing it for the first time, my reaction was: "Well, it's not bad... I can see why it's a cult movie... all that singing would be good in a cinema, but it's not great." Somehow I decided to watch it once more before taping over it, and this time I really started to like it. Over the end credits I actually got up and started dancing (I have no life, I know), and I knew there was something happening cause I'd never done that before. I think that it actually does get better on a second viewing, just because the beginning is so slow going (all that silence), you expect the rest of the movie to be like that, which of course it's not. **What I'm saying is.. watch this movie twice!!** I love this movie, mainly because I feel indebted to it for helping to get me listening to blues and also old rock and roll. Before I saw this I just put up with whatever teeniebopper crap was on the radio, but then I bought the soundtrack, then heaps of other Blues Bros stuff, then I dug out my families old record colection (that hadn't been played for 10 years) and now I hardly listen to the new stuff. For this I am grateful. It also got me watching cult movies, before I saw this I never saw myself watching things like Plan 9 From outer Space. In short, this one movie changed my life, my tastes in music, movies and fashion. It taught me what makes a good comedy, it inspired me to track down old SNL tapes, and I was introduced to John Belushi, and the talent of Dan Aykroyd (who I'd never liked much till I saw this). By the way, why does everyone praise this as Belushi's film and brainchild, when it was Aykroyd who suggested the band, who introduced Belushi to the blues, who wrote the screenplay? Oh well. Whoever you are, go and see this film. Now. If you've already seen it, then see it again. Good. Now wait three days and watch it again. Buy the soundtrack. Or better yet, buy the Blues Brothers complete (all three albums rolled into one). Now go to a late night screening of it. Very good. See, that wasn't so hard was it? And once you've seen the best film ever made (this one, dummy), go and read the best book ever written: Catch 22. You'll never be the same again, I promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeedy-do, the original Blues Brothers is not one of the better movies that I have seen.. because it is one of the rare BEST MOVIES I have ever seen in all 21 years of my life! Even though I have constant disagreements with some of my movie-going buddies, I think this movie stands out MILES AWAY from the rest in the comedy genre! It's unique and it screams of the American culture of the soon-to-be-past millenium! In short, this is one extremely special movie which I will definitely never EVER forget to the day I expire!This is the first John Belushi movie I've seen, and I can only imagine the wackiness of SNL of the days gone by! Dan Aykroyd is as brilliant as ever, much younger and slimmer than his Ray Stantz character in "Ghost Busters" that he did later on. Aykroyd is one of the best performers out there today, he is simply entertaining! And Carrie Fisher is EXCELLENT!! Forget Star Wars, this is Fisher at her best!The best thing about the Blues Bros is the smart inclusion of classic great musicians of yesteryears, cleverly mixed with zany dialogue and some excellent songs, and some of the wackiest slapstick-style comedy ever, and the result is so beautiful you almost forget the stoooopid story-line! You just gotta BE IN THE MOVIE to truly enjoy it! I'm not much for music OR movies, but the Blues Brothers is one movie you cannot afford to miss! Keep an eye out for Spielberg :-)Oomph!-meter (from 5): ****1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Way over produced and exaggerated, this overrated Movie has a number or funny bits and some bouncy Music, some of it by real Soul and R&amp;B greats, but it is also filled with so many car crashes that it wrecks the momentum. There could easily be 45 minutes cut in the form of unnecessary big budget, obligatory scenes and this would be a more enjoyable Musical/Comedy. As it is, there is so much that is disjointed and destructive that it literally collapses onto itself with over indulgence and unrestrained tomfoolery.Worth a view for the better parts, but be prepared to endure endless repetition, mostly of the vehicular nature. Aykroyd and Belushi were naturals on SNL and other projects, but this big production didn't do them any favors in the creative department because they were buried in so much rubble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Hit from SNLI grew up with this movie. It was the first "R" movie I ever saw. I had always been a fan of blues and rock, a fan of musicals, comedies and SNL. SNL has many movies based on skits from them? this movie has to be one of, if not the top one. It has great music from a excellent bunch of musicians. And great acting from a nice bunch of performers. John B. had always been into music, and on SNL has portrayed many singers to a great like. He is also one of the funniest guys out there. He has got to be one of the best motion picture comedians and physical comedians. He was a stunts man as well, he liked to do a lot of his own stunts, which by looking at him his hard to believe. Dan A. has a great talent for music, playing an excellent harmonica, raised with the blues and still talks on a blues radio show. Great comedian and actor. Then the movie brings in some real musical talent; James Brown (The king of Soul) Aretha Franklin (if James is the king then she is the queen) Cab Calloway (All around great musician- writer, singer) Ray Charles (one of the greatest song writers and piano players) Donald 'Duck' Dunn (probably one of the greatest living bass guitar players) John Lee Hooker (Great blues musician and guitarist) Performers; Carrie Fisher- plays the crazed ex, a big step from Star Wars. ;) Pee-Wee Herman as a waiter, not a big part but I noticed him. John Candy the Cop, helping the cops with a vendetta. Very smooth. There are others I know I left out, but these are the ones that stand out in my mind. This movie is full of comedy? line after line? scene after scene. The signature watch break, police pile ups, and cursing. The movie is a tri story- A mission from god to get money for the orphanage, avoiding Jakes ex-girlfriend, and getting the band back together and keeping it together?. and of course the smaller stories- avoiding the Nazis, cops, and good ole boys. Its an un-imaginable cast, a great story line and non-stop comedy.A excellent movie for all those looking for a great laugh and that love great music. This movie is a legend in its own rights and a classic. Maybe even a bit cultish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Home Chicago!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since its initial broadcast, comedy show "Saturday Night Live" has been the launching place for many comedians who use the chance of being in the show as a way to develop their talents and aim for a career on film. As members of the first generation of the show, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were among the first to make the jump from the show to the film industry. Although the pair had moderate success at first, Belushi became a modern icon of American comedy in 1978 with "Animal House". It was after that success when the two friends decided to make a movie about one of the most successful "Saturday Night Live" characters, the pair of R&amp;B singers: "The Blues Brothers". Being his most beloved creation, Aykroyd began to write the full story of the characters, but ended up with over 300 pages of script. It was director John Landis' task to transform Aykroyd's script into a realizable movie.The movie begins with the release from prison of Jake Blues (John Belushi), co-founder and singer of the Blues Brothers band. After being picked up by his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd), he is informed that the band broke up after his incarceration and that the Blues Brothers are apparently over. However, after discovering that the old Catholic home where they were raised as kids is going to be sold because of its debts, the brothers decide that its their mission, a mission from God, to get the money to save the house, and the only way to achieve that goal will be to reform the legendary Blues Brothers band. With this idea the brothers set to find the band's former members, but in their way they'll find new enemies in the form of a Neo-Nazi group, a country band, and a mysterious woman who just wants the brothers dead.Written by Aykroyd and Landis, the script is essentially a musical tale that cleverly mixes action and comedy while paying homage to that good old rhythm and blues music that both were so fond of. While Aykroyd's extensive and detailed account of the characters' history has been transformed into a simpler, straight forward plot by Landis, the change is very effective as this way to unfold the story is more in tone with the frank and raw attitude of the brothers. The story is fast paced, as the brothers' tale of redemption is one of high octane energy with powerful musical performances and insane car chases that never make the story boring or tiresome. Making up for the simple plot are the very likable personalities of the two main characters, who carry the movie with their charm and a presence that proves that a memorable character is more than a collection of one liners.In this his fourth movie as a director, John Landis once again demonstrated why he was one of the most promising directors of the early 80s, showing a significant growth in his style of directing comedy that clearly set the basis for his 1981 masterpiece, "An American Werewolf in London". Already a master of the direction of big and complex set pieces, Landis takes this to a new level with the amazing car chases conceived for the film. With a bigger budget than in his three previous efforts, Landis creates an explosive musical that perfectly represents everything that Aykroyd and Belushi conceived as "The Blues Brothers". The duo's main trait is the music, and Landis knew this well, so the film is filled not only with the brothers' interpretations of R&amp;B classics, but also the ones by real R&amp;B legends such as Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Cab Calloway among others.As expected, the performances by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are of an excellent quality. While less over the top than in "Animal House", Belushi's genius for comedy shines through the film in his energetic role of Jake Blues, who is the one who receives the "mission from God". As the laconic Elwood, Dan Aykroyd delivers the subtler comedy in the movie, and shows a complete domain of his character. Together the pair make an excellent team that not only deliver fun comedy but also make an outstanding musical duo. While the Blues brothers are certainly the focus of the story, the vast array of guest stars that appear through the film deliver terrific performances when singing (Ray Charles, James Brown), acting (John Candy, Carrie Fisher) or both (Cab Calloway). The musical performances are simply top notch and make the film really special.As written above, the movie is first and foremost a musical homage to Chicago, so those expecting a laugh riot comedy will definitely find a different kind of beast. This is not to say that there is no comedy, on the contrary, the movie is filled with a good amount of laughs, but the focus of the film remains on the music. Still, "The Blues Brothers" is not your typical musical, as its fast pace makes it a thrilling ride like no other movie, and probably the features that most perfectly represents this are the amazing car chases that the stunt team developed for the movie. As in a rocking dance of destruction, the cars crash and smash across the streets of Chicago in some of the most incredible stunts on film. Some have criticized the emphasis put on this scenes, but I think that they fit perfectly in the mood and tone of the brothers themselves.Without a doubt the Blues brothers are two of the best and most famous characters created by Belushi and Aykroyd, and this movie truly makes them justice. While not the deepest or most insightful movie ever, "The Blues Brothers" is definitely one of the most entertaining ones, and its magic lays in that frank simplicity that surrounds the movie's story. Raw and direct, "The Blues Brothers" is a movie that truly makes Chicago feel like home, sweet home. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the movies that I have neither heard of or seen, I have never seen a movie that was so good, I had to watch it about 150 times. The Blues Brothers is the greatest movie a director has directed, a producer has produced, a writer has written or an actor has acted in. The Blues Brothers is a perfect example of how every good comedy should be made. John Belushi gives his greatest performance of his entire career as Jake Blues, he takes the character and makes it as good as it was written. Dan Aykroyd has never been better. In this movie, he shows that he's got game and that he can dominate a movie with such force in his character, it'll knock your socks off. The movie also features cameos from such famous musicians such as Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway and James Brown. The musicians are just as good as the rest of the cast was, some are great, some are very good and some are fall on your back hilarious! The Blues Brothers is the perfect movie for anyone who loves slapstick comedy, blues music, cars crashing and the combination of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. If you want a great comedy flick, go get this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is a real one of kind movie. It's funny, action-packed, and quite eccentric when compared to other Hollywood movies. But it is all for the better.The story kicks off as Jake gets out of prison is picked up by his brother Elwood, and finds out the outside world has changed. Most notably that his former home, an orphanage is going to close for lack of funding. He decides that he and Elwood should get their former band, The Blues Brothers, back together to pay the orphanages yearly tax, but the band has split up while Jake was in the slam. Next... the adventure begins!With cameos by some of the greatest blues musicians performing many great songs this movie is pure grade-A entertainment. I don't even listen to blues, I am more of hard rock and metal person, but this movie is still great! Also, the relentless, hilarious, and spectacular car-chases have to mentioned. Tearing through shopping malls and the streets of Chicago they are absolutely awesome and packed with some of the best off-beat comic timing in any movie. Good music, good action, good humor... what's not to like? 10/10Rated R, kind of unfairly, for mostly comic profanity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Culled from the classic "Saturday Night Live" blues duo, "The Blues Brothers" follows siblings Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) and fresh out of prison 'Joliet' Jake Blues (John Belushi) as they try to re-unite their blues combo, spread out all over Chicago, in order to raise five thousand dollars to save the orphanage in which they grew up. Needless to say, lots of harmless carnage and laughs ensue as the Blues Brothers make enemies with the Cook County Police, the Illinois Nazi Party, a rowdy country band, and a mysterious woman whose only mission is to see the boys dead. John Landis directs one of the few worthy films based on an SNL sketch, with a great script by Landis and Aykroyd. One of the most hilarious comedies of the past twenty-five years, featuring an unforgettable combination of blues music, cameos, and car chases. The illogical points in the script only make it funnier. A must-see musical comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I ever saw "The Blues Brothers" was in 1992. It appeared on TBS, edited of course. I wasn't even watching it... I just had the TV on while I was doing some work on my computer.Then... the mall scene.The stunts... the sounds... the people diving for cover... the one-liners... and the music, oh the MUSIC! I had to turn around and watch, as it even caught my attention with my back turned. After watching for 5 minutes, I turned it off and left. Not because I didn't like it, mind you... but because I could see that the "bad words" had been dubbed over (obviously), and it ticked me off that they did this to a movie that was so entertaining to me. So, I turned it off, jumped in my car, and shot over to Blockbuster and rented it.I watched it twice when I got home. Heh... I'd NEVER done that before. Not since I was a kid, anyway. Never actually stopped a movie when the credits came on, rewound it, and then watched it AGAIN. OH, but I loved it! Everything about it... the attitudes, the singing, the car chases, the clothes... the fedoras... the sunglasses.If you haven't seen this movie, please watch it. I'm proud to say that "The Blues Brothers" is known as the first "big-budget" movie in history. If you don't believe me, watch what happens in the movie when they finally get to Chicago.Listen... I just-- can't say enough about this movie. I own a framed original movie poster from 1980. I've been to the House of Blues in Chicago... I bought a Black fedora and Wayfarer Ray-bans-- I know-- I know: geeky, perhaps. But that's HOW STINKIN' GOOD this movie was!! It MAKES you wanna be geeky and like them! Well... it makes ME, anyway. I don't know... maybe I'm just a geek, and you're all laughing at me right now. But it STILL wouldn't change the fact that "The Blues Brothers" is ONE GREAT MOVIE!!--dog-gonnit...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Landis' movie doesn't quite cut the mustard but it consistently hits the goal-posts. It looks fabulous, (it's like a Frank Tashlin movie from the fifties on a much larger scale). What it is, really, is a series of sketches, some of them terrific, rather than a plot, interrupted by some great musical numbers. It may be a terrible film, (it's like a big screen version of "Saturday Night Live"), but it has two great iconic moments.Aretha Franklin plays a waitress and gets to strut her stuff and sing "Think" and it's a legendary moment, and Cab Callaway gets to do "Minnie the Moocher" in front of a large audience and he's magnificent. And any movie that has Ray Charles and James Brown in it is doing something right. The film quickly developed a cult following and has since spawned a stage show based on it's leading characters. It has become something of a classic. It's certainly a guilty pleasure. In Italy, Fellini might have made something like this on an off-day and if he was in a good mood. Unfortunately, the climatic chase, while spectacular, does drag on a bit (and what a waste of 1000 extras).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Landis' spin-off from the Blues Brothers Band sketches of SNL starts with Jake (the wonderful John Belushi) coming out of prison to be met by brother Elwood (energetic Dan Aykroyd) in the new Bluesmobile - a high powered ex-cop car with special features, allowing it to leap across bridges and such. After a trip to see the scary 'penguin', their ex-matriarch (Kathleen Freeman) they decide to reform their band to raise cash for their old orphanage. Thing is, the members of their band are all doing other things like working in burger bars, as maitre d', and so on, and need to be persuaded.The best thing about this movie is the music, and this isn't just provided by the boys and their band, but by a number of guest appearances such as those of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, and best of all, the great Cab Calloway. The car chase sequences where a whole shopping mall and loads of police cars are destroyed is also brilliantly done. There are lots of other goodies along the way, like the country club, the pseudo-Nazis, and of course, psychotic Carrie Fisher. The sequel wasn't bad but this is the real McCoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloated, but never less than entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(NOTE: This review is for the unrated, extended version) SNL movies have a really spotty track record, and often feel like sketches dragged out to feature length. I haven't seen any of the SNL sketches for the Blues Brothers, but this film adaptation hardly feels like the other SNL movies I've seen. There is a decent amount of plot (really, too much) and it is consistently funny throughout. Not only that, but it has one of the best soundtracks ever. The gist of the story is that after Jake Blues is let out of prison on parole, he teams up with his brother Elwood and sets out on a mission to get the band back together in order to raise money to save the orphanage they were raised in. Meanwhile, a diverse assortment of people are all on their trail. What really worked for me was the chemistry between Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi (may he rest in peace), because without that central relationship the movie would just fall flat. And, in contrast to many other SNL movies, THE BLUES BROTHERS felt really cinematic in terms of scale and spectacle. It was excessive at times, but never less than entertaining and always funny. The film also has a ton of cameos from famous artists and other comedians. Some of them felt a little superfluous (Carrie Fisher, I'm looking at you), but again, there was always something to laugh about or sing along with. One scene that I liked in particular was the Brothers' first gig in a Country/Western bar (and the aftermath when the real band shows up). It showed some on-the-spot thinking on the band's part, as well as musical diversity. Outside of that scene, my favorite musical number is probably Cab Calloway performing his signature song, "Minnie the Moocher." Even at his advanced age, he still had the voice and moves. However, the film isn't perfect. Keeping in mind that I watched the extended version, which is about 15 minutes longer, there definitely was a surplus of material, and not all of it was necessary. I didn't really notice too much where footage was added (having not seen the theatrical cut), but there was one short scene where Elwood quits his day job that shouldn't have been added back in. First, in the previous scene he already mentioned he was going to do that. Second, he wasn't wearing his trademark shades. I also feel like Carrie Fisher's role in the film, while funny, didn't have the best resolution, at least compared to the other running gags. Also, at nearly 2 1/2 hours, there are parts that drag. Ultimately, though, THE BLUES BROTHERS is a highly entertaining, funny film that has plenty of action (and comically absurd amounts of property damage), great music and solid performances from everyone involved. If you haven't seen it yet (what few of you there might be), consider watching THE BLUES BROTHERS your own personal "mission from God."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so great and it has so many great songs from Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles and many more. I think the acting was pretty great it had many funny moments and the duo is pretty awesome. Also Princess Leia makes an appearance as the Mystery Woman and blows things up. I will definitely buy this movie on DVD if i find it it has everything i loved from the 80's and even more it's definitely a film you need to check out if you haven't seen there's also a sequel but since the reviews aren't that good maybe you should skip it. I give it a 10 out of 10 a really great film with a lot of great songs, action and one liners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is a classic. It's such a Chicago icon that there are statues of Jake Blues (John Belushi) and Elwood Blues (Dan Akroyd) there. The story is crazy and so over the top that the best way for me to explain it is that Jake, just out of prison and his brother Elwood have to get the band back together to raise money to save the orphanage where they grew up and inadvertently become the most wanted men in the United States. Don't ask how this is, just watch the movie. It's funny, it's quirky, it's well acted, the guest stars are great fun, it's just great. The one word that pops into my head when I hear Blues Brothers is fun. This is just a fun movie. Nine stars. Go check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An hilarious movie! I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the Blues Brothers is the classic tale of the underdog rising above their former self and helping those that need their help. This movie takes this form of storytelling and strings a crazy, comedic adventure through it. The Blues Brothers, Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) and and Jake Blues (Belushi) are two unlikely heroes that travel around searching for their lost band-mates so they can pull off one more gig to raise money to save the orphanage where they grew up. Along the way they encounter trouble, sometimes intentional and sometimes not. It just seems to find them. Aykroyd and Belushi are an hilarious and wonderful pair as they spout their lines back and forth. Their physical comedy is even better. The film as a whole nails physical comedy on the head with its car chase scenes especially. This movie has a bit of a script issue as one can forget what exactly the purpose of the Blues Brother's intentions all along are. While watching I forgot about the Orphanage as the movie had completely centered around the band and the Blues Brother's shenanigans. All accounted for, I'd rate this movie a 8 out of 10. It's an amazing comedy and timeless. Aykroyd and Belushi are lovable idiots as the Blues Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jake Blues (John Belushi), just out from prison, puts together his old band to save the Catholic home where he and brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) were raised.Somehow, this film never got watched by me until now (2015). I was always aware of it, and even knew many of the film's quotes, but had never seen more than a few minutes here or there. Boy was I missing out. We start off early on with a great police chase, and by the end we have more than one (always a welcome part of any film, and sometimes the most memorable).I love the Chicago setting. Although not a Chicago native myself, it is the only big city I have spent any time in. So the suburbs are something that mean much more to me than anything shot in Los Angeles or New York. Give me McHenry or Wrigley Field any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1980, "The Blues Brothers" is a comedy/farce/musical starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as brothers who get their rhythm and blues band back together in order to raise $5000 to save the orphanage where they grew up. Carrie Fisher is on hand, as well as a lot of old musicians, like James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles.I found myself laughing throughout this movie, sometimes uproariously. The best parts are the Catholic orphanage scene, the black church sequence, the diner scene, the country bar episode and any part with Carrie Fisher trying to utterly annihilate Jake (Belushi) and anyone who just happens to be in his general vicinity.For me, though, the film's a little bit overlong and should've been cut by about 15 minutes. For instance, they could've easily cut the music store scene since it's not as good as the other musical sequences, but then Ray Charles would've been cut. Nevertheless, this is a great comedy.The film runs 133 minutes (extended cut 148 minutes) and was shot in the Chicago area.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A one-off gem -- awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They could never make another film like this, it's too over the top and nutty. We see an amazing line-up of blues performers and music -- Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Sam &amp; Dave, Steve Winwood, and the Blues Brothers band members who are all superb. The most ambitious stunts ever seen. The best comic actors including John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, John Candy, and Henry Gibson. Even the cameos are first class, such as Twiggy, Stephen Spielberg, Frank Oz and Carrie Fisher. Just about every scene is a classic. The Nazi rally that Jake and Elwood crash into, the redneck country bar where the band performs behind chicken wire because the drunks throw bottles at them, Elwood's apartment where the trains go by non stop, and Jake and Elwood acting like pigs in a posh French restaurant in a bid to blackmail the maitre d' into coming back into the band. Yes it's a series of sketches, but the film's plot, about brothers Jake and Elwood getting their band back together to raise money to save their old orphanage, propels the film beautifully. Even the fact the band members aren't all good actors is funny. They all have a ball while sending themselves up as hapless musos roped into the Blues Brothers' crazy antics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cats don't make good catholics: they can't kneel and feel no shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically that is the feel of the Blues Brothers movie. Cool cats like Dan Aykroyd and James Belushi are the Blues brothers and they are on a mission (presumably from God) to get 5000$ for the catholic orphanage where they grew up. So they get "the band" back together in order to play the concert of their lives and get the money. They do it by shamelessly cheating people, stealing stuff, running away from police, being chased by Nazis, cowboys, police and finally the army.The film is filled with good old blues music, just look at the cast and you will see the many famous people in the business singing and playing. Based on a Saturday Night Live sketch, the movie wrecked 103 cars in the over the top car chase scenes and it is just concentrated fun in a can. Do watch it, do enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blues Brothers is Rollicking Good Fun and My All Time Favorite Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that The Blues Brothers is my all time favorite comedy. It's delightfully over the top, brimming with good-natured energy, and set to some of the twentieth century's best music. Of all the Dan Akroyd/ John Belushi team ups, this is by far the best. The plot, such as it is, involves the efforts Jake (Belushi) an Elwood (Akroyd) to reunite their old band, the Blues Brothers, for a concert that will raise the $3,000 dollars needed to save the Catholic orphanage where they grew up- hence the famous tag-line "We're on a mission from God." But this is easier said than done. Their former band mates aren't that easy to convince, or even track down, gigs are hard to come by, and they manage to get on the wrong side of everybody from the police to the Illinois State Nazi Party. Of course this is really just the setup for a series of hilarious hi-jinks and upbeat musical numbers. And boy do they ever manage that. Jake and Elroy are two of the funniest characters ever to appear on screen, and the roles that Belushi and Akroyd were born to play. Jake is cynical, wisecracking, and a total ham, while Elwood is utterly deadpan, serious but even tempered no matter what the situation. The thing about these two is that they're a couple of the nicest shmucks you'll ever meet- and at the same time a pair of irredeemable crooks. They pull every trick in the book, from giving false addresses (with excellent payoff) to sabotaging police cars. And these guys are the very definition of chutzpah. They actually manage to pass themselves off as the scheduled country western band at Bob's Country Bunker. And when Jake is confronted by hiss jilted would-be bride (Carrie Fisher), his pitiful recitation of clichd excuses borders on the unbelievable.The rest of the cast are also superb. Rays Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and even Cab Calloway show up as a preacher, a used instrument salesman, and so on. And of course they sing. Their numbers- including Respect, Shake Your Tail Feathers, and Minnie the Moocher- are truly spectacular and will likely have you tapping' your toes and singing along. John Candy Does puts in good work as a bumbling, nice guy detective, and Twiggy is mildly amusing with the old dumb blond shtick, but the best casting decision just might be Carrie Fisher as Jake's psychotic ex. She's not the psycho-killer type, in which case there wouldn't be any joke, but from watching her Star Wars we know that she knows her way around a gun, so the character is believable.Another of the film's main strengths is that it can find humor in anything. In writing the script, Akroyd and Landis have managed to inject comedy into situations as mundane as Jake's release from prison or Elwood quitting his job at the shaving cream factory. One of the funniest scenes is the brothers' meeting with the Penguin. Usually, a meeting with the nun who helped raise the main characters would be handled solemnly. But here, it's an expletive filled scene of snowballing slapstick comedy.This movie also succeeds at something many critics have held to be impossible. It has car chases that are actually funny. Now I agree that there's nothing particularly humorous about watching cars chase each other at high speed. The humor comes from the characters' responses, whether it be Jake and Elwood's disinterested commentary on the stores they're plowing through, or Candy's priceless line after embedding himself in the side of a semi truck. The filmmakers also understand the comedic potential of absurd overstatement, as with the Nazi bigwig's jaw dropping plunge.What The Blues Brothers is really about though is the music. Besides the previously mention legends of R&amp;B, the brothers themselves provide much of the soundtrack. What many people today don't realize is that the Blues Brothers were an actual chart topping band. There's no lip syncing here; the actors are in fact playing their own music, and boy is it ever good. Their rendition of Wilson Pickett's Everybody Needs Somebody to Love is one of the most energetic, feel good pieces of music ever released. I truly envy the crowd that was packed into the Palace Hotel Ballroom for the filming of the main concert.Any way you look at it, this movie is pure fun, plain and simple. Every high energy song and dance, every physics-defying chase, every one-liner and deadpan piece of dialogue is wonderfully entertaining. The Blues Brothers will have you laughing in delight from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Rohit Shetty keeping his usual trademarks intact makes his masterpiece, it would almost be like The Blues Brothers. I went in without knowing anything other than the fact that it was a cult favourite, and I was wondering whether I was wasting my valuable three hours (the movie is two hours and thirteen minutes long) for something that I would be disappointed with (musical and comedy not being my favourite genres). But it is awesome! The brothers who seemed okay in the beginning became awesome-r by each passing moment. It is a high energy musical comedy with crazy stuffs happening now and then and believe me, when I say that you have not seen the like of this one. Never had so much fun while watching a movie for a long time until The Blues Brothers. P.S. And if you like your blues and soul, then the movie has Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles and Cab Calloway to boast off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To date The Blues Brothers remains the only instance in which after watching a movie for the first time, I watched it again the very next day. Several viewings later I've come to the decision that The Blues Brothers is my favourite film comedy.The Blues Brothers is some of the most fun you'll ever have with a motion picture. Just one incredibly fun set piece after another, whether a car chase, a musical number or comedic showcase. Choosing a favourite moment? Now that's difficult. The portion of the film which has me in the most hysterical fit are the scenes at Bob's Country Bunker. Having a blues band with two lead singers who are as urban as it gets at a redneck bar in which everyone thinks they're the night's country music act, has me laughing just thinking about it, not to mention quite a stab at country music. As for the film's musical numbers, let's just say I bought the two disc movie soundtrack very soon after watching the film, which gave me a solid twelve months of continuous music listening pleasure.Of course there's the film's car chase. I haven't seen every famous movie car chase, but I would happily place a wager that there is no other car chase in the history of cinema better than this. I believe a truly great action sequence is one in which there's a sense of danger that someone can get hurt or even killed. Here I'm not only fearing for the fictional characters but also the real life cast and crew. The amount of cars involved and carnage that ensues is unprecedented; Grand Theft Auto years before Grant Theft Auto existed. With so many action movies featuring gargantuan levels destruction which means nothing and has no impact, they should take note from The Blues Brothers on how to make action sequences in which you can actually feel the weight and heft of everything from the screech of every tyre to the sirens of every police car whizzing past the screen.Does there exist a movie which has more reverence for its location? The only other movie which instantly pops into my mind is Rocky. For the best moment in the movie which captures the grit and grime of the city of Chicago is the scene on Maxwell street with John Lee Hooker playing cut to shots of stalls selling music and other artifacts; such a beautiful sequence.The movie's lack of logic only adds to its enjoyment. The very obvious plot hole in which The Good Ole Boys arrive hours late at the country bar with no explanation would likely downgrade most movies; here it just enhances the surreal world inhabited by the Blues Brothers. My favourite illogical moment is the Illinois Nazi's demise on the unfinished freeway; it makes no sense in the most wonderful way. The 80's was pretty much the decade for epic, large scale comedies such as The Blues Brothers. Only then could a film like this even get made.</fullReview>

They are on a mission from God. Meanwhile, a mysterious woman (Carrie Fisher) keeps trying to kill Jake.Dan Aykroyd and John Landis have created two iconic comedic characters. It's a whole lot of craziness. Landis basically throws everything into the movie. It mostly works. There are also great musicians involved. It is a bit too long. Over 2 hours is not a good running time for a comedy. It's hard to maintain the level of comedy for that long and some sections are less funny than needed. It needs some tightening to intensify the comedy.</fullReview>

This was John Landis' first great movie, in my opinion. Belushi and Aykroyd are wonderful. The supporting cast is first-rate. How about that car chase? Really makes today's CGI music video choreographed car stunts look like excrement. A fun movie made by people who clearly enjoy what they're doing.

		<shortDescription>Not my thing, but a fine comedy for those that appreciate its humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will preface this by saying that I'm really picky about comedies. I'm more of a sarcasm and black comedy kind of guy so I rarely encounter a comedy that I really like.That being said, this is a neat little film. Built around the personalities of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd and their sketch characters Jake and Elwood, it's a twisting and turning journey to save an orphanage that they both grew up in. On their trip they gather allies, make enemies, play some gorgeous music and generally get into trouble.So what works? Well, the music for one. Most of the musicians playing in Jake and Elwood's band are actual, real life jazz and blues musicians and you can believe that they can actually play. Heck, even Belushi and Aykroyd are actual musicians, so whenever a musical number starts, the movie instantly picks up in quality. Furthermore, the film has some good appreciation for physical humour, long and imaginative chase scenes and the rough Chicago style world of blues looks kind of fetching.Unfortunately it's meant to be a comedy and I never really found it all that funny. The main joke is supposed to be that Jake and Elwood are never really bothered by anything, and it... kind of works? If straight man humour is your thing, I'm sure you'll be laughing your ass off. If it's not, the movie falls flat pretty quickly. There's some enjoyment to be found in the action-oriented jokes and in the general blight of these two bums, but you have to find Jake and Elwood funny for you to enjoy this film.Still, it's a fine movie. The music is great, the general story is not bad, it's well acted and it looks good. Give it a chance and I'm sure you'll find something in it to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still irreverent, stylish, self-assured and riotously funny after all this time. Belushi and Aykroyd live and breathe the roles of Jake and Elwood, the buttoned-down, stern-faced suits who suddenly explode when the stage lights fire up, characters who seemed instantly destined to transcend the spectacle of their own story. Their plot is, really, embarrassingly simple - regroup the band, put on a big show, save the orphanage - but the strength of the brothers, the ad-lib mastery of their vessels and a staggering wealth of guest appearances mold it into a behemoth that's barely able to squeeze into a comfortable running time. It may seem random, zany and baffling at times, but it's impossible to look away and eventually everything comes together in a loud, reckless, picture-perfect finale. Viewed in a modern setting, it doubles as a fascinating glimpse at city life in the twilight of the 70s - especially when the boys lead pursuing police on a frenzied high-speed chase through the heart of a bustling shopping mall. Classic stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty damn funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 70's John Belushi and Dan Akroyd introduced the characters of Jake and Elwood Blues on the ever popular Saturday Night Live. In 1980 legendary director John Landis gave the characters their own feature length film. The Blues Brothers stars Belushi and Akroyd as Jake and Elwood, respectively, and it follows them as they attempt to put their old band back together in order to raise money to save the Catholic orphanage home where they were raised. Dubbing this quest a mission from God the two set out on a wacky and action packed adventure full of screwball situations and nut job characters. What ensues is a lot of fun.The Blues Brothers is one of those essential 80's comedies. It's worked its way to earning the status of a classic and so these days, no matter how you feel about comedies, it's just one of those that you have to see. It's also one of the very few successful films to be made out of SNL characters, and that's always a treat to watch, especially if you know the characters from the TV show. Seeing them come to life in a whole new way through the big screen is something really exciting to witness. And with characters as classic as Jake and Elwood Blues, played by their original actors, the ingenious Dan Akroyd and John Belushi, it had to have been a nostalgic experience for 1980 audiences.I didn't get as much of this, however. I know the characters for how iconic they are today and I've seen some of the Blues Brothers SNL skits, but I can't say this movie had the same effect for me as it would have had for audiences back in the day excited to see their favorite SNL characters put on the big screen.As far as this just being a good movie, it's funny and that's about it. I definitely enjoyed watching this flick, but it's not much more than just a silly over-the-top comedy. The only thing that makes it better than a lot of the other screwball comedies like it would be it's great actors and the legendary status behind the characters. All in all, The Blues Brothers is just a lot of hilarious wackiness with some crazy song and dance numbers thrown in throughout. It's a lot of fun in a weird, explosive, irreverent way.</fullReview>

He looked out his rear view mirror and saw a cop car hangin out of his 53' trailer. But he said he promised his wife to take her to an Evie concert. And if mama isn't happy,no one is happy. So,he just grabbed another gear and kept on going.Carrie Fisher,Aretha Franklin, Kathleen Freeman,Twiggy, the Soul Food Cafe dancers,the chick dancers at the Tripple Rock, and the chick dancers outside of Rays are hot!!!---One Truck Drivers Opinion---erldwgstruckermovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the kind of movie I like... but I like it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It makes no sense that I enjoy this movie. I don't like SNL, I don't like Belushi and Aykroyd, I don't like blues. My brother made me watch it shortly after it came out just because Murphy Dunne was in it and we had both really liked him in "The Big Bus"; to my surprise, I discovered that I really got into this movie! I run it again every so often for kicks... just last night, in fact. The whole subplot of getting the band back together is a lot of fun. The band members themselves are interesting characters... a couple of real stand-outs, like Dunne and Alan Rubin as Mr. Fabulous, but they're all good even though most of them don't have that many lines. The shot of the falling car is spectacular... this ain't CGI, folks. All in all, way outside the parameters of the type of film I like enough to watch over and over again, but for some reason it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Stands ALONE in ORIGINALITY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first having seen this at an important screening because I was connected to producers and was not that into all the mayhem and hoopla the film was getting and was not a big fan (personally)of John Belushi who I knew from having to be around him On The Rox above the Roxy when he was such a damned bore and I was not into his and Dan's Blues Brothers performances on SNL. In the 90's I began to see it again on big screens, TV and did a complete turnabout in my opinion of not only the film, but Belushi as a talent. I admit to discovering his musical prowess, his timing, his unique personality and HOW he worked with superb Dan Ackroyd, who is still one of the best actors and performers we have in film.Two more different "types" worked so beautifully together and made great music and moved better than any duo in film history. Besides reassessing Belushi---I still am not a big fan of his brother-- the actual film is one of the greatest casting masterpieces of a century of film in any category. I originally loved Aretha's "bit" which should be released as instructional tape on acting,dance and body movement. Her singing and the number just still steal the film......almost as much as the number in the church which is ATOMIC! The script went though changes and when I first thought of the film as a big waste of autos (pre CGI)and needless destruction.....now, I just laugh and love what Bernie Brillstein green lighted as the producer and give him most of the credit for the making of this hilarious concept and his using of Carrie Fisher,Gospel music, Kathleen Freeman, and dozens of actors who all contributed in special ways in cameos and part of the story line. This film should have a major re-release to show the new crop of film directors and students that originality can not be emphasized enough when making the predictable films of today. See it on the big screen with a good print.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hysterical Musical with Saturday Night Live at Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is a great movie with an ensemble cast consisting of comedic geniuses and blues and soul legends. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star as the delinquent, orphaned brothers Jake and Elwood Blues from a religious orphanage in Calumet City, Illinois. Upon Jake's release from prison he learns that Elwood traded the Bluesmobile for a microphone and their orphanage is going under. Hot on the trail of the two brothers is ace cop Burton Mercer (John Candy) who, in pursuit of the brothers gets a building collapsed on him and ends up with the loss of three orange whips. A traffic hold-up leads to the Blues Brothers crossing the Illinois Nazi Party, and thanks to a case of stolen identity, the band is also pursued by The Good Ol' Boys. The final (and possibly most dangerous of the brothers pursuers) is a Mystery Woman (Carrie Fischer) who has a death wish for Jake. The way the Blues Brothers decide to raise the money is to reassemble their old Blues-Rhythm and Revue band, the aptly named Blues Brothers Band that originated in the early days of Saturday Night Live. Along the hilarious route they meet and sing with such music greats as Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Ray Charles. Not only does this comedy remind us of the Not-Ready for Primetime Players, it combines in musical numbers so naturally that no one assumes the movie is a musical. The movie overall not only lives up to your expectations from writers like Aykroyd and John Landis, it exceeds them and makes you want to watch the movie multiple times. The Blues Brothers end up on the chase of a lifetime, but cannot be caught because "They're on a mission from God!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacky, and lots of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the Blues Brothers begins, you'd swear it was a drama. IT starts with a very slow Kurosawa type scene (wide shots, no music, hardly any dialogue). In this scene Jake Blues is getting out of the joint. His brother Elwood picks him up. The first place they go is to visit the orphanage where they grew up. It is going out of business, and so the two go on a quest to raise the money to save the place. First they have to reform their old band, and then find a gig, a very big gig.In addition to featuring some of the funniest people of the decade, We also have Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Ray Charles. We have lots of bottles getting thrown around, lots of glass getting smashed, rockets being launched, cars getting wrecked, and next thing you know half the US military is being sent out to take down a mere two nitwits, who are simply on a mission to do a good dead. This is an utterly goofy, and pretty darn lovable movie. Evern the music numbers are not too bad.The whole formula feels like Mel Brooks meets SNL, meets the soul/blues station. It's a little too mature to be a family comedy, (unless your youngest is over twelve). But it is a really fun film to watch, and has something to offer for (almost) everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully scored musical mayhem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two musicians attempt to get their old band back together in a mission from God to raise money for their Catholic home.Released almost 30 years ago now this John Landis musical extravaganza will make you laugh, sing along and enjoy the comedy capers of some cool collected characters.Opening with a disguised Joe Belushi being released from prison the film builds a slow and already joyous notion through John Landis' comic styling. The high angled shot of Jake Blues standing behind the yellow line and leaning over is great and when we finally see his face that adds a deft touch to our outlook of the film. His expressionless yet sophisticated notion bouncing off his brother's equally non-emotional face sets the film up for more comic demonstration.As the two drive off Jake is highly unimpressed with the new "Blues mobile" which encourages his brother Elwood to drive it over the uplifting bridge which in any action film this would get the blood pumping but in this case it will get the mouths moving as the two land, completely unfazed and talk about Jake's redemption and thus the story begins and the music roles.The pair must gather $5000 in a week in order to save their growing up residence, a catholic home where "the penguin" and Curtis place expectancy on the pair and from there, enjoyable mayhem ensues as they attempt to reform their band.This is an enjoyable feel good motive for a film that encodes religious iconography that does reasonable justice to the faith even if the eventual conclusion of the money earning plan is dealt with too quickly. The intentions of doing the right thing for the right reason are what have won this film over.Which, in a way, is quite humorous. For a story and a situation that should be serious this is frequently hilarious. From the pair abusing and robbing off pub owners to wrecking a shopping mall this has the right elements to create a feel good atmosphere and will have you chuckling away. Carrie Fisher's mysterious unnamed action woman is truly a comic treat but the brilliance of unfazed Blues Brothers gives this a finely articulate touch.What make this film so unique and special are its wonderful cameos from musical legends. Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Ray Charles are the main players and singers all wonderfully used to justify the means of their situations. From Brown's preacher to Franklin's lonely wife worker their fitting characters add an extra touch of realism and with such a wonderful music score their inclusions are arguably the strongest implementation.This has a few faults in that realism is unlikely following assassination attempts and the law restrictions for the cops wouldn't happen and the ending is perhaps too problematic and an injustice after everything but this is a cracking film, a true musical feel good appreciation of life and music</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a great comedy that stands the test of time in my opinion. It also has some of the best car chase scenes I have ever seen, even for a modern action movie... but this is an old comedy! Even those of you who (for some reason) don't like silly comedies will laugh at this movie. If you don't find this movie funny, then your sense of humor is waaaaaay too narrow.This movie is takes some funny situations, then takes it totally over the top into the land of the ridiculous... yet the actors all do a great job of remaining serious about it.Oh yeah, and the music is great! But you don't even have to like the individual songs to enjoy the music, since it's all in good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and exciting although a little repetitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is a movie I have watched numerous times. It is really funny and the car chases are excellent. The only problem is that its a little repetitive (when everyone just suddenly starts dancing). Other than that this movie is great.The highlight of this movie is the car chases. They are done excellently and I think they are some of the best car chases ever made.The movie is about two brothers ,Jake and Elwood, - The "Blues Brothers" who are musicians. The movie starts with one of the brothers, Jake, being released from prison. They visit the nun, who raised them as kids in a Catholic orphanage, and she tells them that they need $5000 to be able to keep the place running. Jake and Elwood decide that getting the band back together would be the best way to get the $5000. They go finding the original members of the band and convince them to rejoin the band. After they get all the members back they start playing. After playing at "Bobs Country Bunker" they go and play at the "Palace Hotel". Along the way they end up making numerous enemies (the police, the "Good 'ol Boys", the American Nazi party, and Jake's ex girlfriend. This results in numerous hilarious car chases. They end up getting the money and giving it to the Orphanage - but then they get arrested and go to prison (they play music there though, so its a happy ending).This is an excellent musical comedy - and I definitely recommend you to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Musical, Not an Action, It's Big Farce !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comic Scene + Song + Action Scene, again and again. That's the candid formula here. There is no much of a plot. It is just nice elements have been played repeatedly and absurdly. The structure of the movie is so easy. The 2 leads are on a mission from god to collect certain sum of money to rescue the Catholic home by reuniting their old music Band. Yes, comedy is about exaggeration, and yes, cinema (great deal of it) is about action. But I do believe that big part of the glamour, any glamour, comes firstly from the script which was here a farce itself. Actually the 2 leads made enemies so simply (simpler than Tom &amp; Jerry's legacy !), having the most unrelated songs to the story; some of the songs (if not all !) got nothing to do with the events so they were against the flow of the movie's rhythm. To be kind of dull comedy, or sure an anarchic musical. The dancing numbers (with Ray Charles, and Aretha Franklin singing) were pathetic. The big, very showy, action at the end is too good to be true yet stands alone, like a huge ending for another movie. It catches up with the boom of the car long chases at that period (Post-Smokey and the Bandit ? 1977). Though it's not an action also, it just utilized elements of it to form a cinematic comedy mood. (John Landis), who directed (Animal House) 2 years ago, enjoys with showing us how to play a slight script with craze, using comedians, iconic singers, and big cadres to hide any defects in it. It's just a show, like the most cinematic TV variety show with explosive action and big production. So despite the fact that it's nearly disassembled, it managed to be fun, and not quite a la' (Animal House)'s fun.The John Belushi radiation is highly dangerous; he can own the screen by doing nothing. Some small touches and gags were memorable. I loved the first sequence where (Joliet) is going out of the jail in holy moment-like, (Belushi) and (Aykroyd) come out of the hotel's debris dusting down their suits indifferently, the end's blowing up and clever chases. Let alone singing the finale song by all the movie's great singers in one last photomontage. The really funny appearances of (Carrie Fisher) as the mad obscure sniper who hunts the 2 leads with machine guns, bombs, and rockets is very much summarizing the spirit of the whole matter (childish, explosive, jest). As for the songs (Theme From Rawhide), and (Minnie The Moocher) were the most entertaining episodes; like paying 2 separated regards during the "show" to the old TV, and the old Jazz too. I don't think that (Joliet) and (Elwood) song at the end was that good to earn all of that success, but maybe it's in the way they performed it. So this movie itself. It proved how a movie can make a big bubble out of small gum, and be dazzling as well. In another dimension that could've flopped hard. It happened already when they repeated the same formula 18 years later at (Blues Brothers 2000) without Belushi, the sudden impact, and in lower action too (How Dare Them ?!). Simply they disrobed it from what hides its own imperfections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twist it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my recent weekly DVD hire, got out a few oldies including this "classic"."The Blues Brothers" is a movie about two brothers, Jake (Belushi) and Elwood (Akroyd), who besides having the unlikely surname of Blues, are part of a killer band. The movie picks up with Jake being released from prison after a 3yr stint and being reunited with Elwood. On the trip home they drop in to see their old Catholic nun who looked after them at the orphanage. She tells them of the pending closure of the home unless they can come up with 5 large. The brothers take this as if they have been given a mission by God to reform the band, do some gigs and come up with $5000. Over the next hour they seek out the old band members, some keener than other to reform. During the hunt we are treated to some great cameos from some other the legends of soul, including Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker and most notable Ray Charles with his brilliant performance of "Shake A Tailfeather". They then manage to book a big theatre for a huge show they hope will raise the money. Will it work? See it to find out.More a movie of some great scenes and cameos, but pretty patchy in spots. Belushi and Akroyd were pretty unaccomplished actors going into this and the movie heavily relies on gimmicks eg car chases than their acting prowess. Decent and holds up OK for a nearly 30yr movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many things to like about The Blues Brothers.One of those is John Belushi,one of the funniest individuals who ever lived.His movie work never quite surpassed his work on SNL,but never ceased to be funny.Who would have thought at the time that we would lose him so soon?Secondly,the chemistry between Belushi and Dan Aykroyd was incredible,which was evident on SNL,so we knew what to expect going in and knew we would not be let down,particularly since they introduced these very characters to us on the show.Also,strategically placed music stars in various roles throughout the film add to it's appeal,They were all great,but my personal favorite was Ray Charles as the store owner,who although blind,always seemed to know when he was about to be ripped off.The film moves along slowly,picking up lightning speed in various places,which also adds to the appeal.The car chase scene in the shopping mall is one of my all time favorite movie scenes.It's a classic.It's comedy so good that not even it's sequel could measure up.Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Arrest Driver . . . Impound Vehicle"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when you combine hilarious comedy, great music, wild vehicular stunts/crashes, and an all-star cast? It means that the fabulous Blues Brothers are in action! Written by Dan Aykroyd &amp; John Landis, and directed by the latter, "The Blues Brothers" was a successful attempt at transferring a Saturday Night Live skit into a theatrical motion picture. The plot of this extraordinarily funny movie, with many memorable lines, involves brothers Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) and Joliet Jake Blues (John Belushi), who just keep on running afoul of the law as they reassemble the members of their rhythm &amp; blues band in order to earn some decent money. (If you haven't yet seen "The Blues Brothers", DON'T read the rest of this commentary!)Here are my favorite highlights from this classic action musical comedy. Jake and Elwood are hilarious as they keep swearing at the nun (Kathleen Freeman) and receive a good share of smacks. The action-packed police car chase inside the shopping mall is equally hilarious. Aretha Franklin as the soul food caf owner gets a chance to show some spunk in this film (prior to her much-too-long feature number "Think"). As the police &amp; the Good Ole Boys chase the Blues Brothers away from the Palace Hotel, the lead singer/driver for the Boys (Charles Napier) realizes that Elwood secretly epoxied the gas pedal on the Boys' vehicle, so the Good Ole Boys unintentionally "go for a swim". While hordes and hordes of police officers, soldiers, and S.W.A.T. teams pursue the Blues Brothers (so overwhelming it's ridiculously funny), Elwood and Jake quietly hang out inside an elevator listening to a laughable Muzak version of "The Girl from Ipanema". Ray Charles (owner of Ray's Music Exchange) and the Blues Brothers Band do a fine performance of "Shake Your Tailfeather". At Bob's Country Bunker ("Chicken wire?"), the Blues Brothers Band applies some quick thinking to satisfy the restless patrons ("That ain't no Hank Williams song!") and offers a nice rendition of "Stand by Your Man". At the Palace Hotel Ballroom, Curtis (Cab Calloway, aka "Mr. Hi-De-Hi-De-Ho") performs a swinging "Minnie the Moocher", and the Blues Brothers do my favorite version of "Sweet Home Chicago". And finally, at the Triple Rock Baptist Church, the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown) leads the congregation in a lively, unrealistically boisterous song titled "That Old Landmark".That's about all I can write about "The Blues Brothers"; so spectacular and enjoyable is this musical comedy from 1980. All of the actors, stunt people, and crew did a hell of a fine job with all their hard work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it For the Music!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie is not very funny in terms of goofy hilarity or wicked puns or punchlines, it makes up for it with excellent music. The Blues Brothers, originally just a comedy act on the original "Saturday Night Live", had evolved into a genuine musical act that focused on performing soul standards and rhythm and blues. This movie showcases not only The Blues Brothers' talents, but those of a veritable "who's who" of soul, R&amp;B, and jazz music. Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, and James Brown make the most of their cameo appearances, and entertain us with some of their classic hits. This is one of the best musical movies I've seen, because it features such a wonderful variety of American pop music. The background music is also excellent, and includes standards from Sam and Dave, Fats Domino, and Wilson Pickett.The music greatly helps in evoking the setting of the film, which is Chicago. Visual effects and sets are also a great help. The movie presents the Windy City in all of its gritty glory, from the grimy streets below the massive el-train trestles to the opening shot showing the billowing smoke from factories and flames shooting out of the chimneys of oil refineries. We also are shown images of plump Vienna sausage grilling on the stove in a soul food restaurant and the hustle and bustle of the city center. Clearly, the cinematographers did an excellent job in presenting their vision of a city that is one of the centers of R&amp;B music.As for the massive car chases, they are indeed eye-popping and entertaining. The movie snowballs into hyperbole in the chase scenes that it almost seems credible. The special effects and vast array of extras to serve as national guard soldiers and policemen ensure that this movie certainly earns a reputation as a comedy epic, akin to "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World." As for the acting, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd hold their own as Jake and Elwood Blues, respectively. They're not laugh-out-loud funny most of the time, but they do their best to at least be consistently amusing and entertaining as the they're trying to reform their band, or are avoiding capture from an assortment of enemies. To their credit, they hold this movie solidly.John Landis did an excellent job at creating a movie that is both epic comedy and soul music musical. While the film ended up in the red when it premiered, time has been kind to this classic, and it will no doubt introduce a future generation to classic soul music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild and extremely interesting musical comedy based on the SNL skit where two brothers: Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) go out on the streets of Chicago to reunite their band in order to raise money to keep the orphanage (where the two men grew up) in business within two weeks.Throughout their quest, the brothers have to deal with what seems like an endless slew of obstacles (cops, Nazis, etc.) that stand in their way. The script, written by Aykroyd and director John Landis ("Animal House") never fails in delivering one hilarious moment right after another whether it's a sight gag or a one-liner. Even the songs (if you enjoy music especially jazz, blues, or both), some of which are performed by Elwood and Jake and/or legends such as James Brown, Cab Calloway, John Lee Hooker, and Aretha Fanklin are just as entertaining as the film itself.Belushi and Aykroyd are both wonderful yet unflappable in the lead roles and I still can't make up my mind in which who was better here."The Blues Brothers" is wildly entertaining and never misses a beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long live Jake and Elwood Blues ... A comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is, in a word, excessive. Director John Landis intended it that way. During a police chase he piles up not one or two cars but dozens.Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were born for their roles as Jake and Elwood Blues and they are so ridiculous but seem so real, as if these two jokers could actually exist. To raise money for an orphanage, they set out to re-form their blues band for one big concert. In the process they run into Ray Charles as a pawn shop owner who does a song, James Brown as a preacher in an hysterical church scene, and Aretha Franklin as the owner of a greasy spoon who also does a song.Not to mention running into nutty Nazis, the entire Cook County sheriff's department, and tiny Carrie Fisher who fires everything from an assault rifle to a bazooka at hapless Belushi.Forget the French Connection for a car chase. The Blues Brothers has one of the greatest car chases ever filmed as the state troopers chase Jake and Elwood through a shopping mall.I can't forget to mention the famous scene in the country/western bar which is part of comedy screen legend.Look for Steven Spielberg, John Landis, John Candy, Twiggy, Frank Oz, Paul Reubens, John Lee Hooker, Joe Walsh, and Steve Lawrence in cameos.This film is a comedy classic with soul music and the unforgettable Jake and Elwood, two of the greatest comedic characters ever created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, Jake Blues finally paid his debt to society and was released from prison. His brother, Elwood Blues, picks him up in the new car he had acquired: a '74 Dodge police cruiser. Jake and Elwood stop at the Catholic orphanage, their old stomping grounds, and learn from the Mother Superior that the orphanage is $5,000 in the hole and unless they can come up with the money, it will be sold and condemned. The Blues brothers wish to help. They next visit Revered Cleophus James' church, and suddenly, Jake had an epiphany, as if from Above. An easy way to raise the money: get the band back together and play a concert. On the way home, Elwood was speeding so the police pull them over. It seems Elwood had hundreds of outstanding warrants so when the police attempt to arrest him, he floored it and tore away from the cops, who give chase. The Blues brothers turn into a parking lot, trying to elude the cops. Next they crash through the Toys 'R Us and drive right through the mall. The police come to a crashing halt. Next, Elwood and Jake retire to Elwood's cramped Chicago apartment for the night. All the while, they were being followed by a mysterious woman with a short fuse: Camille. She had it out for Jake. Badly. She blew up the apartment building in an attempt to kill him. Fortunately Elwood and Jake survive and they head out the next day to reunite the old band.Today, some hated Illinois Nazis were holding a conference, right when the Blues Brothers drove right through it, knocking the fascists into the water. The Head Nazi vowed serious vengeance; It wasn't easy reuniting the old band as most of them had straight careers now. "Blue Lou" Marini and Matt "Guitar" Murphy operated the neighborhood diner, and Tom "Bones" Malone ran a fancy restaurant. But, with much persuasion, they managed to get back the band, including Donald "Duck" Dunn, Murph, and Willie "Too Big" Hall. They buy some instruments and head to their first gig. Only problem: they really didn't have a gig. They stop at Bob's Country Bunker and swindle the manager into thinking THEY were the headlined band: The Good Ole Boys. A blues band trying to play country isn't pretty, but they manage to pull it off. But then the real Good Ole Boys show up, and, Jake and Elwood owe $300 for beer. But by then the Blues brothers had made a clean get away; Next, they visit Jake's booking agent, Maury Sline, who get's them a major gig at the Palace Hotel. Right away they spread the word and in no time at all, it's a full theater. Full of both friends AND foe, including armed and dangerous cops and Good Ole Boys. After the concert, a record producer offers $10,000 to Jake and Elwood for the rights to record their songs. They keep $5,000 and slip out, avoiding the angry mob; En route to the Bluesmobile, they run into Camille again, who apparently was an old flame of Jake's, whom he had jilted. Jake begs and pleads to be spared. Camille took pity. They kiss. He runs. She tries to shoot him. They escape. The Good Ole Boys and Bob give chase, but they can't seem to hit the brakes and go zooming right into the lake. The Blues brothers zoom down the highway towards Chicago with an entire police force on their tail. More and more squads join the pursuit until every trooper in the state of Illinois was after them. The Illinois Nazis were also on their tail. Jake and Elwood manage to elude the cops, by causing a massive police car pile-up. The Nazis chase the Blues brothers onto an unfinished freeway and well, they didn't hit the brakes in time and when soaring off into the air. They fall 2,000 feet and crash into the street; Finally arriving at the Cook Country Assessor's Office, Jake and Elwood ditch their car, which falls apart after all that, and race upstairs. By then, the entire police force, as well as the army, the SWAT team and the National Guard arrive. Meanwhile, Elwood and Jake jam the elevators so they couldn't be followed and finally deliver the money to the Cook Country Assessors. Just then, the police, who took the stairs, capture and incarcerate Elwood and Jake and sent to the maximum security ward at Joliet Correctional where they put on concerts for the inmates. The Blues Brothers is a hysterical musical comedy. Saturday Night Live's own Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi are a smash as Elwood and Jake Blues. Unfortunately John Belushi passed away in 1982 because he chose drugs over life. Also in the cast, Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, Kathleen Freeman, John Candy (who is also no longer with us), and famous musicians like: James Brown, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and Twiggy. If Louis Prima were still around, they'd have used him too. I guess they didn't have room for Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Wayne Newton? Watch for Muppetier Frank Oz as the Joliet Correctional clerk and, ironically, in the Toys 'R Us scene someone is buying a Grover Monster doll, whom Frank Oz performs as on Sesame Street, as well as Miss Piggy! And, watch for a young Steven Spielberg as the Cook Country Assessor clerk! This movie is based on skits Aykroyd and Belushi did on SNL. There was a sequel in 1998, Blues Brothers 2000. Ayrkroyd returned as Elwood. John Goodman was in it. Anyway, if you like John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, then The Blues Brothers is for you. It's got excellent car chases and car crashes, action, comedy and music up the wazoo! See it today! I recommend The Blues Brothers.-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Them Blues Boys Just Won't Crack a Smile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I see TBB's, it's apparent that white folks just shouldn't try to do R&amp;B. We just "pale" by comparison to what black folks can do (pun intended). Against the fine musical performances here from Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, ARETHA Franklin and James Brown, the white people just "can't jump." But, it's a fun, fun movie anyway! Fun for the whole family. Our kids still love this pic, especially the dancin' in the streets while Brother Ray plays &amp; sings...they try to mimic every dancer in that scene, so have worn out 2 VHS tapes. Praise be for DVD! We also love the scenes with cigarette-smoking Princess Leia trying to blast The Blues Boys off the face of the earth...our girls try to warn Jake &amp; Elwood to look out for the maniac murder-woman, but they never hear and she gets her shots in, just like always. Probably the most fun for me is the constant deadpan dialog delivery and mannerisms from Belushi and Ackroyd - I don't think they ever crack even a small grin. Of course, neither does anyone else, except for the late, great John Candy. And so many fun small parts played by surprise actors: Twiggy, Henry Gibson, Cha-Cha-Cha-Chaka Khan, Kathleen Freeman (with her Avenging Ruler) and John Lee Hooker! Fantastic music, a couple of really good chase scenes, plus a happy ending. Who could ask for anything more?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Blues Brothers" is one of the great American comedies. This level of hilarity can never be captured again.The movie begins with Jake Blues (John Belushi) getting released from prison and the corrections officer (Frank Oz) gives him back his trademark hat and sunglasses. His brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) picks him up in the new Bluesmobile--an old police car. They go to visit Mother Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman) who owns an orphanage in downtown Chicago. She tells them that because she cannot pay the taxes, the orphanage will be closed. The Blues Brothers are heartbroken because they grew up in the orphanage. Their friend Curtis (Cab Calloway) encourages them to get the old Blues Brothers Band back together. The Blues Brothers are on a "mission from God" to save the orphanage. Jake and Elwood scour the state of Illinois to look for them all and the finally get them all back together. On the way, they are pursued by a mystery assassin woman (Carrie Fisher), the Illinois State Police (including John Candy), and the Illinois Nazis (including Henry Gibson). Despite all this, they manage to get a gig at Bob's Country Bunker (run by Jeff Morris) posing as the Good IL' Boys. After they are done playing, the real Good IL' Boys show up. Bob realizes the Blues Brothers have tricked him and he and the Good IL' Boys join the chase against the Blues Brothers. The Blues Brothers decide to hold a concert to raise money. It works and the concert is a success. Some uninvited guests are the police, the Nazis, and the Good IL' Boys. During the concert, the Blues Brothers escape from the concert hall and go through the sewers. Down there, the mystery woman meets up with them and tries to kill them again. She reveals herself as Jake's ex-bride-to-be. He left her standing at the altar. Jake confesses his wrongs and she forgives him. The Brothers remember the police and leave her down there while they escape. They lead a high-speed car chase through downtown Chicago to get the money to the County Clerk's Office. Once there, the clerk (Steven Spielberg) accepts the payment and the orphanage is saved. The Blues Brothers and the band go to jail, though.All in all, a great movie. With special musical performances by James Brown ("This Old Landmark"), Cab Calloway ("Minnie the Moocher"), Ray Charles ("Shake a Tail Feather"), Aretha Franklin ("Think"), and John Lee Hooker ("Boom Boom"), this film is a true classic. Also features the Blues Broths Band singing the theme from "Rawhide"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome! Full of relevant political and social commentary. Not a single scene is wasted. Brimming with talent and excellent performances. Mirrors the USA in the 70's in an artful and adroit manner. A real piece of Americana, truly a classic. An example of the early musicals reborn with incredible performances from Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway - and of course Jake &amp; Elwood Blues... Correography is done a la Hollywood with spikes of Motor City, the sixties, and some very good Belushi. This is definitely a low budget flick. I can only imagine how many corners they cut to make this, but brilliant performances from the actors - Belushi &amp; Akroyd - make this movie really shine. I give it an 11 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as frenetic as Animal House, The Blues Brothers is funny the way Texas Chainsaw Massacre is scary. It's an out-of-control comedy, you really never know when the next laugh will happen or how it will. It's a little scary, just not expecting it. It's full of hilarious moments that are just thrown away as quickly as they happen, but the plot is ingenious. They simply want to save their orphanage, like good little Catholic boys, and run amok of all society to do so. Every second of this movie is unique in its own way.John Landis might be one of the most brilliant paced directors of all time. I'll always love the tip of the sunglasses to John Candy way up in the crowd. His character is meaningless to a plot, but essential to the film. And who couldn't love the 20 car pile up? That's what I'm talking about. Best line isn't even that funny compared to others but it perfectly sets up the next hilarious 20 minutes; "The use of unnecessary violence in the apprehension of the Blues Brothers...has been approved." Spoken by a dispatcher to the Chicago Police Dept. When you hear that, you wait for all hell to break loose on film, and it does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I'm not a particularly big fan of the Blues in general. I tend to swing more to the jazz angle, high-octane funk, bodypoppin' around in the midnight hour, you get the gig (if you don't my lexis gets steadily more contrived so I strongly suggest you abort reading this if you're one of those people who get easily confused or who are terminally incredulous).However, this film spun my head round the full three-hundred-and-sixty. Okay, it was two in the morning and I was still in my tracksuit bottoms drinking a famous brand of soft drink, but I cannot find enough words to convey exactly how great I felt watching messrs Akroyd and Belushi bumble around, narking people off one by one, one the way experiencing some impromptu musical numbers from giants amongst giants - Charles, Franklin, Brown and Calloway heading the star-filled roster. And there's an appearance (albeit a brief one) from the massively underrated (at least in my neck of the woods) genius that was John Candy (God rest his soul).The humour is irreverent and impromptu - right from the murder attempts of Jake Blues' mysterious ex-squeeze (Carrie Fisher) through to the Blues band's rendition of the theme from Rawhide, both the gags and the uncannily catchy soundtrack will bring the soul that lurks even within the most disgruntled of us alive and kicking like nobody's business.One of cinema's underrated greats - make it your ambition to see this at least once before your number's up.The Doomsday Octopus deems this film "Blistering"! With a score of 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolute classic, the likes of which we will never see again. It was a magic combination of two actors, Belushi and Aykroyd, hitting their creative peaks at a time when they could get away with just about anything due to their rising star power. The spirit of this film can never be recreated (see Blues Brothers 2000 for proof).This was the first film to destroy a mall in a high speed pursuit. And never again will a film run a 100 car chase scene through downtown Chicago, the underground Lower Wacker Drive, and under the El tracks.The music is heavily featured and joyfully celebrates blues, gospel, and classic R &amp; B.And, the "cool" factor runs high, with Jake &amp; Elwood wearing their trademark black suits, hats, and Ray Bans for (virtually) the entire film, while spouting classic lines like "It's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses." Writer Aykroyd's love for the music and mayhem are apparent and this film, even after 25 years, still stands up as well as it did in 1980.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We're on a mission from God." -- Elwood Blues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie that has a miasma of music, comedy, and car crashes. It is almost obscene how many times I have seen this film -- while the amount of times I have seen Star Wars is obscene. The Blues Brothers went way over budget with its vast destructiveness and cool cameos. Its exuberance is what helped this movie become a pop-cult classic and it would be John Belushi's last box-office hit. It is one of the first movies based on a Saturday Night Live and still, along with Wayne's World, one of the best.The Blues Brothers are Elwood and Jake Blues, two brothers who just reunited after Jake's incarnation in Juliet. They visit an old orphanage of theirs that is in desperate need of money. The orphanage needs 5,000 dollars or it will be forced to close. Now Elwood and Jake can collect the money through dirty deeds, however they have an epiphany instead. During a James Brown sermon, a beam of light begets an idea -- the band. They need to hunt down their former band members and put the band back together. It has to work; they are on a mission from God.This film has two spectacular and unbelievable car-chase scenes. They rank with Bullitt, The French Connection, and To Live and Die in L.A. as among the best filmed automotive-chase sequences. The first pursuit involves the Blues Brothers avoiding the 'rollers' by driving in a mall. The amount of destruction by the brothers, while spouting irreverent quips and the pursuant police is overwhelming, but fun to watch. They crash through stores, run over merchandise stands, avoid the mall-walkers, and create utter chaos. The second memorable chase involves the destruction of many cars. It is a long awesome sequence, that I will not spoil here, that was very costly and went over the expected budget for this film.At the very heart of this comedy is the music. This film is essentially a blues musical. There are performances from James Brown, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, and many more. These entertainers also act in this film with varying degrees of success. Belushi and Ackroyd also perform several blues and country songs in this film. As amateurs, they are good. Belushi has a raspy singing voice, while Ackroyd has a baritone/bass quality to his voice. However, they still cannot compare to Charles proving the vitality of a piano or James Brown serving a sermon.This is also a very funny film. Belushi had tremendous talents as a comedic actor and Ackroyd works very well here. One of the funniest scenes involves them trying to persuade their former horn player, who now works at a French restaurant, to come back to the band. Their antics amongst themselves horrify the bourgeois patrons as they guzzle food down, throw it at each other, and ask people if they are willing to sell their women. Also, look for a quick cameo in this scene by Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman).Comedy is very subjective. However, it is hard to find too many people that do not like this film. It was even on a few critics top ten lists for 1980, i.e. Gene Siskel and Belushi's second box office hit (Animal House was his first). This film offers so much: music, comedy, and action. It is one of my favorite comedies and I have seen it at least twenty-five times. The 'R' rating is a bit misleading. It is there for the colorful and metaphorical language. If you have any inkling for blues and comedy then watch this film. If not, watch it anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have seen this film 10 or so times. I'm not one for watching films over and over but the 'Blues Brothers' is intoxicating. Cameos from superstars of soul and blues are simply the backbone to this hilarious yet 'tasteful' extravaganza. With the world's best car chase scene (forget 'Bullitt' - who needs McQueen when you have Belushi and Ackroyd) and the most unforgiving Chicago Police Force (par John Candy), this is a must see. Oh and the music is pretty good also. &gt; &gt; &gt; N.B: For those who have seen it, do NOT base the 'Blues Brothers' on 'Blues Brothers 2000'. The two are very different - no Belushi. No Belushi, no dough. &gt; &gt; &gt;</fullReview>

Not to be dismissed as just another SNL Belishi- Aykroyd movie, to their credit, they have created a movie that provides a veritable shrine to the Chicago blues tradition.

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A staple of American movie history, the Blues Brothers is one of, if not the, best movie ever. Its kind of hard to describe what makes this musical comedy so awesome, but as soon as you find out that they're on a "Mission from God", you know you're in for a wild ride.It all begins with Jake Blues (John Belushi) being released from prison and meeting up with his brother, Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd). After a rousing church scene with James Brown, Jake "sees the light" and learns that they must put the band together to get money to save the orphanage that they grew up it. It keeps getting better from there, with guest appearances by Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin, just to name a few, and a bunch of great musical numbers by the Blues Brothers band, too. The movie has a lot of funny moments, from the part in the beginning with Frank Oz (I was laughing out loud for 5 straight minutes), to the part with the Illinois Nazis chasing the Blues Brothers ("Ive always loved you"...hahaha), this movie will keep you in a good mood through the entire 2 hours of blues goodness. The movie is finished up with an awesome car chase, which still has the record for the most cars wrecked in a single movie.All in all, it would be a crime to pass up on this great movie, and, with the 25th Anniversary Edition DVD coming out soon (Dan Aykroyd confirmed in an interview, see it on bluesbrotherscentral.com), no-one should miss this classic movie.</fullReview>

Jake and Elwood are being followed by the nazis and almost go over the bridge, but they go into reverse and the car sort of bounces... and then you see the car FLYING through the air, over the nazis. Oh God, it's hysterical. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you'd best go watch that part of the movie RIGHT NOW.

Written by Dan Aykroyd, it has everything from the world record for most vehicles destroyed in a movie filming to really memorable HILARIOUS lines to great music. Belushi is his crazy-self throughout the entire film until the point in the sewer (see it if you don't know). That's such a classic John Belushi moment. The only thing that could have made this movie better would be even more albums to go along with it besides the few that the two recorded before John's death.

		<shortDescription>The perfect musical... or darn close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of musicals. Of the 60 or 70 movies I currently have on DVD, only a dozen or so are musicals. But, as a child of the 50s, I'm a big fan of the music that fills this movie.And how it fills it! Dan Aykroyd's script specifies nearly continuous music: either it's coming out of the 8 track tape in the Bluesmobile, or it's being sung by a who's who of blues-rock.A loose plot is quickly thrown together: the boys need to raise some money to save the orphanage where they grew up.To do this, Jake and Elwood go on an unusual two part road trip. The first has them rounding up the scattered members of the band and the last part is a frantic chase back to Chicago to pay the tax money. (Watch for Steven Spielberg as the tax agent)Both parts are enjoyable in their own way: the first half has them encountering John Lee Hooker, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. And the chase scene effectively parodies movies made many years after this one. A neat trick, indeed.But through it all, the music. This makes the DVD one of those (like "Woodstock" or "HAIR") that I might put on just to listen to while I work at the computer.Oh yeah, the DVD version has a few extra minutes running time over the version that had the widest release. Nine stars, just for the music. The fact that the movie itself is a whole lot of fun is just gravy. One of my faves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler warning. This is how a comedy should be made, based on the very great happenings and characters. A lots of funny situations in this movie and with a big budget, this movie easily makes it all very entertaining in one-two-three! The highlights are many; although the two biggest are the energy-bomb in the church with the black folks and the WEST SIDE STORY look when playing with Ray Charles in a music store. The movie plays on the so very right chords to make it all good, the Blues Brothers being a couple of cool guys who really get themselves into trouble, and the movie is also packed with weird characters like the wannabe-assassin woman, or the weird Nazis, and what about John Candy making pilot sunglasses even look small! THE BLUES BROTHERS is a terrific movie that keeps it up with the audience, and keeps delivering the goods in a tight and strict order. Belushi and Aykroyd are truly fabulous in their roles, wearing sunglasses and suits. And the movie always swings, there's always some kind of swingin' music rolling in the background, this making the whole mood very light and fine.It's a very good comedy, no doubt! James Brown being the Priest that makes the whole church explode into one big crazy circus and when Belushi sees the light, it all even gets more insane. Aretha Franklin playing in it too, and Ray Charles! There's dozens of known actors here, and that just adds the whole genuine part of it. The great climaxe that's truly a budget bomb with military, cops, MP's, guns, cars and everything just pushed together into a long car chase, all off course chasing the Blues Brothers. It's an absolutely highlight in the history of comedy making! STARS: 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cult classic that will never get old, who could forget the great songs and performances by Jake and Elwood and The Blues Brothers Band? While the movie is pretty-much just an excuse to play some music, it's all put together so well that the simple plot becomes a brilliant one. The cameos are wonderful and very witty; Frank Oz as the sarcastic prison warden and Steven Spielberg as the bewildered county clerk. John Candy and Henry Gibson are excellent in their supporting roles, not to mention the fabulous interludes by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and James Brown!This film is probably best-known for its outrageous action sequences, particularly the Nazi car flying off the overpass and the police pile-up in Chicago. The mall chase scene is probably one of my favourite pieces of motion picture ever. The humour associated with Carrie Fisher's assaults is also to die for - "Who IS that girl?", "It's nine o'clock - we gotta go to work" and "There must be at least seven dollars worth of change here" are some of the best lines in the film. Can't really say much that hasn't already been said, but if you haven't seen the film, make sure you do, and if you have, then watch it again! Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice blend of comedy and music...and it's from Saturday Night Live too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colored me shocked when I found out that this excellent musical comedy came from a former player of Saturday Night Live. As we all know anything that comes from their sketches and make it to the big screen are less then stellar (of course its for the fans of the show.)Plot: Elwood Blues and Joliet Jake are two former musicians trying to lead a straight life after numerous illegal incidents in the past when they were traveling with their band. After Jake makes parole (Elwood is already out), the two head to their former orphanage for a visit only to find out its in danger of being shut down with only eleven days to get the money. Not wanting to lose the only home they've known and after getting a inspiration from visiting a local church. The two set out to reunite their old band and raise the money. But a simple red light running gets the cops right back on their tail. Pretty soon modern day Nazi, an angry country band, the mod and the whole police force of Chicago is gunning for them. Oh, did I mention a former fiance is trying to kill Jake for running out on her at their wedding.Like I said, the movie is just a full out musical trip with such a hilarious story to boot. Nothing is taken seriously here from the inspiration at the church to coming together of the band. The road trip to the concert and the concert itself to the final climax that is one of the best car chases in film history. All thanks to the various talent that made the movie such a joy to watch (some of which are no longer with us, R.I.P).Their were a few flaws, the running gag where of Jake's fiance countless attempts to kill him and his brother go a little thin and you have to a have a suspension of belief to watch it, especially during the final moments. Still there's more good then bad here. Overall, if your a fan of musical, comedy or road trip films in general. Do a favor to yourself and check out one of the most underrated musicals out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the top 100, 150, 200 lists I read on this board, no-one has included this classic piece of humour. Great cast, and music of the highest quality, this is one of the few musicals I can stand. ?Classics' like Singing in the Rain, and that one about children running about on hills, etc, all seem so out of place with reality, and I find them completely absurd. Sure they have good acting, music and so on, but, well, they're just horrible. Fine, The Blues Brothers isn't exactly in touch with reality, but it understands that it is not trying to be serious, or making some statement that only 1% of the viewers will grasp. It's about car chases; it's about the Blues, man. Almost every scene in this is memorable for whatever reason, and it should be appreciated much more than it seems to be on these boards. Wonderfully non-conformist. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one hell of a good film, even if you don't like music. It has everything: car chase sequences that even include the Natzi party as well as the police; great actors like Dan Ankroyd and John Landis; great guest appearances by fantastic musicians like Ray Charles, James Brown and Cab Calloway (who sings "Minnie the Moocher", a real showstopper"). The film also has some great lines that are legends, in my opinion, in the history of great film lines ("We're on a mission from God") not to mention a long line of fabulous songs such as the one I mentioned before "Minnie the Moocher" and a great rendition of "Shake those tailfeathers" by Ray Charles. Do not let the pathetic sequel "Blues Brothers 2000" put you off this film, it's a classic, and it's a real shame that films like this are so rarely made. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the funniest film John Belushi made in his all-too-short career, The Blues Brothers builds on an old Saturday Night Live skit to send Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues on a riotous tour of Chicago to collect $5,000 to pay the taxes on the orphanage where they grew up. Along the way, they gather up their old bandmates from their day jobs, buy their instruments (on credit, of course), play their first gig at a redneck joint behind a chicken-wired stage ("Oh, we have both kinds: country AND western."), trash a shopping mall, incur the wrath of a group of Illinois Nazis ("I hate Illinois Nazis."), and lead the police force of what seems the entire state of Illinois on a mad chase through Chicago and the immediate vicinity.From the opening sequence where Jake Blues is released from Joliet Federal Penitentiary to the closing car-chase, this picture will keep you in stitches. The soundtrack kills, showcasing a who's who of blues performers from John Lee Hooker to Cab Calloway to Aretha Franklin. The Band rocks in their performance bits; and, yes, these are actual musicians, most of them top session-men of the day. Look for cameos from such stars as Frank Oz ("One unused prophylactic. One soiled."), Steve Lawrence, and a very young Steven Spielberg. You'll be quoting lines from this picture forever.If your video store has it, buy the extended version with the footage that was left out of the theatrical release. The longer musical numbers alone make it worth the price. And the scenes where Elwood quits his job help to explain events later in the movie. All-in-all, this is a must-see if you like the blues. Even if you don't, give it a chance, you'll laugh yourself into a stupor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all: From my personal point of view this movie is one of the greatest musical comedies of all times.But what is also very interesting about this motion picture are the excellent technical aspects, like photography, production design, cut and of course the music and live action stunts. The performance of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd alias Jake and Elwood Blues is unique in the history of motion picture-duos. Also don't forget the guest-apearences of Ray Charles, James Brown, John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway, John Candy, Carrie Fischer and of course Mr.Spielberg.John Landis made never again such a great and powerful movie like this. Blues Brothers 2000 is just besides of the music a very sad and boring sequel, compared to the first masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is truly a rare occasion that I can say I find no fault with a film. I can almost always think of something I would have done a little differently with each one I see. With The Blues Brothers, I am at a loss to do so.This film has been a part of my life as far back as I remember. I must have been no older than seven when I first saw it. It was always one of those movies my sister and I would secretly watch after our parents had gone to bed. I suppose it was all the profanity that hooked us back then. Now, I have a full appreciation for what this film really is.The Blues Brothers is funny, exciting, ironic, spiritual, musically superior, and any other positive terminology I come up with all in one. From the first scenes of Jake being released from prison, to the final scene where the entire band is back in prison, this film never stops entertaining.I'd say my favorite portion is the part towards the middle when the group attempts to play a gig at Bob's Country Bunker. The band tries playing their usual set to a bunch of rowdy rednecks, and they get about a thousand beer bottles flung at them for their trouble. After finally winning the crowd over, they then skip out on their $300 bar tab. This film has cameos a plenty, car chases, great music, numerous one-liners, and a truly unique feel to it. I have never even tried to watch the sequel since so many people told me it sucks.The Blues Brothers experience is one that will never be duplicated!I see no other choice but to give it 10 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riotous knockabout comedy (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't matter where you go, you are unlikely to find a film as lighthearted, as shamelessly ludicrous and as ridiculously good fun as "The Blues Brothers". It does not have a plot, credible characters or believable situations. And the wonderful thing is, it doesn't pretend it has. That is where it's magic lies.Joliet Jake (the late John Belushi) is released from Chicago prison to meet his brother Elwood (Dan Ackroyd). Returning to the neighbourhood where they grew up, the pair are horrified to learn the church-run orphanage that took them in as children is to be closed down. Jake and Elwood then find themselves on a "mission from God" to reform their band "The Blues Brothers" to raise the money to save the orphanage. Problem is, they keep making enemies everywhere they go.That is about as much story as there is in the entire film. The rest of the movie's running time consists of slapstick comedy scenes, hilariously improbable car chases, and well-staged musical numbers featuring musical stars from the sixties and seventies (among them Ray Charles, Cab Calloway and Aretha Franklin). Belushi and Ackroyd are two highly amusing leads. With their suits, hats and shades and a barrage of well-placed one-liners, they make a lively pair of lovable rogues. They're well supported by an array of cameos including John Candy as the head cop on their case, Kathleen Freeman as "the penguin", Henry Gibson as a luckless neo-Nazi and Carrie Fisher, playing Jake's psychotic ex-girlfriend who ends up dropped in the mud. There are many others.The musical numbers are guaranteed to have you up out of your chair dancing. Be it James Brown's divine "Landmark", "The Theme From Rawhide" or the concluding "Jailhouse Rock", there's something here for everyone.Relentless, unpretentious knockabout fun, there simply isn't another movie quite like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, seriously, my favorite movie of all time. No, I'm not retarded, I just think most people can't see that this movie is brilliant. The comedy seems dumb sometimes, but I swear, it has a subtle character to it that's hard to pin down.I suppose that the duo of Belushi and Aykroyd is part of it. Aykroyd helped write the movie, and during filming Belushi and Aykroyd's friendship was at its peak. They shared ideas, both about comedy and about music. Ayrkoyd said during their SNL years, "John, you teach me about rock, and I'll teach you about the blues." On screen, they're magic together.I guess one of the reasons people don't like this movie is because it seems so "silly." Car crashes with hundreds of vehicles, impossible stunts, etc. But you have to remember, seriously, this movie has a meaning, somewhere, deep down inside its subtle genius. How do I know? They're on a mission from God. That's how I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great rock n' roll movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few weeks ago, I was looking for great rock movies: y'know, like Spinal Tap, Committments, Jailhouse Rock. I can't believe this one slipped my mind; I always thought of it as an SNL comedy, until watching it this evening. But breezing through it, I gawked at the songs, the car chases, the performances (even from the non-actors), and the lines. The world of the Blues Brothers resembles our own more than usual movie comedies do, what our world could be if someone just got it to loosen up and shake a tailfeather, which is what the presence of the Blues Brothers does, throughout the film... For putting those songs in my head, for being the secret uncles of Ferris Bueller, for presenting Belushi's (and Ackroyd's) greatest performance, for putting Chicago on the map, for passing the test of time and so much more... I give "The Blues Brothers" my first 10/10 rating. It's a musical for people who love musicals and who think musicals are fake, an action movie for people who think action movies are stupid and those who miss them, three different kinds of comedy, and a movie that, by featuring all the ingredients that birthed rock and roll in the first place, really feels like rock n' roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"THE BLUES BROTHERS" is a wonderful, perfect confection of cinematic alchemy. The film's soulful, powerful, amazing and energetic musical numbers equally compliment its bold, crazy SNL-inspired comedic strokes. Has any movie ever reached the heights of pure lunacy and divine, get-up-and-dance musical performances like this one? I love this movie like possibly no other. It reaffirms a joy in the shared experience of music, it captures that crazy 70's comedic aesthetic, and it's a hell of a lot of fun. Period.Crafted on the wispiest of premises, "THE BLUES BROTHERS" is a journey that begins as a mere traffic infraction and ends as a tribute to the (at the time) forgotten musical inspirations of James Brown, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker and even Sam and Dave - scored to the destruction of downtown Chicago. This movie truly is a revelation. Why? It loves and breathes the music of the Windy City blues and Memphis soul, and wears its influences, tributes and loves on its rather cigarette-burned and motor oil-stained sleeves. Written by SNL's Dan Aykroyd and director John Landis, the film follows the Blues Brothers John Belushi and Aykroyd through a magical quest to save the orphanage that the two grew up in - by paying up the $5000 back taxes on the place. The film breezes thru it's 133 minutes (longer if you enjoy the new "Pickwick Preview" DVD Special Edition) with such sweet, happy insanity as it follows Aykroyd &amp; Belushi as they try to reassemble their old, misplaced band (featuring kings of the 60's Stax movement, Steve Cropper &amp; Donald 'Duck' Dunn, as well as studio primos Tom Malone, Lou Marini, Alan Rubin and Murphy (The Big Bus) Dunne) to play a special benefit concert.Landis's penchant for anti-establishment "Animal House" style laughs are here in full force. The film's anarchic DNA finds an amazing 20+ minute car chase through the streets and boroughs of Chicago coupled with a crazy, smart thumbed-nose screenplay. It has as much fun with the straight outside city limits regulars who frequent country-hick bars as with the blues-drenched 78rpm vinyl fantasyland that is fuelled by never-say-die spirit and determination where the underdogs hold all the cards and sing a pretty great song or two.Stocked full of cameos including Henry "Laugh In" Gibson, Carrie Fisher, John Candy and even director Steven Spielberg (!) it's the music and goodwill of the endeavour that completely reminds us of the healing power of music, the energy of free-spiritedness, and the beauty of off-the-wall, collision-course comedy. 1980's "THE BLUES BROTHERS" is an absolutely perfect film. Turn it up, turn it up REAL loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love The Blues Brothers. It's a great, fun, funny movie and the only musical that I like. Jake and Elwood Blues are a pair of performers, albeit fictional, that know what it takes to put on a good show. The music in the film is one of the best things about the movie, coming as it does from quite a few real musicians. The Blues Brothers hold the record for the number of cars destroyed in a chase scene, and the final chase scene is a sight to behold. The star-studded cast is excellent and the movie is just a showpiece for all of these stars. This is by far the best film ever made from a Saturday Night Live sketch, and one of the best movies to feature Dan Ackroyd. Bottom Line: Forget the horrible Blues Brothers 2000, this movie is the real McCoy. It occupies a valued space in my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not designed to work, but somehow it does. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BLUES BROTHERS (1980) is a movie that over the years has developed a reputation as a cult movie that has found its way into the mainstream. The penultimate film of the Aykroyd/Belushi partnership prior to the tragic death of Belushi in 1982, it would have led to the success of GHOSTBUSTERS had he lived and would probably have made that film all the more successful.Looking at it now, it seems a rather awkward hotchpotch of stunts and chases, with a subplot of Carrie Fisher's spurned bride relentlessly trying to kill Belushi repeatedly throughout the film, although the opening scene with the nun berating the Blues Brothers with a cane every time they swear.What does save the film are the wonderful musical cameos by the soul stars and help to toetap the film to an admittedly wild chase of a climax, overblown but not dissimilar to that at the climax of IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD.Better as a soundtrack now and inexplicably spawning a sequel, THE BLUES BROTHERS is worth a look nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my book, there are two comedies that try to reach the level of "epic". The first is Steven Spielberg's 1941, the second is John Landis' The Blues Brothers. Guess which is superior? Landis is not a smart director (anyone familiar with Kentucky Fried Movie and American Werewolf in London can attest to that), but here his focus is more on the relationship and interaction between characters rather than typecasting. While I am not familiar with the original Saturday Night Live skits, I can say that this is hands-down the best movie made off of the TV show. Night at the Roxbury? Get real!Landis' camera is deeper this time around. Much of the time he is letting events build up instead of forcing the humor. Thus, he creates the persona of The Blues Brothers without making something along the lines of Ghostbusters. His message is simple: "They'll never get caught, they're on a mission from God." How he conveys that almost parallels Dr. Strangelove in sheer ambition. John Belushi surpasses his wave of mediocre roles (Animal House included) and creates the quintessential smart-ass.The comedy genre in itself is cursed because it is dependent on the viewer's intelligence and trying to appeal to a wide audience. Landis has undoubtedly tried (Coming to America and Beverly Hills Cop III), but he is too mainstream to be taken seriously. Thankfully, Dan Aykroyd (who is slightly more sophisticated in this sort of thing) is the one calling most of the shots with the script. The dialog is punchy, catchy, and never gets useless.I hate musicals. As far as I am concerned, songs in that line of work should stay on the radio and there alone. Musicals are only trumped-up versions of the old Vaudeville performances (except nowadays we have MTV to turn us off). While the Blues Brothers could have done without the music--it sure would've helped the running time--it does help keep it in the vein of "blues". Music purists may debate that point now until they die, I don't care.The car chases in The Blues Brothers are two-sided. On the surface, they represent the typical Hollywood pursuit. The deeper subtext is that they parody the enormous waste Hollywood creates with such extravaganzas. Compare the final chase in all its humor and lack of seriousness with the overlong freeway chase in The Matrix Reloaded. You can draw many similarities between the two in subtext as opposed to simple adrenaline rush. Paging Michael Bay! You are obsolete!Overall, a grandiose that overstays its welcome, but more than makes up for it. This is Landis' best work, he will never improve. Forget about everything else he made because here he finally combines what meager talents he has with a purpose. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy of Epic Proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These days, the muttering of Saturday Night Live movie strikes fear into the heart of comedy lovers. We don't get a comedy, mostly it's a collection of bad jokes and toilet humour but in 1980, the first SNL movie blasted our way and true comedy lovers haven't recovered since. In the time when National Lampoon had made the classic comedy 'Animal House', SNL decided to break into the game with the popular skit 'The Blues Brothers'. Although it wasn't a regular sketch, it would make great film material. The Blues Brothers are Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) Blues. Two musicians who are seperated when Jake is put in jail. The day he comes out, which is where our movie starts, Elwood insists on taking him to see "The Penguin" (Kathleen Freeman), the nun that raised them. When she informs them that the orphanage they grew up in will be shut down if they don't get money, The Blues Brothers decided to round up their old band and perform the gig to end all gigs and save the orphanage. What follows is a comedy of epic proportions. It's possibly the only epic comedy and it is sure to please many groups of people. Music lovers will love, car chase lovers will love it (Watch out for that mall!) and true 80's comedy lovers will love it. I find that 'Blues Brothers' truly improves with age. There are few boring moments and if there is, the script by Dan Aykroyd and John Landis follows it up with comedic moments of sheer genuis. The truth is that they don't make 'em like this any more. The performances are spot on. Belushi proves what a talented actor he is and it's a shame he had to die when he did because he could have done really great stuff. Aykroyd has stayed with is and, although some of his more recent movies are less than impressive, he's still one of the funniest guys out there and I'd like to see him do a Blues Brothers 3 (Unlike most people, I enjoyed the second one). John Landis has always been a talented director and it's certainly on display here. Very nicely staged, shot and edited, the production crew are certainly to thank as well. The supporting cast is the stuff of dreams with the band making a big impression and very funny cameos by John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, Twiggy, Paul Reubens, Steven Spielberg, Cab Calloway and Aretha Franklin. One last thing to note is that this film was originally going to run 3 hours and even have intermissions but all that stuff is sadly lost with the twenty minutes that remain have been crafted into the director's cut available on DVD. I could really go on about this movie. On the personal side, it's a family favorite and the whole family watches it about once a year while I use every chance I get to watch it. It's smart, crazy, loud and funny proving that a really good movie can come out of SNL. Congratulations to anyone that worked on this film because you have went down in comic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An SNL Fantasy, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Musical and Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not many films like 'The Blues Brothers'. It's up there with'Big Trouble In LIttle China' and 'The Adventures of BuckarooBanzai Across the 8th Dimension' as a really strange film. It's amusical road movie comedy adventure based on an old SNL skitbut if you're expecting to see the usual SNL sludge then you'll besurprised. This is back in the day when 'Saturday Night Live' wasone of the best and funniest shows on TV and this film shows it.It's one of the funniest films of the early 80's and a true "fun film".The plot is something along the lines of this: "Joliet" Jake Blues(The Late, Great John Belushi) has just been let out of jail and hisbrother Elwood (Dan Ackroyd, in a wondefully dry performance)takes him to see the nun that brought them up. The Nun a.k.a ThePenguin (Kathleen Freeman) tells them that the orphanage theygrew up in will be shut down if it's not paid for so Jake and Elwoodgo to round up their various band members and put together thegig of all gigs to raise the money and amongst all this are beingchased by the police, Nazis, a band, a country bar owner and amysterious woman played hilariously by Carrie Fisher. It's hardjust to explain the plot right. Those staying away from this filmbecause it's a musical, don't worry. It has the best car chase andcar pile up in history (That's really what made the movie famousincluding the infamous car chase through the mall). It alsofeatures cameos by Paul Reubens (or, as he's more known,Pee-Wee Herman), John Candy, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles,James Brown, Henry Gibson and the previously mentioned CarrieFisher making this gem of a film unmissable. By the way, theextended version only adds eighteen minutes but they includesome of the best bits. So, in short, buy this movie! It's been afavorite of mine and my family for years and it's worth a viewing justto claim you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that I never tire of watching. From the music, the action, and inside jokes, it is a one and only type film that the sequel could not come close to duplicating. The Blues music and the "mission from GOD" has made this a movie that is spoofed in many other films, most recently is "Jonah, A VegiTales Movie".This movie is filled with blues music greats and their song styles.POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! From the opening scenes of Jakes release to the Blues Band incarceration at the end, it is filled with great music, humor and action.This is a MUST see, if only for one time viewing, you will be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, it is an absolute classic. The writing is superb, with lots of memorable quotes ('No maam, we're musicians', 'We're on a mission from God' etc.). The acting is excellent, the soundtrack has to be one of the best I've ever heard in a movie, and the stunts are pretty damn impressive as well.

		<shortDescription>I can't stop watching the Blues Brothers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's the zany predictability, the sense of early 80's nostalgia, or the way the movie showcases some incredible musical legends....but whenever I stumble upon The Blues Brothers on cable lately, I can't stop watching it! I think I must have watched this movie at least 3 times in the past few weeks.Granted, most SNL skit-to-movie concepts are dead on arrival (or should be), but The Blues Brothers was cut from a different cloth. Belushi and Akroyd - two members of what I consider the "Master Class" of SNL - are funny not because they portray Jake and Elwood as humorous characters, but rather for the way they portray the quirky Blues Brothers as unfazed by the chaos surrounding them, and oblivious to how the other characters perceive and react to them. It's the ironic humor inherent in eccentric characters who take themselves much more seriously than does the rest of the world.Much of the enjoyment of this movie comes from the wonderful musical cameo performances by the likes of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, etc. The Blues Brothers would have been just another (forgettable) cop-chase comedy without them. Belushi and Akroyd could never have carried this alone - especially the way they sing, although I do enjoy their bullwhip-cracking rendition of "Rawhide", and always chuckle at the way "Stand by your Man" makes the beer bottle-tossing rowdies at "Bob's Country Bunker" melt away to mush (and I always feel sorry for that poor guy drowning his lonliness in his beer mug!).All in all, The Blues Brothers is two hours of light-hearted, inoffensive, and (for some of us) nostalgic fun, to be enjoyed but not taken too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one cool movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the tagline says, "They'll never get caught! They're on a mission from God!" Dan Ackroyd and the late John Belushi take their Saturday Night Live characters The Blues Brothers to the big screen! Their mission is to get some money to reopen the orphanage in which they were raised that's being threatened to shut down. So, Elwood gets Jake out of prison and their adventure begins! They run into everything from rednecks, a homicidal old flame of Jake's, famous musicians and singers, and the authorities! The Blues Brothers has something for everyone to enjoy. Cool music, car chase scenes, location shots of Chicago home of the blues, and one hilarious mishap leading to another! The funniest parts in the movie were the whole church scene where everyone was doing flips, and the whole chase scene that leads to the end of their 'mission'.  This is quite possibly the best movie about Saturday Night Live characters ever made! All the others such as Wayne's World and A Night at the Roxbury were all mediocre compared to The Blues Brothers! My favorite is Elwood because he's the smart and scheming one. The Blues Brothers is a movie that nobody should pass by! So go ahead and rent it already! It's an awesome movie you can watch with friends and family alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie, if you like blues and really appreciate the good old days. Blues Brothers is one big tribute to the old blues, soul, and r&amp;b school. And what a tribute! Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, James Brown and Cab Calloway, all agreed to contribute to the films music numbers. The Blues Brothers themselves are not that bad either. (Who knew that John Belushi had such a powerful blues voice?)The story is very simple. Jake (John Belushi) is released from jail and picked up by his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). Immediately they visit the old orphanage where they were brought up. This place is in big debt and if someone doesn't come up with $5000 soon it has to be shut down. So Jake and Elwood decide to put their old blues band back together, to raise money for the orphanage. Now we follow them while they track down the members of the band, get their first gig, their second (big) gig, and are being chased by the police, military and Illinois Nazis all over Chicago in the incredible final. This sequence MUST contain the biggest destruction of police vehicles in movie history. (Still can't figure out though how they shot the "car falling" scene.?)As a matter of fact, Blues Brothers is also the film which contains the biggest number of mutes (actors)I have ever seen. I wonder what the budget was for actor wages!?Oh yes, the actors. Besides Aykroyd and Belushi, we have Charles Napier (lead singer of "the good ole boys"), Frank Oz in a small part, Steven Spielberg in one of his few parts where he doesn't play himself, Henry Gibson as the nazi leader, John Candy as the police chief, and Carrie Fisher. What can you say about her? She was at her peak here. My god, she is absolutely gorgeous!The film is filled with memorable moments. I especially love the "Minnie the Moocher" sequence, where Cab Calloway's suit suddenly changes from black to fancy white and the whole band also. While he is singing it (with perfection)we see Jake and Elwood (sneeking around) moving to the music. When the song is over Calloways suit is back to black. "Hideho", that's all I say.The movie was directed by John Landis. Now I have noticed that three of my reviews have been on Landis movies. His flicks must have a big influence on me!So, of course, I urge you to see Blues Brothers. A film with first class actors and first class music. You will definetely have two very enjoyable hours.</fullReview>

The main thing about this movie is simply fun, it is full of hilariously over the top car chase scenes, quirky, odd and down right silly characters. If you are wanting to watch a movie for amusment purposes this is the film for you. Blues and music fans in general will enjoy cameo appearances by such all time greats as John Lee Hooker, James Brown, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles. The stunts and car chases, as I mentioned before, are just crazy at times, but one must remember one simple premise, "We're on a mission from God" anything is possible.</fullReview>

The music really got me going and it cracked me up, not dumb and dumber style but in a dry humor sort of way. I really began to enjoy it. Just when i thought it couldn't have gotten any better.

		<fullReview>Lay it out on paper, two SNL stars playing characters they developed on the show, make it themed to blues music, add lots of cop car crashes, and finally make it a musical. Sounds like a recipe for disaster, right? Especially considering the movie careers of countless SNL alumni.So the impossible happens and not only does it work but it's GREAT! The Blues Brothers is still one of the funnies movies ever made, with non-stop one liners, mondo car crashes, and a sort of mood that keeps going the entire movie. Nowhere does it stop and go thud with a needless romantic scene or try to take itself too seriously. The only thing I really wish is if other comedies could have been as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMHO this is the original big budget action comedy. Who would have thought a SNL sketch that started as an audience warm up act could have been turned into one of the greatest action comedy films of all time. Just the car chases alone are some of the greatest chase scenes captured on film. It must have been a stunt driver's wet dream to get on that film. Remember there were no special effects in the chase scenes except for the back flip by the Blues Mobile and the fall from the sky by the Nazi's Pinto Wagon ( remember those cars...BOOM...). If you love action and car chases you have to see the movie. Anyone who has seen Kenichi Sonoda's work on the anime movie Riding Bean or his anime and manga series Gunsmith Cats can see the references to the Blues Brothers.</fullReview>

The brothers are able to make enemies with the complete Illinois State Police Force, a Country and Western Band, Nazis, a Nun and the National Army, before they can complete their "Mission from God".Of course this one is full of over-the-edge slapstick humor and some of you may not like the undisturbed behavior of our couple.

		<fullReview>Ask most people what the greatest musical of all time is, and they will tell you some piece of garbage like The Sound Of Music or Mary Poppins. There are two possibilities in such an event: they're either not real musicians, or they've just never seen The Blues Brothers!The Blues Brothers is the musical of the musician. No other film gets so close to the truth of what life in the business is like for an actual musician, and no other captures the essence of what real music forms, the Blues especially, are about. Music is not about a bunch of gutless trendies following whatever the PR at Sony tells them to follow, it is about the creative dreams of ordinary men and women, just like the people listening or viewing. The scene outside the Soul Food Cafe is a perfect representation of this: an improptu band performance outside the cafe, attended by the average Joes that they made the music for.Of course, there is still a demonstration of the corruption and stagnation that has become inherent in the music industry, but rather than flaunting it as just something we have to accept, this film shows that with enough determination and work, it can be overcome. One day, I hope to get everyone who's been raised on the garbage they play on the radio these days and stick them in a hall, then play Minnie The Moocher at them. I'm sure the shock of hearing real music with a dozen musicians playing a tight, intricate rhythm in two different speeds will shatter the ease with which they can listen to repetitive noise. As a musician heavily influenced by everyone from The Blues Brothers to Frank Zappa to Black Sabbath (the real Black Sabbath, anyway), I am counting on it because I can see how awful society will become without real music.Alas, Cab Calloway, John Belushi, and John Candy are no longer with us to see that the legacy of this film is still as strong and defiant against stagnant radio drivel as it was in the early 1980s. Calloway in particular gives a performance that shows what a mistake society is making by throwing real music on the scrapheap. The performance of Minnie The Moocher convinced me in five seconds flat that I wanted to be a musician. Now that the DVD is out, grab it and watch it on a widescreen unit with the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack turned up to full bore... you'll be a better person for it.</fullReview>

And particularly if you're a blues fan, then you can also appreciate the cameos of various R&amp;B singers performing their tracks. This film is a timeless masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly great movie. I love Jake and Elwood Blues in this destined-to-be a classic. Between Dan Akroyd and the late John Belushi, the laughs pile up faster than the viewer can assimilate them. This film features some of the best car chase scenes ever recorded and this film is in the Guiness Book for wrecking a record number of cars during the filming. The music also truly shines! The boys are out to make enough money to pay the taxes on the orphanage where they grew up. The only way they know how is to put "the band" back together, but there are a few problems. First they have to convince the other players that they are for real. Then they need to find a gig. Then there's the time factor. This film is so much fun to watch that you just gotta rent it! That's an order!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really almost a gem in the rough. This is in the same cult classic category as Rocky Horror. Now I'm not saying that if you liked Rocky Horror, you'll like this, because I know someone (Drew) who really didn't like The Blues Brothers at all. Now I'm not just saying this because I'm a fan of the movie, but I really can't see how you can't find this even a little bit funny.Granted, John Belushi did some amazingly funny movies, I strongly believe that this was his best. I don't think he ever got more into a role than he did for playing the character of Jake Blues. He and Dan Ackroyd completely emersed themselves in this movie, and I believe it shows greatly.There are many great great scenes in this movie. Don't worry, I will not give any away, but all of the car chases are quite hilarious. Also, the Illinois Nazi scene is fantastic. I'm sure most people have heard the phrase "we're on a mission from God." well, that originated with this movie. Everytime they say it in the movie is just so incredibly opportune. Might I recommend renting or buying the special unrated version of this movie. Don't worry, the unrated is the same as the R version, and its only for language anyway. There are some deleted scenes in this version of it which make all the more funny. I really, truely hope you enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We're on a mission from God." This is about the basic gist of the film's plot; involving getting some old blues band back together, which motivates their trekk. However, it's timeless. The story opens when Belushi (Jake) gets out of jail, and is picked up by his brother Aykroid (Elwood.) Then one thing leads to another, and the next thing you know they're on a mission from god to get the band back together. However, along their way they wind up infuriating everybody they meet.Carrie Fisher's great as Jake's X who now wants his head for walking out on her during their wedding day. The part where she practically annihilates their shabby apartment building's so hularious it can't be missed. Among the others includes every state trooper in the state of Illinois, a gang of Neo-Nazis, a redneck band; named "The Good Ole Boys," and others.It's my belief that a latter, much more ridiculous and not near as funny film; called "Airheads," w/ Brandon Frasier and Steve Buscemi ripped the ending of this film off, because they almost mirror each other, and are similar though not exact in plot. However, Blues Brothers is a far superior and more classic film to date. Too bad the sequel wasn't even half the film this one was.</fullReview>

It's just not that funny. If you think singing is funny, you'll laugh your ass off. But seeing how music isn't that funny, there is no comedy. There is some slapstick comedy, but nothing groundbreaking.I do think it is by far the best SNL movie, though that's not really saying much (I liked it better than Wayne's World).7 out of ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST MOVIE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is an absolute classic of a musical and strongly deserves to be in the Top 250 Somewhere! John Belushi puts in his greatest role ever as Jake Blues, the big (but short) brother of Elwood Blues who is sensationally played by Dan Aykroyd. After Jake (John) is released from Jail after a 3 year jail sentence, His Little (But Tall) brother Elwood (Dan) picks him up in a "POLICE CAR!" After being rejected by their female mentor from the orphanage they grew up in, they are inspired after a church service which their step-father (Cab Calloway) told them to go to. The Church service was conducted by James Brown, and the brothers set off on their MISSION FROM GOD to put the band back together, grab some bread and put it into the orphanage to redeem themselves. This would save the orphanage from being closed down, and getting the money was a very tough assignment. Their are hilarious moments, great duels with the cops that were chasing after them and wonderful music with a big list of guest stars, including Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, The Blues Brothers Band and many, many more! This is the greatest musical ever made, my favorite movie! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was the trailer ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for "The Blues Brothers" 11 times, because I saw the movie "Fame" 11 times. (The BB trailer ran right before the show.) And the trailer sucked me in. It was so tightly edited, so exciting, so ... so enticing. I really wanted to see this movie! And so I did - I'm sorry to say, with a guy I didn't particularly like, one who guffawed and made embarrassing comments regarding the return of certain items of Jake's personal property by the prison guard. Therefore I didn't quite appreciate the flick the first time out, except for the music and dancing. A few years later, when it showed up on cable, my husband and I taped it. We just about wore the tape out. I bought a copy of "The Blues Brothers" when it was re-released. Unfortunately the sequel (if you can call it that) was about to be released and the first 30 minutes of the tape are devoted to promoting the sequel. No matter. I can fast-forward to the good stuff.Is "The Blues Brothers" a great film? Of course not. It can't touch "Casablanca" or "Citizen Kane" or even some of the Marx Brothers' wackiest turns. But is it a great movie? Oh, my. Better than four fried chickens and a Coke. Better than country AND western. Better than shrimp cocktail in a five-star restaurant. (Well, maybe not that good, but close.) "The Blues Brothers" has become a movie (like "A Christmas Story") that I know so well I can quote it. Or should I say, act it. I have Aretha Franklin's, "They still owe you money, FOOL!" dead-on. I watch it today with a sense of melancholy. John Belushi was so talented. He had so much promise. Too bad he viewed life more as the brawling car chase than the mission from God. He could have been a contender. What a tragedy, and what a waste. No wonder the sequel didn't work. He wasn't there to toss the cigarette lighter out the car window.But we still have the original Blues Brothers romp, with its Orange Whip (every tried to drink that stuff?), dry white toast, wine served by a waiter who grew up to be Pee-Wee Herman and other visual, aural and gustatory delights.And it certainly had a heck of a trailer, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The day Jake Blues (John Belushi) is released from prison, he and his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) learn that their boyhood orphanage in Calumet City, Illinois is about to be closed after failing to pay their property taxes. After a visit with the Penguin (Kathleen Freeman) and Curtis (Cab Calloway), and a vision in church on Jake's behalf, they decide to get the band back together in an attempt to save the orphanage. Can they do it? It's going to be a difficult task for the Blues Brothers, considering that most of the band members have moved on with their lives. Furthermore, shortly after Jake's release from prison, both Blues Brothers find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Along the way, they attract the entire Chicago Police force, Illinois Nazis, the Good Ole Boys, and Jake's estranged fiancee (Carrie Fisher) as nemeses. If you've ever experienced a wild car ride through through the streets of Chicago, or even if you haven't, see this movie. You'll know what it's like. Besides the double sided plot of saving the orphanage as well as their behinds, the Blues Brothers play alongside a quite impressive cast of characters. It's almost a pop culture "Chronicle of the 20th Century" in this movie! Besides the Brothers, the Hi-De-Ho Man, and Princess Leia, there's an all-star cast of musicians including James Brown, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, Aretha Franklin, Steve Cropper and Donald Duck Dunn, backup musicians for Sam &amp; Dave, and in non-singing roles, Steve Lawrence and Joe Walsh. Then there's Frank Oz ("The Muppet Show"), John Candy (SNL), Henry Gibson ("Laugh-In"), Twiggy, Rosie Shuster (Frank's daughter and Lorne Michaels' ex), Pee-Wee Herman (Pee-Wee Herman!), and if that's not all, Stephen Spielberg plays a cameo role. Even director John Landis makes an appearance in the Blues Brothers. So for homework, watch the comedy, concert, and cop chase that is "The Blues Brothers," and see if they say "See you next Wednesday," the trademark line in all John Landis movies. If you hear it, you, too, may be on a mission...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jake and Elwood are the Blues Brothers. Both ex-cons and lead singers of the Blues Brothers band, they are charged with a mission from God to find money to save the orphanage where they grew up. A flop on it's original release, this film grew to become a cult-classic, spawning a sequel, stage shows and more spin-off CDs than I care to count. Undoubtedly one of the funniest movies of the ?80s (possibly of all time), this masterpiece never fails to amuse or entertain. Yet what makes this film great?Could it be that John Belushi's and Dan Akroyd's sunglasses-wearing characters are extremely funny, given their constant deadpan expressions and unique dancing abilities?Is it the all-star cast - with cameos from, amongst others, such blues &amp; soul legends as Cab Calloway, James Brown and Arethra Franklin?Is it the superb music, always suitable to the moment and making the audience wish that they too could play the harmonica?Is it the collection of stereotype characters ? gay neo-nazis, shotgun wielding cowboys and anal-retentive clerks who brighten up every scene?Is it the car chases, always taken to the extreme and then over the edge in all the action scenes (yes, I know most of the stunts are physically impossible ? they're meant to be)?Is it because of the seemingly random encounters with celebrities and attacks from an enraged Carrie Fisher, which make the audience sit up and take notice?Or is it the fact that all of these together have produced a highly entertaining film which, even if it doesn't have you returning again and again, will at least have you searching for the soundtrack.A classic in it's own league.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you might expect Chicago to throw at you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some authors, the saying goes, only have one book in them. To extend the metaphor, some people in the movie business have only one film in them. The Blues Brothers was that film for not one, but three different people - John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and John Landis. Okay, together Landis and Belushi made something out of Animal House, but despite amassing a huge body of work, the three have mostly disappointed. But not with this film.The story boils down to the need of the eponymous brothers, Jake and Elwood, to reassemble their now-defunct band in order to provide money to help the orphanage of their youth pay back taxes. The movie dances wonderfully on the border between fantasy and reality, with the brothers encountering Illinois Nazis, flamethrower-wielding ex-girlfriends, and everything else you might expect Chicago to throw at you. It stands tall in the ugly line-up of SNL film translations; why is it so hard nowadays to find the kind of creativity and straightforward talent that went into this film?The Blues Brothers is also interesting in the way is constructs ideas of race, mainly using music as a medium. The blues as a musical style was the contribution of African-Americans; now we have two very white guys (Aretha Franklin mistakes them for "Hassidic diamond merchants") attempting to assume the mantle. This naturally leads to some uneasiness; strolling the south side of Chicago, the brothers look about as uncomfortable as U2 did when they made a similar excursion through Memphis in Rattle and Hum. Adoptive big brother Curtis (Cab Calloway) sends the brothers to the church of Reverend Cleophus (James Brown), who kicks out a number understandably more soulful than anything else in the film, providing Jake with a religious experience in the process. As light from heaven shines through the window, the music is drowned out by a vague European chorus: the cue to the audience that we're dealing with the "real" God now. Isn't Brown's gospel tune religious enough for God? Despite these moments of discord, The Blues Brothers pays its dues to the music by including its most important figures whenever possible. Franklin, Brown, and Calloway, as well as Ray Charles all put in great performances, providing icing on a very delicious cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holds up pretty well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie holds up quite well; despite the excess, it looks almost modest and demure by subsequent standards. And it's not as if that excess isn't funny in this context - the juxtaposition of the rather abstract Blues brothers, sometimes conniving and self-serving (albeit justified by their supposed mission from God) but more often hermetically sealed in their own weird outlook and set of rules, largely oblivious to the vast property destruction and chaos following in their wake, is fundamentally a pretty good joke; and Landis' ceaseless commitment to pushing it further and further carries it right until the end (although he seems to undercut the very last joke through bad editing). The quirkily specific evocation of Chicago is an effective counterpoint; as is the very sincere and guileless enthusiasm for the music: the movie's ambition to act as a showcase for a classic line-up of soul/r&amp;b performers is a great asset in time capsule terms. It's more interesting (or at least innocuous) than funny, with relatively few laughs. But there's a lot of genuine engaging oddity - the extremely long walk through the prison yard in the opening sequence; the one-off stylistic parodies in such scenes as the confrontation with Freeman; the cover of Rawhide; the strange tenderness as they go to sleep in the dingy apartment near the train tracks.</fullReview>

Sure, the story bends reality at times-many times-but the boys make it work, by taking it all in stride. Maybe some other movie could stage a car chase in a mall, or could have the heroes' apartment blow up out from under them randomly-but none other than Jake and Elwood would be remarking on the scenery ("Look, baby clothes!"), or just get up and dust themselves off. ("It's almost 9:00! We gotta go to work.") It's that cool, collected manner that makes it work-that they couldn't really keep together in the mediocre sequel.

		<fullReview>Being born, breed, and raised in the Chicago area means that Blues Brothers has a special place in my heart, quite naturally. It's a birth right of being able to watch the movie and take note of all the places you've been. This is the greatest Chicago movie of all time, mind you. Not to mention it's also one of the funniest movie ever. Say what you will about Animal House, Belushi is better in this. Personally I think Animal House is a little over rated. There's a secondary undescribable humor in Blues Brothers that only Chicagoans can see and nobody can explain. Small jokes through out the movie add to this inside joke. Dan Akroyd hasn't been the same since this movie came out. He has yet to find a roll to erase our memory of Elwood. Great performances are abound in tiny parts from other actors, Frank Oz, Charles Napier, Cab Calloway, Kathleen Freeman, John Candy (Orange whip? Orange whip? Three orange whips.), Henry Gibson and Ray Charles. Killer jammin soundtrack. Let's not forget this is a musical (the best and funniest ever). And then there's the car chases and car crashes. This is the only movie that can ever claim a car chase scene inside of a mall! Record number of cars were destroyed in filming this. And most of them were cop cars, BONUS! There's also the flying Nazi Car, it's a riot. And car 55 "We're in a truck" Plus ther'e at least two dozen memorable quotes, lines, and sets of dialogue. What more can be said of this movie? #12 on my all-time list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal #1 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blues Brothers is without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time. I have seen the movie hundreds of times and I still love it. I believe that the funniest part of the movie is how Jake and Elwood are not disturbed by anything, from having their building collapse to having hundreds of cop cars chasing them. The music is also very good. The movie gives a lot of musicians a place to be in the spotlight which they would not have received. I also believe that the movie is very original in many ways. Sure, many movies have car chases, but how many have them in malls or involve the outrages number of cars involved, combining Illinois Nazi's and orphans, musical numbers, and crazy stunts. Overall, one great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Chicago movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is, quite simply, one of the best films of the 1980's. Never before has the city of Chicago been so beautifully captured on film. Every frame of the film has been carefully planned and executed. The attention to detail is amazing. The photography, the choreography, the music, all breathtaking. Stay away from pan-and-scan, this one belongs on a wide screen. I hope that as time goes on more and more people begin to look at this as more than just a Saturday Night Live movie. This is an urban epic. John Landis' finest moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about two men who are on a mission from God.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an obsolute masterpiece. John Landis directed this classic in what turned out to be one of the funnest movies of all time. What is so incredible is how Landis got all these major actors and actresses to work together and create a movie like this. Belushi and Aykroyd(Jake and Elwood) are on a mission from God in trying to save a church that owes $5000 in property taxes. Along their "mission" they encounter every obstacle known to man and overcome them all. The musical performances are outstanding and the line-up of singers makes the movie into a musical concert. It delivers over 2 hours in non-stop action and laughs and must be on everyone's "must see" list. You can literally watch this movie hundreds of times and never get bored. This is classic Belushi and to watch him perform his magic on the screen is enough to make you watch this one over and over. Ray Charles, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, Carrie Fisher, and the rest of the Blues Brother Band are just to the beginning to a wonderful, cleverly done movie. This is a must-own movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this film again for the 20th or so time. Love every scene, but I think my favorite is where they go to visit "The Penguin" (nun) and they mange to offend her with their profanity. She tears them a new one as they fall down the stairs in their little kiddie desks. Its hilarious physical comedy. This film takes me back to a great time in my life which, by comparison, seems so much better entertainment-wise. Things were so much simpler then.As everyone has mentioned, the music is great. So many greats who have passed on now - the great blues and R&amp;B groups, John Lee Hooker, James Brown, Ray Charles, Belushi, John Candy and so many others. Belushi and Akroyd are hilarious in different ways, but play off each other beautifully.I can't believe this movie isn't a 10/10. Its a cult film and will live forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest comedy's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brohers, what can i say... it's a comedy. an action movie maybe even a parody. The plot is (NO Spoilers) Jake Blues, a man released from a correctional center, meets up with his brother Elwood. The blues brothers are a band and they have to get the band back together to raise $5,000 for their catholic home. What makes this movie so great is the humor, there's things people do for no reason, their chased by everyone, and by the middle of the movie. You believe this is a normal day for the two. I only have one problem with the movie, it does tend to feel a little longer than it is, but the comedy and the music make up for it. I give this movie a 3 &amp; 1/2 stars out of four. A great movie everybody should check out. (Well, at least wait for your kid to be 14 years of age)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great musical for people who don't like musicals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the film opens we see Jake Blues being released from prison and picked up by his brother Elwood; they head to the orphanage where they were raised and learn that the place will me closed down of somebody doesn't pay the $5000 tax demand in the next few days. Soon The Blues Brothers are on a mission from God to save the orphanage. To do this Jake wants to get their old band back together but it won't be easy as the members have all got on with their lives while he was in jail. Even once they have got the band back together it will be hard to earn that sort of money at short notice? and that isn't mentioning the fact that they are wanted by the police, the local Nazis and a mysterious woman who is determined to kill Jake! It is safe to say that by the time they pay the $5000 considerably more damage will have been none!The opening scene might make one think this was going to be a fairly slow movie but once Jake is out of prison it isn't long before the laughter and mayhem begin? and there is a lot of both. The action is over the top and utterly hilarious with countless cop cars, shop windows and even entire buildings being destroyed. This mayhem is regularly interrupted by musical interludes by the likes of James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and Cab Callaway. These songs are frequently accompanied by entertaining dance routines. As well as lots of well known singers there are also quite a few other well known people in cameo roles; the best being Carrie Fisher who plays the woman trying to kill Jake; I loved how it isn't explained why she is doing it till nearly the end. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are great as Jake and Elwood; two characters who almost never remove their sunglasses; even at night. I'd heartily recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh; don't worry if you don't usually like musicals; this one is great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two hour car chase for running a yellow light, sprinkled with cameos, good performances from Motown legends, and Spaceball-esquire humor.They're on "A mission from God" when their orphanage Nun tells them the orphanage will be closed due to back taxes. Their plan is to get their old band together and make money performing. Along the way they pick up a lot of people/groups after them...cops, an ex-fianc, Nazi's and 'The Good Ole Boys'. Lots of good one-liners: "We play all kinds of music...Country AND Western" being the most notable among musicians to this day.Don't expect great cinema, but its a fun movie worth seeing at least once. PS: As far as people who comment about other people's comments, (which now, I am actually commenting on, which means I am commenting on people who comment about other people's comments) I have no comment. I will say that I saw this in the theatre, when it came out, and it was a blast. You have to remember to put movies into their time/era. You can't compare the special effects from 70's to Sci-fi from today, and you can't go see Belushi expecting Olivier, it is what it is: The Blues Brothers.</fullReview>

The cast has so many stars from film as well as music, it's hard to name them all, lest you miss some. The greats include the late James Brown, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, and the film credits of Carrie Fisher, Twiggy, John Candy, and a quick shot of a very young Steven Spielberg are just a few. Don't miss a minute of this classic. as they destroy at least 30 1974 Dodges, and don't forget Henry Gibson's Nazimobile. I haven't done this film justice, for every star I mentioned, I forget two others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Fought The Law And The Blues Won</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, they aren't really brothers and they don't really play the blues. And it's not really much as comedy, only intermittedly amusing, albeit spiced with some winning musical numbers that owe more to southern soul, gospel, and Tin Pan Alley than electric blues.But "The Blues Brothers" has fun and makes sure its audience does, too, goofing on its snarky cool, its demolition-derby aesthetic and setting into play a whole subgenre of film comedy, the "Saturday Night Live" knockoff.Joliet Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) find a higher purpose for their natural criminal bent when the orphanage that raised them is threatened with foreclosure. In order to raise the necessary funds, the Blues Brothers must reunite their old band and play a gig, while avoiding the angry attentions of an ex-girlfriend, a country-music band, Illinois Nazis, and most of the greater Chicago law enforcement community.Along with Lorne Michaels, I have a grudge with this film in that it delivered the death blow to the original and best "Saturday Night Live" cast by depriving it of two of its stars. Belushi and especially Aykroyd were amazingly versatile TV performers, and putting them in a movie wearing dark sunglasses and poker faces feels almost criminal.A lot of the scenes, especially those involving the Nazis and the country band, but also the excessive car chases, bog the film down, as does the coke-fueled narcissism of the two leads. But two things not only save but redeem the movie, the music and director John Landis.The musical numbers are the film's reason for being, not only because they spotlight some terrific performers and celebrate their art but for the way they electrify the film. Watching James Brown belt out a gospel number is great, but what sends it over the top is the kinetic dancing of his congregation, and the way Jake gets carried away by it. Likewise, the Blues Brothers themselves may be cruising as comedians, but they had something to prove as musicians and do so with some gut-bucket vocalizing from Belushi (listen to him sing that opening number, "She Caught The Katy") and spastic hoofing from Aykroyd to the beat of "Sweet Home Chicago" in a raucous, blue-lit music hall.That leads to Landis, who keeps the film moving so fast you overlook the limp plot and blind alleys, and gives it a sheen that complements the aggressive score. When Ray Charles takes out a pistol and shoots at a small child, or Daley Plaza fills up with enough armed personnel to pacify Iraq, it works because Landis makes clear that we are dealing with a world only slightly connected to reality. Seeing the extended version that comes with the 25th Anniversary DVD really shows how Landis squeezed every bit of energy he could out of a script that Aykroyd wrote during his SNL downtime and could have been another "Nothing But Trouble" in less steady hands.Belushi has one great scene, when he's confronted by Carrie Fisher as his M-16-wielding ex-fiance. "I remained celibate for you," she sneers, taking aim at his head. Then Belushi whips off his sunglasses for the only time in the movie, and fixes her with a look that melts her heart as well as yours, for a talent who died too young.But the best comedy is in the music, Jake and Elwood dancing hand-in-hand across a stage and the great Cab Calloway in tails performing his signature number from the 1930s, "Minnie The Moocher." Aretha Franklin's lip-synching, too, though that's unintentional comedy and it's only fair to add that she gives the best acting performance of any musician and most of the actors.Like another film comedy from the same summer made with SNL vets, "Caddyshack", "The Blues Brothers" is flawed but fun, worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the best Saturday Night Live related film ever made. I still think that John Belushi is the greatest and funniest SNL cast member ever.The film has many strong points. For example, the music features a who's who of the soul and R&amp;B genre. From the late great Ray Charles to Aretha Franklin and everybody in between! Watch for small roles by John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson and Kathleen Freeman (who both appear in another comedy classic, "The Nutty Professor").Has anyone ever figured out which 1980 film trashed more cars, this film or "Smokey and the Bandit 2"? It would be interesting to find out the totals.It could just be my imagination but, the scene where Jake and Elwood drive through the shopping mall, it looks like they almost injured or killed several people! My favorite scene: Aretha Franklin's smokin' rendition of "Think". (And where John Candy orders a "Orange Whip"!) Classic Scene: "We got two honkies out there. One wants four whole fried chickens and a coke, and the other wants dry white toast". Classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As perfect as a comedy gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the genre of lighthearted comedies, this is one of the best I've ever seen. The music is good to great, the acting does the job, even the car chases somehow manages to be really funny, and the plot is just enough to carry it. It is filled with memorable scenes and not least lines.There are plenty of stars, not least musicians like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Cab Calloway (all doing good songs), but also unexpected names like Carrie Fisher, Frank Oz and Steven Spielberg. They matter less to the movie though. The music is the most vital part.And the humor. Belushi and Akroyd do their stone-face act just right through all bizarre things that happen to them, more or less caused by themselves.The two most important things to make you truly love a movie are a great opening and a great ending. This one has them both and keeps the tempo in between as well.Too many comedies, American in particular, rely on cheap under-the-belt "humor" like fart jokes, crude sexual implications and the like. That is not present here, apart from some mild rude language that is perfectly called for and used in a fun way. The script just doesn't need junk to fill it.A few scenes were cut that were re-introduced in the DVD version, but only one of them (parking the car in a weird place) has any importance.Simply one of the best comedies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four steps in making a classic musical comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time in 1994 in a small town where I happened to study for a year, in the local movie theater for a ridiculously low sum of money. A school class had organized a screening of the film to help finance a class trip or something. The print was in rather bad shape, and the audience a bit too loud, but I had a great time. This film became my favorite along with "Hatari!" and "Father of the Bride" (the Steve Martin remake). Everything in this film is just right:The attitude: Jake and Elwood manage to keep their coolness no matter what obstacles come their way. With cops in hot pursuit, they totally demolish a shopping center, while calmly discussing everything that's sold there (check out the worker who accidentally bumps into the camera while trying to run to safety). A mysterious woman (Carrie Fisher!) destroys a seedy hotel where Elwood lives, but that doesn't seem to bother the brothers, who climb out of the pile of debris, wipe the dirt off their suits and carry on walking.The music: James Brown's enthusiastic Soul Preacher engaging a whole churchgoing audience (including Belushi and Aykroyd) into a wild gospel number where everyone starts singing and swinging on the floor (some even jumping high up close to the roof, defying the laws of gravity). Aretha Franklin shows she has a way with words and tells Matt Murphy to "Think about what you're trying to do to me". Ray Charles displays his talents by "Shaking the Tailfeather" in a music shop, with the whole street joining in the fun. The funniest scene in the country bar, where the audience, irritated by "Gimme Some Lovin'", has to be calmed down by renditions of "Rawhide" and the sure-fire tearjerker "Stand by Your Man". Not to forget Cab Calloway's "Minnie the Moocher" and the titular band's takes on "Everybody Needs Somebody" and "Sweet Home Chicago".The humor: Just see the Quotes section for this one, there are plenty of memorable lines in this movie.The faces: Landis puts in his usual assortment of film directors and other familiar faces in cameo roles: Frank Oz as a prison officer at the beginning, Steven Spielberg young and unrecognizable to those who know only his bearded mug shots of today, and Landis himself as a policeman joining his colleagues in the shopping center chase scene. Paul "Pee-Wee Herman" Reubens as the waiter who takes the brothers' dinner orders in the restaurant, and Twiggy as a girl whom Elwood asks for a date. And don't blink or you'll miss long-haired and mustachioed rock singer and brief The Eagles member Joe Walsh during the closing "Jailhouse Rock" number.Stock up on dry white bread and whole fried chickens, invite your friends to join in, and have a good time together with a movie filled with SOUL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You read that right.  There's no point in going over the plot. If you're reading this review, you already know the movie most likely. Besides being riotously funny, the characters from "The Penguin" (the late great comic actress Kathleen Freeman) to Jake's homicidal ex-girlfriend (Carrie Fisher in a particularly inspired role. I even like the name of her hair salon "The Curl Up And Die") are beautifully realized. There is not a lame second in this opus. And the MUSIC! WOW!!! Damn the plotholes and full speed ahead. This film, along with "The Producers," "Stripes," "Animal House" and maybe "Caddyshack," this is one of the most flawlessly realized gut-busting comedies of all time. Add to this the amazing line-up of musical talent from John Lee Hooker, to Ray Charles to the mighty Cab Calloway to the Queen Of Soul Aretha Franklin doing another fabulous rendition of "Think," this is a tribute to R&amp;B and soul the true American music as well as a perfectly thought out exercise in funny! What makes it all the more remarkable is that it holds up so well. I still have favorite moments I look forward to when watching this film and some are just as simple as the "Cheese Whiz" toss to the old man in the divy hotel alongside the El to the C&amp;W waitress proudly telling our heroes that "We have ALL kinds of music. We have country AND western." I just wish I could rattle off those long lines with all sorts of references like the great Dan Ackroyd. I also consider myself privileged to have MET Belushi and the late Gilda Radner (who, sadly, has not had a single good film in her repertoire. She deserved better) There's something I can share with my grandkids. And I agree with Elwood. I too hate Illinois Nazis - unless they are going over a cliff. If you haven't seen this movie, BUY IT and you won't regret it....unless you don't like great music and funny comedies...then maybe you ARE an Illinois Nazi, in which case....</fullReview>

John Candy, Cab Calloway, James Brown, Ray Charles and all the others supporting actors are great in the film. John Candy has some of his best one-liners of his life in this movie: "Orange whip?

Its funny to see cameos by Steven Spielberg, Frank Oz and John Landis himself in the movie.I don't know what people are talking about when they say the best car chases are in Bullet and French Connection. These were both good movies and good car chases but what can compare to the chases against the Blues Mobile. "Our Lady of Blessed acceleration don't fail me now"The quotes, one-liners, and music/soundtrack are the best you'll ever hear together in on movie. This movie is a timeless classic.If your as big of a fan of this movie as I am you'll probably appreciate seeing most everybody back again in 'Blues Brothers 2000'.</fullReview>

I'm actually going to keep this one instead of returning it!Joliet Jake really is on "A Mission From God." The way that he gets the band together and sets out for their first gig with no gig scheduled is just like the way Christ would say to the Apostles, "Follow me," with no worries about what to bring along for the trip. Jesus even let a thief act as his Treasurer.Jesus cursed a fig tree for not being ready for Him. Jake and Elwood encounter a gas station that has no gas for them, and ironically the gas station explodes behind them when they finally get on their way.As for Jailhouse Rock at the end, I think that has always been an inside joke that Elvis is really still alive! The reason why all the prisoners are dancing in the aisles is that they've finally seen the light and are having the type of epiphany Jake had when he did front hand springs up the aisle in the church.I must have watched The Blues Brothers on VHS 30 times or more over the years, and I'd always thought I knew who Carrie Fisher's "Mystery Woman" was based on. It wasn't until tonight that I realized that she was planning to kill Elwood the whole time, as well.The new DVD is a gem. I think that if they used cutting edge computer technology to throw in some Matrix style special effects with all the dancing, police cars flying, The Penguin sliding back inside her office, and John Belushi doing front hand springs up the aisle of the church, it would break all existing Box Office records!And speaking of "records," throw in a little more music and suddenly everyone realizes that it always has been a musical!The use of the Peter Gunn theme has always been cool, and if I could request a song for the new theatrical release, I'd like to request that Henry Mancini theme from the original Pink Panther when David Niven and Robert Wagner are skiing. I always thought that theme was a cool one, too.I'd like to see The Blues Brothers in one of those new totally digital theaters. In that way, the timing could be controlled to allow for the audience laughter and applause. The brightness could be adjusted so that everyone in the audience wears Blues Brothers 3-D sunglasses.They could even put in a young Paul Schaeffer with today's technology, as if he'd always been in the film all along!Could a a digitally remastered movie from 1980 win an Academy Award in 2002? It's easy when you're "on a mission from God!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers is a classic comedy, which I think has one of the funniest scenes of all time near the beginning. Let's just say that I was glad that I never said the wrong thing to a nun. Dan Akroyd and John Belushi, Jake and Elwood Blues, are determined to perform music to raise money for their childhood's adoptive orphan church before it goes bankrupt. They break a `few' laws in their determination even though Jake had just been released from prison. Their determination includes putting the "band" back together to win some money to save the church. The risky attitude of the two trying to avoid the authorities to accomplish their "Mission from God" leads from one hilarious scene to the next. Whether it's avoiding a traffic ticket, avoiding the cops in a parking lot (making a new exit), avoiding a bar tab, reacting without emotion to a psychotic ex-fiances deadly bombed revenge or breaking into a music hall through the ladies room, these guys never flinch. It's a movie that you can watch over and over. All the music is very good, but "Minnie the Moocher" and "Sweet Home Chicago" are the favorites. It has a car chase that will check your alertness and make you wonder how many cars were destroyed in the making of this film. Carrie Fisher will give you a Dj? vu from Star Wars holding a gun and the guy at the end... is that Steven Spielberg??? This is a great movie to see, especially if you are going to visit Chicago for the first time whether you haven't seen the movie at all or have seen it 50 or 60 times and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic! Between both Jake &amp; Elwood being wanted by the police, then the band they impersonated, a group of neo-nazis, and Carrie Fischer (who was supposed to marry Jake - but he bailed out) - henceforth the mass destruction she caused. And to top it off, getting the money raised to keep the orphanage going. Absolutely great picture from start to finish, and I'll watch it again and again. And if I'm correct, it set the world record for most vehicles destroyed in a single picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly the movie with the first great car chases. Belushi and Akroyd are a dynamic pair of brothers who have a tendency to cause havoc everywhere they go. The police are so funny with their ignorance, and the musical scenes are actually quite fun. Carrie Fisher was so bloody hilarious, I was waiting for her to make herself known. She was a great psycho. The German enthusiasts were also enjoyable, and very annoying. The car drop was neat. I enjoyed this movie to the extent anyone can enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Michael Jordan of Saturday Night Live-Based Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Blues Brothers" was the first film based on Saturday Night material and it is still the best by a mile. The two brothers (Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi) are on what they call "a mission from God". They are trying to raise money to save a Catholic orphanage. Of course money is difficult to come by and they get much of it by illegal means. They bring their band back together and more trouble ensues. By the end, it seems that they have become a threat to all of Chicago and to the national government in general. The comedy is great and the musical numbers just add to the film. The screenplay and direction are both surprisingly good. There are also cameos all over the place. Watch for Steven Spielberg in a very small part at the very end. A very enjoyable epic comedy. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie more than once (OK, twice) and have tried to watch it a number of other times, but, I just don't get the allegiance to this movie.For a comedy, it is NOT funny, unless you consider cars smashing into things funny. For a movie, it has a paper thin plot that seems like nothing more than a vehicle (no pun intended) to get Ackroyd and Belushi into a movie with a lot of their friends and musical idols along for the ride. I'm guessing a lot of chemical substances were ingested during the writing and filming of this movie. When they were making this mess, I'll bet they thought that this was really funny...not! If hard-pressed, I might give it two stars only for the musical numbers.Of course, this movie was about par for all of the movies that have come out of SNL cast members. I can't (off hand) think of any really good, funny movies from any current or former SNL member.In closing, it is a sad state of movie making when people actually think this movie is funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most watchable movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the movie I've seen most often, maybe upward of a hundred times! (Of course, this is partly because my fifteen year old grandson watches it about once a week, but what the hell, I told him about it).I hesitate to say it's a good movie. It isn't carefully plotted, and it doesn't have very subtle acting in it. But if it isn't good, it somehow manages to get around this by being, very simply, GREAT. Of course, it's largely the music that does it. Imagine seeing and hearing Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker and James Brown in the space of about two hours, not to mention the Blues Brothers' own fantastic R &amp; B sound! And there's Cab Calloway's Minnie the Moocher....But maybe even more than the music, it's the tone of the whole thing. How rare, how moving to see R &amp; B and soul and the blues openly worshipped (even if a bit wackily)! How satisfying to see country music, which has caused me so much aesthetic agony, sent up so hilariously! That scene in the country and western bar, where the Brothers sing Rawhide has got to be one of the most delicious bits of satire I've ever seen! And imagine Twiggy being stood up by an evil smelling bluesman. What a fantasy for all us blues-loving losers! Someone should give John Landis about a dozen lifetime awards for making this fantastic movie. Then maybe other directors will start making good movies about musicians, like this one and 'Round Midnight</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will be in my Top 10 list as one of the best films ever made. Belushi and Akyroyd worked remarkable together in this film and I hoped that he could have returned for the sequel but he died at a very young age in 1982 of a drug overdose. This film had very funny scenes and great musical numbers that you will dance to the rhythm of the music. Mostly the funniest scene was the Penguin scene and the film had set a huge record for the number of cars crashed. Every time a car crashes, somebody gets out of the car and says "They broke my watch!". This film had many great one-liners but some say it was a bit overlong but the story never trims out a bit and I consider this the best comedy ever made. I almost remember every line from this film and this best one that I can do is definitely the Penguin scene. It's a really funny film and I hope you can see it! It's a classic.</fullReview>

Why are the Blues Brother's two main characters taken so seriously? Why isn't the blatant "whiteness" of Duke and Elwood poked more fun at? These two are so unintentionally dorky and white it's pathetic. Most of the musical scenes are annoying. The sequence involving Arethra Franklin was so irritating it made me want to vomit all over myself. All this movie has going for it is its gratuitous car crashes and that one scene with the Nazis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly John Landis's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I liked Animal House, Trading Places, Coming to America and Oscar(his most underrated I feel), The Blues Brothers is what I consider John Landis's best. True the plot is pretty skimpy, but there is so much that compensates. The Blues Brothers is beautifully filmed, is confidently directed once again by John Landis and the script is very funny. Other than the delightful cameos from music legends such as Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and James Brown, the Pinto scene with the fall from the sky and the spectacular car chase(ludicrous I know but spectacular too) with the massed forces of the law and order, a country and western band and a bunch of neo-Nazis, what makes The Blues Brothers is the music, it is absolutely brilliant, and the numbers it features in are particularly rousing. And then we have endearing performances from John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Carrie Fisher as well. In conclusion, people may argue that it is a mess plot wise, but I am past caring really with the music and performances as good as they are. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

At all.Was the bit with the neo-Nazis really necessary? In a musical movie? I don't think John Landis has ever directed a really good film. Even Animal House is loaded with weaknesses and serious flaws...Belushi and Ackroyd are terrible actors and cannot sing a note.

		<fullReview>Having somehow never watched 'The Blues Brothers' in the last thirty four years, I set out to rectify that oversight with certain preconceptions in mind.I more or less knew the plot, as one cannot immerse themselves in pop culture the way my generation has and not pick these things up, so I was expecting the humor and the high energy musical numbers. What surprised me were the over the top car chase scenes, the quirky, askew tone and the general excess. All of this most certainly gives the film its unique charm, but at a bloated 132 minutes, it's ultimately a bit numbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elwood Blues (Dan Ackroyd) is picking up his brother, Jake (John Belushi), who is getting out of prison. Their new vehicle is an old police car, which Jake initially pooh poohs, until he admits it has "nice pick up". Also, their Chicago apartment has a train going by "so often" you won't notice it. When they visit their former Catholic grade school to ask for spiritual advice, an irate nun, knowing their criminal activities, warns them not to come back until "they redeem themselves". Also, the school needs money, desperately. Not long after that, the two attend a church service where the charismatic preacher (the one and only James Brown) inspires them to get their blues band back together and make money for the Catholic school. After locating all of their former bandmates, some reluctant to re-up or having spouses who discourage them (Aretha Franklin is one), they get their first gig. Unfortunately, due to miscommunication, it is at a country bar. Thinking quickly, they launch into the Rawhide theme and Stand By Your Man. After several concerts, they get in trouble with the law and are almost caught by the angry former galfriend (Carrie Fisher) of Jake's but he charms his way out of it. With most of the Chicago police force after em, will they pay the school's debts? This film is anything BUT blue. Its a laugh fest, with a great cast. As one of the few films Belushi was able to make, it is a must see. The script is wildly funny, the scenery great, the direction first rate and the music wonderful. Don't be blue this weekend, not when you can get this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too ambitious of a project is detrimental to the end result</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. This movie was far too of an ambitious project. When you have so many characters and musical numbers and musical legends and comic legends built around a thin main plot and weak subplots the entire picture collapses upon itself. This is still a funny and clever movie but it's just too cluttered. As it begin with some funny sight gags with Frank Oz taking inventory of Joh Beleushi's belongings and Beleushi throwing the cigarette lighter to Dan Akroyd's Bluesmobile out of the window it had some nicely paced comedy but as the film evolved into a musical with an overabundance of soul and blues legends it disintegrated into a movie that couldn't make up it's mind to be a comic adventure or a music video. The car chase scenes and mega-multiple car crashes were way too long and overboard and added nothing to either the comedy or music direction that this film was torn into going. In supporting roles, Henry Gibson, Carrie fisher, John Candy, and Frank Oz were all very good while Kathleen Freeman was excellent. Music legends James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Artetha Franklin, Chaka Khan, John Lee Hooker, Pinetop Perkins, Steve Lawrence and 60's fashion model Twiggy are all featured here as well as the Blues Brothers Band featuring former Memphis Stax records musicians. Cab Callowy and Aretha Franklin were very good in their roles but too many musicians spoiled the soup. Some delivered some exceptionally bad acting too. Director John Landis had success with Animal House and Kentucy Fried Movie before The Blues Brothers and would enjoy sporadic success as a director in the 80's and 90's with such films as An American Werewolf in London, Trading Places, Twilight Zone: The Movie and Coming to America. Longtime Landis associate film editor George Folsey Jr. really did a good job on what must have been a monumental task of editing the footage that went into this epic production to make some sense out the the mess that Landis conjured up to give us The Blues Brothers movie. This is not a bad movie as a whole but could have been a lot better. Any viewer will find some laughs and some great music here that they will appreciate once you sort through what is irrelevant. Because of it's large musical cast however, it does serve as an historical document. I would give this a 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of my favorite films of all time. i always loved this film ever since i first saw it in the late nineteen eighties when i was about six years old,and still love and watch it often today,it hasn't dated at all. there's no plot or any deep,meaningful moral message,but it has great musical numbers,wonderfully over the top car chases and a script full of quotable lines. so sit back,switch brain off and enjoy one of the coolest films of all time. but lets try and forget blues brothers 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I lived in Munich, Germany, between 1986 and 1992, there was a cinema (the Museum Lichtspiele) showing this movie every day. I think, they cancelled it in 1996 or 1997. I saw it at least once per month. After leaving Munich I bought the german and the original version on video. Independent of your mood at the beginning of the film, after watching world looks fine, everything seems to be alright. In the meantime, my 9 year old daughter has become a Blues Brother fan also. She only knows the german version. But I think the original version can help her in her future english classes. Although it is not necessarily high class oxford english, that is spoken in this film, the mixture of making good music, giving good political statements, presenting the different aspects of religion and simply showing different people living and working together makes this film a good basis for every kind of education. This movie should be shown at school at least from the age of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a landmark-it was responsible for Chicago becoming the setting for a number of future movies. On its own, it is based on a Saturday Night Live sketch about two white characters with pretensions of being blues musicians. Add a number of major real-life blues musicians and an even larger number of car crashes, and that's the recipe for the movie.The premise is about two brothers, one just out of Joliet prison, who try to raise money to save an orphanage from closing down, and to do so, bring together the members of their old band. Of course, their efforts to do so end up causing trouble with the law, as well as other people (such as a country and western-themed bar and the band that was supposed to play there). In the end, dozens of police cars chase after them, and even the National Guard, before they fulfill their quest. There are some genuinely funny parts, but overall the whole movie depends on exaggeration-twenty police cars crashing into twenty police cars, as critic Roger Ebert had put it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminded me a lot of "Dumb &amp; Dumber". What we have here are two idiots on a quest. Along the way, they run into various blues greats, neo-Nazis, irate cops, even more irate country/western bands and bar owners, a murderous ex-girlfriend, SWAT teams, and even the Army. The whole plot, such as it is, goes completely over the top on a number of occasions, including several car chase scenes that must surely set a record for most cars wrecked in a single movie. What works? Several moments, most notably when Jake and Elwood show up to play a cowboy bar, start off with "Gimme Some Lovin", and, after a, shall we say, negative reaction from the audience, they quickly shift gears and start playing country songs. Not that it matters much, the crowd throws beer bottles at the band as a sign of both approval and disapproval. Luckily the band gets to play behind a screen of chicken wire. Also, Carrie Fisher is hilarious as the rejected girlfriend of Jake, who goes on a one-woman mission of vengeance. What doesn't work? Pretty much everything else. For starters, the "Blues Brothers" are basically two dorky white guys trying to cash in on a black musical thing. Also, the film relies far too much on the aforementioned car chases. Whoever had the contract to supply cop cars to the filmmakers must have made out like a bandit. Final analysis - If you really love the music of blues artists like Ray Charles, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin, you will no doubt put up with the nonsense just to hear some great music. If not, you can laugh at a pair of goofballs trying to resurrect a dead band and running into numerous ridiculous situations along the way. It's far from great comedy, but it has its share of laughs. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just ain't my scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say straight up that this musical 'comedy' just ain't my scene. Jake and Elwood Blues are on a mission from God - which finds them on the run from the law, neo-Nazis, redneck country bands and aggrieved ex-fiances. In order to save their Catholic boys home from closure, the guys decide to put 'the band' back together after 'seeing the light'. What follows is a state wide scramble as the guys gather the old crew together while always narrowly avoiding capture.Writers Dan Aykroyd and John Landis' offbeat script, which is part time slapstick and part time satire, really fails for me as a comedy. Their dialogue is incredibly dry and sardonic, but so much so it's parched. The best laugh on offer is probably the mall scene in which Jake and Elwood drive around the local shopping centre doing a spot of casual window shopping, while the police are in hot pursuit.The catchy musical numbers are what saves the film, with some rhythm and blues being matched with some smart, wacky choreography. Contributing to this soul-fest are some of the all time greats including Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker and the Blues Brothers band. The cast of actors do a reasonable job, with Aykroyd and John Belushi (obviously enjoying themselves) being backed up by Carrie Fisher, John Candy, Henry Gibson, Frank Oz, Charles Napier, Jeff Morris, Kathleen Freeman and Twiggy.Stephen M. Katz captures the action with skill and Ira Newborn supplies the incidental music.Saturday, September 14, 1996 - Video</fullReview>

Let's go down the list:The acting was rather pathetic most of the time; I know it was done intentionally, but the effect of Jake and Ellwood having no emotions ever was stupid.The plot was kinda lame, but nice try; the whole mission from God thing in such a context just doesn't work.The actual events of the film were ridiculous--even if they were on a mission from God. Getting away from an entire state police force, and in such a fashion--please!I truly feel my IQ has dropped because of seeing this movie. Why it is such a cult hit, I don't get.

		<shortDescription>Some Flaws but Overall Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blues Brothers (1980) *** (out of 4) Madhouse from John Landis has Jake and Elwood Blues (John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd) getting their band back together so that they can raise $5,000 to save their orphanage where they were raised. At first it seems like raising the cash will be easy but the brothers soon have Nazies, cops, angry cowboys and others chasing them through Chicago. THE BLUES BROTHERS is one of the most entertaining bad movies I've ever seen. There's so many great things in this movie but at the same time there are so many things that bothered me and kept me from enjoying the picture even more. We'll start with the bad and I'd say it's obvious that there's no story here. Instead of an actual story we just get non-stop music scenes as well as car crashes, two things that actually work in the movie but the extended running time is just way too long and I was constantly looking at the watch to see how much longer there was. The lack of any real story and the extended running time are certainly the two things that keep this from being better because outside of this there's quite a bit to enjoy here. The best thing is the fact that Landis pretty much throws everything out the window and right at the viewer. This includes some of the craziest, most over-the-top chase/wreck scenes that you're ever going to witness. There are many throughout the picture but for me the highlight would have to be the one inside the mall where everything in sight gets destroyed at least twice. Another good thing the film has going for it are some of the musical performances especially the ones dealing with Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin and John Lee Hooker. Then, of course, you've got Belushi and Aykroyd turning in great performances as the Blue Brothers. You can't help but feel like you're watching real brothers doing real blues. THE BLUES BROTHERS is far from perfect but there's still enough here that makes it worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that this movie was spun off the characters created on Saturday Night Live. However, I was not watching SNL when Belushi and Aykroyd were doing these characters so I don't have that frame of reference. My viewing it was simply as "a movie" with no background. While I found it somewhat interesting, in all I cannot call it a good movie, only an interesting one for seeing the deceased John Belushi in a memorable role. Plus many cameo roles for some of the best entertainers of the time.There is only a very simple story here. John Belushi plays Jake Blues and it opens with his release on parole after 3 years in prison in Joliet, Illinois, just outside Chicago. He is met by his brother Elwood, played by Dan Aykroyd, driving an old retired police car. The "Blues Mobile", the Cadillac, was gone, sold to buy a microphone, which Jake figured was a good enough reason. Reminding Jake of his promise to visit their old Calumet, Illinois orphanage when he was released, they discover that it will be closed unless $5000 can be raised in 11 days to pay back taxes. Being "on a mission from God", the whole movie is about raising that money. Since Jake and Elwood are always on the fringe of deep trouble, the movie also turns out to be a sequence of chase scenes.SPOILERS follow in my summary comments below. They visit a black church, James Brown is minister, there's dancing, gives Jake and Elwood idea to re-form the old band to raise money. Driving home they get stopped by cops, a plate check turns up "arrest driver, impound vehicle" for outstanding warrants, Elwood flees, resulting in first chase scene, destroying a mall, and ending up at a men's hotel. Mysterious woman (Carrie Fisher) uses grenade launcher, misses them. John Candy and cops show up, there is an explosion, building falls down. Later encounter Nazis, they try to run them down, forcing all the Nazi demonstrators to jump off a low bridge into water.More SPOILERS follow. Aretha Franklin is the owner of a food joint where they retrieve one of their band members, Aretha does a song. They go to the music store where Ray Charles is the owner, get instruments. They show up and play a gig at a C&amp;W hangout, then the real band shows up, another chase scene ensues when they don't have cash to pay the beer they drank. They get a gig at the Palace Hotel advertise heavily, big crowd shows up, but Jake and Elwood run out of gas and are late. Cab Calloway entertains, Blues Brothers show up, followed by cops. An impressed agent gives them a $10,000 advance for a recording contract, they find a secret way out, but the cops hear machine gun fire of the mysterious woman shooting at Jake and Elwood. More SPOILERS follow. Thus the final and biggest chase scene starts, into Chicago, under the El, dozens of cop cars are wrecked, even the angry Nazis are chasing, ending at the tax office, Cook County, go to suite 1102, while snipers, cops, and helicopters surround the building, Jake and Elwood get the tax bill paid, get a receipt, then they are handcuffed and brought away. The movie ends with them in jail, playing in a jail house band, "Dancing To The Jail House Rock." The mysterious woman was mad because Jake had stood her up at their intended wedding.</fullReview>

Blues Brothers was a fairly simple plot, owe money do anything to pay it back. Blues Brothers is the best SNL related movie, I really don't think many would disagree there. Dan Akroyd and John Belushi are classic as Jake and Elwood, too bad Belushi went to soon, but I still continue to enjoy Akroyd's work. Blues Brothers is worth every bit of the rating it got, I preferred the recent version more, but that takes nothing away from the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd give this story a fat zero if we were enable to on this site. What's the story ? The script doesn't develop any story, it doesn't even attempt to, it doesn't even bother, and I'm not sure if the directors even had the intention to do so in the beginning. It's a fraud - it's a rip-off of the Saturday night sketches that they piled up together and consequently, it is so contrived that it just doesn't work. I've ever seen a movie that talks about nothing more than the Blues Brother. They managed to do a rip-off of "Give somme lovin", the best soul song of all time, and it sound awful. Basically, the directors were only interested in three things:- Showing a rodeo and police cars crashing.- a three ring circus in a jail with jail birds singing along.- a final trail with the two gangsters chased down by an army of cartoon soldiers reduced to "hut-hut" for fifteen minutes.That's not a script. Don't buy the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies ever, and the best "SNL" I can think of...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something funny about the actual Blues Brothers, Jake and Elwood. You don't even have to hear them say anything particularly funny to laugh at the sheer sight of the wacky duo lined up against one another, wearing the infamous clothing and sunglasses. And since their appearance on "Saturday Night Live," and then later in their milestone feature film, they have infiltrated society."The Blues Brothers" (1980) is, and will remain as far as I see it, the funniest "SNL" skit adaptation to ever hit the big screen. The problem with adapting characters from 5-minute skits on "Saturday Night Live" is the fact that they are just that -- 5-minute skits -- and are not substantial enough to merit any type of further focus. Backdrops are not needed -- all we need are quirky characters with distinguishing traits or gestures that will make us laugh."The Ladies Man," "The Coneheads," "A Night At the Roxbury," and "Superstar" are all examples of material stretched too far -- basically just skits multiplied by their original running length some 15 or so times. In fact, there are really only two or three feature length movies with "SNL" characters that are any good. I love "Saturday Night Live," but even I have to admit that some things are not meant to be turned into a movie. I'd rather see a compilation of the character's best moments on the show hit the big screen as opposed to a weak plot-driven film about them doing many unfunny things a quarter as funny as anything on the television program."The Blues Brothers" has a great plot (considering it's an "SNL" film) and a great pair of characters. Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison, greeted by his taller (and more slender) brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). They visit the old Catholic home where they were raised as children by "The Penguin," and are instantly thrust into a mission to save the orphanage by raising a ton of money before it is due to close.How will they do this? Reunite their old band, of course! But it won't be easy, because in the process they get entangled in the affairs of a Neo-Nazi and a heavily armed woman (cameo by Carrie Fisher). They also get entwined in a bunch of musical sequences with blues legends such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles. (John Candy also stars in this film, and in John Hughes' masterpiece "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," he did the "mess around" to Ray Charles' song on the radio while driving an awful car.)It's all in the name of fun, of course. Oh, and in the name of God. Quoting Elwood, "We're on a mission from God." Not exactly a laugh-out-loud line of dialogue, but the more you think about it, the funnier it becomes.All my readers are probably aware of the fact that I absolutely love "Saturday Night Live" and all its actors. (Well, most of them.) Especially the older posse of actors such as Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Steve Martin (frequent guest host), John Belushi, et al. They're like dear old friends and every time I see them on old reruns of the television show I get instant nostalgia. When you become a fan of "Saturday Night Live," you enter a sort of small group of friends you've never even met. You just somehow feel very close to the actors and their friends. John Landis, the film's director, was one of those close friends of Dan Aykroyd like Harold Ramis.The Blues Brothers are two of the best characters to ever come out of "Saturday Night Live." We've seen a lot of characters like Mango and Mary Katharine Gallagher lately, but the best characters are the fondest -- Wayne and Garth, The Lounge Singer, The Coneheads, The Cheeseburger Guy, The Blues Brothers. And just about any character Steve Martin plays.I can't explain why I enjoy "Saturday Night Live" so much -- is it the humor? the acting? the familiarity feel? -- but I can say that I DO love it, and I love "The Blues Brothers." Sequels can become nasty things or splendid things, and "The Blues Brothers 2000," which reunited Aykroyd and Landis (the director), was a failure. A compilation of musical sketches and a terribly recycled plot, it was a sure sign that The Blues Brothers themselves worked not only because of Elwood but also because of Jake, and "The Blues Brothers" the movie worked not because of a recycled plot but because of an original one. (And here's advice for the filmmakers: never, ever replace John Belushi with John Goodman ever, ever again.)I am sure that anyone who enjoyed "Ghostbusters" or any type "SNL"-alumni film will absolutely adore "The Blues Brothers." I mean, this is the stuff legends are made of. Jake and Elwood Blues, two of the most familiar faces of all time. How can you not laugh at this film? It's impossible. Yes, it's a bit long, and yes, you have to sit through some blues music; but they're The Blues Brothers. What else would you expect?5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A buddy of mine loaned this to me and I believe I owe it to him to write an honest review for BLUES BROTHERS. It is a great movie and everything is done right. There are cameos littered everywhere that compliment, rather than sabotage, this hit. The pace is good, the action is fast and all over the place, but I did not find THE BLUES BROTHERS very funny. It was too cliche for that. I question some of the over-enthusiasm of the dancers in the numbers too, but hey, as long as it is not boring, I will not complain too much.The orphanage where the Blues brothers were raised is being sold. To save it by paying the property tax, they decide to bring back 'the band,' though they have some difficulties. But don't worry, "We're on a mission from God."'Rawhide' and Ray Charles' cameo are by far the best parts in the movie. But the ending was a little too over the top, only saved by Aykroyd's and Belushi's casual reaction to the Chicago police force. I don't really know if anything else could have been done to make it better. I thought the movie should have been funnier. Thank you Andy for loaning this and NEXT MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Were it not for the pathetic provincialism of movie-goers from Chicago, this awful movie would rate about a 3 or 4 at most. The premise is rather lame, especially given that Belushi and Aykroyd are terrible singers--two white guys calling themselves "the Blues Brothers" is an insult to any real blues singers! The movie's plot is slap-dash, seemingly thrown together to exploit a throw-away sketch from SNL. This movie started the long trend of bad movies based on throw-away sketches from SNL. I realize it is meant as a live-action cartoon, but so many seams are left showing that suspending one's disbelief becomes a chore. Many people love this film because they can't watch it objectively. They see only their favorite comic actors from the past. It's like that Top 40 hit you loved from high school that just embarrasses you now when you hear it. I saw it when it first came out, and it was over-hyped then and hasn't aged well at all. Most professional movie critics see _The Blues Brothers_ for what it is: a mediocre star vehicle that crashes like an old Chicago police car flying out of lower Wacker Drive.</fullReview>

Basically 'Joliet' Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison, and he and his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd, also writing) return to the orphanage run by nuns where they were raised as children. They find out that the church has stopped giving support to the orphanage and that unless they can pay the $5000 tax on the property it will be sold, so they go the church for some inspiration. Jake sees the light and suggests that he and Elwood should reunite their old blues band and raise the money by selling out all seats in an arena gig. So they set off on their "mission from God" to find their fellow band members to join them, and they don't care what it takes, they won't even stop for the police or any old enemies. One by one Jake and Elwood do find the members of the band, while being chased by the cops, an army of Nazis and an enraged Mystery Woman (Carrie Fisher), and of course having a few song and dance scenes with old friends. After all are reunited, and playing a small gig under a false identity to warm up, they are ready for their big concert where they do indeed manage to sell all seats, and they play with great reaction, and manage to get away from the cops in the audience. The final scene sees Jake and Elwood speeding to the tax office with the ?5000 to pay for the orphanage, and they do manage to do this before being arrested for all the damage and chaos they caused in their journey. Also starring Kathleen Freeman as Sister Mary 'The Penguin' Stigmata, James Brown as Reverend Cleophus James, Cab Calloway as Curtis, Ray Charles as Ray, Aretha Franklin as Mrs. Murphy, John Candy as Burton Mercer, Escape to Witch Mountain's Henry Gibson as Head Nazi, Steve Lawrence as Maury Sline, Charles Napier as Tucker McElroy, young Steven Spielberg as Cook County Assessor's Office Clerk, Twiggy as Chic Lady, Pee-wee's Big Adventure's Paul Reubens as Waiter, Frank Oz as Corrections Officer, Landis himself as Trooper La Fong, John Lee Hooker as Street Slim, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's James Avery as Man dancing outside Ray's shop and Mr. T as Guy on Street. Belushi and Aykroyd are fantastic as the criminally minded but ultimately likable brothers, the cameo appearances by legends of music and film makes for fun viewing, the plot is simple and there are a fair amount of laughable moments (including possibly unintentional), and of course the song and dance sequences, including the memorable "Everybody Needs Somebody To Love", are great fun, a most watchable musical comedy. It was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 12 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ex Saturday Night Live = bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has it good moment, and a few comedy classic scenes. The music part of this film is like eating glass. They forced the old SNL blues skit into the film. One see John Candy in a bit part, and Steven Spielberg only acting role. (tax office guy) Over rated and out dated. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My kids love this film. I have tried to watch it 3 times and I find it so boring I fall asleep during the car chase in the shopping mall. I never get any farther. It starts off well, especially when they go to see the nun, but then it gets involved in the music. I thought the scene in the church with James Brown was far too long. I can't judge the other singers because I fall asleep before I get that far. I suppose if you want big names like James Brown, Aretha Franklin, etc. in a film like this, you have to give them quite a fair bit of the action. I may try to watch it next time it comes on TV, but maybe I'd better stay standing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hated It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BLUES BROTHER is one of those movies that gets highly praised in reviews in TV guides and the like , and it does have a hardcore following . In fact I remember seeing the rather poor WAR OF THE WORLDS TV series from the 1980S that has a scene with the martians walking into a Blues Brother convention ! But to be honest I vaguely remember hating this movie the first time I saw it many years ago and watched it again last night to see if it was as bad as I remembered Jake is released from prison and his brother Elwood comes to pick him up in a second hand police car and the opening sequences seem to drag on . Considering THE BLUES BROTHERS is supposed to be a musical comedy there`s a complete absence of either music or comedy . Later on we do get musical numbers and there is some uplifting moments especially with the Ray Charles number . However with most musicals the segments featuring singing and dancing are set pieces that don`t fit into the narrative easily . There`s also a wider problem with the movie and that is it has no real narrative shape . All through the movie characters and incidents happen as if it seemed like a good idea at the time so by the end we have a chaotic embarrasing mess as troops , fire engines , policemen and SWAT teams chase after Jake and Elwood . In many ways THE BLUES BROTHERS is very similar to the Bond spoof CASINO ROYALE with sometimes memorable musical interludes amidst self indulgent and oh so painfully self indulgent comedy set pieces</fullReview>
