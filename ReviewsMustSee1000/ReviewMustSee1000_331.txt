		<fullReview>Having seen "The Pledge" without knowing much about it, I got something other than what I bargained for. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.If you're looking for a good whodunit, avoid this movie. If you're looking for a fast-paced thriller, avoid this movie. But if you're into seeing an intense character study bolstered by impressive acting and clever directing (kudos, Sean Penn), you've come to the right place.I read one IMDB review calling this film Nicholson's worst ever. This is not true -- that reviewer obviously never saw "Man Trouble" -- but I can see why some folks really don't like this movie. It doesn't deliver what you'd expect, and what it does deliver is neither conventional nor uplifting. In fact, it's pretty depressing. But if you ponder the story afterward, you realize there's a certain dark justice at work here. Like, blacklight dark.So then, "The Pledge" is not a light and frothy piece, but if you're the type who thinks watching some poor b**tard's descent into madness is entertainment, have at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Penn proves himself a first-rate director who gets moving, deep performances out of all his actors. And what a supporting cast - in addition to Nicholson (at his most subtle, something he doesn't always do), there's Harry Dean Stanton, Benecio Del Toro, Tom Noonan, Vanessa Redgrave, Robin Wright Penn, the list goes on and on with the best charactor actors around. Del Toro does something completely different once again. The story is very moving and almost at the level of a Greek tragedy. Beautifully shot and edited with good use of score. The best drama I've seen in quite a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Faithful to the book in most regards, the film is excellent, and Nicholson's performance is beyond reproach. While the denouement may have had issues (not with the point or the meaning, but rather the delivery), the film is still outstanding.Nicholson's relationship with the girl (he is beautiful as an aged father) and his inexorable obsession with the murderer are perfect in the film. Sadly, Penn's pacing is inconsistent, as is the sense of "detective" that Duerenmatt was careful to give his novel: the film's heartbeat ranges from driving to rambling, and most thematically appropriate may have been a measured beat which is lacking here.Nonetheless, the film is gripping, and captures the point, spirit and feel of the novel perfectly. It may not pull off the trick of being both faithful and profitable, but the film is true, and the acting impeccable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film on cable last night (only the last hr. or so) &amp; it was extraordinary. Nicholson gives both a moving &amp; harrowing performance as an old, hard-drinking, washed up police detective. Though his character is in the dregs, he still manages to compel our empathy. Not since "Ironweed" has he attempted a character so thoroughly seedy.His relationship w. Robin WRight &amp; Wright's daughter is affecting; and the plot developments around the child murderer stalking the daughter are riveting.The film concludes in a downbeat way that only a director like Sean Penn would have been brave enough to attempt in this era of happy Hollywood endings. Though we as audience know that Nicholson was right in his suspicions of the murderer, none of the characters (including Nicholson's) realize this. At the end, everyone gives up on Nicholson, believes he is nuts; &amp; he in turn reverts to a life of booze &amp; unintelligible muttering. It is heartbreaking to watch. As you watch Wright flay Nicholson for letting her daughter be a lure for the murderer; and we watch Nicholson react w. sullen silence to the onslaught, we are twisted into paroxysms of sadness for him. You realize the moral complexity of the situation: in order to keep faith w. other parents who've lost children to this murderer, Nicholson has endangered the daughter of a woman he has come to love. And she in turn comes to hate him when she learns what he has done. This is a profound moral dilemma.Penn has created a masterful film, proving yet again that he is one of our better directors. "The Pledge" is one of which he can rightly feel proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had rather low expectations for The Pledge - even though I've admired Penn as an actor (Dead Man Walking, Racing With The Moon, etc.) I really didn't care much for his writing/directing attempts (Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard) so I finally got around to watching this on cable and I was not prepared for how intriguing, intelligent and emotionally powerful the movie was. Yes, obviously, from other people's comments, this isn't every one's cup of tea. Fine. You want quickie thriller, wall to wall action - go watch Con Air or something. Popcorn movies are fine. People need to turn off their brains and escape every now and then (Unfortunately for big budget movies - its more NOW and very rarely THEN)&gt; So that is why I really enjoyed the slow pace and the ambiguity of the plot - it left things out there for you to find, to discover, to ponder. Nicholson - who is so capable of just phoning it in lately or just doing a gig for a paycheck (Anger Management - YIKES!!!) - but here he really delivers a strong, aching performance. He is surrounded by excellent actors (especially Del Toro, Eckhart and a very impressive tiny scene from Mickey Rourke). I know there are huge fans of the German book and the movie - I will seek them out. But I have watched this film twice and it is even more powerful the second time. One CAN be driven mad by NEVER knowing something so ghastly, something so important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb drama. Top 5 of the decade so far without a doubt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been an admirer of Sean Penn's previous directorial efforts ('The Indian Runner' and 'The Crossing Guard'), but he has really surpassed himself with this one. Re-teamed with Jack Nicholson he has helped that legendary actor create his best on screen performance since his 1970s peak ('Five Easy Pieces', 'Last Detail', 'Cuckoo's Nest', 'Marvin Gardens' et al). Nicholson has always been sensational but over the last ten years or so has sleepwalked his way through way too many movies, culminating in his irritating and mannered performance in the cliched and sentimental claptrap 'As Good As It Gets'. 'The Pledge' has obviously recharged his creative batteries. He is simply stunning in this film.Nicholson is supported by a superlative array of actors, ranging from Aaron Eckhart ('The Company Of Men') and Sam Shepard ('The Right Stuff') to British vets Helen Mirren and Vanessa Redgrave, to Nicholson's old cronies Lois Smith ('Five Easy Pieces') and Harry Dean Stanton ('The Rebel Rousers'). While the cast is packed with familiar faces, none are gratuitous, all are first rate, and contribute to the overall excellence of the movie. Special mention must be made to the memorable cameos of Benicio Del Toro, and an as especially compelling performance by Mickey Rourke. Long underrated and often ridiculed, Rourke once again shows just how compelling he is as an actor.'The Pledge' sticks out like a sore thumb in today's climate of wall to wall action movies, dumb comedies, and contrived "blockbusters". This is a real movie, with outstanding acting and a haunting story. Sadly fewer and fewer movies of this calibre are hitting the big screen, so treasure it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson in a tormenting, riveting performance. ***1/2 out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PLEDGE / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four) By Blake French: Don't go to "The Pledge" expecting it to be a suspense thriller with a lot of fast-paced action and the tension peak high. By the misleading trailer and TV ads, I was personally expecting the above. "The Pledge," directed by the underrated actor and producer Sean Penn, is more of an unraveling drama than a genuine nail-biter. The film is a lot more than a conventional, run of the mill chiller. It vividly describes the process in which a person goes through before he reaches the state of insanity. The movie is most outwardly about obsession and commitment, more subtly about loneliness and depravity. This is one the most unusually absorbing movies of the new year.Sean Penn is often overlooked as a Hollywood figure. He is an actor more often then he is a director (his most memorable directing feature was "The Crossing Guard"), but his work quite variegated. In 1998, Penn Portrayed a Sergeant in Terrence Malick's acclaimed war drama "The Thin Red Line," and a drug addicted Hollywood casting agent in "Hurlyburly." In 1997, he portrayed Michael Douglas' estranged brother in David Fincher's mystery thriller "The Game," and a down-on-his-luck drifter in Oliver Stone's gritty film noir "U-Turn." He delivered his most powerful performance in 1995 as a man on death row in "Dead Man Walking." Now, with "The Pledge" he is harrowing and intense, even though the script is often slow moving and monotonous. The stark edge and superior direction give the movie an authentic feel and emotional vigor. Sean Penn once again proves himself to be an excellent filmmaker especially behind the screen.  The enormously talented, Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson stars as the retiring Reno homicide detective Jerry Black. Jerry is a superb investigator, and when he examines his final case, the sexual assault and murder of an eight-year-old girl, he promises the victim's mother he will find the individual in charge of the atrocity. Police quickly bring in a mentally handicapped American Indian (Benicio Del Toro), who was found fleeing the crime scene and previously served time for rape and various other crimes. It appears that the officers found the man responsible, and when he confesses to the crime and kills himself, the other officers, including Jerry's friend, Stan (Aaron Eckhart), and their boss (Sam Shepard), consider this an open-shut case. Jerry has a gut-feeling this person is not who they are looking for, however.  The remainder of the movie is not about a police investigation, but more about Jerry Black's reaction to the events that have taken place. His obsession with catching the killer eventually leads to him going crazy, after he betrays his new friends, a single mother (Robin Wright Penn), and her young daughter. I personally desired more material involving the investigation instead of the development of the relationship between him and Robin Wright Penn's character, but that is not what the movie intended for us to watch. Regardless, the story arguably begins at its strongest point, and gradually losses much momentum as the mystery is not fully explored, and certain elements feel setup but are not paid off. Some of the production's technical areas are also very astonishing, like the original music by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer, and the cinematography by Chris Menges. Such ambient factors make for a sleepy and tranquil mood similar to the one in "Fargo." This film's soundtrack contains enthralling, refreshing, and captivating instrumental tones. Jack Nicholson is tormenting, riveting. He is the central of the movie, and it doesn't pretends otherwise. His performance provides energy for the story. "The Pledge" is the type of movie that leaves us pondering about the opportunities passed by and the chances missed by the characters, the ironic coincidences, and the perplexing twists. The ending leaves us with more questions than answers, but that factor contributes greatly to the emotional impact the film has. "The Pledge" could have been more than it is, but considering the temptations the screenwriters overcame, it is more than what most of us would expect. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haunting Film With A Great Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unsatisfying endings usually make for box-office bombs and I suspect this one bombed, too. I don't particularly care for them, myself. I'd rather feel good at the end of the film, but I really liked this movie in a strange kind of way. It's weird but it's original and it stayed with me for several days afterward. On the second viewing, knowing what to expect, it didn't haunt me but it was worth that second look....and probably a third one in a few years, too. I didn't care for some of the anti-Christian tones in here, however. That is my only complaint of the movie. A key character - a minister - is made to look evil (typical film-world bias).The rest of the film has a lot to offer: a great performance by Jack Nicholson; a very nice music score; good cinematography; interesting characters and a different, almost-shocking twist at the end.The best part of the film is Nicholson. As usual, Jack is very interesting, playing a low-key role here. The story might be too slow for a lot of folks but it kept my interest all the way. On the second viewing, I appreciated the music even more - a great soundtrack!If you are looking for a crime film that is different, check this out, but don't blame me if you don't like the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware - Major Spoilers Throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ending of this movie stinks. It is the equivalent of telling a child a very suspenseful tale of a prince and a dragon. You build up skillfully to a climactic battle, and as the prince is raising his sword, you say, "But the dragon suddenly had a brain aneurysm and died, leaving the prince looking like a fool who lived unhappily ever after. Hey... sh*t happens, you know?"Before the sneers and mutterings of "philistine" begin, let me say that I know what the screenwriters and the director were going for -- Greek tragedy: a good man, a Hero is brought to ruin by a fatal flaw in his character. The problem is that here, as in all storytelling, a tragic ending must also be a satisfying one for the audience. No matter how sad the hero's fall/demise, no matter what plot twists occur, one has to be able to say, "Well, that's tragic, but it had to happen. It was inevitable." It's a storytelling tightrope, from which the screenwriters and director fell from great heights, crashed and burned.In trying to throw a curve, they threw a spitball; they cheated. A deus ex machina ("Machine of the Gods") is a phony dramatic contrivance where the Gods step in at the end of a story and make everything right again. The hero is off the hook. What happened to the serial killer here was worse than a deus ex machina. He is killed by coincidence. That's just cheating.I would like to suggest what would have been a truly tragic ending. Make Jerry Black a lonelier man. One whose two failed marriages have left him without hope of having a family. Then he meets Lori and Chrissy. His unexpected love for them grows to *almost* the size of his obsession with catching the killer. Give him a true choice between love &amp; obsession and let him pick the wrong one. Then let him catch the goddamned killer. And after he does, this Hero, having fulfilled his task, turns for love and adoration to Lori, who lets him have the same speech she does now and whisks herself and her daughter out of his life. Black then fully realizes what his heroic choice has cost him, and ends up lonely, embittered and perhaps mad.That would have been a satisfying ending, because the way things play now, here's what the audience is thinking, "He deserves to catch the killer. He does not deserve to have this family after endangering Chrissy so horribly."The ending of "The Pledge" is badly, terribly wrong, as it trashes what up until then was one of the finest suspense films I've ever seen and one of Jack Nicholson's greatest performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine, thoughtful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pledge is one of the few films directed by the now respected (if not by the makers of Team America) actor Sean Penn, and it manages to simultaneously remind us why he should direct more, and that Jack Nicholson can act.Let's face it, it's been a while ? our Jack acting, that is. Most of the time he just tilts his head, gives us a manic stare and says "Here's Johnny" in that patented (exclusive rights to Nicholson and his younger avatar, Slater) drawl.Ostensibly, The Pledge is a detective story, with Nicholson playing a retiring police officer (Jerry Black) trying to track down the killer of a young girl. Quickly, a Native American is brought in and induced to confess, although we're never sure whether the confession related to an earlier crime. He then shoots himself. Job done, according to most of the police officers, but not Jerry. He doubts the confession, and has pledged a solemn oath to the girl's mother to find her killer.The Pledge is not really a detective story, though, and there will be no prizes for guessing the killer's identity. The staggeringly obvious choice of Tom Noonan (of Manhunter fame) is proof enough of that. Admittedly, Hollywood is capable of just such crassness of casting where suspense is required, but not, I suspect, Penn.But suspense is at best a distant second in this film; it is more a study of pursuit and how a goal can blind us to the present, and to our actions. Nicholson's performance is truly breathtaking, and one wonders how it could have made barely a ripple when the film came out. Gone is the trademark uber-performance. In its place we are given subtlety, a man playing his age with dignity, and an uncompromising take on obsession, loneliness and folly. If there is a problem in the film it is in his relationship with the much younger Wright Penn. It's implausible, but somehow the gravity defying Nicholson manages even to make that convincing.The film is watchable for Nicholson's performance alone and it could easily have been a vehicle project. Credit to Penn, though, that he was able to assemble such a distinguished cast for. Robin Wright Penn (okay, maybe she wasn't so difficult), Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave and Mickey Rourke all give fine vignettes. But perhaps the most amazing performance was Benicio Del Toro as Toby Wadenah, the accused Native American. I knew he was in the film (one of my reasons for watching it) but I had to double take when I saw him. His performance was breathtaking and worth watching the entire movie, just for the 5 minutes he was in it.Sean Penn's directorial style is similar to Clint Eastwood's. He leaves a lot of space in The Pledge and the film proceeds at a measured pace coming in at just over two hours, which allows the actors plenty of room to work. His characters are mainly working class or lower middle class. The camera-work is starkly beautiful rather than pretty, and focuses on a bleak America that gets little airtime from the soft focus brigade in California.Penn is also, like Eastwood, brave enough to tie up the ends loosely at best. The ending may be downbeat, but it is uplifting to see that American cinema is still capable of making films like this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not that crazy about the story, which has been put to film at least twice before. (I think the other movie is The Cold Light of Day.) In the other movie, which was set in one of the Soviet bloc countries, there was also a serial killer after young girls, and the detective makes the morally questionable decision to put a girlfriends daughter unknowingly at risk to use as bait. The swingset for the girl beside the road (where the killer would be sure to see her) was copied over from the novel.For sheer moviemaking prowess, though, this team of actors and Penn as the director is unbeatable. Every performance comes across with perfect sincerity and you forget you are looking at famous actors. There are some surreal touches as well, when bit players from the early part show up on screen late in the story with non speaking roles. Four stars. Even if you don't like Jack Nicholson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The basics: Penn is the next Woody Allen, but more adept and more visceral. His own understanding of acting attracts some top flight talent, and here they are all as good as it gets. Even Micky Rourke is powerful! Nicholson starts a new career. Making a film is all about abstraction, and since it is a collective art, managing all the abstractions so that a single vision projects. The odder the vision, the more worthwhile, and the harder to corral. This man ruthlessly exploits everything that streams at us (including the music -- so apt). Del Toro is worth mentioning because he is currently in two other films of merit. But the cinematic flash there is all in support of either nothing (Snatch) or thin narrative support for a relatively vapid insight (Traffic). Here, not only is Del Toro amazingly real, but the whole film delivers powerful dramatic effect integrated with narrative, unlike the other two which are mostly dance.The IMDB comments posted before this are largely negative, and I speculate these are from younger folk -- further that the audience Pledge grabs in the gut will be among more experienced souls. The ending is great, the biggest emotional cliff since `Limbo.'But all that is just surface stuff -- a man pledging his soul and losing it when the bargain is usatisfiable. The really interesting thing is the ambiguity of the narrative. We know Penn is concerned with this issue -- really hot among thinking directors for the past couple years. Here he (and the original book) play Nabokov -- the pacing of the film resembles a madman's reminiscences. Yes, there are too many coincidences in the story. Yes it is framed by a mad drunk's mumblings. Yes, the camera deliberately takes non-contemporary human viewer perspectives. Yes, there are discontinuities. Yes, the `Lolita' references were many and obvious.What we have here folks is a multilayered weaving of reality and imagination. We saw Penn act at these two levels simultaneously in Woody's `Sweet and Lowdown.' Now he coaches buddy Jack (who has more to give and more to lose) into a more nuanced dual-level performance. This will endure when `Snatch' is long gone.This is the first 10 I give in 12 months of theater releases. That's about 100 films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not entirely convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short, this is a story about a decent man driven to madness by an obsession. This story line has been covered with great success by many film makers and screenwriters many times before, but Penn's effort falls short, mainly due to a contrived and highly coincidental storyline.Nicholson plays a cop who is entering retirement. Just hours before he is officially retired a young girl is found raped and killed. The only witness is a young boy who sees a long haired Indian man running from the scene of the crime. The boy does not see the crime happening. The Indian is quickly located and brought to the the police station. Turns out that he has past convictions for child abuse and drugs. He is also clearly retarded and with a little plodding from the cops confesses to the murder and then shoots himself with a cop's gun. Case closed right? Not so for Nicholson. He has promised the dead girl's parents that he will find the killer, and he is not convinced the Indian did it. Needles to day his fellow cops do not agree and the case is closed. Nicholson goes on his retirement but his promise still plays on his mind.Now begins a long and at times unnecessarily meandering tale of Nicholson's slow degeneration into mad obsession. Penn tries to bring conviction to the story by portraying Nicholson attempting to settle down into a life of normal retirement and yet driven into pursuing the investigation by a series of subtle events that persuades him that the actual killer is still at large. This type of mood story requires skilled handling by the director, and Penn does not seem to have it (length does not necessarily create mood). Along the way we see Vanessa Redgrave, Helen Mirren and Mickey Rourke in a series of cameos. Does nothing to improve the story though.Nicholson in the central role acts like he is doing a favour to Penn by appearing in this movie. He does not appear to be giving 100% to this role. At times he looks like even he is unconvinced about the transformation of his character.The most noteworthy aspect of this film is Penn's ability to get so many great actors together for this movie. Pity that their presence is not going to save this movie from obscurity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To sum up : long, confusing, but mostly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like this movie; it was way too long, the editing was terrible (how many times can we see Nicholson fishing), and the overly present music badly chosen. I found Nicholson good though. Without going through the whole movie, many question were left unanswered (***SPOILERS***: 1) The dramatic début of the movie, with the 5 minute-long discussion that ends up with Nicholson's Pledge, seem to indicate that the movie will be about a cop trying to find a child-killer. The next part of the movie, a ten-minute-long interview (way too long, by the way) with a first suspect seem to follow in that direction also. 2) The scene with the child-therapist seem to add a twist when a chain-smoking, sweating Nicholson looks like the above-mentionned killer. Key to this scene is when the therapist asks him if he is still sexually active. Why this question ? Probably because she suspects his obsession with young little girls being raped is unusual. Since she is a therapist, we should pay attention to this scene. (Unless the movie doesn't really have a storyline, which is probable). 3) Nicholson falling in love with a woman which is not particularly pretty, but has a cute little blonde girl of almost 8 years old. During the movie, I felt as if Nicholson fell in love with the mother because of her daughter. A scene in particular, at the beginning of their relationship, highly insinuates that Nicholson is flirting with the little girl. (But maybe this scene is only to cause confusion). 4) Nicholson is seen drinking at the beginning of the movie, and the officer says he is a drunk. Is he ? We did not see him drinking during the whole movie (except for the beginning and the end). 5) We see Nicholson looking suspiciously at just about anybody. We get the idea that the officer suffers from an obsessive paranoia of some sort. 6) The whole story about a giant, a large man offering candy to attract little girls is probably a story that nourishes Nicholson's own fantasy world. Nicholson attaches so much importance on that whole narrative, that we understand that he is obsessed by big man seducing little girls with chocolate. 7) He litteraly sets up a fantasy scene where his little blonde girl is attacked by the real killer. No parent in the world would ever do such a crazy thing, unless, of course, he finally wants to see it happen.All these put together, the movie seems to suggest that officer Black (Nicholson) is a pedophile who gets a libidinal kick out of pursuing cases involving little blonde girls being raped. He can then indulge in his fantasy without actually doing it (highly suspicious is here the scene where he steals from another police officer a picture of a 8 year old victim). Black then falls in love with the killer's next victim (which he probably chose because she fits the victims profile, but that part of the movie is still really far fetched, talk about luck), gets a kick at watching all day long this cute little potential victim, trying to imagine all the big men that could sexually molest her, and then goes crazy when the fantasy scene doesn't occur. If this conclusion is true, they probably diluted it to make it acceptable by adding a non-sensical beginning (abd all these fishing shots). If I'm all wrong, then the movie doesn't really make sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, boring and doesn't really go anywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This whole review is a spoiler so dont bother until after you see it****By the time this movie ended I felt like snapping the DVD in half. I was so appalled that I came to the IMDB site to see how badly other users had rated it. To my astonishment it has an overall rating of about 7?!? and it seems that most of you inexplicably like it?To be more objective, I have to conceed to some good acting on Jacks part, there is some fine camera work and the scenery is beautiful. Unfortunately the story is not.The movie seems to change its mind about where its heading about 4 times. It starts as a standard detective thriller, then its about retirement escapism, then its becomes a love story and finally it remembers its meant to be about solving (or not solving) a murder and quickly wraps it all up.Ok, I understand that there is a lot of subtlety to the movie and it does explore more meaningful issues of ageing, dimentia and of course the tradgedy of the unresolved crime leading to Jacks insanity because of his unfulfilled pledge. There is also the additional tradgedy that he was right all along and that the killer was on the way to the rondezvous before slamming into a truck, therefore destroying all hope of the mystery ever being solved. In a nutshell Jack was an unlucky bunny. I havent missed the irony! These would have made excellent plot points but for the films failure to tell the story with any degree of clarity. It tries to be clever but is just overly subtle.I just wish it hadn't taken 2 and a half hours to do it. It really sucks you in because the direction is good and you know you are watching what should be a quality movie. The ending however is perhaps the biggest anti climax I have ever seen. When I first saw it I have to confess I didn't entirely get it and hadn't figured out who the killer was. It was only when reading some of the other comments that I confirmed what had really happened.The biggest problem for me was the lack of development of the killer. I wanted to find out why he was butchering little girls. The film hinted at a timing pattern but never developed it. Also, some of the earlier scenes are designed to mislead you. When the first body is discovered the young boy sees an indian chief walking back to a pick up truck after commiting the murder. This is the only evidence we see and is the basis for the initial wrongfull arrest. Can anyone explain to me what this has to do with the killer at the end? The real killer seems to be white caucaision and drives a large black saloon. We never see the killer but if he is the son of the porcupine shop lady, he can't be indian.Just because a film is slow, subtle, artistic and well acted does not make it a masterpiece. The cameo performances were well acted but what happened to Helen Mirren? She had one scene that suggested a deeper involvement in the film and then never appeared again?Also How much time is supposed to have passed from the first murder to the end of the film. As far as I can gather it must be at least 18 months but again its open to interpretation.Films like this are often critically acclaimed. I think the truth is that nobody gets it first time around but most are too embarrased to admit it. The fact that eventual scrutiny allows you to reach some conclusions only allows pretentious critics to be superior and condemn anyone that doesn't understand. This movie is not as clever as it tries to be and the issues it raises are not worth such lengthy exploration. There is not enough meat on the bones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak points and pessimism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a couple of weak points. Unfortunately, such points are so weak that eclipse all the talent in the movie.First of all, the movie has two clearly differentiated parts that just don't mix well (making a *very* different portrait of detective Jerry Black on each part). Maybe there's some will of creating contrast by concatenation of hope and tragedy in the same movie but, if that was the real will, the movie fails: it gets absurdity rather than contrast.Secondly, the story is built from a serious promise. The scene where the promise is made is very disappointing because of the weak arguments, circumstances, and acting, for such a serious promise.Also, as an additional comment, I wish to add that this movie shows a pessimistic view of the experienced old people. If you love stories where young people learn from old people, you may prefer other kind of films rather than this one.I watched the original version of this movie when I was a child ("Es geschah am hellichten Tag" -- 1958), and I remember it as a very nice experience. I think I enjoyed it a lot, although I don't remember why (I was too young).I've been very disappointed by this Hollywood remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the payoff?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***I went into this movie just knowing the basics about the story, and was not familiar with the book or the previous film made on it. It really played well for me, but I had a bad feeling it wasn't going to end "satisfactorily" to my tastes, and it didn't. I wanted to see Nicholson's character prove everybody wrong and catch the real killer, but Penn (or the screenplay) didn't let him. In fact, he left way too many dangling questions throughout the movie. It appears that the Tom Noonan character was the killer, and in fact was on his way to another grisly episode when he was in a car wreck at the end. I thought they showed his cross on the charred remains after the accident, but wasn't quite sure. Also, Del Toro's confession was never fully explained. Throw in the eerie parade shot of the chubby kid reappearing along with the sighting of the Patricia Clarkson and Michael O'Keefe characters later in the movie, and you've got way more theories than answers. We're finally left with a drunken, destitute Jack mumbling outside his rundown gas station. I wanted something better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not My Cup Of Tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've wanted to see this movie for ages, so was overjoyed to get it on DVD. I've heard nothing but good reviews for it, so I was waiting with baited breath.It started off at a slow, moody pace. I didn't have a problem with that. The slowly mounting sense of dread can be as effective as being thrown in the deep end of suspense. Things trudged along at this unhurried pace. I still sat and watched intently. It was just out of being good. I was thinking to myself "Any time now, the real meat of the plot's going to kick in." Eventually, things looked like they were going to get interesting, a great story was about to come together by the looks of it. I thought that this was where it would start to get good. Then the credits started to roll up the screen.I can see why some people would like this movie, but I for one found it very disappointing. I read that it was "Jack Nicholson's best role in years." They could have got Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell or Martin Sheen to play the same role. It was a generic character that wasn't really testing Nicholson. Sure, he was good in the role, but Jack Nicholson can be good in any role. This was nothing special, and a poor follow-up to his Oscar-winning performance in "As Good As It Gets" which is one of his best roles in years.The only consolation I can get is that I didn't waste any money on this: I got it free with "The Shining": truly a fantastic Jack Nicholson movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb film true to the spirit of the Dürrenmatt original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspect it is more of a European kind of film: no ban on slowness, reflection, and no need for a clearcut happy ending. Many Europeans have probably also read the Dürrenmatt original - the very idea of the book is to demonstrate the artificiality of the clearcut, satisfying endings of most detective stories (including European ones such as Agathat Christie's:))) The main character tells a story to the narrator about a colleague who was a brilliant detective, was absolutely right in his conclusions (that nobody shared) and set up the ideal trap for the killer. And then something as stupid, irrational and "un-clear-cut" as a traffic accident that killed the murderer (just as in this movie) ruined everything. Ultimately, the truth was revealed but too late for the detective who had already ruined himself. I had read the original but totally forgotten about it(and the movie's American setting did nothing to remind me of it) until the end of the movie hit me with full force ("I remember now, I have read about it!") One does not have a usual "surprise" ending here but a genuine shock. And a recognition that life IS messy, that we have come to expect from detective stories a kind of orderliness that we think is there in real life but that actually only serves us as an escape from reality. Now never expect an escape from reality from Dürrenmatt! Perhaps I am influenced by the original (yet I do not quite think so since I only remembered it at the end), but sincerely I did not see any kind of undue "obsession" in the film. So a cop (OK, a retired cop) knows that there is a serial killer at large - one that is likely to strike again - and does everything to prevent this: even without the pledge it would have made sense. Incidentally, I totally agree with the commentator who suggests that the owner of the Christmas shop was the actual criminal. I did not give 10 for a film with superb actors and acting as well as superb directing for reasons that another commentator found crucial - the implausibility that the accident would not have come out and be linked to the potential crime both by the police and especially by the main character himself. The original did no have such small and close-knit communities so the ignorance was more plausible. But it is still a masterful film with the main message - that totally irrational chances can ruin our best rational efforts - coming across clear and loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst I like the concept of this film - that in real life, the good guy rarely gets the bad guy - I couldn't help feeling cheated by this film.If the film was supposed to be a drama on real-life inadequacy, I wish it had started that way, instead of pretending to be a really good psychological thriller. The first hour was excellently paced, but then the film changed tack and meandered around Nicholson's confusing character, steering right away from the plot. By the end I was well and truly bewildered as to the identity of the killer and the whole point of this film. Nicholson's acting was more subtle for once, unlike his usual over-rated hammy style. It was evident that Wright was only cast because of her marital status rather than any skill she might possess. Notable performances were Del Toro and Eckhart, whose fine looks helped the film immensely!As a fan of Penn I was very disappointed with this film, which ultimately was trying to prove a point that is made in the papers every day! Thought-provoking, but left a bitter taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, what a disappointment! Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors and the previews for this movie looked really great. I was expecting a great police drama, and that's how it looked like it was going to be from the first quarter, but as soon as it started to get artsy, THE PLEDGE just kept getting worse and worse right up to that ending, which is probably one of the most anti-climatic endings of all time. The last three quarters of the story, which focuses on Detective Jerry Black's (Jack Nicholson) unhealthy obsession with his promise to solve the crime, do not mesh well with the first quarter, and it drags and drags and DRAGS. Watching this movie, you'll notice that at one point, nothing significant at all happens for 45 MINUTES! If that isn't bad pacing, I don't know what is. I too was hoping that the ending would be so good that it could make up for the boring and badly paced movie before it, but it only made the movie worse. I won't write it here, but when the movie was over I was feeling cheated and unsatisfied.Sean Penn's direction is good (in some parts great, especially in the scene in which Detective Black told the murdered girl's parents the bad news), but at times it seemed like he over-directed. Jack Nicholson was good, but the subtley he used in playing that character would've worked better if the movie wasn't so BORING in the first place. I found myself looking at the floor or ceiling more than once.I think I'm being generous with the grade I gave it. Jack Nicholson fans are the only people who should think about watching this.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want to make everything right, everything goes wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie I was really looking forward to watching. It has an impressive cast and the story by Friedrich Durrenmatt is really worth turning it into a movie for a second time. That's why I wasn't just disappointed but angry when I came out of the theatre: this film want's to make everything right but does everything wrong. The mind-numbing soundtrack of Hans Zimmer(the most over-estimated composer in film music history) gets on your nerves right from the beginning.In his ambition to show the real American countryside, Sean Penn only chose ugly looking actors. That is not a problem per se, the problem is that Penn is yelling:"Look, how authentic we are!" in almost every shot of the movie. Apart from that, Penn doesn't seem to have done any directors-work at all. It is so sad to see Jack Nicholson play merely the shadows of his former roles. There's only one scene showing the wasted possibilities of this Film: Mickey Rourke as the father of a missing child gives an outstanding but very, very short performance. Dear Mr. Penn, stop directing stay with acting!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overpowering Obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tragic story about an ex-cop who falls into the grip of an overpowering obsession is told in a style that's riveting, powerful and thought-provoking. The atmosphere is consistently unsettling, the action is often disturbing and Hans Zimmer's wonderful score complements the mood of the piece perfectly. Its interesting set-up is typical of a routine murder mystery but soon it becomes clear that what's to follow is going to be far less predictable. Additionally, a marvellous plot twist very late on in the movie leaves each of the main characters with the wrong impression of what they've just experienced and for the ex-cop, this proves to be devastating.During a retirement party for homicide detective (and reluctant retiree) Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), Reno Police Department receives a report that the dead body of an 8-year-old girl has been found in a snow-covered wood nearby. It transpires that young Ginny Larsen had been brutally murdered and sexually assaulted and that the youngster who discovered her body had seen a man leaving the crime scene. Native American Toby Jay Wadenah (Benicio Del Toro) is a known sex-offender who fits the description provided by the youngster and soon the mentally handicapped suspect is taken in for questioning.Jerry's aggressive colleague Stan Krolak (Aaron Eckhart) interviews the profoundly confused suspect and elicits a confession but very shortly after, Wadenah grabs a police officer's gun and kills himself. Krolak, Police Captain Eric Pollack (Sam Shepard) and all their colleagues immediately regard the case as closed but Jerry isn't convinced that Wadenah was the killer. When Jerry tells the victim's parents the dreadful news about their daughter, he's pressured by Ginny's mother into promising to find the real killer. Having made this promise, he carries on with his investigation after his retirement and soon discovers evidence to support a theory that Ginny's murder was one of a series in which the victims were young blonde girls who wore red dresses. When he shares his findings with Krolak and Pollack, they regard his theory as absurd and think that he's become irrational.Jerry goes fishing, buys a run down gas station and starts a relationship with a local waitress who has a young daughter. His preoccupation with the theory that only he believes and his commitment to fulfilling the promise he made, turn his investigation into an obsession so strong that it drives him to do something terrible and eventually lose everything that he values, including his sanity.Jack Nicholson's remarkable performance is subtle, sensitive and subdued and his ability to convey his character's feelings so effectively is very impressive. "The Pledge" is a haunting movie with a supporting cast that includes a number of top class actors (e.g. Benicio Del Toro, Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton, Mickey Rourke etc.) in a series of cameo roles which all leave an indelible impression and enrich the quality of the whole undertaking enormously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never have so many people got the killer's identity wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant movie, surely one of the masterpieces of 21st century cinema to date. It is its fate to be under-rated and under-appreciated, but to those who can see, its genius is obvious and compelling.While the identity of the murderer is definitely NOT the point, it IS clearly and unambiguously revealed; however, judging from countless misinterpretations and misidentifications, both here and overheard in the cinema when I saw it, this apparently counts as a spoiler even for a lot of people who HAVE already seen the film...SPOILERS The killer is seen only in passing. He is the man, called "Oliver" by his wife, in the "Land of Christmas" shop. If you re-watch the movie closely, this should be apparent. If you need more explicitly listed evidence, keep reading.The killer, known as the Magician, is very tall, to the point where one of the victims calls him a giant. Note the shot from above the door of the "Land of Christmas" shop when Nicholson enters. The camera is inside the shop, above the door, looking down towards the floor. The bell that rings catches our attention, but if you look again you will see how unusually high this door is - see how much taller the door is than Nicholson? Much higher than a normal-sized door. This shot is also repeated near the very end of the movie, in the sequence where all the clues to the killer's identity are summarised.When we do glimpse Oliver in the shop, in the scene where Nicholson enters the "Land of Christmas" asking for directions to the girl's grandmother's house, he has the grey hair that we see the killer has when driving towards the rendezvous at the end of the film (which he never reaches due to the accident). We learn subsequently that the girl would visit the "Land of Christmas", also.After the killer has started his drive towards the rendezvous, as part of the "clue summarising" we return to the "Land of Christmas", with his wife calling out for him.The absolute clincher, though, is the fact that the "Land of Christmas" sells small chocolate "porcupines". (We see his wife mention them and take out a box of them when she is searching for him.) It was of course these that he would give to his victims, as depicted in the child's drawing.Incidentally, the point of the close-up of the rear-vision mirror in the burning car is to show the small porcupine figurine hanging from it. The Tom Noonan character is a decoy, and definitely not the killer.Hopefully anyone re-watching it after reading the above will be able to see for themselves. :) One fascinating angle I've not seen commented on is the way Penn's tirade at Nicholson at the end of the movie would, word for word, apply just as well as if Nicholson had been abusing her daughter himself... Rewatch the scene and see how well that jibes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising film that does not deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to have some very interesting possibilities that were never fully developed. The characters were not nearly as fully developed -- watching Jack Nicholson go fishing and tending a gas store is not character development. The film had many great ideas but did not take advantage of them, instead becoming a long, drawn-out film that leaves the viewer rather unsatisfied. The film starts out strong but simply lugs along rather clumsily; I was waiting for it to come together at the end, and it never did. There were more questions than answers about Nicholson's character, and I felt I knew less about him at the end than I did at the beginning. Even the excellent acting cannot save the heavily flawed script and directing. Overall a disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen 'The pledge' a few times before, but after having seen the original 'Es geschah am hellichten tag' (1958) not too long ago, I thought I'd catch this one on the telly - in spite of commercials. It's now for the first time I found out who exactly the killer is, although it could be argued that this man (the husband of the candy store woman) is another red herring - I personally would think that to be a total stretch. But then, if he is the killer, why wouldn't Jerry (or anyone else) find out about this accident with a black car and that the dead man is quite tall, and he sold little hedgehog candy in his store? And why did Jerry drink and drive anyway (at beginning of the film)? It's probably an indication of his deteriorating state.Anyhoo, the film has lots of wonderful cinematography, a rather slow pacing and plenty of soothing, beautiful music. But somehow I don't feel that Jack Nicholson's talent was utilized enough, which must have had something to do with the direction, but also with that contrived development in the story, in which the friendship between Lori and Jerry suddenly becomes a relationship. It didn't feel plausible to me. Then, there were small supporting roles by quite a few unexpected familiar faces, such as Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton, Vanessa Redgrave and Helen Mirren, mostly just single scenes - how odd and how inane that all seemed, cameos like that in a film like this.But the film, as a whole, was certainly 'entertaining' enough, being a '90s thriller from the 21st century. And with its considerable length, it felt a bit like a miniseries, which was not a bad thing.For this attempt, I'm much more mild than for the 1958 version, since Lori gives Jerry hell eventually and the whole story has a better build-up. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting masterpiece with a knockout cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn's The Pledge is an agonizing, uncompromising, unique, emotionally wrenching slice of unconventional cop drama that will raise the hairs on your arm and have you in tears in equal measures. Penn has no interest in genre conventions, or giving us a tidy, cathartic resolution to the films central mystery. Hell we're lucky we got the subtle answer he gave at all, and people still complain it's not enough. Goes to show you how many people watch films expecting narrative training wheels included in the DVD. Oh well. Jack Nicholson gives a tired, tortured performance as burnt out police detective Jerry Black, who gets a murder case of the worst kind in his last week before retirement. In a desolate snowy field, the body of a 6 year old girl has been found, raped and murdered. When her devastated mother (Patricia Clarkson in a cameo that touches scary roots of sadness), makes Jerry promise to find her killer, he is galvanized into an obsessive and ultimately self destructive hunt across several states. He has a gut feeling that the mentally challenged native American (Benicio Del Toro in a very disconcerting, typically eccentric cameo), who was seen near the scene, confessed under the hothead ed bullying tactics of sergeant Aaron Eckhart and then killed himself, is in fact innocent. He finds himself haunted with finding the real killer, and strings together a plausible yet far-fetched chain of similar occurrences in nearby states that although can't be proved, he doggedly pursues. We see a man destroyed by his pledge and the lengths that a person will go to find the truth, sometimes not even just for the truths sake, but for their own sake so that their soul may rest. It's rough, hard hitting cinema that will put a lump in your throat and squeeze your heart out to dry, but it's also a beautifully made, loving piece, boistered by its unique narrative and unbelievable supporting cast. Watch for a heartbreaking cameo from Mickey Rourke, and welcome work from Helen Mirren, Costas Mandylor, Tom Noonan, Sam Shepherd, Robin Wright Penn, Harry Dean Stanton and Vanessa Redgrave. It's one of the best casts ever assembled. Penn directs with a mournful, ambient, melancholic hurt that gives reverence to the tragic story, never exploiting the subject matter or going for cheap thrills. It's a massively underrated emotional knockout of a film, but be warned, it goes to some truly despairing places, and doesn't lead you out of them to resolution. Anyone who can't handle that should remember that the minute the lights go up and they walk out of the theatre they are back in the real world where these things happen, and there's no happy ending or credits to stop the sorrow. This movie tells it like it is.</fullReview>

First, I thought the police interrigation scene with Aaron Ekhart and Benicio Del Toro was awful- way over-acted and not realistic at all. When you work for the police dept (like me) you know first hand how many flaws this movie had. And Jack Nicholson's promise to "find the killer" was also just plain dumb- police dont do that. I did not understand why the image of the chubby little boy kept re-appearing throughout the movie. I cannot believe this movie averaged 7 out of 10 stars on this site- too generous. If Sean Penn would of done more research on police work prior to making this film, it could of been alot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good start and a good unusual ending. But it is mind numbingly long and very boring.I guess they are trying to go for realistic looking people, and a pace that would be more akin to a British Drama (but the Brits would have done it better) but it fails. Mainly because Americans very often fail at doing drama. They should stick to the crash boom bang big action movies, that American do do very well</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see that this movie had much depth, and it takes deep thinking to understand it all. I will still talk firsthand and say that this movie never unfolded it's purpose. This movie was 2 hours and 5 minutes of total drag. Jack Nicholson in his most boring and slowest acting performances I've seen yet. He trys to be this tough, yet sympathetic(retired, have you) detective who goes around picking up clues from things as little as kids drawings. The acting was horrible, yet somehow interesting(what a mix) and everyone seemed to be lost. I can't see what Sean Penn was trying to tell the audience when this movie ended. It makes you hold your breathe for nothing. Although, I did enjoy the little cameo by Benicio Del Toro as Toby. Gee, he would have been better off as the detective(sheesh!). The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was the mystery it portrayed. Though, the mystery went unsolved in debating whether this movie was worth my time. I came to the conclusion that it wasn't.

		<shortDescription>A remake of a Swiss-German movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After about one hour, I began to realise that this movie is in fact a remake of a German-language movie from 1958, namely "Es geschah am helllichten Tag" (in English: it happened in broad daylight). That movie is a nice retro nostalgic watching experience with an excellent and equally chainsmoking Heinz Rühmann in the main role.The beginning of this version is quite strong (the interview and "confession" of the indian). But, sadly, for the rest of the movie, Sean Penn sticks to most of the original movie. (the children's drawing, the gas station, ...)The outcome of the plot is very predictable and thin. A story like this certainly worked in the fifties but not in 2002.As for Jack Nicholson, it's always difficult to say whether he's doing an original acting job or one of his numerous versions of the Jack Nicholson madman character. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.As it is, I don't like it when people smoke too much in a movie.Dries Van Dongen Belgium, Europe</fullReview>

How could an experienced detective not know who in the community was the killer and pursued evidence to get him arrested. The setup with the litte girl was too much! Also, why wouldn't he have alerted the Reno cops that this is the person identified in the orginal child's drawing of a person who drives a black station wagon so when they saw the wreak they would known it was the killer and that he had been on his way to murder? The only thing that kept me watching was the riveting performance by Nicholson - maybe one of his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to compare this film to a tire full of air that eventually hits a nail and by the end loses all the air. In order words, a very flat second half of the film leading to a contrived and not very good ending. After a fairly suspenseful beginning, the movie loses it ability to sustain the viewer's interest. Sean Penn does a good job of directing, and the cinematography is excellent (especially the water views), but the story loses its punch and ends with a whimper. Jack Nicholson is, as usual, great in this portrayal of an anti-hero or tragic figure. I supose what I'm really annoyed with is the simplistic manner used to twist the ending. It's a question of whether or not you're willing to buy that contrivance, and I am not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real downer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really enjoying this movie until it got even more sick, depressing, and outlandish. Jack Nicholson does a nice job, as does Robin Wright Penn (as usual). Likewise, Sean Penn's directing was very good. He only occasionally dropped into a film cliche - like where the cop tells someone their loved one is dead and Penn chooses to pull back and show the scene from afar (seen it!). Overall, though, it keeps you engrossed, trying to figure out if Nicholson's character is crazy or sane, right or wrong, good or evil. Some of my criticisms: he was a cop - why doesn't he inquire more at the places the girl and Toby were knew to hang out? Also, my biggest shock was when cops put a young girl into jeopardy without her mother knowing -- yeah, right! The one redeemer was the ending song, "Why" which I think explained what Sean Penn had in mind with this movie. Basically, it says people do good every day, and then one person does complete evil. It ends, "Don't ask me why. I don't know." A good premise, but he would have been better off just doing the music video :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty and pretty dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Pledge" tells the unexciting story of retired cop Jerry Black, who retires to a small community in an attempt to solve one last case.This film is dull. One reviewer here tried to claim that anyone who found it dull was clearly lacking an attention span, and that the film was obviously a work of genius. I disagree - I have an attention span when there's something to catch my attention. This film doesn't have one. Sean Penn seems to think that slow, lingering shots of scenery, and various "character-richening" moments make a good movie. No, they don't. They make for a bit of yawning. I can appreciate stories told over a longer length of time - look at the work of David Lean. Penn has not such a talent.Nicholson is, as usual, good playing the cop so determined to solve the murder case that it consumes his whole life, and he begins to become unbalanced. You cannot argue much with the man's acting abilities. However he is forced to follow a plodding script. The story's hardly complex - it's fairly easy to follow. In fact there's only one moment that made me sit up in surprise, and that resolved into a let-down. The film has a certain inevitability about it that may be admired, in that it refuses to do the usual turn-of-fate and instead go for "realism", but that doesn't stop me from glancing at my watch as it all plays out.I can't really recommend "The Pledge". It's dull, has an intrusive score by Hans Zimmer, and the presence of Nicholson is just not good enough. Don't bother - 4.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see, that a lot of people liked this movie a lot. I actually don't. The characters/actors and the initial plot is great but the movie suffers from the big problem that it does not know what kind of movie it want's to be. In the first half hour or so, it seems to be a cool and exciting thriller police drama like it has been seen lots of times before but still well made so it makes you want to see more.But then focus shifts and the movie is all of a sudden about the retirement crisis of Jack Nicholsons character. This goes on until the very end with the final scene as the exception where the crime is solved/unsolved (depending on how you interpret the ending). In my opinion the director should have decided to only focus on one of these plots and the personal crisis of Jack N goes on for far too long for my taste anyway, so I would have preferred a standard police drama.Many have complained about the ending, but I think in a way this ending is ok. It is just the whole idea of the movie itself which is a major problem. Too bad, cause there are some really good actors in this movie.</fullReview>

The story can be told in one line: Retired Cop tries to solve one last (brutal) case.So what else is their to say. Some of the violence is to graphic. I am used to a lot, and I didn't think it was necessary the way they showed it. Look at the classic "Psycho". It didn't show much and was horrific nevertheless. Just because you CAN, doesn't mean you have to. The story is really good, and is modeled after a novel from "Friedrich Duerrenmatt". I've read some of his books (but not this one) and always liked them.The problem with this one is that you start to miss some "action". There is simply nothing happening at all. Since I found the end a bit disappointing (but not unbelievable) I only gave it 6/10. This just means that I have seen some better movies. I wouldn't watch it a second time, but it's definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimpressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was probably an unwise choice to rework Friedrich Dürrenmatt's classic script for `Es geschah am helllichten Tag' (`It Happened In Broad Day Light', 1958 -- which he later expanded into the brilliant crime novel `Das Versprechen' (= `the promise', or `the pledge')) into yet another movie, since it has already been filmed several times in English and German, for the silver screen and for television. I can't really put my finger on it, but certain scenes and characters, such as the child murderer, the frightened suspect (a traveling salesman in the original script, in Sean Penn's version a mentally retarded native American), or the central character's (Detective Jerry Black, played by Jack Nicholson) decline into insanity in the last scene of the movie, seem to be incompatible with modern cinematography, maybe because it is impossible to create the appropriate atmosphere without the use of black and white, maybe because the pathological serial killer has in the past decades become a Hollywood mainstay, maybe because the audience has become much more cynical and less easy to shock or impress. Sean Penn's movie therefore seems to me prematurely dated and often unengaging; several characters, such as the Indian suspect (played by Benicio Del Toro) and the unscrupulous police officer (Detective Stan Krolak, played by Aaron Eckhart) seemed to me flat and overdrawn. On the upside, the `The Pledge' tries to come close to the novel, some of the characters (especially Robin Wright - Penn as Lori) are truthful, and I generally liked the unpretentious style of narration and cinematography. Overall though, I left the cinema feeling somewhat short - changed. Wait for it to come out on video or TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is retiring as a cop. During his retirement party, a new case arises: a young girl, brutally murdered. Police quickly apprehend a suspect, a mentally deficient Native American (Benicio del Toro) who confesses to the crime under duress and then kills himself. End of case, right? The cops have their killer, and everyone has their closure, right?Jerry is the one who has to break the news to the parents of the little girl, and the mother elicits a promise from the retiring cop to track down the killer. This is even before the alleged suspect is apprehended, and during the supposed confession, Jerry remains unconvinced. So much so that he works on the case after his retirement, much to the chagrin to his former colleague Stan (Aaron Eckhart), who had been working on the case and who had gotten the confession from the suspect.Jerry rents a place in the town where the girl who was killed lived and researches other murders that have similar characteristics. He buys a gas station/convenience store and falls for a waitress who has (coincidentally) a little girl herself. He becomes obsessed with the case, and of course his former coworkers don't buy into his logic or hard work. So the whole movie appears to be about Jerry working diligently to solve the murder. He doesn't believe the true murderer was caught, so of course we're not meant to, either. This can be very gratifying, as we watch the pitfalls and peaks of his investigation, as well as his burgeoning relationship with the waitress. However, it's not. It's about the one man's obsession; in this case, an obession with an unsolved murder. It's wonderful and mesmerizing to see Jack get into his role as much as he did, and you're forever reminded that he's a powerful actor. But be warned: This is NOT a psychological thriller. This is NOT a murder mystery. And although I won't tell you the ending, I'll have to say this much - the ending is terrible. You don't feel good or angry, you feel... well, you feel cheated. For the first three quarters of the movie, Sean Penn does a great job (he directed). For the final quarter, it's as if someone's kid brother was in charge. And unfortunately, as bad as that last quarter was, the rest of the movie can hardly compensate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and thrilling remake directed by Sean Penn from classic Spanish/German film by Ladislao Vadja</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ¨Pledge¨ is an awesome movie with tension , thriller , chills and extraordinary performances with special mention to starring Jack Nicholson who does a superb acting . It's a remake from vintage Switzerland/Spain/German co-production titled ¨The Bait¨ (1958) directed by Ladislao Vadja with Heinz Ruhmann , Maria Rosa Salgado , Michael Simon and Gert Frobe . This haunting movie based on a Fredrich Durrenmatt novel concerns about a detective ( an obstinate Jack Nicholson in similar role played by Heinz Ruhmann ) who on the day of his retirement becomes involved in the case of a little girl's killing . The retiring police chief pledges the parents ( Patricia Clarson and Michael O'Keefe in brief performances ) to catch the killer of the young child . Detective Jerry Black has made a promise he can't break, to catch a killer he can't find . At the beginning appears as suspect an unfortunate vagrant , a retarded Native trapper ( incomparable Benicio Del Toro in the role of Michael Simon ). But the Nevada police detective doesn't believe the police detained the right man ; he investigates this is the third incident in the zone in the recent past with victims young , blond, pretty, and small for their age . He gets some clues from a drawing by the killed girl , as the murderous can be a tall man who drives a black car , gives toy porcupines as gifts, and calls himself the wizard . In order to search the killer , the police buys a gas station to Floyd ( Harry Dean Stanton ) and takes employee a separated woman ( a sweet Robin Wright who married Sean Penn ) with a daughter, being his intention of use them as bait for the cruel murderous . The police detective trying to trap a child killer , at the same time his mind on the woman and the little girl . It leads to the climax with the presence of the serial killer along with the kid and the possible tragedy.This is a well crafted movie plenty of suspense , thrills and psychological studio . The picture functions on various levels with superb characters well played by an all-star cast and a well-paced screenplay . Its perfect developing resides not in displays of frenzied action and grisly violence like happen in modern cinema, but rather lies about interesting characters and suspenseful . The story as told in the novel is scary enough , but the picture manages to create an atmosphere of unbearable tension and palpable terror within the enchanting , brightly-lit outdoors of a small location . Colorful and glittering cinematography by Chris Menges - The mission- . Sensible and touching musical score with some wonderful song by Hans Zimmmer and Klaus Badelt . This fine-tuned motion picture is excellently directed by Sean Penn . In my opinion this is one of the best films to come out of America in the decade of the 2000 .If you like thoughtful and brooding films that are exciting and rich pace with rhythm but no displaying a great deal of action, you'll like this one.Other movies based this exciting novel are the following : 'The cold light of day' (1995) directed by Rudolf Van Den Berg with Richard E Gant , and as a 1997 TV movie ; and of course the best adaptation the Spain/Switzerland/Germany production titled ¨The Bait¨ (1958) directed by Ladislao Vadja .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Pledge" is an unusual thriller in the sense that it plays with the viewer. It teases us about its focus and intentions. Is it a murder mystery, or a character study. In my opinion, it's both.On the day of his retirement, Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) makes a promise to a grieving mother (Patricia Clarkson): he will find the person who brutally raped and murdered her young daughter. The same night, a man named Toby Wadenah (Benicio del Toro) is arrested and confesses to the murder, then kills himself. Jerry isn't convinced, and as much as he tries, he can't let go of the case.The trailer makes "The Pledge" seem like a generic murder mystery/thriller, but that assumption does the film a great disservice. Director Sean Penn takes the film at a slow, deliberate pace; there's really not much action (despite what the ratings say, this isn't a particularly violent movie). But the film moves along just like Jerry thinks. Clues are revealed slowly, and as soon as we put them in the back of our minds, another one is revealed. We begin to think just like Jerry. Penn's skill as a filmmaker is evident because the clues are realized just as Jerry would see them. There's no heavy-handedness in how they are shown. There are no plot twists, just puzzle pieces slowly falling into place.The acting is terrific. Present in every scene, Jack Nicholson dominates the film with another great performance. He plays Jerry in a low-key manner, but not to the point where he becomes dull. Some people think that Nicholson only plays himself in movies, but that's not the case. Nicholson is a gifted actor, and this is a terrific performance from him. Robin Wright Penn is unrecognizable as Lori. She looks and acts just like a small-town woman. "The Pledge" is littered with appearances by A-list actors, many present in only one scene for less than a minute: Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Benicio del Toro, Hellen Mirren, Lois Smith, Sam Shepard. All acquit themselves admirably (and all of them portray a unique character-for once a big-name cameo is not used just for a "spot the star" thing or to add weight to the cast)."The Pledge" runs smoothly until the final ten minutes. They rely on stupidity, and the final clip doesn't make sense. One could interpret them a different way, but the film doesn't seem to fit that interpretation.Sean Penn likes to take the films he directs at a slow, methodical pace. His set-up for scenes is flawless; there's plenty of set shots to set the scene, and his attention to detail is impeccable. One could argue that he takes the film too slowly, but I disagree. It sets the scene well, and while Jerry Black isn't the most interesting character, Nicholson's performance is spot-on, and he's a delight to watch."The Pledge" is a good film, but don't expect a lot of action with this one. This film is all about great acting and good storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an unforgettable study of obsession and a man's descent into madness.The story revolves around a recently retired police detective. He's convinced there is a serial killer on the loose, preying on young girls. However, because he's just retired, he has to improvise his own amateur investigation. He becomes obsessed with catching the killer, going beyond all good reason and even using a young girl as unwitting bait.Nicholson is incredible as the slowly unraveling detective. He captures the the central character's increasingly fleeting hold on reality with great subtlety. Although this might not be one his more acclaimed roles, I feel it is one of his best performances. The mood the film sets is wonderful. It contrasts idyllic mountain scenery with the foreboding feeling of a predator lurking, waiting to strike.The conclusion of the film knocks the wind out of you. It seems the "crazy old man" was right along about the existence of a serial killer. He had set a perfect trap to catch the killer, but was undone purely by simple bad luck. Ultimately, this failure seems to destroy what is left of his sanity.It's a very nihilistic conclusion, making you wonder if there's any justice in the world. On the other hand, you feel a little strange rooting for Nicholson's detective. He's gone beyond all good reason and common sense in his hunt for the killer. Did he have something to prove to his former colleagues? Did he have something to prove to himself, to satisfy an over-inflated ego? Or were his intentions more noble, hoping to save the lives of innocent children? It's not really clear and that's what makes this such a great, introspective movie. It will leave you thinking about fate, people's intentions and how delicate our hold on reality can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People Who Don't Like This Movie May Not Understand the Influence Behind It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most people, this may be just an average movie. But they might not understand the inspiration behind it. I saw Sean Penn's first directorial The Indian Runner in 1991 and initially thought it was a slow, dull, lagging soap-opera. Back then I didn't know much about the art of film. Other movie watchers may not like this film The Pledge for similar reasons.Then I watched an interview w/Sean Penn and he said his big influence was John Cassavetes, who had recently passed away. So I went back &amp; watched some of Cassavetes' films again. His films were social dramas between friends, usually in New York, struggling with their own inner conflicts. After that, when I watch Sean Penn's first four films (as filmmaker) I can totally see Cassavetes all over his films, especially in this one. Never has his inspiration been so strong than in the way Nicholson struggles with his demons in this picture. The scenes where Nicholson realizes what a mistake he made towards the end, and of him drinking himself to death, looking up in the sky, talking to himself in the closing (and opening) are priceless. I see Cassavetes' struggle of the human soul in those scenes, just like in the films he made, and in some of the characters he played. It really affects the way you see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mona Lisa is a face on a canvas? Believe THAT and all you will see here is Jack Nicholson looking "bored," Jack Nicholson reading a story book, dusty roads, flowers swaying in the breeze, shots of a county fair etc etc. IF, on the other hand, you are a person of awareness, romanticism, compassion, and most importantly UNDERSTANDING, aside from being in the rare minority, you might just see one of the greatest character studies in the history of film. Sean Penn must have an enormous emotional depth to have come up with this deceptively simple tale of retiring detective Nicholson who in his last few hours on the force, is assigned to a brutal murder/sex assault case involving a little girl. He makes the pledge to the girl's mother that he will find the killer - whatever it takes! No heroics here. No high-tech Police work, jive talking low-lifes, bad-ass cops, bimbos snorting coke....just Jack...being Jack..and NO-ONE does that quite like Nicholson. As sensitive a portrayal of an ultimately decent man consumed by a pledge he must honor as is imaginable. I rate it as arguably Nicholson's most poignant role. He is simply stunning. The supporting roles, filled by the cream of the "character acting fraternity" offer Tom Noonan, Mickey Rourke, Vanessa Redgrave and especially Benicio Del Toro the opportunity of acting most of today's A-List stars clear off the paddock!Cinematography and attention to smalltown detail is inspired. Penn has infused so much creativity here that the film has a fully "personal" edge. You're expecting real Police action/Crime drama?...do your limited self a favor and give this a wide berth. I too found myself so utterly entranced by it all, I didn't want it to end either. In fact...DOES it? Some clown suggested the conclusion was ambiguous and open to interpretation. Well, I guess if you're stupid enough, thats true! Not a solitary winner here, no criminal brought to justice, no happy family Spielberg type ending...just Jack, alone with his tortured thoughts..and an audience hopefully alone with theirs!Absolute unadulterated brilliance from beginning to end from just about every aspect of film-making. Composite viewer-rating of 7.0 I see, and Spiderman pulls 8.1? Certainly is a culture-conditioned and aware world we live in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsung masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of cinema's more idiocyncratic "serial killer movies", Sean Penn's "The Pledge" stars Jack Nicholson as a retired police detective who promises a distraught mother that he will apprehend the paedophile responsible for raping and killing her daughter.To reveal any more of the plot would be to spoil the fun. Suffice to say that much of the film's impact is derived from watching just how far Nicholson goes in his attempts to catch the killer. He becomes increasingly obsessive and insane, going to quite shocking lengths to capture his man.Many have complained that certain events in the film are implausible, but this is the very point. The film is structured as the memories of an already insane Nicholson. Watch how director Sean Penn uses fades (images fade onto the same image, slightly out of sync) to suggest that Nicholson's memory is out of sync with reality, that things don't quite add up, that we are merely watching one slice, one "version", of what really happened. Watch too how Penn has Nicholson express extreme sympathy for the mad drifter who appears at the start of the film, how the word "crazy" flickers behind Nicholson during a parade and how, in true Lynchian fashion, symbols and objects reappear in different contexts as though we're trapped in a strange waking dream. Framed by shots of a drunken Nicholson alone and mumbling to himself, this is a madman's hazy recollection.Interesting too is the way Penn's style has evolved as a director. Since working with Terrence Malick on "The Thin Red Line", he's developed a much more ethereal aesthetic, his camera always restless, always moving and changing focus. This style is replicated in Penn's "Into The Wild", but it suits "The Pledge" best, conveying a strange blend of reality and mental instability.Elsewhere the film eschews the usual clichés in favour for a more introspective take on the genre. The film does fall prey, however, to the "creepy bald paedophile serial killer" cliché. Why do film-makers associate hair loss with sexual perversions? It's almost as though we subconsciously associate hair with sexual maturation, and baldness in murderers to be a sign of creepy prepubescence. 8.9/10 ? A somewhat great film. Sean Penn previously directed Jack Nicholson in "The Crossing Guard", a less interesting film about adults coping with the loss of a child. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewers failed to recognize implausible psychology of the cop. The police inspector in the novel, according to the review in "Sight and Sound," simply wanted to catch the big fish and showed little feeling for the child he used as bait. Such a character is too repellent to make a movie about, so the movie version "humanizes" the character by making him become attached to the mother and child, and indicates that he is concerned that the monster will kill another child. This concern would place him in a moral dilemma: should he use the child as bait in order to prevent the monster from killing more children? The movie does not deal with this: it presents him as subject to a compulsion or something of the sort, which is not interesting. Inner conflict is not shown and his behavior is not explained. His evidence would have to be very strong to compel him to use the little girl as bait, and the other cops would never have joined his crazy scheme, for at least three reasons: first, they didn't accept his suspicions; secondly, no one with children would consider putting a child at risk; and thirdly, if the trap had resulted in harm to the little girl, they would all have had to move to another planet. The mom showed up and said, "How could you do this?," which is what the other cops would have said. Some reviews saw the cop's journey as a "descent into madness", which is about as good as you can do with it, I guess, but it just makes the cop crazy instead of evil. The movie does not illuminate or deal with the psychological or moral issues, which is to say the makers were in over their heads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: this is an existential parable, not a detective story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In fact the novella by the Swiss author Friedrich Duerrenmatt, to which this screenplay is pretty much true, I guess (I've only read the Wikipedia synopsis) is subtitled "Requiem for the Detective Novel," and moreover it has a framing device which clues in the reader right away that his/her expectations should be held on a tight leash. This movie lacks similar warning labels, a flaw for which I'm knocking off a star as it inevitably makes people mad and confused (see some other user reviews).Furthermore not everyone wants to spend two hours on an existential parable. I wasn't really prepared for it myself, and when it was over I had a period where I thought Sean Penn had played an irritating prank on me, sort of like someone who tells you a long involved joke with a really stupid punch line. But when I had thought about it a few minutes I developed a better appreciation of the philosophical issues that the movie was raising.To give you a sense of those issues: when Victor Frankl was in a Nazi death camp, he had written a philosophical manuscript, and another prisoner asked him what the point of this was, since they were probably all going to die there and the manuscript would be forgotten. Frankl replied, "What kind of value system would I have to have, if I let my actions depend on whether I was going to get killed by Nazis and whether anyone was going to read the manuscript?" I admit to being hazy on the details of this story, but I am confident that I am getting the general idea.This movie follows detective-story conventions up to a point, and the point comes about ten minutes before the end of the movie. (Expect bigger and bigger spoilers as this review progresses.)Jerry Black is on his last day as sheriff of Reno, Nevada, land of ice fishing, Norwegians and hockey fans (the screenplay was written for Minnesota) and is ready to retire and go down to Mexico and fish, when he sits in on the botched arrest and interrogation of a mentally challenged Indian charged with the murder of a little girl. His successor has gotten a confession and is happy with the result. Jerry, who has sworn on the cross to the girl's mother to catch the killer, doesn't get on his plane. He goes out and interviews some big stars in cameo roles, and works out that there is a serial pedophile murderer out there, and figures out pretty much where he must live and some other things about him.Nobody else is willing to get on the trail, so Jerry devotes his life to the pursuit; he buys a live-in gas station / store and starts watching for suspects. He meets a woman (Lori, played by Robin Wright) with an abusive husband and a daughter in the predator's target zone; they move in with him, and he starts using the daughter as bait. There is a disturbing parallel between the way he grooms the daughter for her role and the way the predator himself must operate. It's not that he doesn't care for the daughter - he does - but he is taking clearly unethical risks with her, without cluing in the mother. In a usual movie, that would be enough of an issue. Also his obsession seems to be undermining his mental balance.Finally, after some red herrings, we get to the point (it is now fifteen minutes before the end of the movie) where the predator (identity unknown to Jerry) is expected to come for the girl. Jerry brings in his skeptical sheriff buddy with a SWAT team to surround the area, they wait, and -And the predator doesn't come. (Because, as we know, but nobody else in the movie realizes, he has had a fatal auto accident on the way there.) Jerry now loses everything. His cop friends write him off as a "drunk and a clown." Lori hates him and leaves. So far as he knows he has completely failed; the killer is still out there; his mind goes; he is left drinking and mumbling to himself in the ruins of his life. THE END.You can see how existential this all is. You try to live your life, accomplish something, catch the killer, roll a rock up the hill like Sisyphus; you give everything; and then something absurd happens and everything gets taken away from you, leaving you without even the knowledge that you've accomplished anything (if you have). That's life. That's mortality. That's what Stoics would say we just have to accept. I actually pretty much appreciate the point. And it was all done very competently by the ensemble. So I'm very glad I saw it. But if I hadn't had a Wikipedia article on Duerrenmatt on hand, as well as some previous encounters with postwar existentialist European thought, boy, would I have been grumpy about the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson shines in a subversive thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Pledge' works largely because so much of it is playing with the expectations and prejudices of it's audience.Nicholson stars as a retiring cop who has one last case. Sound familiar? It feels like a police drama for a lot of it until the last act which I think would have made a far more interesting film had it been expanded into a full length story. Nicholson's character is obsessed with finding a serial killer who may or may not exist. He comes to the point where he seduces a bartender to use her little girl as bait to catch the killer. This is where the movie turns and becomes fresh. It's an understated performance and a sad character Nicholson brings to life. One gets the feeling the movie is as much about aging and find a way to stay relevant.It also has an outstanding supporting cast loaded with top notch character actors. Aaron Eckhardt, Sam Shepherd, Helen Mirren, Costas Mandylor, Mickey Rourke, Patricia Clarkson, Tom Noonan all turn in memorable scenes. My one gripe is that it is far too clean looking a movie. It has that same pristine look that a lot of the thrillers from the early 00's have. There's no atmosphere in the lighting or cinematography. The main thing is it's color palette is so bland. This could have been a great stylistic noir film in the hands of Fincher.Sean Penn and Nicholson know what the beats of this kind of film and they play them until they reach the brilliant final act. The result is something fresh and frightening. While discussing the film I heard it referred to as a "meta movie". That term is dead on. It makes the last act of the film so much more interesting when it doesn't go through the motions of the cop thriller at all. I remember thinking that "Oh what a nice change of pace to see Nicholson play this character with a moral code" and then you see how cavalierly he uses the little girl as bait and you come to despise him. Jerry didn't get the memo that he wasn't supposed to be the hero. It's a unique film. Nicholson is as always masterful. The beginning has some slow areas but it ends up being an alienating thriller that haunts the audience expecting a standard story of a hero cop getting his serial killer.</fullReview>

But nevertheless I was not disappointed by The Pledge. It's a good movie. The end could have been better but it is what it is. It's clear what happened and you're not left with questions unanswered. Some people thought Jack Nicholson didn't deliver like we are used of him. I have to disagree completely with that. Jack Nicholson is the main character of this movie and I thought is acting was top notch. To me having Jack Nicholson in a movie is almost a certainty to have a good movie. He's a world class actor. Strong character roles are written for him and he always deliver. The rest of the cast was good as well. All in all the movie might be a bit slow and different from what you expect it to be but it is well directed with strong acting. Certainly worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid in most departments but the ending is rather unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the night of his retirement and during his retirement do police chief Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) goes back out into the field to investigate the death of a young girl who was raped before being murdered. The police arrest Toby Jay Wadenah (Benicio Del Toro) for the little girl's murder and manage to extract a confession from him - albeit in a rather unethical manner. Despite the fact that the police are content that Wadenah was the man who killed the little girl Black isn't convinced and acting on a hunch, he comes back out of retirement and carries out his own investigations to try to track down the person who he believes is really responsible for the killing.As far as stories go this really isn't a bad one and certainly has enough intrigue and mystery about it to keep one invested in the story. Parts of the story are a little predictable - as soon as we learn that Wadenah has mental health problems it becomes fairly obvious that they've got the wrong man and this leads to Wadenah being interrogated by the police in a section of the film which dragged on for too long. Sadly, the film also suffers from many other clichés that we'd expect to see in the genre; retiring cop on 'one last job', one cop believing that the man they've got for the crime is innocent when no-one else believes him. I also felt that more interesting aspects of the story weren't given enough focus; Black's inner voices are mentioned and referred to now and again, but aren't really ever a focal point in the film which made these sections of the film seem a bit pointless (his therapy session with Helen Mirren is perhaps a good 'case in point'.In the second half of the film Black buys a gas station and goes undercover to try to track down the killer and this section of the film is definitely one of the weaker aspects in the film. The pace is notably slower at this point and again seems to be filled with pointlessly long and drawn out scenes (such as about 5 minutes spent watching Jack Nicholson fishing for example). It all amounts to filler as far as I'm concerned and adds up to very little and just makes the film longer than it needs to be.The ending is also rather unsatisfying and teases the audience into believe that there is going to be some spectacular showdown between Black and the killer but alas this never happens. Instead it seemed to offer more of a moral debate on whether Black went too far by using a little girl as bait to catch the killer - suggesting that a 'red mist' has descended whereby he's willing to flush out the killer regardless of the consequences.... This is interesting as a social statement but I still felt cheated as the film seemed to be building up to an exciting finale and never really got there. I suspect this may work for those after something 'thought-provoking' but won't really work for those looking for a straight-forward 'good triumphing over evil' story.All in all this was fairly interesting and intriguing film and is reasonably good in most respects, but I really wish that the film had ended on a stronger note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little girl is sexually assaulted and brutally murdered. The police fumble and prevaricate (why must it always be so?), closing the case on the basis of a confession extracted from a junkie - who conveniently shoots himself immediately thereafter - which has chasms larger than the Grand Canyon. It's left to Jerry Black, retired police detective, to have conscience qualms, meet the girl's shattered parents, and, on his soul's salvation, pledge (ergo, the film's title) to bring her killer to heel. He proceeds, on his investigation and to his department's obvious discomfiture, via the well trodden route of investigating similar crimes in the area around, in the past, etc etc.Thus far, it's run-of-the-mill - at least so far as the plot goes - and reasonably predictable. However, once Black (unforgettably brought to life by Jack Nicholson) gets set on the right track, and finds all his hunches, and inferences, to be justified, one by one, the script runs wildly off track.Now that, ordinarily, would be a criticism, rather than a compliment. However, in the case of "The Pledge", director Sean Penn - who has distinguished himself as much in the field of direction as in that of performing - carries us with the completely random flow of the events that unfold, each more unpredictable than the last. Till it all ends in a climax which, I am willing to wager, no one, absolutely no one who has been watching the lunatic turns the plot takes, could have predicted.Whether the end of the film is fulfilling, or not, is debatable. I don't really care. I only know that this is a film which I would unhesitatingly advise anyone, and everyone, who wants to know what imaginative filmmaking is all about, to see. It stands luminously aloft as an example of how, even while working within staid formulaic parentheses, something genuinely and gratifyingly creative can be crafted. By one who has the gumption to do so, and is willing to take the risks, however. Like Penn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Burn, but Crime Fans will Enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite movie genre has to be gritty crime dramas, especially ones where a serial killer is in play. The pinnacle are the Hannibal Lector movies. The Pledge does not quite live up to that billing, but it is a solid crime drama with an impressive cast. Quite a few of the bit players have gone on to lead films of their own.A little research tells us that the original author wrote a TV movie and was forced to use a less believable, more happy ending. He then wrote a novella with a more realistic finale, which is where The Pledge is adapted from.I do not want to give too much away, I just want any user who stumbles across any of my reviews to get an accurate idea of what they are in for and if they should invest their time into watching this movie. The Pledge starts off how all crime fans like - a cop brought in to examine a brutal crime. However, the movie then settles in for a long, slow, almost meandering middle. There are no chases, violence or action as the story builds to its conclusion.This might turn off or disappoint viewers who expected more action. But I enjoyed the set up. Mainly because the Jack's acting is so good and I enjoyed the character. I have to admit some of his motivations were so subtly implied that I only realized them after researching the film afterwards.What elevated this to an 8/10 for me was the unconventional ending. Your first reaction is disappointment, even anger. You want just desserts for the scumbags of the world or redemption for the heroes of the world or a clear resolution to the world's problems. But as we all know, real life is not fair. The ending will stick with me for a long time, it will not fade like all the other crime drama endings we have seen. True crime fans, give the movie a view. It's worth the long ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*For anybody interested that's seen the movie*Nicholson has been in a few great films with low-key endings. Easy Rider, Last Detail, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest...But this one takes the biscuit. We are never sure if he finds out about the crash. My take on this is that he didn't and that's what riled him. His years of alcoholism, along with his sudden retirement (he seems to have been working hard until the end of his career in the force) pushes Jerry Black into a situation he's frightened of going.I thought his colleagues felt glad getting him that ticket the hell out of there. He seems to have been a bit of a pain at the station. But he stays and gets involved. Deeply involved in his mad plan.He uses the girl as bait, at the same time knowing that what he is doing is out of order. He knows the girl's mother would be furious. He is positive to the dress in the shop, and he places the swing out front by the gas pumps. Creepy.At the end I went back to the part where they showed the killer. Just to get a good look at him...Not a film for parents of young kids, as I am. An unsettling look at a very dark side of the human nature./Soup</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A somewhat enigmatic film. A real tour de force for Nicholson. I thought Penn's direction was overdone and it became a bit irritating. He seemed to be showing off. To me, a well-directed film is one in which I give absolutely no thought whatsoever to the director. There were a lot of cameos, and I missed most of them. I knew when Helen Mirren was onscreen, but I still don't know which character Mickey Rourke played. Didn't recognize him at all. The only other outstanding performance was by Pauline Roberts, the child actress. She seemed totally natural almost all the time, tough to achieve with children. NOTE: You can't really discuss this movie without spoilers, so be warned. It is hard to square the actions of Jerry Black. (Nicholson) He seemed to genuinely love the little girl, and was protective of her, but at the same time, he was clearly and consciously using her as bait. The viewer doesn't know if Jerry ever found out about the big wreck at the end, though one would have to assume so. But his later madness and drunkenness would be better explained if he did not know. While this film contained a great performance by Nicholson, the rest of the movie doesn't measure up. Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give the big guy a break! (SPOILER!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Responding to the false spoilers sprinkled throughout these comments:Why in the world do people think Tom Noonan's character Gary Jackson is the murderer? This is a complete red herring. Jerry (Nicholson) comes to believe he is the killer, and in one of the more manipulative scenes, rushes to a church where he fears that Jackson has abducted and killed the girl. Penn's decision to portray Jerry's fear in a fantasy shot of Jackson covered in blood is artistically questionable, in my view. But he clearly goes on to reveal that what's happening in the church is in fact a religious ceremony: when Jerry bursts in, Jackson earnestly welcomes him in to the service. Jackson is not a crazed killer, just a very religious guy hoping to interest anyone he can in joining the congregation.As for the "real killer," who dies in the car accident on his way to the trap Jerry has set for him, we never clearly see his face. But there's no reason whatsoever to assume it's Jackson. It's the guy who works as a clown.Seems to me some people need to watch these films a little more carefully, and not assume that because a guy is best known for playing a mad killer (Manhunter), that he is going to be the killer in every film he appears in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see both sides of the issue. On the one hand, this movie *was* made in the U.S., with (mostly) American actors. It has the backdrop of an American city and appears visually as an American film. But the story is definitely European. Someone mentioned that it was like a Greek tragedy and oh how right that person was! I guess the main problem is that most Americans don't really look for a dual meaning or an allegorical situation unless it is spelled out for them. I certainly don't. As soon as I saw Friedrich Durrenmatt's name attached, however, I knew there'd be more to it.The pivotal scene for me when I knew I should pay attention, was Jerry's visit with the psychologist. It was like a necessary reminder for the dense folks in the audience.I was disturbed by this film at a gut level. I felt as though Jerry should have at least mentioned his fears for the little girl to her mother. The ending might not have been so unpleasant if the mother had known the potential problems.BTW, I think Sean did the right thing to divorce Madonna.

		<shortDescription>Nicholson's best role since "...cuckoo's next"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jack Nicholson in a murder mystery" makes one think of "Chinatown". Well dont expect that - this film has a pace, style and atmosphere that sits somewhere between "Taxi Driver" and Egoyan's "The Sweet Hereafter".Director Sean Penn makes the most of a strong script, beautiful locations and photography and a number of cameos from just about the best character actors around. Unsurprisingly, Benicio del Toro is once again the most memorable (there is a scene with him and Aaron Eckhart that is SO bizarre but oddly effective, especially in retrospect)But the film's dominating asset is Nicholson and I think that when a leading man finds a role that is so right for him and he is on this sort of form then directing is easy. Nicholson creates a believable, multi-dimensional, sympathetic character that the audience is with from the outset and this is the film's heart without which it would be very grim stuff (but still admirable)and ever since that ending I can't stop mulling over the whole thing...Highly recommend</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful disturbing &amp; classy detective yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn's direction, Jack Nicholson's wonderful,weary performance and the great Nevada locations would be enough on their own to lift this detective yarn into the higher echelons of the genre. However the story is so ingenious with such a different take on the subject that it creates a really memorable, haunting, top quality movie. There are a few holes in the plot but not enough to trip up the gradually and skillfully created sense of unease and the viewers increasing empathy for Nicholson's obsessed character.Things begin rather slowly but build up nicely as the movie goes past the half way point. The final scenes are truly nerve shredding. To say too much more will give away elements of the plot,so I will simply add that I could not stop thinking about the twist in this tale for days afterwards. It's a great film, genuinely disturbing.It looks good, it's acted well and perfectly cast.Nicholson in a 'senior' role is terrific. What more could you ask?Congratulations to everyone involved.Good work. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pledge is a vehicle for showing off another fine performance from Jack Nicholson. He plays a retired police officer, Jerry Black who is determined to solve one last murder case that has already been closed, doing anything it takes after promising to a victims mother he would find the killer (Hence the title). The film gets bogged down a bit in parts and is a bit slow moving. If it wasn't for the fine performance of Nicholson and the original ending I would have rated this lower. Not bad, check it out if your a fan of Jack. Otherwise wait for it on TV. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What drives a person to madness?To me it would almost be the bad decision/taste of some people.When I went to the theater to see it, somebody who stood behind me was talking to a friend she hadn't seen in a while. I wish I hadn't either. Let's follow the wonderful world of friendship:Person 1 HeyPerson 2 Hey, How are you?Person 1 Fine Thanks. And You?Person 2 Great. SO what are you going to watch?Person 1 The PledgePerson 2 Ooh dear god girl. I went to see that one last week, it's a terrible movie. Too slow, bad acting and no plot what so ever.Person 1 So what are you going to watch?Person 2 The Glass House.After this I dropped dead. Apparently I had a heart attack. I couldn't handle the pressure of this been said so I said goodbye to my 22 years on earth.Like The Deep End and In The Bedroom, these movies will not be appreciated by a large audience. But it will be loved by critics and a small group of filmgoers. Is it a shame?For me personally? Yes. For others? Maybe not.But the acting, the plot, the directing and the suspense were all great. It was all sober and modest. For example: At the chicken farm, when Jack Nicholson has to tell the parents about the child they lost. And many other great scenes. The story? About a cop who is almost on retirement. But on the day he quits, another murder happens and Jack Nicholson decides to get involved in the case. It could have been a typical cat and mouse chase were the cop chases the bad guy, but Sean Penn decides to take a completely other way.And I thank him for it. From this point it is where many people will leave the movie behind and start to hate it. From this point it al begins where I start to love the movie more and more.I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will give you a series of films........Taxi driver, The Searchers, Deliverance, Midnight Cowboy, One Flew Over The Cukoos Nest.......and THE PLEDGE. Spot the odd one out..........there isnt one, each film is a masterpiece.Sean Penn has surpassed himself with this slow paced, thoughtful study of a man and his mind. Curious, obssessed, angry, dogged, tender, gentle, cool and haggard. Nicholson does the lot!I wont give much away on this. Nicholson is a retired cop who, on his final day in the force deals with the murder of a young girl. He has a hunch the killer is not the guy they took in and through coincidence, luck, determination and instinct, Jack keeps going until he believes he has the guy in his sights.I loved the camera work, the haunting music, the fact that Nicholson, who is deemed as the hero in waiting has a variety of weakness and vunerability.The ending made me fell so angry and pityful of his character, I had to watch it again although strangely, it seemed different!!!Superb film!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pledge is not a fast moving action packed movie that will have you on the edge of your seat but what it is is a fascinating movies that is full of brilliant acting and superb suspense. Nicholson plays a retired cop who promises that he will catch the killer of a young girl. This promise takes over his life as he constantly looks for clues to who and where the killer is. Without giving the end away it is brilliant and moving and different and perhaps you can thank the director Sean Penn for that. the Whole film is beautifully shot in the way that you feel for all the characters and you care what happens to them. So many film dont do that. Nicholson is brilliant and in my opinion this is the best thing he has done for many years and deserves a lot of recognition for this role. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very good, I fail to understand why Jack Nicholson is uncredited and officially he is only a supporting actor in The Pledge but he is the main attraction. I still need to see the first movie in which Jack is bad, even average movies look better with him in it, and this is the opinion of someone who is not even a fan. However there are so many great actors to be seen in bigger and smaller parts that in this case Jack doesn't have the whole movie on his shoulders, all in all, great acting, great locations and great directing. Without giving it all away, the ending might not exactly meet expectations which might give certain people a bad feeling, to others it will give a feeling that it is still a good conclusion if somewhat unorthodox.

		<fullReview>This film is an all out masterpiece which unfortunately very fewpeople saw upon it's release. It's also frustrating to see theAcademy throw Academy awards to actors for work that they don'tdeserve(Pacino for his Scent of a woman, Nicholson for As Goodas it gets) and not even bother to nominate them when they areworthy. In my opinion I felt it was a given that he would win theoscar for this film but he wasn't even nominated! Of course, thefilm is dark and disturbing and is reminisent of the great films ofthe 70's which might be the reason that Hollywood pussied out. The most stunning surprise is Sean Penn's directing. I've neverseen his other directed films, but I assumed that they would bepedestrian like every other actor who has tried to direct, but no. Onfirst viewing, I felt that he was showing off too much with thecamera and editing, but on second viewing, after you get thestunning ending, you realize that the earlier scenes that wereshow-offy weren't, in fact, and fit in perfectly into the psyche of thecharacter. I can't say enough about this brilliant film, and it wasexciting to see why Jack Nicholson is considered a great actor inthe first place since he seems to phone in most of hisperformances nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I realize that this film was not a whodunnit, as several other people have commented, I would have liked to see something at the end that gave the storyline a little closure. Had I realized that this was an artsy film and not a murder drama or cop story which revealed the names of the culprits at the end, I surely would not have bothered renting it. There was way too much fluff in the film. I fast-forwarded through several scenes. My husband fell asleep during it. The plot could have been shown in half the time, especially since it had no real ending. Unless you're into this kind of film, that which leaves the viewer to interpret it however he may, grab a cheap police story instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by no means a classic but it is worth watching. The acting and direction is pretty good and this is because we have a good partnership from Jack and Sean. The only thing I have a problem with in this film is that this film do not really know what it wanted to do. It is not an entirely a character study, because if it is, more attentions should be directed to the characters and their developments. Jack has alot of talent, but I felt that he wasn't given enough chance in this film to express them. The story line was alittle predictable, the relationship between Robin and Jack can be seen a mile away. There are some holes also in the story, like, with all the young girls in the town why the killer want to find one that is related to the main character of the story? If this movie really is a character study and anyone wants to see this movie purely on this premise, I suggest the movie Taxi Driver staring DeNiro, directed by Marty. Now THAT is a character study movie. I give this movie 6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here is a little truth in advertising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are shopping IMDB.com for a suggestion as to whether you should see this movie, please take this advice: You should see it. But please go into it with this understanding: The marketing of this movie falsely portrays it as some sort of action/crime drama. It is not. It is a character study, nothing more and nothing less. And on that score, it is fabulous. If you are expecting something along the lines of "A Few Good Men" or "Chinatown," keep looking.The film is extraordinarily well-crafted. The acting, writing, directing and cinematography are top-notch. Penn does a great job of conveying the feeling of the book, and Nicholson, Robin Wright Penn, Mickey Rourke, Venessa Redgrave, and Benicio Del Toro are all in rare form.The discussion of this film on this website is interesting, and proves that part of the allure of good art is that it invokes different strongly-held opinions. In deference to that point, and without meaning to minimize any other viewers' opinions, this film's greatest virtue is that it is not banal. In my view, the most critical criteria to determine a film's quality is it lack of banality. On that score, this film ranks very high. A lot of viewers disagree with this criteria. They do not like bold, unexpected or unresolved stories, and complain about any film that does not present a tidy, tautly structured ending. Those viewers will hate this film, and based on many of the comments below, do hate it. The film is also will be loathed by those who believe that the only appropriate film resolution to a crime is the punishment or death of the offender. But in real life, many people avoid consequences for their hurtful actions, or at least we think that they do. This film explores this truism.</fullReview>

He never really finds any new leads. And after more than two hours about a man who cant handle to be retired, the killer isnt even found. Either the killer dies in a car-explosion or Nicholson is simply crazy.The only interesting part of this crap is Benicio DelToros one scene as a retarded indian, who isnt even the killer. Hes really good but almost not in the film at all. This movies is one big pile of mess with no real ending. Just like Eyes Wide Shut. Sean Penn should stick to acting which hes not even very good at.

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Movie, but Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very slow moving movie, with a lot going on. There is much to see, hear, and interpret, if you're paying attention. A extremely fine performance by Jack Nicholson. See this film, and you won't have any trouble understanding why he is considered one of the finest actors alive, and maybe, one of the finest of all time. He brings the detective character to life with just the right amount of tension, restraint, and nuance.The movie is haunting. The murder of these little girls is troubling. The conversation Jack Nicholson has with Mickey Rourke, a father of one of the murdered girls, is emotional and painful. The pain of losing his little girl just radiates from Rourke.A fine directing job by Sean Penn. He is really making a name for himself by directing thoughtful character studies, with fine subject matter.I have to admit being thoroughly disappointed in the ending. Without giving too much away, Nicholson's character deserved much better than what he got. Of course, real life doesn't come with happy, satisfying endings, but this movie ends tragically, and leaves you feeling empty inside. Generally, I see nothing wrong with that, but he deserved a better fate.An exceptional movie, a fine character study by Sean Penn, and a tremendous performance by Jack Nicholson.</fullReview>

There is a mixture of beautiful panoramas and eye-catching angles that manage to meld together quite nicely. All of the performances were well above par and what a level par is with such an august cast. It's tempting to think Penn called in many markers to get some very big names to do such small parts but I prefer to think it was the high quality of the script that brought in Micky Rourke and Harry Dean Stanton and Benicio Del Toro to accept as little as 5 minutes of screen time for this film.

		<shortDescription>Performances and cinematography raise an otherwise frustratingly paced film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn directs Jack Nicholson again in a thought-provoking and ultimately dark film about obsession. Jack Nicholson plays Jerry Black, an almost retired detective, who assists Krolak (Aaron Eckhart) in a grisly murder of a little girl in a small quiet town. Jerry makes a pledge to the family that he will find the murderer. The cops end up closing the case, but Jerry remains unconvinced as he spots connections to another murder and he seeks out his own personal mission to find the mysterious killer.I personally didn't like 'The Pledge' all that much, and prefer Sean Penn's other films in 'The Crossing Guard' and 'Indian Runner'. The performances were top-notch in 'The Pledge' especially from Jack Nicholson playing a tormented Jerry Black. The supporting cast in Robin Wright, Aaron Eckhart, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro and Helen Mirren were all fine as well. The cinematography was also very strong and conveyed the snowy and cold climate of Jerry Black's small town rural world. So why didn't I like it that much? The pacing, and aspects of the direction were uneven and lacked the suspense I would have preferred. The overall style of the interview between Aaron Eckhart and Benicio Del Toro irritated me with the use of the video camera, and plus some other uneven scenes all added up to a very unsatisfying conclusion. The ending was admittedly brave, yet frustrating at the same time for the film dragged on to get to it. Also, I found the score distracting at times, and certain scenes boring but I also thought this was a reasonably well made film, and I do respect the performances. Like I said, I personally didn't like the film that much but I appreciated aspects of it and what it was trying to convey, so it gets a pass in my book. *** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good adaptation of the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite sceptic upon seeing the ads for The Pledge because it says there that this is an adaptation of a novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, which I haven't read but I've seen two other adaptations of it, both in German, and both, I think, was not exceptional, if also not bad either (the black-and-white one being the better of the two). I just thought this novel has been made into a movie one time too many, and the idea of seeing a whodunnit film whose story I've known more or less doesn't really appeal to me. So when they were showing it in movie theatres I passed.Several months later, just out of curiosity, I rented the DVD. Because I guess Jack Nicholson being a great actor that he is, this film cannot be that bad, can it? And it really is not bad. In fact, I was glued to the screen. And that, even though I knew what would happen next, I knew that the detective would use the kid as bait to catch the murderer, and I knew what "porcupines" mean and why they found chocolate inside the stomach of the killed girl. Director Sean Penn and actor Jack Nicholson have made this a very interesting film, fresh and engaging from beginning to end.So I guess that if you want to make a remake of a film you should have an exceptional director and cast, otherwise you would end up making an inferior version of the story, like what happened to Get Carter (Stallone) or Down to Earth (Chris Rock). Nicholson has what it takes to play Detective Black. Other actors would not do better, except maybe de Niro but I'm quite tired seeing de Niro as a cop. Why don't he play someone different like a saxophone player or a boxer or something like he used to? Okay he's too old to be a boxer but what about a chess player.Anyway I'm rambling there, but the conclusion is, you gotta catch this if you can. You're not gonna regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some nice touches help elevate this from merely average territory?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never seen Indian Runner or The Crossing Guard, I was looking forward to seeing The Pledge, not only because it was billed as Jack Nicholson's return to form, but also as an excuse to experience the directing work of Hollywood bad boy Sean Penn. I'd seen the trailers and heard the acclaim, now it was time to watch, what I thought, would be an exemplary piece of film-making. But I was sorely disappointed. For the most part the Pledge amounts to nothing more than a slow burning character study, with some nice photography. But besides Nicholson's Jerry Black, none of the characters are all that interesting, and come off simply as plot devises, despite the work of the amazing cast of diverse acting talent. The vital flaw with the film is the plot, which is never as interesting as the film-makers would like you to think it is, with far too much emphasis on Black coming to terms with his retirement, instead of focusing on the detective story, which at the end of the day, is why the audience is watching the film in the first place. Nicholson may be a senior citizen now, but I was not expecting to see a cross between Grumpy Old Men and Se7en, which is what this film comes across as. The film does have some strong acting from most concerned, notably Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton, Tom Noonan, Benicio Del Torro and Mickey Rourke, but this endless line up of, what amounts to nothing more than celebrity cameos are ultimately distracting. The film should however be commended for having the guts to give us a twist ending that no one in a million years will ever guess, because it's the kind of ending that will either have you staring at the screen thinking `wow' or staring in to space laughing hysterically in disbelief. The Pledge is not the masterpiece some critics hailed it as, however the main performance of Jack Nicholson is perhaps his best, and most restrained since his pre-shinning days, giving us the only fully developed character, a character more about maturity than wild out-bursts, which is enough to make any serious film fan want to watch, but considering the talent on display, The Pledge should have been something so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very professionally shot movie with very nice character acting, and yet it left me with a sense of hollowness...As the film unveils itself, Nickelsons character slides deeper and deeper into paranoia. This is done very gradually and delicately. Not the 'lets go crazy in 10 seconds flat' kinda Hollywood flick. To me the rest was just a side dish; the murder, his pension, his shallow partner, etc...(Del Torro almost outplayed Nickelson on the 'how to portray a nutcase' though!)Even his fixation with getting the son of a bitch is merely a vehicle for his paranoia.BUT WHY? Why would "a good cop" go this nuts? Unlike for instance The Deer Hunter, in which u can see people go gradually nuts as well, there is no explanation whatsoever. There is only the promise he made on his soul's rest, but THAT just doesn't do the trick! And yes, the tempo isn't in the fast lane. That serves a purpose though: This is much more a character movie then a story movie in my opinion. And in that category, if you can withhold yourself from asking why too much, it's a good film! I rated this a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched this film some familiar images came up. I realized that this film is a ripoff of an excellant 1996 movie called "In the Cold Light of Day" starring Richard Grant as the detective and Perdita Weeks as the little girl. If I hadn't seen the latter film I might have enjoyed "The Pledge" more despite the long pauses and constant stareing of Nicholson. I am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson but Richard Grant did a much better job in the role of the Detective. I urge viewers to rent a copy of "The Cold Light of Day".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome, an actor's film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to say that the film moves somewhat slowly, but by no means is it ever boring. This isn't an action film or even a thriller, but a psychological study of a man whose obsession to find a child killer completely overtakes him.The obsession eventually destroys him physically and mentally and finally drives him to endanger a loved one, destroying all that he has left. Jack Nicholson was absolutely amazing in a subtle performance that deepens as the film progresses. I am puzzled by those who were actually "bored." As the end neared, probably in the last half hour or so, I was so disturbed by Nicholson's character's deterioration and mounting suspense that I almost wanted to turn the film off...yet, I was compelled to watch.I don't think this is particularly "arty" as some have commented, it's just an intense drama. If you want an action killer/thriller rent Seven instead. If you have the patience for captivating performances, take the time to see The Pledge.Hadn't seen Mickey Rourke for quite some time, amazing as usual....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few points short of becoming a masterpiece !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly this film hadn't got the attention it deserved. An all star cast and another fine turn from Sean Penn behind the camera had me believe that this could be a little masterpiece. And it almost accomplished that. Hearing rave reviews (especially about a top class performance from Jack Nicholson),I expected this film to notch a few Oscar nominations. But on the otherhand "the Academy" doesn't always get it right. Jack was good but I've seen him do better many times before. The supporting cast was excellent including Robin Wright-Penn and Benicio Del Toro. The story is simple (retired cop tries to catch a child murderer) but the psychological aspect of the movie is tremendous.Although the ending wasn't all that it still made you think. And I'm assuming that's what Sean intended. So my conclusion is that you shouldn't get too excited by the (loads of) wonderful reviews,but this is still a movie that surely deserves your attention. Only if it's to see that Sean Penn's first two outings as a director weren't a fluke. And remember that Jack on automatic pilot (that's my opinion !!!) is still worth your attention. So why don't you leave those wannabe blockbusters alone and give this one a try. It surely won't change your life but I'll bet you that you won't be dissapointed! Rating ; 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The basic reason that I'm writing this review is because I'm appalled at the negative comments regarding this excellent, off-beat film. People have become so used to the awful garbage (I would use more appropriate, colorful language, but I don't want to offend) that Hollywood serves up on a daily basis that when a film tries to be a little different, they can't cope with it. Sean Penn has done an excellent job as a director and his handling of cameos by Benecio Del Toro, Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, and, of course, Jack Nicholson in the leading role, are on their own worth the admission ticket or rental. Don't be fooled, if you like good cinema, don't miss this film. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, albeit unsettling movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say this (in regard to the other comments on the movie): I don't see any relation to (or attempt to immitate) Fincher's work. This is something that stands on it's own, with no attempt to replicate some other's work.This is the story of a man, with a deep sense of obligation to one's word, in his declining years. The character is very well written, and deffinately not typical of hollywood. From the mystery aspect, there are alot of events and people that lead you this away from the "villian". This movie isn't faced paced, and the MTV crowd won't have the ability to sit through it as it makes it's way to the end.** SPOLIERS **This is actually how I see some crimes turning out. Someone gets convicted (if at all), and the real killer goes free to die in some accident.I've seen Manhunter, and enjoyed the use of that actor to lead the viewer away from the truth. I was also very pleased to see that the killer only gets about a half-second of screen time. Something rarely done in movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and that's renting the video. I would be p***ed indeed if I'd paid for tickets and popcorn to see this in the theatre. Some good final cutting might have helped a lot, it is at least 25 minutes too long.Penn has a great ability with the camera to transit from scene to scene. But the first 10 minutes of the film were not much else except advertisements for (a single-malt scotch whiskey), a (time piece) whose brand I didn't recognize, (an SUV) and a (snowmobile). Again, done with great ability. After those beautiful commercials, the film degenerates and I don't remember seeing any other advertising (indeed snowmobiles appearing later in the show had no branding).***************** ***************** I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE I ALSO DON'T WANT TO GET BLACK LISTEDA spoiler follows (I don't think so but others might)*****************Maybe the producers couldn't sell (name your clothing company)on the merits of having a picture of a little girl tied up and mutilated wearing their brand.This movie is full of individual scenes, with the co-stars having 10 minutes of the screen each. Nicholson is in it from start to finish. Sometimes he gets blown out of the water by his co-stars, Vanessa Redgrave put in a great scene for example; the film is uneven. Many of these scenes are insultingly improbable. Some of them have obscenely graphic violence and one style Penn is most definitely not using is Hitchcock's. This is not a suspenseful movie.Others scenes - like the multi-exposured images with the accompanying new age music I found added to the unevenness. The plot has a really neat turn at the end, and the story is a good one - but this is not a good telling of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like to watch Jack Nicholson driving around in a truck not saying anything, watch this movie. This movie is boring. Nothing happens for most of the movie. This movie could have been shrunk down to a half-hour TV show with nothing missed - except for scenes where Jack Nicholson is driving around in his truck by himself not saying anything. To me the attempt to build drama is successful only in making one wonder - when is SOMETHING going to happen. I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. This movie is similar to the equally uninteresting AFFLICTION starring Nick Nolte. If you liked that movie you'll like THE PLEDGE. Bottom Line - Don't Bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean, are you trying to be David Fincher?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all... Jack Nicholson is UNTOUCHABLE. Give him a good script, a bad script, a mediocre one, or nothing at all, and he will come out looking like a sure fire Oscar winner. The only way he could act badly is if he tried to. His performance here, as always, is top notch.Sadly, if we talk about the movie... it's bad. Boring. Bland. Sean Penn tries to create a thriller similar to Se7en and Fight Club, with terrible results. When compared to those movies, "Pledge" comes out as empty, boring and unfulfilling. It lacks a powerful, deep and motivating story. It seems to me Jack Nicholson noticed this, and turned the detective story into a drama of a man who doesn't want to confront the fact that he is old and retired. So you have two stories, neither one powerful enough to keep you glued to the screen.Couple this with the fact that the movie is full of flashbacks very similar to those found in Se7en, and you realize that Sean Penn watched Fincher's masterpieces more than once and thought he could do better. Wrong. There is only one Fincher.On the other hand, we get to see Mr. Penn doing weight lifting. Yipee.Had Nicholson not appeared in this movie, I would have had to rate it below 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful film on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always admired Jack Nicholson's work as an actor, and here he delivers a riveting performance as Jerry Black, a retired cop working his final job, while on the brink of some emotional breakdown.The storyline is gripping; the acting, credible; the directing, excellent; and the editing, wonderful. I don't want to give away any plot points, but I will say that the story had me sitting on the edge of my seat, and the pace kept me interested and surprised at each budding development.Sean Penn (Director) allows us to get into the mind of the Nicholson character. We see the way he operates, and we understand and believe what he believes. Though the movie has us guessing at the end (what "really" happened?), we walk away feeling badly for the Nicholson character, who seems to be a victim of the wrong circumstance.On a technical note, I enjoyed the edited sequences involving the ice-fishing house and the girl on the swing. Throw in the circular camera moves around Nicholson's head when he is confused and the soundtrack of different voices going to and coming from "somewhere," and the overall effect helps make this a satisfying (though somewhat troubling, in a good way) movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where to start. Jack Nicholson, as usual, was great. So was everybody else. Great direction. Great scenery. Great silent parts. Excellent drama/suspense but all kept low key, like Nicholson's acting. The ending was the best I've seen in a l-o-o-o-n-g time. I'd recommend The Pledge to anyone that likes movies that allow you to think as you go. The director, to my surprise Sean Penn, mixed a lot of visuals and sounds of the area.Everyone looks for honor, dedication, and integrity in an individual and Jack Nicholson as Detective Jerry Black delivers. It's interesting how the overall effect of his dedication distorts his perception, overtakes and then consumes him. The supporting cast was perfect. The casting company and make-up department maintained that "local" look.Don't miss this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit I rented the movie to see Benecio Del Toro. His part was small but set the tone of the film. The interrogation scene between him and the rookie detective is laughable as that interrogation is done in such an unrealistic manner, I am not sure whether that was put in to show the rookie cop's inexperience, or whether it was just bad writing and research on the filmmakers part. This film is about a retired cop played by Jack Nicholson who promises the parents of a murdered girl he will find her killer. His promise turns into an obsession as he works to find a link between several disappearances of little girls in the area. The suspense and plot is built up pretty good up until the last 15 minutes of the film. The ending is unexplained and ruined what should have been a good film. Because of the LAME ending I give this a 6/10 at the very best. Would have been a 5 for not the good performance of Jack. Be prepared to be disappointed.</fullReview>

Del Toro's part was good at best, but that entire scene made me homophobic, which wasn't Penns' intent. The end makes you feel like there is justice left undone, and you walk away feeling empty.

		<fullReview>Oh the day of his retirement, Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) becomes involved in the investigation of a brutal rape / murder of a little girl. The little girl's mother makes Jerry take a pledge, that at the risk of his immortal soul, Jerry will FIND the killer of the little girl. Soon, Jerry suspects the child may have been the victim of a serial killer posed to strike again...For the better part of two hours, I was enthralled by the superb acting in "The Pledge," particularly Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright Penn.Sean Penn's direction was assured, the cinematography, music and editing bordered on majestic. Then came a horrible, insulting letdown of an ending. Sure, such things happen in real life. I have no problem with downbeat endings in movies if they done with a purpose. However, when I realized the "purpose" of "The Pledge," I was offended. Upon its conclusion, I originally felt "The Pledge" was a hybrid, a character study with too little character development and a mystery-thriller with too few thrills and an unsatisfactorily resolved mystery. I later realized, however, "The Pledge" is an anti-capital punishment polemic, and I was offended that I was propagandized with such loaded arguments, especially from people as reportedly violent as Sean Penn and Jack Nicholson. Nicholson seems an ESPECIALLY ironic and unfortunate choice to play a man who PROTECTS a woman from an abusive male, given his reputation for violence toward women. Benecio Del Toro initially plays Toby, the initial "mentally handicapped" suspect, as SUCH a "retard," (I hate that term, but it is the only adequate way to describe the performance) I cannot imagine him being able to "get it out of his pants," much less having consensual sexual relations with a sixteen year old girl.Sean Penn, Samuel Goldwyn said it best, "If you want to entertain, make movies; if you want to send a message, call Western Union."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good character study, doesn't excuse flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a lot of comments stating what a great study of character this film is. I tend to agree, and the music was nifty too, and the cinematography and all that stuff. But the one binding element that makes a movie a movie was flawed - the story. Story is why a movie isn't a nature documentary, or biography. In this story, I sat through a lot of implausibilites - for example, why would Jerry's police department boot him from the case, scoffing at his leads, and then later send a SWAT team to follow up on those same leads?The other problem with the story was its multiple identity. It started out as a typical hollywood serial killer deal, and then there was a montage of fishing and driving and fishing and lakes and mountains and fishing, and 40 minutes later I'm bored out of my skull because the story has been set up in one way, and is resolving in a completely separate way.Basically we have two separate, incomplete stories here: The beginning of a serial killer movie and the end of something else entirely. This obviously leads to a frustrating resolution - or lack thereof.The performances were all excellent, as was the score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual Thriller Full of Surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Pledge", Director Sean Penn has given us an unusual thriller that is full of surprises. Jack Nicholson plays a retiring small town sheriff who becomes embroiled in a brutal child rape/murder on the day he is retiring. He promises the child's mother that he will see the murderer brought to justice (the "pledge" of the title).  Director Penn starts out by giving us a particular gruesome murder and introducing us to a concerned former cop in the Nicholson character. As the movie progresses, about 18 months pass and we see Nicholson move to a small rural town and begin a relationship with a local woman and her daughter. All the while Nicholson's character is undergoing subtle changes as Penn guides us through all of the twists and turns of the plot and then springs the unexpected surprise ending on us. Jack Nicholson gives a superb performance in the lead role. He looks like a man ready for retirement. Robin Wright Penn (sans make-up)plays the woman who comes into his life along with her young daughter. There are also a number of cameos by recognizable faces. Benicio Del Toro (barely recognizable) plays a murder suspect, Sam Shepard plays Nicholson's former boss, Vanessa Redgrave and Mickey Rourke (in a particularly touching performance) as relatives of victims and Harry Dean Stanton is the man who sells Nicholson his store. You really have to pay attention to this movie. What starts out as a murder mystery develops into something more. Don't go out for popcorn during this one.</fullReview>

A serial-killer suspense movie that is low on action, high on brooding atmosphere and scenery (Western Nevada in winter!), and with its undercurrents of deep cover and religious extremism owes a lot more to "Witness" than to, say, "Se7en". Jack Nicholson does wonderfully in the hackneyed role of the borderline-alcoholic maverick retired detective who has become obsessed with finding the real solution to a "closed" case. Without being too specific, some viewers will feel let down by the extremely non-Hollywood bathic ending. From the outside, we are left feeling frustrated for various characters who in different ways are left thinking they are right when in fact they are wrong, wrong when they are right, and who have failed to receive their just deserts or vindication as the case may be. 7/10.</fullReview>

As for Jack Nicholson his acting was sub par. Some have talked about character building in their reviews, but Nicholson's Schism came on faster than a speeding train. Then it seems post production went back and did scenes like the one with the psychologist studing the girl's drawing. As soon as she question's him, the audience feels the effects of his schism like it was some buried problem that arises on command. In fact the whole scene was useles...I give it a B- for excellent camera shots and a glimpse of something we can hopefully see develop out of penn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I saw "As Good As It Gets" and was bored to tears, I was hesitant to get another long Jack Nicholson movie when I saw "The Pledge" was out on DVD the next day, but...I was pleasantly surprised! Now, this is NOT the best serial killer movie of all time. The killer of little girls is actually the same killer of little girls from an old X-Files episode. Jack uses his new girlfriend's daughter as bait to try to catch the killer and never tells her about it. Jack's snaggle-toothed new girlfriend just HAPPENS to require some emergency dental work and turns out to be gorgeous (similar to Adrian in Rocky!). A lot of people have been critical of the ending.Despite these minor flaws, however, the grainy cinematography is wonderful, the film is fairly fast-paced, the acting is way above par, the supporting characters are excellent (and mostly famous), and the ending is unpredictable. If the ending frustrates you, perhaps it is only because you were actually into the film and the characters. Kinda like Resevoir Dogs.I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** First off I must agree with the user who commented about movie goers and film lovers. This is a "film lovers" movie. I'm sorry but Jack Nicholson is so damn good in this movie that its not fair. One scene in particular when he realizes his daughter just left with Tom Noonans character Jack runs up the steps one at a time but as he gets to the top he starts taking two steps at a time this is what a real person would do if they were in a hurry. All the cameos really didnt need to be there but were acceptable. Anywho what most people missed is that they actually show the killer very early on in the movie. when jacks character goes into a shop the bell ringing is showed for a reason. The killer is briefly shown in that shop. In closing when people ask me what was the last great movie I saw I say The Pledge.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obsessed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn has done it again. From the intrinsic detail of Penn's direction to the impact of characterisation that touches your emotions, The Pledge is a story obsession on more than one level. Each character, however short their time on screen, is crafted with the intensity of a driven obsession. Cameo roles come and go, in The Pledge, they will stay with you. Harry Dean Stanton (still looks like he did in Alien), Mickey Rourke, Vanessa Redgrave and Helen Mirren all perform wonderfully. Tom Noonan speaks with the soft tone of innocence but with the look of death. The Pledge will keep you gripped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been So Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed after watching this film. I very much expected to see a more chilling story with good twists and superb acting. The acting was very second rate despite Jack Nicholson and the small appearance of Benicio De Toro and as for twists, well...they are more like pot holes.The story is about a retired detective who pledges to a murdered girl's parents that he will find the killer even after he is retired....sounds good heh...don't keep your hopes up......I'm sure the director, Sean Penn, could have done a much better job. Two good points about the movie is the music (nice one again Mr. Zimmer) and the very impressive cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge talent, huge disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be gracious to Sean Penn and say up front that he has great potential as a director, but I'll emphasize the word potential. I frankly was dumbfounded to learn this was a 2-hour movie. I suppose it seemed longer as I stopped it 4 times, checked my watch 6 times, and spent the last 45 minutes yelling "Resolve it already!" This is intended to be an artsy film, but unlike a successful, similarly unresolved art film such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, The Pledge is stultifyingly in its pointlessness and lack of logic. What bothered me most was the abrupt switch of Nicholson's character from a near breakdown in his colleagues' office to complete normality for nearly the rest of the film to the totally unforgiveable ending. I wish Sean Penn would read through these comments; one reviewer suggested an ending that would've made this a far more satisfying film with the tragic hero ending Penn wanted. The religious references made no sense in this film, nor did the endless gauzy shots of landscape. One more criticism -- Nicholson's hallucination at the church was just obscene. It's a shame to see such a huge waste of talent, but that's what you'll find if you rent The Pledge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong first directorial effort by Sean Penn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn's directorial debut portends a promising future behind the camera. Despite having to overcome a somewhat flawed screenplay, Penn shows talent at creating a textured character study with some wonderful photography thrown in. While the film drew criticism for its deliberate pace, every scene adds another brushstroke to the human canvas and develops the characters richly. This film is not an action adventure thriller, and it was never intended to be. The only criticism I have of Penn's direction is his failure to rectify a number of plot flaws (like the abortive stake out?no way they pull out like that with so much evidence that the killer might make an appearance).The story follows Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), who on the day of his retirement from the police force is called in to help solve one more case involving the murder of a little girl. When the case is closed after a confession is coerced out of a simpleton, Jerry is not convinced. He made a pledge to the victim's mother to find the killer and he doesn't feel that he is being true to that pledge. So, he buys a gas station in the area he suspects that the killer resides and does a little investigating from within the community.Penn keeps the film intriguing, giving us subtle clues that cast suspicion on numerous characters as possible murder suspects. At one point I even thought the murderer might have been Jerry. Ultimately the murderer is revealed, but the ending is unsatisfying, leaving the viewer without the vindication of seeing him properly brought to justice.Nicholson is at his moody and sardonic best in this film. He has an innate ability to play the complex and offbeat character to perfection, always believable despite being on the fringe of mental instability. Robin Wright Penn takes an unglamorous role portraying a hard working lower class mother and gives a tremendous performance. Aaron Eckhart is obnoxious and unbelievable as detective Stan Krolak, but Benicio Del Toro is outstanding as the simple minded Toby, who gets pinned with the murder because he was seen in the area.This is a good film with a mediocre story and a promising outing for Penn. I rated it a 7/10. Action junkies will be bored but for those who enjoy a good character study it is worth a look.</fullReview>

This is one of the first roles I've seen where I got so caught up in Jack Nicholson's character that I forgot it was Jack Nicholson. Jack does an exquisite job as does his supporting cast.

		<fullReview>Originally, I was planning on voting for this extremely well made film, and leaving it at that. Then I began to read the negative reviews that this film was receiving, and felt that I needed to give it a bit of justice. First of all, i wasn't expecting anything spectacular going into the film. However i was very pleasantly surprised. Sure it was slow moving at points, but that didn't bother me at all. The pacing was perfect for the tone of the film. The story slowly gathered itself- drawing me further into the mystery that centered around the murder of a young girl. Jack Nicholson was great. And the ending was definitely different.I was so gripped on the storytelling of the film, and how it revealed new characters and plot twists. This was a very unexpected surprise and one hell of a movie!8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Great Cinematography, Plot has holes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to agree that this movie has some of the elements to make it great. It was moving, had great acting, and was a joy to look at. What killed it for me were the holes in the plot. I don't think there was enough setup for Jerry's complete break with reality at the end. There were some signals that his thought process wasn't what it should be, but not to the extent that a shism to this extent would occur.This next point was the kicker for me. Let's see, we have an entire SWAT team on a stakeout waiting for a black station wagon to show up. It doesn't show so we leave and on the way back we see, lo and behold, a fatal accident involving a black station wagon! Hmmmmm could there be a connection?? Apparently not, no, Jerry is an alcoholic and a clown what a shame, lets go home.I wish the movie sucked because then I wouldn't have been so disappointed with the ending. And yes, I realize part of my disappointment is that things were not tied up in a nice little bundle like they are in most movies. I just think that the ending would have been more palatable with the proper plot setup.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are advised to read the comments others made about this film; they are mostly right, even when they differ broadly. And this is so because this movie is about how different people react before different situations in life. Thus, upon the brutal murder of a young girl we witness the reaction of a Native trapper (who may, or may not be the killer) as running away, and the face of a young boy who sees the body. We also learn of a policeman who knows the family of the dead girl, but "rather not" be in charge of informing them. Another detective who laughs at the thought of a policeman being so "sensitive" that he rather not talk to the family of the victim. We even get to see the father, who upon learning that his only child has been brutally murdered, gets upset because a policeman enters his house smoking!!! You witness the visit to the father of another girl who cry his soul out, even though 4 years have passed since his little girl disappeared.I am 51 years old, and I have done, or witness all those behaviours, and more in very stressful circumstances.This is a film about life, love, and death, and how different people react to them. This is a film that respects its audience, and does not try to trick them. Read the comments of those who like the film, those who love it, and those who were disappointed by it. They are all right, because this film has as many angles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will it ever end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You almost have to make a pledge that you will finish this movie, and that might be one of the hardest promises you ever have to keep. This movie was boring. I am sorry Mr. Penn, I know you are an Artist and your films are so unique and all, but get to it. I kind of enjoyed "The Indian Runner" and thought "The Crossing Guard" was OK, but this film had serious problems. For one, it looks like a bad Robert Altman movie. Plenty of cameos by famous actors, but for no real reason, except name dropping. Top rank actors who play boring, meaningless roles. Moreover, I thought the storyline was simplistic. Not to spoil anything, but Nicholson's character is just not very consistent. He is sure about who the Psycho is, but he lets his little girl carry on a conversation with him while she builds a snowman. The basics of the story, are that Jack is retiring and he has little else to fall back on. The night he retires, a little girl is killed. They arrest the guy that does it, but Jack is sure that he did not do it (why? who knows? Maybe he just wants something to do). For the rest of the movie, Jack kind of looks for the real killer (if he is indeed still out there) and kind of does not look for him. My problem with the movie, is that it is so slow! It just crawls and at about the sixth hour (I might be over stating here) I just wanted it to end. The scenery was not that pretty and the images are not either. He throws in a little religion, but for no real reason. This is the kind of film, where someone that wants to be different will say "I really liked it," but I am different, and I did not! ** out of **** and that is being nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was completely drawn in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the most compelling I've seen in a while. Jack Nicholson is more subdued in this character than he usually is, which is a testament to his reading of the character and to Penn's directing. Jerry (Nicholson) is a retired detective who is so disturbed by a violent rape/murder of a girl and the subsequent mishandling of the case that he obsesses over finding the killer for a very long time afterward.This is not an uplifting film, and most of it paints the undoing of the main character. There are some familiar plot devices, but they are all handled artfully and with finesse. The ending is, I believe, intentionally confusing and frustrating, in the same way Chinatown's was. Perhaps it's not coincidence that Nicholson is in both films.I have read several comments that bash this film. Obviously, I disagree with them. But also, I don't think that it's fair to say that plot developments make no sense or, in other cases, are too predictable. Most importantly, this is not structured as a detective/crime/whodunit film, and it should not be treated like one.Having said that, enjoy. I hope Mr. Penn continues with work of this quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've noticed that a lot of "artsy" types of movies (based perhaps on a Life Is Meaningless Tale by an eminent existentialist writer) allow themselves a certain studied artificiality in screenwriting and acting which may even be intended as dramatically subversive, like characters breaking out of the scene into the movie studio in a Fellini film. As regards THE PLEDGE, I'm referring to the crucial scene in which Nicholson's cop character takes one "on his soul's salvation." Sorry, but that was just an actress reading a Thematically Important (and bad) Line, and Nicholson's face saying the obvious Meaningful Universe thing: "Look lady, you've had a tough break and I sympathize, but get a life..." even though it would seem that given future developments The Pledge meant something more to him... I wanted the scene with the eagle-eyed psychologist (Helen Mirren) to last longer, and to be shot in a simple Meaningful Universe long shot without all the fancy audio distortions and flashbacks. Granted, the obsessed cop had his reasons for tuning her out, but I think that if we had been allowed to see just the expression on her face by the end of their little chat, we would have known some things that the movie never tells us- like maybe the cop's interest in little girls, dead or alive, was a bit unwholesome? As for the cop, already known as a nutcase, getting all those other cops to go along with his outrageous scheme involving his lover's daughter, now we're in Parallel Universe territory. THE PLEDGE is right up there with THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD as far as distractingly unnecessary starpower goes. (Though at least here, they're all just fine, Miss Redgrave, Stanton, Rourke, and all.) Robin Wright is great as the cop's troubled waitress lover, but the director seems to have broken with form and spotlit her in the kinds of conventional emotional states at which a little gold man nods...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the year. Oscars await!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone who sees this movie and does not think that it is one of the best films of the year needs only to reflect on just a few of the critical and distinguishing elements that make it a truly great motion picture.You can put aside the amazing and the most subtle performance of Jack Nicholson's career (which will surely garner another Oscar nomination) and the brilliant direction of Sean Penn (who, like Robert Redford, is one of his generation's best actors, but is destine to be known as an even greater director). These elements alone make this a good film. But it is two other things that make it phenomenal. First, the cinematography and the musical score are astounding, full of symbolic contrasts, and genuine contributors to the breadth of the character study that is the theme of the film. (Make no mistake: this is not a crime drama, and to think it is misses the point and its impact as cinematic art). Even more importantly, the supporting acting, collectively, is sublime, the best of any film I have ever seen.Consider: First, Robin Wright's performance. She is so completely given to her character that some viewers familiar with her work might not even recognize her until her role is half completed. Second, the perfect tone of the performance of Helen Mirren as the child psychologist. Third, Benicio del Toro. An absolutely stunning performance that almost single handedly demonstrates his immense range!! But the best two performances are from Vanessa Redgrave, whose subtle and heart-wrenching depiction of a mournful grandmother is mesmerizing. And finally, Mickey Rourke. I've never been a big fan of his. But his two minute cameo in this movie is so compelling and emotionally evocative that it truly heartbreaking. On the basis of this brief but memorable performance, I now have gone completely in the other direction, and think of him as a great actor.Fans of the crime drama genre may be somewhat disappointed with this film. Fans of great acting will be amazed at the collection of career performances on one movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a unique movie that is beautifully shot, and absolutely compelling &amp; engrossing through &amp; through. However, I am very disappointed w/ the ending. The movie is based on a book (which I've never read), and it seems to me that Penn lost the last chapter, and decided to make up his own, as it is very unusual. It's the kind of movie that doesn't fit the cookie-cutter shapes coming out of Tinseltown, as it is unpredictable, tragic and definitely haunting. Nicholson gives a moving performance, and the under-rated Harry Dean Stanton is in it for all of 2 whole minutes. It is a great movie, however, all in all, I'd have to say disappointing....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>salvation, remains consistent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interpretation, spoilers:With the title, the most important theme of the movie is established. Yet what is it about the pledge? Since the pledge is of a decidedly Christian nature, we must assume that the theme revolving around the pledge shares this nature. The pledge is synonymous with swearing - something prohibited by the bible. Moreover, the subject of the pledge is also something that can never be given certitude to mortals according to the bible, so the pledge is doubly anti-Christian. The tension arises from the assumption that the cop is a very religious man; if he were not, he as a retired man would not have so completely immersed himself both psychologically and physically into a closed case. Thus the fear of damnation serves as an impetus moving the plot along. The plot is essentially a telling of the progressively more desperate attempts and graspings at air of the cop. The movie ends with what was alluded to from the start: the cop is bordering on madness and angrily mumbling to himself. He will never know what the Indian had to do with the murders, for the Indian's anxious placement at the scene of the first crime is never explained; and when the cop hears of the wizard's death, he will never know for sure if the wizard was a serial killer. All the evidence regarding wizards and porcupines and drawings may end up to be a coincidence, "imagination." This idea is given life at the end, when the cop feels he is so near to assuring his salvation, the wizard is coincidentally killed in a car crash. It's an Oedipus-like story in which the protagonist exhausts himself in an unconquerable journey. Like Oedipus, the cop cannot even hope to change his fate (predestination).The emotional terror caused by the fact that this brutal, pedophilic, child rapist is never found is warranted and necessary for the film to remain consistent.</fullReview>

Unlike movies like "The Sixth Sense" or "The Crying Game", this one did not feel like it was designed to completely mislead me and then slap me in the face with the truth. The Pledge just let me assume what I wanted to and see what I wanted to, and then fairly gently showed me that I had made an error in judgement.It was pretty slow, yeah. Don't start it ten minutes before your normal bed time and try to stay up late to watch it - you might not make it through. But my partner usually chooses action flicks and comedies designed for those with a short attention span, and he wasn't bored with this one. I liked Mr. Nicholson in this movie. In his last few movies it seemed to me he got away with just raising his eyebrow and giving that classic Nicholson crazy-man smile instead of *acting*. The Pledge was different for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Do you swear on your soul's salvation" that you will find the killer??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some spoilers... Nicholson's character, 6 hours from retirement as one of the the best police detectives ever, gets sucked into this case, the gruesome molestation, murder and dismemberment of a 7-yr-old girl in the woods, in the snow, and when the mother asks, about not giving up until the killer is found, "Do you swear on your soul's salvation", he unwisely says "Yes"!! I could have lost interest at that point, because it was ridiculous for anyone to ask such a thing, and equally ridiculous for a sane person to say 'yes', but perhaps they thought it was necessary for the rest of the film to feel right.So he devotes his life in retirement, telling a doubting cop, "You're old enough to remember when a promise meant something." He studies the case, finds connections to others, discovers a drawing of "a giant", the "wizard" with a black car who was giving her chocolate porcupine candies, buys a local gas station for surveillance of all the people in the area, gets involved with a lady (Robin Wright Penn) and her little girl, using bad judgement uses the girl as "bait", mom is rightly upset, the "wizard" never shows up for the meeting he arranged.What is unique in this film is that only us, the audience, and none of the characters, ever figure out what happened. Nicholson's character becomes a chain smoker, a drunk, loses his relationships, his gas station fails, he is rapidly becoming crazy, all because he made this "pledge" that he can never fulfill and he can never realize that. The killer was Oliver, the husband of the Christmas Store lady, near the end was hunting in the store, saying, "Oliver, where did you put those candies. Oh, here's some...", the chocolate porcupine candies. We see Oliver driving his car towards the meeting point, crossing the centerline, and dying in a blazing head-on crash with a large truck. All the cops in the stake-out, all the towns people, none of them ever suspected that Oliver was the killer. The fire would have destroyed any evidence, like the candies, that may have tied him to the crimes.It is interesting that we never really see Oliver, except a hazy image through a window of the Christmas Store, or his fluffy grey hair from behind as he drives the car. There is no character development for him, because none is needed. The story is not about him, it is about Nicholson's character and how a good intention (the "pledge") can ultimately, through a quirk of fate, destroy your life. My wife and I both found this a very absorbing film, lots of opportunity to guess, usually incorrectly, what would happen next. Watching the film on DVD is a big help, as we were able to go back, after the end, to replay parts of key scenes to piece everything together. It is all there, if you listen and watch carefully. Good movie, good job by Penn and Nicholson, I rate it "8" of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SAD TALE OF OBSESSION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A retiring sheriff makes a promise to the mother of a serial killer's victim and becomes obsessed when he comes to believe that local police have pinned the crime on the wrong man. Jack Nicholson is superb, as usual, and Robin Penn Wright leads a generally excellent, supporting, ensemble cast. The bleak Nevada mountain scenery blends perfectly with the plot and Sean Penn proves again that he can direct experienced professionals. The story unfolds well, although predictable, and has a fitting end. Of special note are the fine but brief performances by Harry Dean Stanton and Mickey Rourke.So why did this production leave me with an empty feeling? The movie itself is fatalistic and slow moving. The viewer can never really understand how the sheriff developed into who he is and the mother who elicits the pledge isn't quite convincing. I've never read the book but perhaps flashbacks about the Nicholson character could have helped.This is a film to be seen on the big screen by cinematography students and those who appreciate fine acting and don't want to feel challenged by a story. Those who budget their movie viewing would be better advised to wait until Showtime or Cinemax picks this up.**1/2. Two and a half stars because of the acting and story flow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to be disappointed with this movie. It sets itself up as a crime drama, but never really delivers the expected outcome; and, indeed, the focus for most of the film is detective Jerry Black himself and not the crime. If you watch this one expecting a thriller, expect to be bored.What this film is really about is a psychological study of obsession and its effects on people. This is done with a great deal of subtlety and insight, although some of the techniques used here struck me as too formulaic (like when Jerry constantly hears significant bits of dialogue in his head). If you find this sort of in-depth character-oriented drama interesting, you will enjoy the film despite its very slow pace.</fullReview>

Nicholson gives a good performance as a veteran police detective who has promised to catch a child killer. This movie is interesting and mysterious from Nicholson's performance to the ending of the film. When this was first released all of the theaters in my region never got The, Pledge in my opinion that was showing disrespect to the best movie legend of all-time Jack Nicholson so I had to wait and watch this on video.

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I cringe watching, in this case starting about halfway through. It even almost makes you believe in it.At first, I thought that Jack Nicholson was mis-cast. But after watching the end of the movie, I realized that he was perfectly cast. Unfortunately, as well as I believe he was cast at the end, the movie itself is a letdown. It does an ok job of drawing you into the story, but completely falls apart in front of your eyes with an unbelievable Hollywood/Murphy's Law style ending (although it was a surprise). Worse, you are left with the impression that the poor main character has no hope of a decent life ahead. To sum up, it was a depressing beginning, an almost decent middle, and a very depressing ending. Not one I would watch again, or recommend except if you have had a really cruddy day and want to be psychologically toyed with and depressed by this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is easy to dismiss this movie for one reason or another. Either it was too blue, or the ending didn't satisfy some, or whatever. But it was a really, good movie. Tight directing, great acting, and the viewer becomes very invested in this drama from the first scene 'till the last. I felt my mood change about halfway through it--some might get upset by this feeling. For others, it is called 'getting lost' in the plot. I felt the pressure.Jack Nicholson, who rarely disappoints, gives a commanding performance as a cop going into retirement with mixed emotions...he has had a great career, but in his last 6 hours as a detective, he visits the crime scene of a murdered juvenile girl. The family makes a demand on him that he doesn't have the heart to deny. That demand, his 'pledge' to them, and his reaction to it for the remainder of the movie, forms the basis of an obsession that gradually erodes the Nicholson character's view of the world to the end of the movie. The absolute certainty that Nicholson feels about the presence of his target later in the movie was particularly compelling, since only the viewer knows 'the big picture.' Great work. I was only disappointed with the lack of DVD extras...8/10 stars :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful adaptation that stays true to the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film makers did not "fix" Friedrich Duerrenmatt's story "that wasn't broken" they actually stayed very close to the book (except changing the time and place, which isn't important to the story). One has to understand that "The Pledge" is not a remake of the German 1958 movie "It Happened in Broad Daylight" but an adaptation of the novel that Duerrenmatt based on the story he had written for that movie. While it was the movie's intention to educate about the dangers of sexual crimes, Duerrenmatt's novel was meant to criticize the genre of mystery novels itself. In the novel the police chief who tells the story to the writer says that it could never be a novel or a movie because it is too "real", too close to life to work as fiction. It does not meet what people have come to expect from a mystery novel and that's exactly what makes Sean Penn's "The Pledge" so controversial. Everybody who is familiar with Duerrenmatt's work knows that he was a very intellectual writer and that his stories work on many levels, they never are just what they seem at first glance. I encourage everybody to read the novel who wants to really understand the movie. If you like to think along while you watch a movie you will get a lot out of "The Pledge". If you like to turn your brain off and just get entertained then it is probably not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a non Hollywood formula character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, in time going to be an example of one of those love or loathe films perhaps even reaching cult status. Despite an all star cast, a reputable Film Star/Director and initially a rather familiar plot, most mainstream seeking cinema-goers will be disappointed in the outcome. On the other hand it's an achievement to follow the Sean Penn/Jack Nicholson collaboration, The Crossing Guard, their previous effort, Penn proving himself as an effective filmmaker and Nicholson proving that he is an actor and not just a movie megastar.It's the emotion, the loneliness, the obsession and the ever righteous attitude of Nicholson's character that drives the movie along at a slow pace yet managing to remain enthralling. Aaron Ekhart, Benecio Del Toro, Robin Wright Penn and Sam Shepherd add support alongside a slightly wasted list of cameo appearances including Vanessa Redgrave, Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton and Mickey Rourke. Like Nicholson in the movie, as a viewer you seek satisfaction as he becomes more determined to find the truth and catch the culprit of a brutally murdered young girl, he always seems to be on the right track but you often question his intelligence...was this guy really a retired homicide detective?Like many controversial thrillers the climax of the movie, which I won't go into will be talked about whenever the film comes up in conversation...are we satisfied? has justice been done?This is a thought provoking film, beautifully shot despite it's grim subject matter but it's a safe bet that it won't break box office records, but staying clear of Hollywood's Good Guys and Bad Guys clichés this film does offer alternative originality.</fullReview>

Then it started getting implausible, changing from "An Honest Man's Lonely Quest to Find the Truth" to "How Stupid Can An Honest Man Be?" If you're willing to believe, let alone sympathize with, a man who would mortally imperil one little girl in order to capture the killer of another, and if you can swallow even more disbelief and accept that his fellow police officers would go along with this ludicrous scheme, you might be able to get through the entire movie without shaking your head in disgust. Even then, the deus-ex-machina "anti-Hollywood-ending" ending makes the whole thing so terribly bitter that all you can salvage from this flawed effort is the consistently excellent acting and Sean Penn's skilled directing. Otherwise, it's a good idea gone bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several comments here, I found a lot of IMDB members claimed that The Pledge was realistic, and had an ending that people who appreciate "reality based" films would enjoy. I would agree with that, if only the characters had an authentic feel to them. Most of the actors in this film felt like they were going through the motions (Nicholson included). If the viewer can't believe what is on the screen (not in all cases, but in this movie belief is necessary) most of us will lose an interest quickly, and I did. From the moment that Nicholson's cop character makes a pledge to the grieving mother of a slain daughter (who asks Jack to swear on his soul that he'll find the child's killer), we are supposed to believe he is sincere and that he'll do whatever it takes to bring justice to the victim's family.From early on, I could care less if the family finds closure. The mother came after Jack with a conviction not much unlike Piper Laurie in Carrie. Sounds ridiculous? Unbelievable? It is... It's been a long time that I can remember Jack Nicholson giving such a poor performance. There's a reason this film dropped out of sight so quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film but easily misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another commentator noted that THE PLEDGE has many affinities to Atom Agoyan's THE SWEET HEREAFTER. Yes, but it has even stronger affinities to AFFLICTION (also based on a novel by Russell Banks). In AFFLICTION Wade Whitehouse is a lonely, depressed rural cop who develops a fixation about a deer hunting accident that might not have been an accident. In the book and film Whitehouse's investigations become obsessional, ultimately deluded, and terribly destructive. Indeed, AFFLICTION isn't really a detective story at all but an increasingly grim character study of a man who is desperate to reclaim his self-respect by enacting fantasies of chivalric heroism. Much the same can be said for Jerry (Jack Nicholson), the retired detective in THE PLEDGE, who promises a murdered girl's mother that he'll find the killer. What makes this film so great--and so easy to misread and despise--is that it sets up a classic cop genre paradigm (i.e., the old warhorse cracks that last big case and shows the younger generation how its done) only to radically subvert genre conventions in its closing moments. Audience members trained to see the battered hero triumph over evil will be sorely disappointed. But that's precisely the point of this anti-genre film. Real life offers no predictable, formulaic outcomes. Sometimes the would-be hero, though right and righteous, is confounded, defeated, and destroyed. Deal with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The approach of the movie is down and close-in, pushing hideous acts of human cruelty forward and juxtaposing them with an old policeman's inability to accept his time is done.Many criticize Nicholson's character's motivation, his "pledge" during a scene in which the mother of the murdered girl demands Nicholson's promise to find the killer. The scene is embarrassing to watch and embarrassing for Nicholson, who agrees only because he is so off-balance where it concerns human emotion: he's been a cop too long, too long outside a society where family and love is strived for, not the apprehension of serial killers.Nicholson's subsequent investigation is nixed, he determines where the killer might strike next and establishes a life in a geographic hot-spot for such activity. What Nicholson is doing is not fulfilling any "pledge" to the murdered girl's parents--he's staving off loneliness and paranoia and old age, and using the promise as an excuse not to become what all other 'people' are: victims. All victims of one kind of crime or another. Nicholson feels he is superior; he is superior and he is horribly justified. He is sun-ravaged and insane, but is certain that he is right. Lacking the support of the world of police, Nicholson is a ghost haunting through his own memories of his flimsy private life, and finding only a cop on the job who can't stop looking.Fascinating stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actor/director Sean Penn reunites with Jack Nicholson for another slow-paced, thoughtful film about death, and moving on with life in The Pledge, a superior film to their 1995 outing, The Crossing Guard.Nicholson stars as detective Jerry Black, recently retired, who decides to leave his retirement party to go and help investigate an 8 year old girl's murder. He is confronted by the parents, whom he pledges to find the killer for.The Pledge may have the earmarks of a thriller, but director Sean Penn's subtle and intelligent handling of the material elevates this into a thought-provoking, considerate character study. Not only does Penn provide a crime thriller in the revelation of clues as to who the real murderer might be, he also focuses on Nicholson's character and his illusion that he is indeed moving on with his life after retirement, even though he is simply deluding himself and becoming increasingly desperate to find the killer.Jack Nicholson's nuanced performance is right on target, and the veteran actor tackles the role with the subtlety and grace he usually never gets to exhibit due to his mostly over-the-top roles. His quiet demeanor, tired pale and relentless prodding into the case truly give a sense of tragedy to Black's dogged persistence and inability to deal with a life of retirement, where he has been so used to always being active and busy with his work. Robin Wright provides good work as the mother who becomes attached to Jerry but doesn't know that he has mixed intentions for their relationship.It's unusual for a Hollywood studio to produce a movie that moves confidently slow and offers a tragic, decidedly downbeat ending. Jack Nicholson is at his understated best and director Sean Penn delivers a slow, thoughtful, and meticulously well-crafted character study.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Companion piece to "The Sweet Hereafter"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pledge has many similarities to The Sweet Hereafter, directed by Atom Egoyan. Both movies are slow paced and thoughtful, and involve an older man investigating the death of children in a rural setting. In Penn's film, the deaths are murders and the investigator is a retired cop, while in Egoyan's film the deaths are the result of a school bus accident, and the investigator is a big-city lawyer looking for clients and grounds for lawsuits. In both cases, the investigator has to face grieving parents, and makes promises involving bringing to account the persons responsible for their children's deaths. In the end, both investigators go too far, and alienate the communities that they are trying to help.Both movies contain extensive scenes of small town/rural life in the winter, with a similar sombre mood. The exteriors of both films were shot in British Columbia (standing in for Nevada in the case of The Pledge), with The Sweet Hereafter shot in the the towns of Spence's Bridge and Merritt, and The Pledge in Lytton and Merritt. All three locations are within an hour's drive of each other.The investigator/lawyer of The Sweet Hereafter is like a city-dwelling hunter, out for the weekend, who has to be back in the office Monday morning. He is only in town temporarily, and will abandon it if his hunting is unsuccessful. He bustles around town trying to locate his "prey" (families willing to have him represent them in liability lawsuits). If rejected by one family, he simply moves on - his prey is not specific, but is whatever he can find by "beating the bushes" of the small town in his rented car.Jack Nicholson however, in The Pledge, is a fisherman with a highly specific prey in mind. He researches his fishing grounds, sets up his fishing spot, and settles in for a long wait for his prey to show itself. At first, his efforts are solitary, and the difference between the gas station that he has bought in the area where he thinks the murderer lives and the hut in which he ice fishes is only one of scale, not of philosophy. Fate however offers him the opportunity to use "live bait", which as a TV program playing in the background of one scene reminds us, is usually more effective than artificial lures. From then on he is a man pursuing mutually contradictory courses of action. On the one hand, he cares deeply for the child in his care, and panics whenever there is the slightest possibility of her being in danger. On the other hand, he cold-bloodedly arranges to display her as bait in a highly visible location. In the manner of a fly fisherman selecting a fly, he even ensures that her clothing matches the supposed preferences of his prey.Both The Pledge and The Sweet Hereafter are treats for moviegoers who enjoy finely crafted character studies, and seeing both adds to the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt about it, this film had a lot of things going for it -- great cast (and Nicholson's best performance in a while), capable director, fine music from Hans Zimmer, and a potentially interesting story/character study. Too bad it winds up such an unmitigated mess.Most of the blame should go to director Penn. Look, I enjoy a movie that doesn't feel the market pressure to ratchet up every scene to 10 on the Richter scale, but this film is low-key to the point of absolute catatonia. Penn makes Tarkovsky look like Michael Bay. Scenes drag on forever with no apparent reason or focus.The script is a problem too, however. The story is a tragedy (in more ways than one), and by their nature tragedies tend to incorporate coincidences which lead to the hero's downfall. It's important, however, at least in modern tragedies, these coincidences seem as organic to the story and believable as possible. But in "The Pledge" none of the plot points seem natural, they're noticably forced and manipulated to get Nicholson's character to where he has to be by the film's conclusion.An unfortunate misfire.</fullReview>

I'm sure I would not have enjoyed The Pledge as a 14 y.o., but fortunately, I have since then lived and learned to enjoy different, more intricate qualities in movies.So what if this movie is not like Seven or Silence of the Lambs. Maybe the marketing was wrong; hard to judge from here. Not sure why so many people apparently chose the wrong movie to watch. I enjoyed it immensely, and I admire the fact that Mr. Penn could make such a complex and beautiful film at his relatively young age. I liked it more than his previous work, which was not bad either. The plot twist near the end was disturbing, but not in the sick way Hannibal is disturbing. The Pledge is a movie to ponder on for a couple of hours. Great. More movies should do that.The fact that the comments here are so varied and explicit, is a compliment in itself. Way to go Sean!

I saw it last night at a little independent theatre in Maine and people left grumbling, and I couldn't believe that they didn't get it. Then I went to the web and read the reviews and was stunned that not one review even alluded to the mastery of this thing.If you are a more than typically shrewd and respectful movie viewer and give this one the attention it deserves (believe me, give it that attention), go see it with a couple of common, run-of-the-mill TVidiot types who tend to take what they watch at face value. Follow details closely. If you GET IT, and you're hanging out with these clowns afterward talking about the structure of this movie, you'll find yourself in an argument with them that puts you in EXACTLY THE PREDICAMENT that drives Jack Nicholson mad as Jerry Black. You won't appreciate the value of this film 'til you're in that argument.There's a lot of taut beauty and craftsmanship, sure. And a very cool cast. But that's just window dressing, and if you don't see behind the curtain it's not enough to take it out of the range of upper mediocrity. FOLLOW THE DETAILS though, and it's a very different story.I know just the kind of people who missed the hook (or took the wrong one) and completely misread this film. I just can't believe there are so many of you fumbling around in the dark out there. Does it always need to be spoonfed to you like The Sixth Sense?This film is the Bomb.

		<fullReview>Sean Penn's "The Pledge" shows you what happens when a group of immensely talented folks pool their collective genius, commit to an intriguing idea, and, through blood, sweat, and good hard work, produce a pretentious, nearly unwatchable piece of artsy-fartsy crap.Jack Nicholson, one of the best actors around by any yardstick, stars as Jerry Black, a Reno, Nevada cop one day from retirement. If he knew his movies, he'd know that this is always a bad sign, but no matter; Penn's Reno doesn't appear to have a movie theatre anyhow. Jerry is called away from his retirement party by a murder; a little girl has been found dead in a snow-blasted field. It's up to Jerry to deliver the news to the child's parents, ne'er-do-well turkey farmers who make the old cop swear, on a crucifix made by the little girl, to bring the killer to justice. This idea begins to consume him, and even after he leaves the force, even after he takes up with a sad young woman (Robin Wright Penn) with her own little girl, he is driven recklessly to find this killer. His pledge becomes his obsession, and drives him over the edge to the brink of madness.Good premise, fraught with real dramatic potential. Good cast, too. The film is practically a parade of familiar faces, most of whom acquit themselves quite admirably. There's Vanessa Redgrave as the dead girl's grandmother, Aaron Eckhart as Jerry's partner, Benicio Del Toro as a mentally challenged Indian murder suspect, Mickey Rourke as another victim's miserable father, Sam Shepherd as the chief of police...it's like Penn went to Spago's on a really busy day and promised everyone he ran into a part in his next film. That's the nice thing about actors with creative control; they can usually pull together a good cast just by talking to their friends.And the bad thing about it? Since actors are the true powers in Hollywood, there's not enough people willing to tell them when a project is going nowhere. It happened with Travolta and "Battlefield Earth", and here it happens again. Penn, given this great cast and intriguing idea, proceeds to drive the film into the ground through the force of sheer artistic pretension. Nothing is more tedious, in film, literature, or anything, than symbolism that symbolizes nothing, and Penn weighs his film down with shots of fields, flying birds, snow, and any natural phenomenon he can think of, until it starts to feel like all these stars are just getting in the way of a very nice nature documentary Penn was trying to make. And guess what these shots symbolize? That's right! NOTHING! Empty. Pretentious.Nicholson's obsession, rather than seeming to emerge naturally, through plot occurrences and character reversals, instead seems imposed on him by the material, like he read the script and knew he was going to go crazy by the end of the film (this is not to take away from Nicholson, who does his job with reasonable skill). Still, he's forced to muddle in obscure, meaningless plot twists, and nothing at all happens during most of his lengthy interlude with Wright Penn. I have to confess that I nodded off for a good portion of this section of the film, but don't think that makes me unqualified to write about the film. The friend I saw the film with tells me I missed nothing. Nothing important, anyhow.After Jerry chases a creepy old preacher (Tom Noonan) for the last third of the picture, culminating in an excruciating hallucination sequence in which he guns the man down at his pulpit, the identity of the killer is revealed. It's a character who appeared in about three seconds of a previous scene, was not set up for us in any meaningful way, and therefore the revelation means NOTHING to us. Plus, it involves dumb little porcupine-shaped candies, which ticks me off for reasons I can't even explain to myself. And guess what? Jerry never finds out who this guy is! The killer dies in a car crash that has NOTHING to do with the rest of the film! So we end with Jerry jibbering in drunken insanity outside a broken-down old gas station, and for what? Repeat after me, class: NOTHING!"The Pledge" is one of those films that made me angry with its badness. It's the worst kind of unsatisfying filmgoing experience, because unlike "Battlefield Earth", it takes itself too seriously to allow you to laugh at its badness. It's heavy and plodding, with no humor to leaven the "tension", and the weight of its pretensions eventually drags you down, leaving you feeling drained, and not in the way that a good, emotionally wrenching drama can, but the way you do after a day of slogging away at a boring, unrewarding job."The Pledge" was the second 2001 release I had the misfortune of seeing. The first was "Antitrust", the lame-o computer thriller. Let me just say one thing for the record. If you're ever in a situation where you've seen a film starring Ryan Phillippe AND Rachael Leigh Cook, and it's STILL not the worst thing you've seen that year, look out. It's rough moviegoing waters ahead for sure.By the way, if I ever find the person who recommended that people who liked this film also check out "Man On The Moon", I owe him an open-handed chop to the throat. I owe one, for that matter, to anyone who liked this film. Look out, Roger Ebert. I'm coming for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good cast, Hans Zimmer, not a bad story, so what went wrong? Is it Sean Penn? Or is it a poorly written story? The main thing I felt with this film was that it was arty, a thriller and a drama but not good at any one of the aforementioned. This in it self is not a bad thing. But if art has a time limit, 2 hours is not it. I felt this movie dragged and was slow at most points. This movie could have been made with the same impact but done in a short film. That way we would not have to watch Jack fish for 45 minutes (sarcasm of course). The other thing was the product placement in this movie. No more then usual except for the Isuzu Rodeo. On more then one occasion I felt like I was watching a commercial for this SUV. One scene it was dirty the next it was clean, like it was driven off the lot. I guess we can be thankful we weren't forced to watch Jack wash his truck and fish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This field says I have 1,000 words... however, I don't think it is possible to eloquently describe just how much this movie made me absolutely sick to my stomach. First of all, the plot was incredibly perverted... Nicholson's character was a horrible person who used the young girl to try to rectify his own failures... Also, it made me want to shoot those idiotic birds right out of the sky and stew them over the car fire of the killer. This wasn't a movie that had an R-rating for nudity or violence so much... it was purely for the fact that this movie should be restricted... to all ages. No one should be allowed to see this monstrosity. And that cop that was working out when Nicholson was talking to him... only a true mental patient could come up with a character like that... I would much rather have had my fingernails ripped off with Q-tips by the psychopathic, suicidal Indian than to have seen this movie. Please someone... give me the gun and let me put myself out of my misery. The only thing that would have made this movie watchable would have been a full cast of strippers in the background to take my mind off of this horror. Which, incidentally, with some of the scenes (such as the girl swinging) lended themselves to strippers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deliver on promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can tell a lot about a film by what time of the year it's released. A film released in the Spring for instance, isn't looking for Oscar recognition, but probably was thought of as a contender at one point. Something happens and it gets bumped though. It's 'pushed back' to a Spring release. Spring, the season known to the motion picture industry as the year's dumping ground. For one thing, many actual Oscar contenders are still in theaters, so to release a film that wants awards during this time isn't practical. So we get films looking for box office only, like "Save the Last Dance", "Hannibal" or "Get Over It".There are exceptions, like "Erin Brockovich". So when I went to "The Pledge" I had to wonder if this was a strangely placed Oscar contender. I mean, what's wrong with it? Why release it the first week of the year and give it virtually no chance of Oscar glory or box office (putting it up against "Hannibal"). So I went, not just to see what's wrong with it, but because any Sean Penn/Jack Nicholson collaboration seems worth checking out.So I'm sitting in the theater, understanding why this was once scheduled for December release, just under the wire for Oscar eligibility. Penn's visuals are compelling and take you by surprise. The story pulls you in and grips you. Nicholson's retiring Detective Jerry Black hears of a murder during his retirement party. He decides to go along and lend a hand at the scene. I don't want to go into exactly what happens after this because it's so good and I don't want to spoil it. The writing is perfect, the photography, the direction, the performances, everything. This is filmmaking perfection. Jerry vows to find the 8 year-old girl's killer. He promises her mother on his "soul salvation" that he will find the person responsible. I will never forget this scene.The likely killer is apprehended. A confession is coerced out of him. The case is closed. But Jerry doesn't believe this was the guy. Sadly, this is were "The Pledge" derails. True, this is the first plot point. This is where any film is SUPPOSED to twist off into a different direction. But after this scene, it doesn't remain as interesting as it's beginning promised. It stops and takes a look around when it should continue along the path with determination. Jerry, for reasons the audience will not understand at this point in the story, buys an old gas station in an area he believes to be squarely inside the killer's area of activity. He takes residence in the same small town, then waits. He catches the eye of a waitress (Robin Wright-Penn) with an abusive ex-husband and a young daughter and the two begin seeing each other.You could almost guess the kind of direction the story takes after this. Penn keeps giving you the interesting visuals, but is crippled by the contrived, coincidence-driven story. The film never regains the emotional power it left the gate with.So THAT'S why they didn't release it in December. I recommend it anyway because it features another great performance by Mr. Nicholson. The first third alone is worth the price of admission. Too bad it couldn't have fulfilled its own promise. It coulda been a contender.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one line summary is the tagline for "In the Cold Light of Day" (1994 with Richard Grant and Lynsey Baxter in the Jack Nicholson / Robin Wright parts), book by the same author and it's the same movie with different actors. It is remarkable that there is not one comment comparing "The Pledge" with its predecessor. `In the Cold Light of Day' is not a perfect movie but the plot and characters hold together better than in `The Pledge'. Things make more sense - the mother coming to live with (basically) a total stranger (and she IS aware of the child killings), reasons for the child to disregard the warnings about talking with strangers, a motive for why the killer kills, and there IS a killer in the first movie. Perdita Weeks as the child is remarkable in the first movie.The previous movie was filmed in Eastern Europe with scenery astonishingly like the scenery in `The Pledge'. The beginning of both movies is very similar and it is a deju vu experience. Once into the movie, `The Pledge' takes its own mountain road and I do not need to go into discrepancies in `The Pledge' that should not have happened, since other posters have already done so. There are many weaknesses yet there are great strengths in `The Pledge'. Sean Penn has constructed some wonderful performances from his actors. Most notably, Vanessa Redgrave and Mickey Rourke. Sean Penn has achieved something no other director has ever accomplished, he finally got an exceptional performance out of Mickey 'insipid smile' Rourke. I may even have changed my opinion about Mr. Rourke's acting ability after seeing this movie. With the exception of Mickey Rourke's presentation, even the exceptional performances do not hold the film together when inserted into the whole of it. Although Ms. Redgrave's performance was superb, I also got the opposite feeling from her characterization - that she just didn't give a damn about anything. Robin Wright's performance also left that dichotomous sensation - she may have liked Jack Nicholson's character but maybe not really. There is no chemistry between them. I almost got the feeling that Sean Penn was offering up his wife to his pal Jack Nicholson at one point - just for friendship's sake. In previous films, whenever Ms. Wright is on-screen there is a light, a radiance - she glows on the screen. Somehow, her light was smothered in this movie. To her credit, she must have amazing self-confidence to play a snaggle-toothed, greasy-haired, dim-witted character, especially with all those close-ups; however, her character just didn't come off.And to Sean Penn's great credit, in his rendering of `The Pledge' he did not do what had already been done with Friedrich Durrenmatt's book and in `In the Cold Light of Day' - he took the song and made it his own.Sean Penn is not underrated or undervalued by those with wits or even half-wits. He is a superbly accomplished actor and director. Of course he should have won the Oscar for `Dead Man Walking'. And some day he'll get what he should have been his. But I don't feel it should be for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is another keen demonstration of one of the finest directors around today. Penn has impressed as an actor for a long time (was that REALLY him in "Fast Times..."?) and keeps satisfying. What a cast! Del Toro, Mirren, Wright Penn (she's up there with the few honestly natural actors- Streep, et cetera), Redgrave, Rourke, Patricia Clarkson and the venerable Harry Dean Stanton. A tale of a policeman's instinctual obsession and it's consequences on his remaining life doesn't tire or bore but sits you in the seat next to him and allows for a stylish, tight telling of a woeful tale. This is life- not filmic fantasy and Penn can bring me, for one, more tales of this quality and film-making beauty any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try to break the movies I see into three categories when I see the trailers..ones that I want to see in the theaters, video rentals and not at all. Unfortunately the trailers for this film moved it into the want to see in the theater (action sequences, which were very few) instead of it's rightful place as a wait for video movie. It is a slow paced movie with decent acting and an acceptable ending. An example of an unacceptable ending would be "The 9th Gate" w/ Johnny Depp. That movie drags you thru it and gives you nothing at the end, real visions or imaginary. In "The Pledge", at least you are dragged through it and are shown something in the end and can draw some conclusions on your own. To truly give an unorthodoxed summary to it's slow pace and lack of action, throughout the second half of the 2+ hour movie I had wanted to use the restroom and didn't because I thought I would miss something, which I didn't. So, if you go see it in the theater and nature calls, answer, you won't miss anything (provided you don't go in the last 10 minutes). 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very interested to see that so many people found this movie, especially the ending, to be a disappointment. One cannot go into this movie expecting a traditional 'whodunnit.'Many commented that the film lacks closure, and that the identity of the killer is left unknown. First of all, the killer's identity is not really relevant, as, in my view, this film is not a traditional mystery. If one pays attention, one can figure out who the killer is. The real story of the film is about a man who makes a rather rash promise, and how this promise eats away at him and threatens to cost him his very soul.If you're looking for a police procedural, look elsewhere. This film is an almost existential story about a promise, and the terrible price that it exacts from him.</fullReview>

Ms. Redgrave is spectacularly good in a tiny role but not all of Mr. Penn's family, friends and associates that populate this movie are quite as successful, and a few of the performances by some perhaps too familiar faces (Rourke, Stanton) are more distracting than effective.The tone of the film is relentlessly downbeat and the ending is contrived and unsatisfying, but all in all it's an interesting chapter in the development of one of our very best actors wearing his director's hat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unusual film at best. I saw it recently and I'm still not sure how to comment on it. There were things that I liked and things that I didn't like but overall it didn't make a huge impact on me. For the most part, when I sit down to watch a movie the most important thing is entertainment value. The movie could have cheesy lines or law defying stunts but if it entertains me, then it achieves its goal. This movie was like a roller coaster ride that never really delivers on the thrill scale. It hinted it at the beginning but fizzles out and leaves an unsatisfied feeling.The Pledge is about a retiring detective (Jack Nicholson) that takes on a final case that turns out to possess his life. On the day of his retirement, a body is discovered that hints of a serial killing. Detective Black chooses duty over retirement and gets involved. A suspect is apprehended and all the signs point to him being the killer despite Black's doubts but a quick confession and conviction closes the case and puts an end to Blacks insistence that the killer is still loose. Accepting his retirement, Black lies back to a life of fishing but a nagging thought in the back of his mind brings him to reopen the case and pick his investigation where he left off.What can you say about Jack Nicholson? He's a fabulous actor and rarely have I seen him give a poor performance. He doesn't disappoint in the Pledge but the story is weak. Sean Penn has never been a conventional storyteller and although he has some smart twists in this storyline I left feeling rather annoyed. The movie began full of suspense. In fact, Penn teased us with a brilliant opening scene and it filled me with anticipation but as the movie progressed I could feel it slow down and by the time the end came I was disappointed although in a way the ending was interesting from a psychological standpoint. From an entertainment point of view, it failed its goal.There is an enormous cast of actors here and all of them accomplished. They all do an incredible job but one in particular stood out. I usually sit and watch the credits to see all the people involved and was very surprised to see Benicio Del Toro had a role. I remember seeing his name at the opening credits but never really noticed him. It wasn't until the end credits that I realized which character he played and was absolutely stunned! He played the character so well that it never occurred to me that it could have been him. He doesn't have a huge role in this movie but after watching it I have to say that it's worth at least the cost of a matinee movie to see his performance.Would I recommend someone to see this movie on full fare? No but it is potentially a good matinee movie. Nicholson is great and Del Toro's performance is scene stealing but the movie on an overall level is not worth full fare.Alan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed to read the praise for this film. Stunned. I see many movies and comment on many of those here. I tend to be rather generous with praise, and I really try not to dole out frivolous criticism. So, I really thought this film was a failure as entertainment, as character study and as a screenplay. To say that it had excellent acting would be an understatement. Given the terrible screenplay, Nicholson, Mirren, Redgrave and Wright should all get special awards for elevating the film beyond the cable TV market. It lumbers. (Rather appropriately, given the ending.) The audience at my screening found refuge in quiet conversations about shopping after the film. Anyone who found this film exciting better wear a seat belt if they ever see a decent BBC detective series. I won't spoil the story line. The endless suspense, like a slow tire leak, is the only thing the film has going for it. I wish I had been a fly on the wall as this film was being made, or unmade. There must have been something to the project for it to have attracted such major talent. Perhaps that is what is running over and over through Detective Black's mind at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler . . ."The Pledge" is an entirely engrossing character study, and Nicholson is convincing as the detective who makes a series of wrong choices and pays a horrible price for them. That said, however, the film is maddening in many ways. I just didn't believe that the suspect's suicide, now matter how damning his confession previously, would prevent their examining the DNA evidence of the case. The little girl had been sexually assaulted; was there no DNA evidence of any kind at the crime scene? If Nicholson's character had suspicions they had the wrong guy, wouldn't he have insisted on this? It also makes little sense later in the film when Nicholson sees cars matching the description of the one in the victim's drawing. He doesn't know anyone back at the dept. who could run a license number? If he is truly obsessed with his "pledge," wouldn't he be more actively investigating his suspects (especially the red herring in film)? We keep hearing what a terrific cop he was, yet his police work involves putting a little girl in a swing set by the road and waiting for the killer to stop by. "Children in jeopardy" makes for a queasy time at any film, but I could have accepted it here if the character had not acted in such an illogical manner. Granted, Nicholson's deteriorating mental state is one of the linchpins of the drama, but other than a couple of failed marriages (certainly standard for all film cops), what evidence did we see that he was unstable? It just seems a cheat to make him a lunatic drunk at the end. Lonely? scarred? remorseful? Yes - those are more usual, and thus more affecting, outcomes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more I think about this film, the more I like it. It's not your typical Hollywood blockbuster (a good thing!), so I can understand why some folks don't like it. It reminded me of an early 70's film. The premise is a typical child rapist/serial killer manhunt story ( throw in handsome young leading white actor with an older black man sidekick) that goes off in another direction. I have to admit at one point about 2/3rds of the way I started getting restless, wondering where the film was going, but I told myself to trust that Sean Penn knows what he's doing, and I was right. Definitely Nicholson's best performance in many a year, I can't forget the scene with Helen Mirren as the child psychologist. One disappointment: I was happy when I saw the shots in downtown Reno, and I thought they filmed it in Nevada, only to find out it was, once again, British Columbia.It seems to me that now, unlike a decade ago when there were all these fresh new independent films coming out, you have to be a big name in Hollywood to get anything original or different produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Jerry Black has made a promise to a suffering parent that becomes an obsession. Sean Penn proves his talent from behind the lens in this well crafted story about a retired cop on the trail of a serial child killer. An advantage of being a fantastic actor who takes on directing a film is that other great actors are drawn to the project. The movie is crammed with great actors taking sometimes miniscule roles. The list includes Robin Wright Penn, of course, Aaron Eckhart, Vanessa Redgrave, Sam Shepard, Helen Mirren, Mickey Rourke and Benicio del Toro. This great cast of actors is lead by Jack Nicholson, a Sean Penn veteran. Penn does a wonderful job telling this story, along with Jack's acting, relaying the torment of the retired cop. The rest of the cast is just as effective as the lead with a special nod to Mickey Rourke and Mr. Del Toro in his third great role in a row(Traffic &amp; Snatch). It is probably one of the best dramas of the year but unfortunately will not be seen by many people. Those who do see should be pleased with the outcome. Go see it!</fullReview>

If you're into loose ends and/or can't pass up a Jack Nicholson film, you'll get your money's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Penn's third strike as a director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I'd give Penn one more shot as a director, and I went to see this film. While certainly his best effort so far, this film rambles and ultimately falls apart. The first half of the film differs from the second half so markedly, you'd think a different (and less talented) director stepped in to complete the project. Jerry Black goes through an unbelievable metamorphosis from crimefighting pundit to total loon. It just doesn't play. There are far too many artsy pauses and fishing scenes where story and character development should be. A disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slight spoilers --General thoughts: This film has been ill-promoted as a serial-killer cop thriller. While these elements are cornerstones of the storyline, the movie's foundation is grounded in far more subtle complexity. Rather, The Pledge explores human emotions, and how they drive human action. This is an epic story with a pace that may put off viewers expecting (or who have been led to expect) frantic scenes in the police headquarters, or copious car chase scenes. Rather, The Pledge is an intellectual thriller. Generous details and recurring themes (Jack's fishing, the porcupines) draw the viewer into the world of the characters, who are well developed, and continue to grow as the film unfolds.Nicholson: Brilliance unbound! Jack Nicholson, sporting a moustache and all-over gnarled appearance, gives his 'retired cop' a richness, a realness. Fans will recognize a few 'trademark' Jack moments, but Nicholson easily loses himself in the character of Jerry Black. This performance is one of his best in a long while - certainly more challenging than his As Good As It Gets role, and beautifully executed. Nicholson's final scene had me spellbound.Penn: Bravo to Sean Penn's direction, which is always quirky and innovative without being distracting. Some predictable scenes and a little too much foreshadowing, but other directorial decisions negate this minor criticism. Many overheads, close ups, half-lits. Also noteworthy is Penn's comfort with silence and pauses, elements which help create 'realism.' The pacing and relationships reminded me a bit of Fargo, in spirit.Aesthetics: One of the haunting things about The Pledge is the music, an instrumental hybrid of Native American and country-western. The soundtrack complements the cinematography well -- coordinating a stanza with a scene of flying birds, for instance.Aftermath: This movie, and Jack Nicholson's performance in it, just gets better and better in retrospect - this is indeed a film that mandates a second viewing. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Penn has created a great film in the Pledge. It is an extremely suspenseful film that is both gratifying and frustrating in the end. Nicholson gives his best performance since Batman as a retired cop dedicated to catching a criminal that he knows exists but cannot prove this to be so. Penn seems to deliberately keep the pace of the movie slow, heightening the suspense each time Robin Wright-Penn's daughter is seen talking with a strange man. Without giving the movie away, all I will say is that in the end, Penn does not allow us to leave the theatre satisfied, but an unsettling feeling of empathy lingers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor films in my mind fall into two main categories: grave insults to my intelligence (i.e. Swingers, Go) and overblown, very loud, pointless films with horrible acting (i.e. Battlefield Earth, Bringing out the Dead, Shaft, Starship Troopers, etc.). When I criticize a film made before, say 1985, I keep in mind that it may be the director's first feature, or that it was a film school project, or that he went nuts and decided to turn a classic into a stupid musical about man eatings plants or something, so I might not immediately shove them in the "insult to my intelligence" category. That was not the case for the Pledge. What kills me is that a smart guy like Sean Penn would decide to churn out such an insult to my intelligence in the year 2001. First of all, a thriller or a good suspense movie to me is a flick that intricately develops the personality of either the killer (serial or not) or the good guy (cop or not). This piece of garbage does neither. Secundo, why the hell did I have to sit through such dribble separating the climax from the pledge, I don't know. Don't tell me that the beautiful scenery or the buildup of the suspense made this movie great cause neither of those elements were present in the film. I was high on caffeine when I entered the movie theather that night and when I came out, I could barely keep my eyes open. And no the unpredictable nature of the ending couldn't save it (I mean does the simple fact that african american girls win the cheerleading competition in "Bring it on" makes it a great movie ? come on... give the viewing public some credit)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From one who has actually disliked most of Sean Penn's work - this movie is a well-made gem. Penn paces things perfectly, the story unfolds as if you were living it. Nicholson is at his best, he leads you to love a character not worthy of your affection. When he cheats on your trust you forgive him the way you would a good friend or relative. Cleverly done.The ending will leave you disappointed as you leave the flick. But you'll start talking to your family and friends about the movie and realize that the story finished the only way it could. Justice is served in every way, and the viewer takes away a lesson too.This is not a movie you'll forget when you leave the theater. A great job by every actor.

		<fullReview>I found this film suspenseful, moving, beautifully filmed and acted, and the ending hit me like a ton of bricks. Nicholson reminds us of what a subtle and powerful actor he can be. But I saw it without expectations at a pre-opening screening and wasn't disappointed by its mixture of psychological character study and police procedural. I have since seen the trailer, which makes it look like a garden-variety serial killer manhunt, and no wonder it received some virulent negative comments ("bad", "worst film ever made"): it was sold to the wrong audience, and people who go to the movies for violent cheap thrills felt cheated. I've also learned that Warner Bros. blocked Sean Penn's wishes to enter The Pledge in prestigious European film festivals before its opening. Apparently they wanted to hide the fact that it's an art film, not "Bone Hunter." I'm sorry that they weren't prouder of the film and didn't trust it for what it is instead of trying to pass it off as something it's not in order to make a quick buck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pledge is the best acted film in the last ten years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the acting Oscars for 2001 could be awarded to this cast. The qualities of the acting I saw in many of the scenes were Personal, Raw, and Courageous. Sean Penn deserves a great deal of credit for creating an environment for this type of acting work and capturing it on film.Robin Wright Penn is as courageous as ever. She never held back.Mickey Rourke was so beautiful - relaxed, simple, and extremely personal in his brief scene - I wanted to reach into the screen and touch him and give him a kiss and tell him how beautiful he is.I felt that there was a new level in Jack Nicholson's work, or something that hasn't been seen from him in a long time. His character was raw and real, and fully wrought. We always expect something good or at least interesting from Nicholson. In this film, he does something great.Benicio Del Toro - what an animal.I will re-watch this film. My current theory about it is that it's only superficially a crime/police based drama. As with the Sergio Leone westerns, that weren't `Westerns.' The conventions and expectations of the crime drama genre are disturbingly warped in The Pledge. The effect is a greater focus on the personal turmoil of Jack Nicholson's character.The cinematography had some beautiful moments, the opening sequence in the snow and the birds. I felt that obvious budget limitations must have dictated shot selections. Interestingly, some shot angles seemed lower than expected and others higher than expected.The quality of the editing had a rougher than expected feel to it. Many transitions felt harsh. That's probably what is intended.The Hans Zimmer score, seems more appropriate for a real crime drama, and therefore is part of the convention.Overall an extremely interesting film worth seeing for the acting alone, if not for the overall effect of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can the ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review comment. I HAD to try and keep people from seeing this movie. It stinks. It is slow. It is predictable. It is in dire need of a major rewrite. It has one of the lamest endings I have ever seen. Even Jack's fine acting couldn't save it.Granted, Sean Penn gives you some good visuals, but he leads you into the story like you were a dummy who had never seen a movie before. As soon as Jack "promises" he is going to find the killer, you know he is nuts! What cop is going to make that kind of promise? A crazy one for sure.So Penn drags us into his spiraling dementia. Oh, so boringly. He did not make ONE character interesting in any way. He just gave them a few cliche's to hang on to.Other reviews mentioned how dramatic and exciting the stakeout was at the end. Ha! I felt like one of those cops on the stakeout. Waiting for something to happen, and NOTHING did. They fell asleep and I nearly did too.Then, the utterly stupid attempt to provide irony at the end. Like now the movie is about irony or fate? Hello! This isn't "Magnolia"!It is hard enough to come up with good story lines these days. It irks me to see one destroyed.If you decide to see it. I hope you like it. Maybe your theatre will have more than 4 people in it at 8:00 on a Thursday night. That should tell you something.P.S. Note to Hollywood... I AM SICK OF STUPID FLASHBACKS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I liked this movie enough to give it a 7 for the wonderful acting by everyone involved and the cinematography, this is a pretty bad cop movie in terms of police procedure. No cop with Jerry's experience, even given the onset of mental illness, would have missed the connection between the most glaring clue and the locality of the perpetrator to the victim, not to mention other investigatory omissions obvious to armchair detectives.I do not think, however, that making a cop movie was the intention but a study of one man's descent into madness. In this regard, The Pledge works very well, however twenty minutes could have been easily trimmed to create a much more powerful statement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Want to Know Why This Movie Doesn't Work?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS PASSAGE CONTAINS LOTS OF SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE AND WANT TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A story about a killer who calls himself the Wizard and entices pretty 8 yr. old girls wearing red dresses to their deaths with his magic chocolate porcupine candies. A disturbing concept in itself.This movie was decent to me because its unsettling ending which was anti-climatic. The audience really never gets to experience the killer in action and Jack becomes the real loser. That was sort of cool because of what never happens-the killer really never gets caught.It would have worked better if the rest of the movie was not so slow. Penn tried to make it a psychological thriller but there was never a doubt who the killer was and whether he was for real or not.MY PROBLEMS with the movie are 1) the kid that was a primary witness at the beginning of the movie was never accounted for. They tried to talk to him in the squad car and he was silent. All indications led the viewer to believe that the kid placed the 911 telephone call to the police. So I ask, "WHY HAVE A PRIMARY WITNESS TO A CRIME IF YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE HIM UNACCOUNTED FOR?- JUST TAKE HIM OUT OF THE MOVIE." This leads to my problem # 2)The vehicle they picked Toby up in was described as a maroon pick up, the killer was driving a black pick-up- which the kid ID'd at the beginning but was never accounted. OK so what? Here is the real problem.After Toby gave the cops the confession they were looking for, they escorted him out of the room handcuffed. (The astute observer already knows he is not the killer so one would expect this character to die.) BANG! BANG! We hear gun shots. Cut. Now we see Toby holding a gun, free of handcuffs, and taking a cop hostage. OK Well how did that happen? I know its the movies but this isn't David Copperfield-sorry I am just not buying it. If this movie was any indication, Sean Penn should stick to acting. Jack was solid. But this film wasn't.5/10 Good Content, Visuals, and Acting. Too many unanswered questions, film lacked energy and passion at times- should have employed more editing and cut about 15-25 minutes off total running time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny, I love the movie and thought that Nicholson's performance and Penn's, Robin Wright that is, where incredible. The Pledge is a film that everyone should see for the story and content, but more so as commentary on what we as a society have become. As I left the theatre, I couldn't help but over hear several people complaining about the film, even tossing the idea around about asking to get a voucher or their money back. Albeit, the film is not a blockbuster or accessible to mainstream viewers, which in turn could be the only fauxpaux of director Penn's vision, but regardless the concept of a man so driven to fulfill a promise, to have conviction and belief in this day and age was moving for me. The film is slow and artful, masterfully shot, and brilliantly cast, especially Rourke's 5 minutes, but like I stated earlier the film's most important echos are that we as a society have evolved into people how really don't care much about or have conviction in anything. In turn, that being the main reason so many viewers will walk away from this film not understanding or appreciating exactly what they saw, for the simple reason that they don't posses the mental or emotional lexicon to understand what true conviction and belief are.A VIEWER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pledge is not quite what most viewers expect, based on comments overheard in the theater after the film was over. Almost everyone seemed to dislike it, but the reasons, when mentioned, were along the lines of 'boring', 'stupid ending', 'too long', etc.What I found was that this is not your ordinary 'loner police detective sorts through clues everyone else missed but manages to burst through the door to save the day just as the killer is about to claim another victim' movie. The film is more a study of a good man's slow descent into madness in the pursuit of a quest. As such, Jack N. gives a fine performance, and the director has surrounded him with cameos by other fine actors.I won't go into the way things develop, but I would like to see comments from other viewers regarding who the possible killer was. A couple friends thought it was obvious, but after I pointed out a few details, they were not so sure.Not a great film, and not a must-see, but a worthwhile effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I witnessed a trailer for this movie, I didn't think much of it, seeing what may be jut another "Bone Collector". What convinced me to go see it were the critics. Even though having read the reviews, I wasn't sure what exactly to expect, but I really liked by the end, although I feel I was the only one that felt that way in the theater. I suppose it really depends on what kind of movie you think you're going to see. If you're expecting a movie like "Se7en", then you'll hate it (although the ending is just as cruel towards the main character). Even though this movie is just around 2 hours, it feels like 3. It's slow and has no real action what so ever, but it makes up for that with its acting and character depth. I think this movie will be popular amongst the critics, but will be despised by the movie-going public, mostly for the ending. I guarantee that 70% of the people who read this review will be, if haven't already been, enraged by what they'll view as a weak ending, but it is truly wicked if you sit back and think about it. Think of everything Jack Nicholson's character gave to catch this man, everything he looses just to find a conclusion towards his obsession. He's left clueless of the murderer's identity and fate, to forever be searching for him in that lonely gas station upon a desolate road. While extremely subtle, it is as malignant as the notorious conclusion to "Se7en". If go to this movie, be sure to go with an open mind and a patient eye.</fullReview>

Especially if there's a new one popping up suddenly every few minutes to put in their obligatory 90 seconds on screen. Kind of like the producers are yelling at the audience "Hey, look! We've got lots of stars!"Second, the ending needs to be completely scrapped (and burned), rewritten and reshot. It doesn't work.Third, there are little montages speckled throughout the film thrown in almost as filler. And there's this scene with Helen Mirren, playing a psychologist, where she tries to psychoanalyze Nicholson. It was as though it was cut in from a different film. Maybe it was to foreshadow the end, but failed because nothing else contributed to the foreshadowing, and so, left it sticking out like a sore thumb. And the metaphor of the fishing...please. I can be hit over the head just so many times before I say enough.If you're going to see it, walk out just when you think Jack's about to catch the bad guy. Then imagine the right ending.

		<fullReview>All I needed to know before deciding to watch this movie is that S. Penn was directing this film. I've seen his work with Jack before in the Crossing Guard, which is also a extremely well written/directed/acted movie with real emotion and characters. That same comment can be used for "The Pledge". Great heart felt performances by all the actors. Excellent directing! Really approved of the helicopter shots over the landscape (playground) while the story of the angle was being narrated in the background.SPOILER (((DONT READ BELOW THIS LINE)))______________________________________The movie does end with mixed emotions, relief that justice is fullfilled, but you also leave with a melancholy fealing regarding Jacks character. He is left in limbo because he himself never relizes the magician has paid for his terrible deeds, and is left alone with his obsession.I only saw the movie once, but plan on seeing it at least one more time, but when the majician pays for his deeds, I thought I saw the the worlds "girls" at each end of the bumper of the semi. If I'm not mistaken, I love the symbolism of the girls killing him. If I'm misstaken, just disregard the above sentence.I also thought it was awesome how the movie started with the ending. You felt something aweful had to happen, so you go through the movie with this bad feeling that he is going to kill again and Jack is going to be semi-responsible for using a girl as bait. But low and behold, that doesn't happen, but Jack is left with his obsession.PS: Also liked the scene when jack was approching the parents in the chicken farm with all the shots of the gawking chickens. And I hope this is a sign of a good year for movies because the year 2000 was tremendously horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS CONTAINED I am dismayed, but not surprised to read how many viewers found this movie tedious, pretentious, and unsatisfying. It is none of these things. The characters, especially Nicholson's, are morally and psychologically complex. He is neither hero nor villain. He has made a promise, which he keeps, to find the girl's killer. That search culminates in his own destruction; the irony in the very sad ending is that he NEVER KNEW that the real killer was destroyed. The artfulness in Penn's direction comes from his many suggestions that Nicholson himself may in fact be the real killer. The suspense in the final stake-out scene is almost unbearable. If Nicholson is in fact a psycho-killer, HOW will this scene play out?There is no ambiguity in the ending. We know who the killer is, even though we never actually see this character. It's very clear who it is.This is a tough movie to watch because it insists that the world is evil and bestial. If you hated this, you'll certainly hate the movie which Penn used as a model for this one: last year's French film Humanite. It's even more uncompromising. If you hated The Pledge, you'll loathe Humanite. It's a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a sad disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all of the hype that lead to me seeing this movie, I was sadly disappointed. I am of the opinion that a movie should leave you with the satisfaction that the movie has ended. This can even be accomplished with an ending that leaves you hanging. This movie, however, left you with an empty feeling in your gut. A real feeling of unsatisfaction. I don't think that I have ever liked a movie that Sean Penn has starred in, with a possible exception of "Fast times at Ridgemont High." This movie has not given me much confidence in his directing abilities, either. I am astoundingly surprised that Jack Nicholson, with his acclaimed performances, would make a movie that could leave you so empty. I would liken this movie to a dream where you are dreaming about consuming a great big steak. When you wake up, you realize that your stomach is still empty. Don't waste your money or your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Wonderful Small Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era of "let's spend more on special effects and lavish sets", it is so delightful to see a smart, well made, elegant, and moving film like The Pledge. The acting (particularly JN, of course)is wonderful. The direction is skillful. The script and score are great. It is such a pleasure to see a movie like this at multiplex theaters. It is a challenging film on a difficult topic and it has painful moments. It has subtle complexities that could fail in the hands of less competent direction, but there is not a mistep in the film. It reminds me a lot of a more ambiguous "One False Move" sort of film. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have read the other comments made by other people. I probably would have seen how "challenging" this movie was. Give me a break, people! There was absolutely nothing challenging about this movie. They made an old, retiring, Police Detective insane. They threw in a killer, a girl, some birds and various fishing scenes. I am sorry guys, but I am not catching the artistic value here. This is old stuff. I could name you off a dozen movies that had the same story with a better plot. This movie was not challenging. The only challenge was sitting through the whole thing, only to be insulted with the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you miss the fishing symbolism, you've missed the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many of the critical comments about "The Pledge" on this web site deal with the film's slow-moving pace and drawn-out story line. But from the opening credits, director Sean Penn establishes that his retiring cop, Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is an expert fisherman.If you don't understand fishing, you obviously won't understand this film.Nicholson's detective obviously knows where to find his prey, and has the self discipline to wait patiently for his catch, knowing full well that he has the perfect bait for the job.My lone criticism of the film is the glossing over of any real "investigation" into the central murder. Why couldn't DNA testing rule out the most obvious suspect? Why doesn't Detective Black ever take his questions about the victim's drawing to her parents, to whom him made his pledge? These are minor flaws, but could have made for interesting plot sidelines.Overall, a disturbing film, but one that deals realistically with obsessions of many types.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After sitting through about a half hour of this film, I remembered that one amazing actor can't make a whole film work. (And I'm talking about Jach Nicholson--not Sean Penn). I felt as if it were a cheesey made for TV movie that had several of those cliche scenes and situations that were, I hate to use this word, predictable. I was bored throughout the entire film. I wasn't in suspense, I wasn't scared, I wasn't anything that Sean Penn probably strived for me to be. The only part that I felt had any meaning was the ending. The final scene was an ugly embarrassment for Jack. But it tied the whole film together and gave the film substance. It gave the audience a chance to realize the extreme that he went to to follow through with his pledge. His promise was all that he cared about throughout the film. Was he really insane like his former co-workers believed? By the end, I felt as if he finally fit in perfectly with all of the weirdos of that small town.I wish I would have gone to see Save the Last Dance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS CONTAINEDI am shocked at all the negative reviews this film has gotten on this website. This perfectly demonstrates that many people are no longer interested in watching challenging movies, they just want to see old movies rehashed again and again. THE PLEDGE is a fascinating, visually stunning film that contains one of Jack Nicholson's very best performances. He plays a cop who on his last day before retirement gets involved in a case involving a murdered child. He is the one who has to tell the parents about the crime, in a wonderful scene as Nicholson has to walk through thousands of turkeys to get to the parents. Nicholson pledges to find the killer. The other cops think they have their man, a retarded Indian who confessed, then killed himself. Nicholson doesn't think so. He does some investigating and finds two similar unsolved cases in the area, where the description of the victim was identical to the crime he's investigating. He sets up a surveillance of the area by buying a gas station where he's sure the killer will turn up. He meets a woman (Robin Wright Penn) who has a daughter who fits the description of the other victims. But, he would never use her as bait, would he? The ending has drawn a lot of complaints, but I think it ends the film on the perfect note. Nicholson's dark obsession with the killer, and his using a little girl for serial killer bait, means that Nicholson is not a hero. If he isn't a hero, why should he get a heroes ending? A lot of people say a lot of terrible things about Nicholson as the film closes, all of them true. But he wasn't wrong. This is a fascinating film about a man slowly imploding. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infuriatingly Lack of Detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the Most part I really loved this movie. It is different in that the "policy story" is a type of rouge tale as Detective Jerry Black ...aka ... Jack Nicholson goes off on his own. It has great acting by Jack Nicholson. It was even fun to pick out good parts by minor characters, like Benicio Del Toro.However, there are some infuriating lack of details in this movie.First, the movie uses all sorts of names from Minnesota towns. (Becker, Stillwater, Moorehead). BUT, it places them in Nevada. I can maybe see this because Minnesota's Spirit Mountain doesn't classify as a mountain chain (maybe they are even towns in Nevada). BUT, then why feature wildlife that has no business being in Nevada. (incidentally the movie was filmed in Canada).These are just minor scruples, but what really disdains me from the movie are its lack of details at key times.For Example--&gt; Detective Jerry Black makes sure that the finger prints are taken off of the little girls buttons, but later we hear that Benicio del Toro's character had lots of chocolate wrappers and that this (not finger prints) proves he did it. Later though (in the last minutes), no finger prints are taken, even when the cop seems to indicate (with his eyes that he thought of something). The movie somewhere along the line lost the story line of the other murders that took place (this in-itself is ok, but somewhere along the line, you expect them to be picked up again, and they never are).The movie could still be saved, but it seemed that at this point (2 hours in, Sean Penn just gave up). The last minutes or seconds of the movie ruined it for me, it totally changed what I thought was a good message film. And it is what changed my vote from a 9/8 (for a movie I really connected with and enjoyed) to a 2/3 (for a movie that made me leave the theatre wondering "What"..."huh"..."it does not even say where it was filmed"..."urgh".I guess I should have read the book and had different concepts of the movie going in, but oh well.</fullReview>

Simply Great.I think why some people are disappointed is because of how challenging the work is. The fact that you are never really sure who is the killer is very interesting and keeps you watching.Nicholson's character has some great nuances too. His whole motivation and plotting is simply fascinating.Don't overlook this movie and see something like "Save The Last Dance" instead. At least you leave this one thinking~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most memorable films this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to begin by saying that this is definitely Sean Penn's best directorial debut I have seen so far, and one of the best works of Jack Nicholson. This is a film about real life, about real events that happen, and it is filmed with the outmost though, realism, and the level of profundity possible. If you are reading this review and have not seen the film, please go see it, I do not want to summarise the story again.Jack's acting, and most of all his role, is very different from other works we have seen him in. I think that this movie is as different from his other films as Profession:reporter. His acting is totally brilliant in his portrayal about a retired detective. A lot of moviegoers have misunderstood the film, and did expect it to have a Hollywood type feel to it, and a Hollywood ending. This is not just a thriller, but also a life drama that deals with human lives in depth. This is a film, with an amazing ending, that will make you ponder about the different possibilities for the outcome of this film. I have no other words to use except, go see it, and think about it. This is a great work that is to be watched, understood and appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Penn delivers a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his 3rd &amp; best film to date, Sean Penn has reached a level of directing that most Hollywood directors will never achieve. The images &amp; storytelling in The Pledge are so amazing that by the end of the film, the viewer shares the same obsession that drives Jack Nicholson's character over the edge. Based on a Russian novel from the late 50's, it's easy to see how most American audiences could be unsatisfied with the unhappy ending, but this is what sets this film apart from every other standard thriller made in the past decade. This film never settles for the cliched twists &amp; characters that plague all Hollywood films of late. The haunting soundtrack mixed with the beautiful cinematography &amp; storybook editing makes the film easily one of the best crime thrillers to date. With wonderful performances from a too-good-to-be-true cast like Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Aaron Eckhart, Sam Shepard, Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton, Vanessa Redgrave &amp; the always amazing Robin Wright Penn. If you liked either of Penn's earlier directorial efforts, The Indian Runner or The Crossing Guard, you could not be disappointed with The Pledge. Not only has Sean Penn become one of the greatest actors of all time, he has now grown into a superb director. It's also nice to see Jack Nicholson in a role where he doesn't seem like he is playing himself. His performance in The Pledge is a reminder of how Jack got to be the superstar that he is. With the right script &amp; the perfect director, Mr. Nicholson can still keep us believing. It will be very interesting to see if any other films released this year can match the style, quality &amp; craftmanship of The Pledge. I really doubt it, seeing that crap like Antitrust &amp; Finding Forrester are clogging up the cinemas with the same old same old. Fancy a change? You must see The Pledge!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The three films Sean Penn has directed all display the questingspirit of an artist, a sensitive soul who has an appreciation for fineacting and fine image-making. They are also, all three,unsatisfying movies. In THE PLEDGE--a sort of U.S. remake ofL'HUMANITE, with the quixotic aspect of Kurosawa's IKIRU thrownin--Jack Nicholson plays, as he did in Penn's CROSSING GUARD,an aging guy haunted by the death of a child. A retiring cop,Nicholson swears to the mother of a murdered girl that he will findthe killer. Along the way, he runs into a battered single mom(Robin Wright Penn) whose beautiful child becomes the light ofNicholson's life--and the grain of hope that he may redeemhimself.But...redeem from what? is the question I found myself asking.Unlike the bureaucrat in IKIRU, or Harvey Keitel's Bad Lieutenant,Nicholson's character doesn't particularly seem in need ofabsolution. All we see is a polite, thoughtful and deeply moral guy.So what's all the breast-beating about? (One gets the feeling thatSean Penn lives for breast-beating.)Penn creates moments of soaring, rolling, rhythmic beauty. Hehas one of the world's greatest cinematographers in ChrisMendes, and many of the scenes of Nicholson's blossoming inrustic family life have a stirring, effulgent quality. But Penn seemsunable to get actors in a scene to make a basic point. He letsweirdos like Lois Smith and Benicio Del Toro roll on and on; itoften seems Penn makes movies for the acting process that goesinto them rather than for their end product. (I know, I know--that'swhat people said about John Cassavetes. Different guy.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an interesting movie because it chose to take a little more perspective on the lead character (Nicholson), rather than just pushing this off as a straight format cop-hunting-killer type movie. I think alot of appreciation towards the movie comes from understanding the fact that Sean Penn wanted the story to be about a man going through the adjustments of retirement and all the harrowing changes that come with it...set to the backdrop of the killer story, NOT revolving around the killer story. Some people may not like this because it steps out of the mold of the typical suspense film, but it makes sense. Alot of the movie is conveyed through unspoken imagery...the pained expressions, and little pieces of the directing that are put together to almost let you directly into Nicholson's mind. Does seem slow and meaningless in a few spots, but everything irons itself out to become a sharp, well acted and directed drama. I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great performance by Nicholson, but prepare to feel cheated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A retiring cop makes a promise to the parents of a murdered child to bring the killer to justice in this disturbing drama directed by Sean Penn. Jack Nicholson, as the cop, is tormented by the brutal crime, and becomes obsessed with honoring his "pledge". The setup and atmosphere of this drama is effective and haunting, but ultimately the story walks an uneven path to its unsatisfying conclusion.One of the first problems with the film is the very opening scene, which, it becomes obvious within minutes, is actually a scene from much later in the movie. That means the audience is given a hint as to the outcome of the story just after the movie houselights go down. And the hint is HUGE. Unlike the beginnings of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and THE GLADIATOR, which used the same foreshadowing method, the scene chosen to begin THE PLEDGE is as subtle as a smack on the head with a shovel.Already knowing which direction Jack Nicholson's character will be heading, the fascination for the audience is to see how he reaches that point. The range that Nicholson shows will not disappoint. From the horror he feels at the scene of the crime, to his compassion for the grieving parents, to the paranoia that makes it difficult for him to keep a grip on reality--Nicholson sells those emotions like few actors can. That being said, his journey toward instability seems to be a plot contrivance. Nothing in his history, as far as we are told, makes his downturn seem like a logical progression of his life. He's seen countless brutal crimes in his long career, presumably, and there's no mention or feeling given that he's carrying a lot of baggage from those experiences. The "pledge" itself seemed to flip a switch, but for me to buy that I needed more background on his character. We got his retirement party to start the movie and no flashbacks,no conversations about past events, no nothing to give us a sense of this guy's life up to then.Given this, I found the ending unnecessarily cruel. If you watch this movie as a character study, and as an another example of Jack Nicholson's considerable talent, you will be rewarded. If you make an emotional investment in this movie, prepare to feel cheated.</fullReview>

That it involves the brutal rape and murder of a young blond girl by a supposed serial killer would be interesting in itself but director Sean Penn is after more. Casting Jack Nicholson(as Jerry Black) allows Penn to give us a smart compilation of character flaws of Nicholson's previous films. Jerry Black comes across as a troubled man who enjoys trout fishing and his police work but precious little else. Indeed, Nicholson initially appears to be holding back a mysterious if not evil nature likened to his 'here's Johnny' role in "The Shining". In a revealing encounter with a psychiatrist (wonderfully acted by Helen Mirren) ostensibly to try to decipher a criminal profile from a child's drawing, Jerry Black instead has the tables turned when he exhibits traits of someone with post-traumatic stress. Penn then shows another Nicholson role, that of the authoritative figure who is really warm at heart, as in "The Border" and "The Last Detail". His bedtime reading of 'Thumbelina' to the little girl and his reticent advances toward her mother (in a dreary role by Robin Wright Penn) are uncharacteristic. But that is not the final take because Penn isn't interested in the run-of-the-mill hero. Instead, the final Nicholson we see is a tragic, singular minded figure of "A Few Good Men" and "Five Easy Pieces". Penn deliberately plays on our sympathies for Nicholson through use of periodic slow motion to detail the escalating torment of a man who cannot prove his suspicions. As well, we can feel for this ex-cop who never lets down his guard in protecting a little girl and her mother from a killer he has deliberately flushed out of hiding. Penn also has a gift for illustrating local figures from the sheriff pumping iron while his female officer is manicuring her toes, to the shop clerk trying to give directions, to the Harry Dean Stanton character who refuses to sell his store one minute and is out the next, to even Nicholson's love interest who can't afford to have her chipped front tooth fixed. Two scenes crystallize this all-consuming, Quixotic figure in "The Pledge". Even as his fellow officers tell him to 'get a life', Jerry rebukes them by saying he has made a promise, something that isn't kept much in this day and age. Secondly we see the macabre yet powerful glimpse of his kitchen where he has his fresh filleted trout next to the colored photograph of the bloodied corpse. In "The Pledge", Penn has neatly given us a summation of Jack Nicholson's many human qualities in a poignant film about how we can by misdirected by our best intentions</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick!Harry Dean Stanton; Dead or Alive?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack finally gets that toast he ordered about 25 years ago, served up by Robin Wright Penn who probably wasn't even born when he ordered it. Am I being a little too obtuse here, or cryptic I get them confused?Anyway, "The Pledge" is a terrific movie and I highly recommend it, even though it's definately not for everyone. Some may not be able to look past raped and brutally murdered 7 year old girls, graphic photos included. Trust me that is not what this movie is about. This is a movie about death, loneliness, mental illness and people, just like you and me.This is one of Jack's best. Jack creates his charachter, an old, soon to be retired, lonely, schizophrenic cop with an understated brilliance that very few actors can even dream of. The only thing he can't pull off is making the audience believe that Robin Wright Penn could possibly be interested in him romantically. We know that's comming going in though so it's easy to suspend reality on that one.The supporting cast is excellent. Hellen Miren, Vanessa Redgrave, the cop from "Traffic" as the mentally challenged Indian, Sam Sheppard, Mickey Rourke, and Harry Dean Stanton, are all worth the $8.50 admission to see them work their acting chops. I think the babe from the fishing resort is somebody but I couldn't place her.The direction of Sean Penn and the Cinematography of someone is brilliant and puts you right in the movie, and as they say in the commercial that's priceless.You may not enjoy "The Pledge" as much as I did but you will have lots to talk about afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite lukewarm reviews and unenthused audiences, don't be deceived, this is a powerful movie. Brilliantly shot and superbly acted, the story is difficult and awfully troubling, but worthwhile. The film does not unfold at a typical pace, like many standard films, and this might rub many people the wrong way, but Penn does it to delay pay-offs and make the story as rich as possible. Not for everyone, but most film fans will not be disappointed, especially not fans of Penn or Nicholson.</fullReview>

Nicholson's performance was also quite good, not over the top like some of the roles that have made him famous.However, the movie itself was extremely long and boring, and had no satisfactory payoff at the end. The previews make the movie look like a thriller. It isn't. Although I am sick of the traditional Hollywood ending (which this movie doesn't have), I have to say that I was totally unsatisfied.

		<fullReview>This is a meticulously crafted, powerful movie. Seemingly random camera shots portend important events. Seemingly insignificant acts by the protagonist suddenly add up and give the movie its center. And a horrifying center it is. As usual, Nicholson is brilliant, and the rest of the cast is great. But Sean Penn is the real star here. I know nothing about the art of filmmaking, but as the old saying goes, I know a work of art when I see it. It is a disturbing movie. And the ending will probably generate some controversy - to call it unpredictable is to understate. The audience I was with was upset by the ending, and I heard grumblings about getting their money back on the way out. Those of you who complain about Hollywood endings, this is the ending you've been asking for. And you know what they say about being careful about what you wish for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson is so un-Nicholson like in this riveting film (SPOILER)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn defies formula by taking a story with a familiar premise and making it original.This is Nicholson at his best.Jack Nicholson plays a cop(Jerry Black) who, on his retiring night, decides to take on a homicide. A 7 yr old girl is brutally raped and murdered. It is Black who makes the decision to tell the parents of their murdered daughter. He ends up making a promise to both God and the mother that he will find the little girls killer. It is this very pledge that leads to a blind obsession. In the end it will rob him of his dignity and his sanity. Unlike a more conventional film Jerry Black does not wind up the hero. The audience,however, gets to see he is. We get a look beyond what he can see.Jerry Black is more like a real life person then someone from the screen. He is flawed and his obsessions become costly. Nobody or himself gets to see the fruit of his efforts. If he(and others) only knew his pledge may have been fulfilled. Then again he may have been chasing nothing at all. Not like traditional thrillers,the little girls killer is up for interpretation.It may be the Indian with criminal past or it may be the preacher. Or it could be neither. Penn isn't trying to go for a whodunit here. He is above and beyond that. It is not drawn out for you. You have to do a little work.Along the way in this film we get to see some great cameos by the likes of Benicio Del Toro(is he in like every film out in the theaters)right now?!),Mickey Rourke,Tom Noonan and Sam Shepard just to name a few. Sean Penn is doing more then telling a story; he is painting a picture of characters and landscapes. I respect that. However even I found the film to be a little long in spots. I am perhaps trying to find some fault in an otherwise flawless film. This picture is Oscar worthy. Nicholson is so un-Nicholson in this role that this very well could be his best picture ever. A must see!</fullReview>

Some of the parts in the movie were totally pointless, it just seemed to me that Penn believes he is some sort of visionary presenting to us some amazing imagery. He's not, however, all he's doing is adding worthless footage to the movie. The movie itself is fine, however, it's way too long. Had it been half an hour shorter, it could have possibly been better.

		<shortDescription>Pledge to see this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As just having seen this great film after 14 years, I was surprised by just how much I enjoyed it. Jack Nicholson again shows us why he's one of the acting greats, in a perfect vehicle for him. The Pledge deals with a tragic shocking murder, horrific in the fact, it's of a little girl, where the movie doesn't pull away from the graphics. Nicholson plays a cop who works in Nevada, and it's his night of retirement, where his partners and party's interrupted by this shocking incident. There's many cut back and forth scenes of Nicholson's party, to the anticipated and shocking find, by a young chubby kid on a snow scooter, which I liked. An Indian suspect (a great Benecio De Toro) a slow sort who has a history of child molestation, is brought in, kind of pressured to confess by a colleague of Nicholson's, firmly played by Aaron Eckhart. Unfortunately De Toro ends his life, where Nicholson spends the rest of the movie trying to bait the real killer, as never really buying De Toro was ever the murdering hand. He sets up shop, buying a petrol station and store from a wearied Harry Dean Stanton, quite accepting to Nicholson's offer. His new business sits between the locales of other murder sites, involving kids, where he speaks to the mentally destroyed father of one, in a small but nice performance from Rourke. He falls in love with a rough looking Robin Wright Penn, an abused wife. Nicholson had made a pledge to the parents of that murdered girl, that he'll find the killer responsible, and we know that's what he intends to do, and hopefully we'll find him, so the anticipations are in the waiting. Nicholson even consults a behavioral psychiatrist (Helen Mirren) with a child art drawing, featuring a man that could be that monster. I liked that idea. Nicholson suspects this priest (Tom Noonan, who gave a great performance as the creepy killer in Manhunter) is his man. Or was it really De Toro, or was it someone else. So we have options, which is what makes this a good and realistic thriller. The Penn master has done is again. It's his best film, where they just get better. His perpetual zoom in frame shots are old hat though. Nonetheless, he's brought out a near perfect film, and a damn fine one with an ending that of course, will first disappoint, but after will leave minds, contemplating after, on the impossible certainties of suspects, in this perfect, and very well acted film, with a great and little haunting, yet harmless score.</fullReview>

No wonder Roger Ebert put it into his great movies list.Most thriller movies focus on minds and behaviors of the psychopath. This one has different angles. If you understand the psychology behind those psychopath, you will realize they are insane and their actions should not be elaborated into medias. Spotting those predators in the society is more intriguing.I like how the story is told. I think graphic scenes should only be applied when they are necessary to tell the story.

		<fullReview>Not an enjoyable movie, not at all 'enjoyable'. But what can you expect from something premised on the search for a serial murderer of children, miscarriage of justice and the miserable lack of closure for the grieving parents concerned? Life is not fair, crap happens, and when it does the powers-that-be are full of people who are less than brilliant seems to be the message. Jerry Black, a retiring officer played by Jack Nicholson, is however brilliant. When a little girl is found murdered on his patch, the timing is not ideal, happening on the very evening of his retirement party. He observes the 'closure' of this case, his last official duty, but is deeply unconvinced by the conclusions of his fellow officers. This is an astute man, a man of conscience, and when the victim's distraught mother holds him to the promise of all promises ? a 'pledge' to find the true killer - it bites into his very soul.Nicholson's performance is deeply moving yet understated, submitting his own ego to the gravity of the role, and the result is a convincing blend of subtlety and intensity. He is a man consumed by the oath he was sworn and unwavering in his belief that his police force got it wrong. This is also a study of a person outliving their usefulness, trying to have themselves taken seriously when pushed aside with age and divested of influence. Ex-sheriff Black, however, can still pull a few strings as well as possessing the resourcefulness to conduct his own unofficial investigation. As a detective story it is intriguing enough, as we follow the slenderest trail of evidence with him, and witness the creative yet increasingly questionable methods he is forced to use. Above it, though, it is an existential tragedy of great power. A cameo by Mickey Rourke as a grieving father is heart-breaking, a vivid etching of a life destroyed by loss. We can only hope that in this world we do have people of talent and integrity, such as Jerry Black perhaps, to put things right... but IS he 'right'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PLEDGEThis is another one of those movies that had slipped past me. I had not heard of this until recently when it was on TV. I only recorded it because it had the legend, Jack Nicholson, in it.The movie is about a cop, Jerry Black, who is about to retire. But on his last day he get's put on a case of the brutal rape and murder of a little 9 year old girl. But when a man gets arrested for it, admits it and the commits suicide it seems like an open and shut case. But Jerry believes the wrong man has been accused. After Jerry retires he is struggling to leave the case behind. He tries his best to get on with his life, but he is haunted.It is a moving story and very sad in places. I really feel sorry for Jerry. His character is so likable. He really cares for these girls and wants the killer to be found. The problem is, he is getting very suspicious of everyone. He doesn't trust anyone and is still investigating the killings.Jack Nicholson does an amazing job in this. His character was played perfectly. I really wanted him to retire happily, it was horrible to see him so haunted and unhappy. Patricia Clarkson plays Margaret. Margaret is a waitress in the local cafe that Jerry frequents. They get to know each other and have a bond. Patricia did a great job too. Other cast members were Benicio Del Toro, Aaron Eckhart, Helen Mirren, Tom Noonan, Robin Wright Penn, Venessa Redgrave &amp; Mickey Rourke. Phew... what a cast! The whole casting was brilliant. Everyone was very convincing and there were some great speeches. The script was really well done.The movie was directed by Sean Penn. I didn't realise that Sean had such a good skill in directing. The images he had for this film were immense.This film really keeps you gripped. It is not a fast paced movie, it goes along quite slowly in fact. But it is not boring. You really become interested in Jerry's life and you want to know if his suspicions were right and he moves on with his life. This film had me so gripped that at one certain point, I gasped and held my breathe. My heart was beating so fast. Not many films can make me do that. It really got me attached.I loved it... I will give this film 8 out of 10."I made a promise, Eric.

		<shortDescription>Film without a happy ending does not equal art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>64 year old, out of shape, hard-living, scraggly-haired Jack Nicholson needs to prove on screen he can still bed women 1/3 his age so you'll get a very un-sexy, un-romantic, grandpa/granddaughter-like make-out scene. Awkward in any film, it's especially so in a film involving a serial murder pedophile; the age gap between the pedo and his victims may be drastically smaller than Nicholson's and his love interest.I guess elderly movie critics who still want to cling to the idea that this sort of pairing is at all plausible give the whole thing a pass. To those of us who were born more recently, say, after the invention of the wheel, it's slimy and gross, and totally derails the film.Regardless, PLEDGE had some ingredients of a classic pot-boiler building to a big payoff but it never comes. No, viewers are not so stupid as to always need a happy, simple ending, but they need one which satisfies.The ending of this film says, "Well, anything can happen. In fact, someone might have dropped a piano on your head as you watched this film. Oh well." Roll credits. Possibly one of the worst twist endings ever.Throw in some ridiculous characters, like Benicio Del Toro in a z-grade cameo, or the artist who suddenly becomes an expert on serial killers.Pointless scenes? Oh yes. Marvel at Jack Nicholson's fifth trout fishing scene, or his masterful "pumping gas" performances.What's really thought-provoking is how such a turd of a script got a wide release, and produced to the tune of 45 million bucks (about 44 Million of which you will not see on the screen). The film only grossed 29 Million so at least the producers got the same sort of ending as the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pledge is a good movie which showcases Nicholson's acting talent He is the glue that holds this movie together. Sean Penn is a good director but his style leaves a lot to be desired his pacing is a little slow and he takes his time in unfolding a story that doesn't need that much time. However he does tell a compelling story that if you stay with it pays off. Granted however the payoff is nothing major and the ending is anti climatic leaving you with a bad taste in your mouth and questions that need to be answered. Aaron Eckhardt in one of his first roles plays a Smart ass type of detective who figures he is cool and in charge he figures he has all the answers. Nicholson's Jerry Black is a cop not afraid to admit that he does not have all the answers but he's not afraid to look for them and that is his downfall as he gets obessessed over his last case. The Movie is nothing major and you expect more from it but in the end it does just what any movie should do it keeps you entertained. I gave it eight stars just for Jack Nicholson's acting the man is a master at his craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-mystery to remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pledge is based on a book by Friedrich Durrenmatt, whose subtitle reads "a requiem for the detective story". That's because Durrenmatt used his short novel to criticize all the conventions of mystery fiction, the narrator being an ex cop who told a writer how something that happened to a colleague of his (here played by Jack Nicholson) never fit into the traditional whodunit structure. Sean Penn, the director of the film version, changed the setting from Switzerland to Nevada, doesn't retain the book's framing device (although the role could have been suited for Aaron Eckhart's character) and made a few changes to the shocking epilogue, which is more pessimistic on screen than it was on the written page. Nonetheless, Penn's third directorial effort could be described as "a requiem for the detective movie", its relentless sadness bringing it closer to the "flawed cop" stories seen on NYPD Blue or The Wire than Sherlock Homes.The Pledge is a film about obsession, about promises that can't be broken, despite the fact they can't be kept either. Such a promise was made by Detective Jerry Black (Nicholson) to a woman (Patricia Clarkson) whose little girl was found dead in the woods on the very day he was retiring. Although a man (Benicio Del Toro) fitting the profile of the killer was arrested almost immediately, Black is convinced the real murderer is still out there, and vows to find him at all costs. Using all the tools at his disposal and getting help from the most unlikely people, he soon comes to believe he's onto something, refusing to give up in his stubborn search for a monster he may never actually find.Moving the story from Europe to America hasn't really done Durrenmatt's work a disservice, Penn's assured direction having a confident sense of time and place but at the same time giving an impression of universality to the various locations: stark, gloomy and undeniably fit for a great human drama. Penn doesn't give in to gratuitous violence, preferring to inject every frame with a more subtle brutality, blood being replaced by straight-to-the point observations regarding man's darkest nuances. The Pledge isn't an easy film to watch in certain places, but the overall experience is ultimately one of the most rewarding American independent cinema has to offer.A great deal of that is of course due to Nicholson, a long-time friend of the director who goes in a completely opposite direction compared to what we're used to see when he's around: no quirks, no stares, no manic laughs; just a look of silent pain on a face that does nothing to hide the years of experience the actor masterfully employs to give a low-key, unpretentious performance, anticipating his Oscar-nominated turn in About Schmidt. The supporting cast (Eckhart, Del Toro, Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton and Robin Wright Penn among others) is top-notch too, but in the end The Pledge belongs to the achingly beautiful partnership between Penn and Nicholson. To call it a must-see is almost too little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly haunting character study featuring the most tame, internal and devastating performance of Jack Nicholson's career. It's a true study of a weary man on the verge of a breakdown and his slow slip into complete desolation which is finalized in the last few minutes of the film. We see him make a horrifying choice at the beginning of the third act, but still we root for him to succeed and catch the man he's after. When the worst coincidence (or was it an act of untimely karma?) comes into play, it sends everyone in Jerry Black's (Nicholson) life against him and turns him into the pathetic, mumbling, broken man that everyone claims him to be. A devastating film that was very painful to watch, namely due to it's realism and Nicholson's superb performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie About Obsession ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Refusing to let things go can make life tough - and here's a movie that proliferates on that. Jack Nicholson puts in an intense performance in this unusual story.The story is about a retiring cop who is unexpectedly maneuvered into making an extreme pledge to a distraught mother of a murdered girl. The pledge is to find the killer "upon your soul's salvation." This reaches deep into his person and keeps him lingering on, even after the case is closed.It is pretty interesting to watch Nicholson's character progress through the story. Both the character and the story are well conceived. Although this may sound like a typical obsessed cop movie, it is anything but that. It's hard to explain, but a lot happens in this movie and without spoiling it, suffice it to say that the movie is a bit of an unusual story.If you're looking for an intense drama with strong characters and a good, different type of story, this will fit the bill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those looking for action, gunfire and a cheerful, emotionally-satisfying conclusion had best look elsewhere. 'The Pledge (2001),' Sean Penn's third film as director, is a brutal and uncompromising character study of a retired detective's slow and steady spiral into madness, driven to the brink of sanity by his obsession with catching an invisible killer. Following the rape and murder of a young girl, Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) promises a distraught mother that he will bring her daughter's murderer to justice. A mentally-challenged American Indian (Benicio Del Toro), who was witnessed at the scene of the crime, is arrested, driven to a confession and subsequently commits suicide, leading to the closure of the case. However, Jerry comes to believe that the killer was somebody else ? a tall man who called himself The Wizard and lured young girls with chocolate hedgehogs. Believing that the murderer will strike again, Jerry makes a new life for himself alongside a lake and waits patiently for signs of The Wizard's return, in the meantime striking up a friendship with a single mother, Lori (Robin Wright Penn), and her eight-year-old daughter, Chrissy (Pauline Roberts).Though the identity of the killer proves not quite as important as Jerry's psychological deterioration, the story throws countless red herrings to put the viewer off guard. Tom Noonan, best-remembered as Francis Dollarhyde in Michael Mann's 'Manhunter (1986),' would seem the obvious choice for the killer, and we witness more than a few unlikely coincidences that would place his character well within suspicion. Rather than allowing the actual murderer to be brought to justice, the story takes a shocking turn when he is killed in a car accident, the truth behind his crimes completely unknown. In the final moments of the film, the characters are offered various lifelines that they fail to grasp: will Jerry abandon his pledge to protect the young girl to whom he has become a father? Will Detective Stan Krolak (Aaron Eckhart) recognise the black sedan blazing on the roadside? Will Jerry ever be acknowledged for the truth behind his unlikely hunch, or will his former colleagues continue to believe that he has lost his mind?'The Pledge' was adapted from Swiss author Friedrich Dürrenmatt's 1958 novel, "Das Versprechen," which was an altered version of his previous screenplay "Es geschah am hellichten Tag / It Happened in Broad Daylight," upon which a critically-acclaimed 1958 film was based. Jack Nicholson has a welcome return to form with his portrayal of a hardened but emotionally-vulnerable character, and the supporting players complement his performance well. Though his efforts have indirectly caused the death of the perpetrator, Jerry is completely oblivious to this. Having severed his close friendship with Lori after placing Chrissy's life in unnecessary danger, we find and leave him a drunken, muttering wreck of a man, forever condemned to live in the shadow of his broken promise. There are not many Hollywood directors daring enough to cut to the credits on such a downbeat note, but sometimes we've just got to realise that, in real life, a happy ending is not always a certainty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have also thought it's oliver (although his guilt isn't indicated more than the priest's is -the priest makes those animal figures, drives a black combi) yet there is sth about Jerry - not because for someone who wants to protect the girl he doesn't object her mom buying a red dress, doesn't object her wearing that dress, and that very day she is going to meet the murderer she actually wears that red dress BUT because of the way the boy who found the body looks at him;1- his facial expression when sees jack at the crime scene where the boy waits in the car 2- his expression when he sees him at the parade with the mother and the daughterat the end of the day it's filmed after the book so what the answer lies in the book (havent read it); Penn probably made it just more ambiguous and by the way i think we saw oliver at the gas station where jerry complimented him about his car to find out a thing or twocheers</fullReview>

Some people have to see a resolve otherwise their fairytale ideal of the world is destroyed.I believe it is a brave ending on Penns part, a film where justice is still dealt to the baddie. Yet Mr nicholson (the goodie) although on the right track and able to catch mr Baddie is unable to complete his task and reap the rewards for his efforts.It is indeed a tragedy in many ways for mr nicholson. Tho in the balance of things justice was kind of dealt out.good film though may leave many unsatisfied because it is not the normal everyday Hollywood ending.Once again excellent direction!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an great masterpiece. You can see in this picture growing paranoia of the personage. Please, imagine that the killer of this girl was actually (Del Toro) the person who shot him self in the beginning of the movie, or imagine that the killer did died the same day he killed the girl. In an car accident, suicide, age... (forget the car crash at the end, because they put in the film to somehow justify his sick behavior, or place this car accident at the day of killing) Was the paranoia of the Jerry Black really worth it? Was it even real to count on catching the killer? No, first of all it wasn't his case at all and the killer did not existed (not for him) and ex-cop lost his mind after he saw (Del Toro) killing him self. He shouldn't have taken the call at all, it wasn't a great move for his new beginning of happy ending of his last days. Jerry Black was an old, lonely, pathetic man. His Job is only social contact he ever had, and he was very afraid to lose his last "day therapy" and it wasn't easy for him to handover the new chances to a new generation. This picture shows that you must learn to leave behind, to start over again or try to get over the past. To use ability of choice to break this "magic circle" of everyday routine. For J. Black this "hide and seek" game wasn't really about the victim or the killer, he was straggling with him self. He was rushing full speed leaving his sanity behind, without even looking in the rear-view mirror. He could beautifully walk out of his office as an legendary detective with respect, an gas station and young female on his side, but no he choose to hunt ghosts. But please find out for your self and make your own judgment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quality character study and proves that Penn can direct</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in "Indian Runner", Sean Penn takes a average tale and makes it something more. Penn skillfully uses imagery and visual poetry. Nicholson's performance is excellent and is at it's best when he is subdued and patient.The plot unfolds at a deliberate pace. but that draws the intelligent viewer deeper into the movie. If a shot lingers, we wonder why. We scan the frame looking for clues not only to help us figure out "whodunit", but also for clues into the motivation of our protagonist. It is actually vague enough for me to question whether it isn't Nicholson himself behind the murders.We see another excellent performance from Robin Wright (Penn?) who is made up to look simply awful in this film. We watch the patient and obsessive retired cop use all sorts of bait to catch the fish he is after. I found myself trying to give advice to Nicholson's character. I empathized both with his dilemma and his loneliness. His police instincts are honed from years of obsessive but effective law enforcement. Quality acting all the way down to the bit parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the last movie I saw was "Mr and Mrs Smith", I could have put on a Meg Ryan movie and thought it was brilliant. Even though the "Mr and Mrs Smith" incident may have clouded my judgement, I think I can say with confidence that this is a solid movie.The movie follows a cop, Jerry (Nicholson), who oversees a brutal rape/murder case on his last day before retirement. Normally when a movie features a cop on the last day of retirement he gets killed by being in the wrong place at the right time, so it was a pleasant surprise that he didn't die. Jerry promises the parents of the deceased child that he will find the killer. Shortly after, he and his counterpart are called in to meet the likely suspect ( a surprising Benicio DelTorre). While his cop buddies think this is all wrapped up, he's not convinced. Jerry starts snooping around and finds what he believes are copycat incidents. So Jerry decides to move to the area where the other murders occurred so he can keep scoping it out, plus do some fishing on the side. Before to long he thinks he's found his man and prepares, like he does with the fish, to lure him in.The movie has a surprise ending which could have been about 1,000,000 times better if done properly like the other 98% of the movie. I liked where they were going with it, but Sean Penn went all schizo with what he wanted to achieve and just left us with a train wreck of an ending, which is a shame because for a slow paced movie it was pretty intriguing. A great cast too, with a bunch of great cameos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, Intense Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Pledge" is pretty much "Prime Suspect" with Jack Nicholson in the Helen Mirren role. Ironically, Mirren is also in this cast, reminding me of the classic scene that jump started Ralph Fiennes film career by being interviewed by Mirren as the shocked boyfriend of a victim who is her suspect. There is a stream of top-notch character actors interviewed in the process of a criminal investigation who responded to Sean Penn's siren call of "How would you like to do a scene with Jack Nicholson?" Robin Wright Penn had to be dirtied up a bit and the camera not linger on one of the most beautiful actresses in order to have her fit into the atmosphere. Nicholson really tones down his usual mannerisms and tics to thoroughly inhabit this old and obsessed cop.The story unfolds v-e-r-y slowly so that my mind did wander quite a bit in the first third so I think I missed some clues. But gradually it becomes clear that the whodunnit is far less important than the character study. This is the kind of intense mystery the Brits do so well, particularly for television. While Penn favors relentless close-ups, the camera does sweep back to encompass the varied Nevada scenery and very naturalistic environments, from a retirement party in a bar to a flea market to a patriotic small town parade. Nice closer of a David Baerwald song, but there's not a lot of music, though the Hans Zimmer score is effective without being as bombastic as he usually does.

		<shortDescription>Powerful Performances by Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, when a movie features a couple of big-name actors, their performances are the one that shine above everybody else's. Surprisingly, this is not the case with the "Pledge": Although Jack Nicholson is absolutely superb in his role as honest-yet-obsessed ex-cop Jerry Black, many members from the cast compete with him for the best performance on equal terms. We watch actors such as Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro, who although they cannot compare with Nicholson's status in the history of cinema, deliver short but extremely powerful performances. "The Pledge" is a film characterized by A-class acting by virtually everyone involved.Although it starts as a crime film, we soon realize that "The Pledge" is in fact a study in Jerry Black's character. The story goes as follows: Black is a police officer who at the day of his retirement is faced with a horrible murder of a young girl. As the girl's mother begs him to promise to find the culprit, he takes the matter personally and pledges to do so despite the fact that he does not belong to the force anymore. A suspect named Toby is arrested (Del Toro) who fits the murderer's profile perfectly; moreover, he also confesses the crime, albeit via very dubious circumstances. The suspect commits suicide, and the police consider the case closed. Jerry does not believe so, however; he is convinced that the real murderer is still out there, and starts a personal crusade to find him. Although guided by a good investigative instinct and a sound analytical thought, Jerry gradually starts to become too obsessed with his pledge, and this begins to have consequences on his life and interactions with his peers...Sean Penn does a fine job in directing Jerry's road to self-destruction. In fact, this movie convinced me that Penn has proved to be not only a great actor, but an artful director as well.I give the "The Pledge" 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly entertaining Thriller !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this DVD as it had so many great actors in it..Nicholson, Del Toro, Eckhart, Mirren, Redgrave, Shephard.. and it just goes on. Most of them in very small roles, so I thought.. the storyline must really be worth it. The acting overall is great in every way, except maybe for Patricia Clarkson, which after seeing her in Six Feet Under, of which I had expected to put more in her role. Sean Penn's directing is very effective too, mingling some surreal effects and increasing them as the movie rolls on. Also he doesn't take the viewer for idiots, providing a lot of elements through images. Mind you, this movie doesn't bore for ONE minute. I would have liked to see a bit more in-depth on the obsession of Jack Nicholson's character.. why is he so destined... It would make the ending a bit more understanding. Overall a very good and intelligently made thriller with excellent cast !</fullReview>

Very reliable performances from the leads, a thoughtful, well paced film that leaves you thinking after the credits roll. Its not a by the numbers; bad guy vs hero type of film, but the plot is perfectly coherent if you pay attention.I gave it a 9.

The various scene and emotion changes are really expressed by all of the characters. They end each theatrical phrase well. I am sure of where one thought ends and where a new one begins.

		<fullReview>Having seen this movie twice, I came to the comments to find out who the killer really was. I still don't know, so I'll watch it once more, and then buy the book by Durenmatt. The subtlety obviously works, since our commenters on IMDB disagree on who the murderer is, but are adamant about who they think he is.Mickey Rourke DId a fantastic job, grieving for his daughter. As I watched that ambitious detective getting up close to the Indian (Benito deTuro, great acting job), I thought of the Molly Bish and Sarah ? cases, here in Ma. ...two child murders still unsolved. I think how really wonderful it is that the police in those 2 towns (Wayland and a town near Worcester) didn't do what this guy did, and frame a mentally retarded person, or some other child molester. I know it must be a temptation to mark these cases closed and get someone in jail who the community would feel better about if they WERE in jail....but it's still not justice. Congratulations to police everywhere who DON'T take the easy way out and manufacture evidence or 'lose' evidence that would destroy their case against the wrong person.Jack played against 'Jack' this time, stupendously and you're left wondering at what drove him mad: the loneliness, the knowledge that he screwed up by using his love's daughter as bait, the drinking, the inability to convict the murderer??? And of course, you wonder, what if the guy in the black car is NOT the one who killed the 1st girl? Was it THAT which was the final straw that drove him over the cliff, mentally? I've seldom seen insanity portrayed in such a convincing way, as the actors usually do a caricature of madness.Like other commenters, I genuinely wish Hollywood would do a movie on a pederastic priest or other child molesting murderer.......what drives them to such perversity? Why can't it be cured? (Supposedly child molesters have the highest recividism rate of any criminal.) Actually, a movie that has as its protaganist the killer, himself. I was left with the impression that this killer was still free out there.Some memorable lines: "You don't want to see her now. Because it was something we found it impossibly hard to look at." Great compassion in dealing with the family in the turkey barn: long shot to up close. Can't think of anything more horrible to have to convey to a parent.Maybe if I see it ONCE more, I"ll find out who the killer was. If not, it's read the book itself. Great movie, Sean Penn and Jack, you're NOT doing a 'John Wayne' on us (who only ever played himself). Excellent acting...none of the cocksureness your biography mentions you've always had as a shield, due to being a kid born out of wedlock.. Usually, I wouldn't even care enough to see a movie again. Thank goodness, I bought "The Pledge".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can add this role to the list of Jack's best. Subtle yet powerful, driven but patient, Jack's performance lifts this film past the ordinary psychological thriller, which it otherwise could have been. The plot itself is fairly simple. But the pacing is slow and menacing, and the suspense builds quietly. Director Sean Penn has come into his own with the directing thing, and he seems more confident here than in "The Crossing Guard." Still, the film is not without flaws, as Jack's motivation for his pledge was never clear enough to me. I understood that his pledge was necessary to advance the plot, but I just didn't quite understand the reason for it, and that is a big problem for a film. Tom Noonan is, of course, brilliant as the slimy monster, but he always is (he has played this character in "Manhunter," "Last Action Hero," and one or two episodes of the "X-Files"). The scenery is spectacular, the pacing hypnotic, the acting wonderful, and the ending satisfying. Not perfect, but well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many films that are so lousy they are difficult to watch. Rarely, though, do we get what's on offer here: a film so absorbing and well-crafted that it's almost unbearable. The cast, of course, is remarkable - Jack Nicholson at his best, Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave, Robin Wright-Penn with a broken tooth, Harry Dean Stanton, Sam Shepherd and another brilliant turn by Benicio del Toro - but that's just the beginning. The editing is wonderful. The cinematography is solid if not incredible, with a few really nicely framed shots, and benefits from a great location. The music. But above all, this is a movie driven by character and ideas.(No spoilers from me just yet, but even so, I'd urge you to stop reading if you haven't seen the film. Just see it and read about it afterwards. It's... better that way. I promise.)So what do we have here? The plot sounds simple. In the movie's only weak scene, a woman whose daughter has just been murdered compels retiring police officer Jerry Black to make the pledge of the title, a promise "on his soul's salvation" that he will find the child's killer. The rest of the force soon believes they've gotten their man, but Jerry doesn't. He has his reasons, but in a film like this it's natural for those of us watching to doubt them - for a while, we don't really know whether he's crazy or right. Or, for that matter, both.In fact, a key to the film's success is the fact that we don't fully trust Jerry's judgment - at every moment, we're questioning his motives and his observations, trying to measure just how much his obsession colours what he sees. Indeed, the relationships he forms as the movie progresses are also ambiguous; he's helping people, but it's no coincidence that they suit his purposes so well.This *is* a character study - Jerry's psychological descent, superbly (and understatedly) presented by Nicholson, stands out in stark relief against the bleak setting we find him in. On reflection, though, I think this is mainly because the screenplay and acting (and presumably direction) so painstakingly stick close to real humanity. For this is also a film of ideas. There are some easy ones - the parallels between Jerry's obsession and the murderer's, the question of guilt and responsibility as Jerry takes grave risks to get his man. How far does the web of pain spun by a crime extend? Is Jerry another victim? Does Jerry's pledge literally damn him, cost him his soul?But there are also some bigger ideas at work, and for me perhaps the most compelling of these revolves around the notion of truth. For almost every minute of the film, we only know what Jerry knows, yet we don't quite share his conviction. Ultimately, we find out a few things without him - enough to convince us he's right, and enough, in a way, to leave his own certainty shattered. (As an aside, I feel I have to mention just how deftly Penn feeds us our superior knowledge. We find out just enough, when almost any other director would have given us too much.)There's no cosmic audience out there to take in a cinematic view of our own lives, nobody to be dismayed at how right or wrong we manage to be with our scarce and provisional information. If there were, we might find that many a sad old drunk was right all along, and many a clean-cut deputy sheriff was leaping to conclusions.A wonderful, though distressing, film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I say MUST-SEE, I mean it. I heard this was good; in fact, it completely blew me away. And here's why:- Jack Nicholson's best performance ever (and one that will surely be appreciated, even by those who do not appreciate Jack's style). He is subtle but evocative, intense but not obnoxious. His eyes and lips speak volumes. The moustache was a great touch.- Mickey Rourke's best performance ever, easily surpassing the somewhat overrated Angel Heart, he uses 2 minutes of screen time to give us an unforgettable character who we feel we know much more about than is actually said.- Other actors utilised beautifully and all giving their best: Robin Wright Penn, Benicio Del Toro (in another very short appearance, much better than his award-winning Traffic cop), Aaron Eckhart, Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave...- Sean Penn's truly exceptional directing. Putting us squarely in Jerry Black's troubled, haunted, obsessed mind-frame, we are often not sure where reality lies. The session with Helen Mirren's doctor and the whole final reel are exceptionally well done.- A story that (cliche but accurate) breaks all the rules...deep, thoughtful, compelling, morally dubious and uncompromising. It treads distressingly close to real life, to the real pattern of our world, unlike any other film of this type.- An inspired soundtrack, great cinematography, excellent editing, and locations that seem to conspire in creating the haunting atmosphere, complete the picture.See it and challenge yourself to forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing. (MAJOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which movie wins an award for one of the suckiest endings ever? This one does! The latest film directed by Sean Penn is THE PLEDGE. One of the most diappointing movies I have ever seen. Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) has made a promise to the mother of a murdered little girl that he will find the girl's killer. The only problem is that he's having a little trouble tracking the guy down. The supporting cast includes Aaron Eckhart, Helen Mirren, Benicio Del Toro, Harry Dean Stanton, Patricia Clarkson, Robin Wright Penn, Vanessa Redgrave, Sam Shepard, Tom Noonan, Lois Smith, and the great Mickey Rourke. Honestly, I cannot even remember half of those names being in the film. Partially due to the fact that many of them hardly have roles in the film. Helen Mirren is only in one scene!Time for me to complain about the ending, READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE TERRIBLE MOVIE!Okay, the ending is probably the suckiest ending I have ever viewed. The box makes the film read like a good old-fashioned suspense thriller where the detective trying to find the killer will eventually find him and then eventually kill him after discovering that it was someone who we never suspected. But, no! We never even figure out the identity of the killer...instead, the film ends with Jack Nicholson sitting in a chair, shaking nervously and mumbling. What is up with that? Did the writers just get tired of writing the script? And what is wrong with Sean Penn? A good director/actor like him should have been able to spot an ending that would suck oh so very badly. This film is possibly one of the worst thrillers that sits on my video shelf. THE PLEDGE: 2/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>strangely compelling thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Child endangerment has always struck me as rather questionable source material for adult thrillers ? particularly when that threat takes the form of child rape and murder. `The Pledge' wallows in the muck of the subject matter a bit much for my taste, but the film does boast some interesting twists on this otherwise dubious theme. For the first of its two hours, `The Pledge' treads along some pretty familiar ground. Jack Nicholson plays Jerry Black, a veteran Nevada police detective who, on the very day of his retirement party, ends up at the scene of the brutal slaying of a 7-year old girl. Jerry finds himself pledging to her distraught mother that he will leave no stone unturned in bringing her child's killer to justice. Almost immediately, a suspect is arrested and forced to confess, but he kills himself while being taken to his cell, thus closing the case for all concerned ? except, of course, Jerry who, for reasons unfathomable to him or us ? other than that this is the way these plots always turn out ? feels that something is not quite kosher with the outcome. Thus, throughout the first half, the film goes through the motions common to this narrative setup: over-the-hill veteran follows a hunch that all the less seasoned pros dismiss as the rantings of a guy unable to give up the glory of the chase and settle into the quiet life of leisurely retirement. Jerry is, thus, on his own to prove them wrong and to bring the true culprit to justice.But just as we are all settled in, ready to follow the movie along its preprogrammed course, damned if director Sean Penn and writer Jerry Kromolowsky don't pull the rug out from under us, sending the film off into new and unconventional territory. For slowly but surely we begin to see subtle hints that all may not be quite right with Jerry's psyche. Could it be true ? as a number of people along his way suggest ? that perhaps he really can't cope with the mundane world of domesticity and that he needs to `create' a case to make himself feel as if he is still a part of the action? Or is he, perhaps, so traumatized by the brutality of the crime whose aftermath he's witnessed and so obsessed with fulfilling his `pledge' to the girl's mother that he can't see facts as they really are and feels compelled to devise scenarios that will allow him to play the hero, thereby validating his own relevance? Or is it possible that he can be both mentally unbalanced and right about his hunches at the same time? Friedrich Durrenmatt's novel provides a solid core upon which the filmmakers can build their case. Even some of the predictable red herrings achieve more than their usual credibility when filtered through the mind of this potentially disturbed man. And the downbeat ending demonstrates a bravery rarely seen in Hollywood these days. Nicholson does a superb job playing out the many aspects of Jerry's mind and personality and Robin Wright Penn provides strong support as the waitress he comes to love through the course of the film. I wish the filmmakers hadn't felt compelled to enlist an assortment of big name actors to provide cameo appearances throughout the movie. In this backwater area, it becomes disconcerting to see people like Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Sam Shephard, and Harry Dean Stanton pop up for their five-minute appearance, then disappear into the background never to be seen again. This game of spot-the-stars becomes not only distracting but undercuts the air of authenticity the film is trying so hard to achieve with its location shooting and somber pacing.As a director, Penn shows definite assurance, allowing the story to unfold at its own deliberate pace, never feeling compelled to interject irrelevant action sequences for their own sweet sake. He also does a fine job exploiting the small town, rural atmosphere in which the film is set. `The Pledge' starts out like a conventional thriller, but it ends up, much to the satisfaction of its audience, as something strangely unique and compelling. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of 2001 and Mad Jack doesn't overact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful film to look at, with engrossing performances to match. A little Jack Nicholson can go a long way in some of his movies and if he can get an Oscar for 'As Good As It Gets' then with this one sainthood could be coming his way. He is on screen nearly the whole time, either listening to his voices, or going through the motions of dialogue until his own human interaction is finally engaged by his involvement in Robin Wright Penn's family. The cinematography is stunning, particularly the outdoor shots of the ice fishing and the spectacular mountain scenery. These contrast starkly with the first shots of the worn out Mrs Penn in the diner, with her scars and broken teeth. Despite Jack's character having retreated from two failed marriages into his police work it is not entirely clear why he loses his perspective so tragically since it is evident he has found fulfillment in his instant family. The casting of Tom Noonan is more red herring than Red Dragon, while the high profile cameos vary from a Twin Peaks type role for Benicio Del Toro to a very touching and grandmotherly one from Vanessa Redgrave. This film is what good, if not brilliant, film making is all about and Sean Penn shows mastery of the craft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a film of which it is of little surprise that it did not do very well in the USA. putting aside all comments on american film tastes and any snobbish comments this is a film that is not what most people would expect with the subject material.it is less a study of a crime than a look at the nature of evil itself. it offers little help or redeeming endings that people seem to look for (and almost need) but instead offers a look at a man who is at odds with a crime and then slowly moves on to being at odds with himself. a great performance by jack nicholson (although not up there with his Chinatown) who offers a morally ambiguous performance of a man whos motivation could be for many different reasons.having watched this film it made me think of two different quotations, one is "the banality of evil" and the other comes from the very talented director himself Mr. Sean Penn "No good deed deserves to go unpunished". A strong film which is at times quite unsettling, but at least a film that asks you to think about what you are being shown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your average murder mystery, with Jack Nicholson again stretching beyond his crazy-killer persona. The story is familiar, but the treatment is not, with excellent cinematography, editing, and music by Hans Zimmer. The look and feel of this movie is very real, yet surreal, as if Sean Penn was taking mental notes while acting in "The Thin Red Line" by Terrence Malick. There are some things that just don't fit together in this movie: they are mostly story or plot-related, and might bother some viewers looking for realism and logic. However, the pleasure (and pain) in watching this film derives from the overall "feel" of the work, and if you enjoy films about people making tough choices that turn out to be wrong, you'll love this one. But man, what a downer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Penn puts on a director's hat to make a movie about a retired cop who has made a pledge to find the killer of a little girl. Jack Nicholson stars and brings convincing heavyweight acting abilities to the lead role whilst various other stars decorate the story in small, cameo roles, like confetti. Benicio Del Toro, Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave, Sam Shephard, Harry Dean Stanton and Mickey Rourke all turn in great performances. The pace, style and story, for the most part, all shun commercialism in their approach, yet the end product teeters on being too classy for its own good. After sitting through more than two hours of slowly unfolding story, many audiences will want a bit more of an adrenalin kickback on their investment.</fullReview>

This is not to saythat it's not well done- it's very well crafted (if a bit indulgent) andfilled with fantastic acting from the Love Boat of ensemble casts.Nicholson gives one of his finest performances here, as does RobinWright. Redgrave and Rourke suprise as always, but I was a littledisappointed with Aaron Eckhart and Costas Mandylor, I felt they weremiscast (or cast because of their looks in a movie that clearly doesn'tCARE about looks). The story itself is Camus-esque, which I like up to acertain point- but I felt the ending unresolved and kind of a let down.This may be why the French love it so much, but I'd rather leave thetheater feeling like I've learned something more than "life is brutaland random and sometimes nothing good comes of it".

		<shortDescription>This film seems misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(May contain thematic spoilers, but no plot points)Having read the reviews of this exceptional film, I have become a bit disturbed by the shallow and unimaginative expectations of the other IMDB reviewers.So often we are asked by the American film industry to pony up to $10 to watch the same old crime/police drama plots spun in a slightly different but eventually unoriginal way. Don't we want originality in the films we see, or are we happy to see the same old package in slightly different wrapping? I think the answer is yes: we want new and original films to view.The problem is that the American viewing public is addicted to action and the kind of simple-minded ideas of "justice" that spew from garbage television like "America's Most Wanted." When we walk into a theater and witness a crime in the first ten minutes, our good ol' American blood-lust view of revenge demands to be quenched by familiar plot points of car chases, gun fights and bad guys behind bars. And when an original picture fails to deliver that formula, we balk at it as being "too slow" or having a "bad ending." All our lip-service to "originality" goes out the window.This failure of evaluating art is the theme of the reviews I read here. This movie is not a action picture. It is not even a crime drama, although it uses a similar type of story to achieve its goal. This is a character study: a view of a good and decent police detective and his subtle and sorrowful descension into madness over the death of child, the final case of his career. The reviewers who pan this film do it not based on what they saw, but what they did not see but wanted to.Like any great character study, ala "The Remains of the Day," "Hurlyburly" and "American Beauty," this movie seems to move slowly to the impatient, action-oriented viewer. Also, like any great character study, it depends on the skill of its actors to convey the film's artistic message. Character study films are like great novels: they are art. Unfortunately the great American movie-going public doesn't want real art. They go to movies like they go to a roller-coaster: for a thrill. Only in America is a roller-coaster confused with art!The reasons this movie is great, interalia, is because it comes close to being a thriller, but it isn't one, and to confuse it with a thriller makes it seem flat. Review it not as the thriller it mirrors, but as the character study it is. In that light it is truly mesmerizing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PLEDGE did not last long in the theater. And with good reason. Jack Nicholson may have a starring role, but the film itself is the kind the general public just does not have the patience for. There is no fun, no sense of being drawn into THE PLEDGE. Its brooding selfish nature completely blows itself up. And NOBODY in their right mind would pay movie theater prices for a film such as this. Jerry Black 's brooding and obsession was intended for his frustration in finding the killer, but in the end, we probably all finished watching this film acting like him.A seven year old girl is raped and murdered. The victim's mother than makes retired detective Jerry Black promise to find the killer. Jerry puts his retirement trip to Mexico on hold in hopes of finding and catching the killer.What starts out as a ho hum criminal investigation transforms into a major borefest as we start to get to know more about Jerry. Anyone with a sharp ear can detect where Jerry went wrong in the investigation, but the whole movie later revolves around the poor loser 's inability to get on with his life. There is no climax. There is no suspense when the killer is moving in for another kill. THE PLEDGE is a big nothing. There is no more point wasting your time trying to learn from a movie that is confusing and dull from beginning to end. You have all been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is NOT your average movie. Never mind the plot line or the summary. Never mind what you expect from a cop or detective movie. Put aside what you expect from a hero-protagonist. Put aside your preconceived notions of Sean Penn's noirish directorial style. Check all your expectations at the door. One thing you should know up front, this ain't Hollywood, kids! No neat little plot development with emotional spikes in the right places and ribbons and bows for the short-of-attention or the needy-of-emotion. Instead, you get a real gritty drama with a fresh perspective and a different kind of suspense and tension. Think a little more Hitchcock, and a lot less Kojak. Throw in dashes of Poe, Truffaut and the Twilight Zone for good measure. Throw in bright light, color, and great scenery, and this ain't your average noir mystery, neither.Don't miss the opening credits and you might get a chance to get your expectations in order. There is nothing wrong with this movie. Do not attempt to adjust your drink holder...As for the performances, wow! A host of luminaries fill out the bit parts, making a small movie huge. Robin Wright-Penn is excellent. But, Jack Nicholson is terrific. I mean, he's always terrific, but here he even outdoes himself in a showcase part custom-made for him. You want a little light entertainment? This is the wrong movie. You want to see a master at work? Step right up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is only one good thing about this movie and that is the acting. Other than that (and it's not enough) this is one of the worst movies ever. It started out interesting but after about 20 minutes it just got plain boring. Naturally they show the best scenes in the trailers. We went in with great expectations and came out SOOOOOO disappointed! What a let down. The worst part was the end. It was so bad that it made the good acting and the interesting first 20 minutes or so and ruined it completely. If they had just made the ending work better instead of leaving Jack's character a basic vegetable then it would have been worth it but the screwed it up royally. We weren't the only ones who felt this way. As we were sitting through the credits waiting for the bulk of the crowd to thin, we heard person after person as they walked by to leave talking about how horrible the movie was and how crapy the end was. Based on the numbers on this site apparent lots of people liked this movie. I'll never know why but hey, to each his/her own. Personally I haven't felt so much like I just wasted a whole evening in a long time. I was actually mad at myself for not going to see something...anything else. Oh well. I guess that after seeing excellent film after excellent film there was bound to be a piece of crap that would show up eventually. If you want to see a thriller, go see Antitrust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is retiring from the police force. A little girl's body is found, and he's asked to go in for one more case. When the girl's mother (Patricia Clarkson) asks him to find the killer, she forces him to take a pledge. When brash cop Stan Krolak (Aaron Eckhart) gets a mentally weak Indian (Benicio Del Toro) to confess, Jerry isn't so sure and continues to investigate despite nobody believes him.It's obvious that director Sean Penn called in a lot of people. This is filled wall to wall with top ranked acting talents. Every character is played by great actors no matter how small the roles.This movie takes its time. Maybe it takes too much time. It sets an interesting tone. It's moody. But the pace suffers. Sean Penn has an actor's instinct rather than a storyteller. He gets great performances from great actors. But the story meanders. It's more of a character study as the Jerry character oscillates from a superior police mind to a paranoid father figure. The character study culminates in an unusual ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard of "The Pledge" until searching for a freebie to watch on Netflix. I love Jack Nicholson and saw this film as an undiscovered gem. The story pulled me in and kept me riveted through several scenes, but in most of them, Penn spent so much time on atmosphere, camera angles, and the scenery, that I found myself getting a little annoyed, and this killed the build up that he was obviously aiming for, but failed to deliver. I believe the film would have been better paced and less frustrating to watch at times if Penn cut 30 minutes from it. This wouldn't have made this movie any less powerful because the writer's hold their cards very close to their chest, pulling each one out very discretely, and only when they have you begging for more information. This created a good measure of suspense for me, but as I mentioned, the excessive time trailing after each punch - instead off winding up for the next one, deflated what should have been much better film. The ending is tragic, but this made the film stand out from so many action- heavy losers it competed against in 2001. It's an honest and real movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Full-Bodied Story, Top-Drawer Filmmaking, a Deeply Moving Impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn's somber, wintry meditation starts as a cop story and coils into subjective obsession and personal mission. It gives Jack Nicholson one of his paramount roles, as a retiring detective who makes a vow and struggles to honor it. It sees the longing for justice running wild and growing treacherous. The story has the rudiments of a crime thriller---cops, suspects, fatalities, evidence---but ultimately it's a character study, and in Detective Jerry Black, Nicholson crafts a character we can't turn away from en route to the dusk of his compulsion.Jerry is retiring in Reno. He's from a bygone age band glancing around for ashtrays in the offices of non-smokers. News arrives that the disfigured corpse of a girl has been discovered. Dedicated Jerry wants to work out his last day, and ultimately finds himself bearing the heartbreaking information to the parents. This scene, set by Penn on the couple's turkey farm, is astonishing in its backdrop and its effect. Nicholson weaving through thousands of turkey chicks, finally holding a crucifix made by the slain Ginny, he promises "by his soul's salvation" that he'll catch the murderer. This is the eponymous pledge, and in due course it consumes him.It seems initially that the murderer has been caught. Benicio Del Toro plays a Native American, clearly retarded, who was witnessed fleeing from the scene. Evidence appears to connect his pickup truck with the atrocity. Show-off detective Aaron Eckhardt extracts a confession, with Jerry fidgeting behind the glass and saying the Native American "doesn't understand the question." Then the Native American takes matters into his own hands, quite literally, cementing his guilt in the minds of the police. Except for Jerry. He's been doing this too long.In retirement, he persists in probing the case, in time discovering that the departed Ginny had befriended a "giant" she called "The Wizard." Who was he? Was he the culprit? Was he connected to other unresolved slayings of little children? Now Penn, carving from Friedrich Durrenmatt's novel and the adaptation Jerzy and Mary Kromolowski, seamlessly start the film's gradual plunge into Jerry's obsession. He oddly buys a gas station convenience store flanked by two townships where he believes the Wizard might've killed similarly. Analyzing doodles by Ginny, he believes he knows what vehicle the killer might've driven: The store is an unassuming snare.An unanticipated thing occurs. He meets mother Robin Wright Penn and her young daughter, and they share an intuitive compassion that buds into something more. After a couple of divorces, Jerry finally experiences what a content family life can be. We instantly grasp that the daughter is would-be prey, if the killer is in fact still on the loose. We believe Jerry realizes this, too. Though certainly he wouldn't draw on this lovely little girl as a lure? The core predicament of Jerry's pursuit is that he's the sole person who has confidence in it. His ex-contemporaries assume he's gone over the edge. Even chief Sam Shepard, an old comrade, looks despondently at Jerry's deranged fanaticism. His gas station ruse may be a gamble, or the work of a seasoned top-drawer cop, or just confirmation that he's losing sight of reality. The final act of the movie is where most police stories go on self-steer, with compulsory chases and mass fights. That's when The Pledge becomes most forcefully gripping. Penn and Nicholson take chances with the material and exalt the movie to another, surprising, poignantly lingering altitude.What is unmistakable about Penn as a director is that he finds no appeal in making conventional films. He is enthralled by characters under great tension. He's jaded by run-of-the-mill genre exercises. The character of Jerry here is not just a good cop, but a retired man, palpably of a particular generation, a man overcome by a cast-iron notion. He's capable on one hand of conveying charisma and permanence, one incentive for the younger woman being that he bids tranquility after her aggressive marriage. But we intuit murkier, more grave undercurrents, and concerns he isn't entirely alert to himself. By the end, the tension pivots by and large on Jerry himself, and the resolution of the crime is a profoundly haunting axis for the unforgettable images of him that bookend the film. It's here that Nicholson's talent is most crucial, and most valued: He has to illustrate for us a guy who has embarked on a shocking and lonesome mission into the mystifying spaces of his psyche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand why so many people dislike "The Pledge", the ending was (SPOILER ALERT) a ripoff, and the "all-star cast" feel just isn't. But personally, I liked it. Jack Nicholson is in it, how bad can it be? Nicholson plays a retiring detective who gets stuck on the case of the mysterious murder of a young girl. While we initially believe it's Benny Del Toro, it probably wasn't, and Jack goes crazy trying to find the killer.The reason I bought this was because it had so many juicy names on the cover (Aaron Eckhart, Helen Mirren, Sam Shepard, all beside Jack Nicholson? Too good to be true...) But Sean Penn ripped us off, as each of these actors' performances are about three or four minutes each. (The only exception is Robin Wright Penn.) The ending is a complete ripoff, and was a major disappointment to the story. The story itself, which was beautifully worked up, was enthralling, and kept me guessing on who the killer might be. But no, (SPOILER ALERT) we never find out.I'm doing a lot of complaining for my eight star review, so here's what I liked; Acting was grade A. Those three minute performances are well placed. We have Nicholson in one of his best performances, but I thought Tom Noonan did a great job as Gary Jackson, the preacher.All in all, decent movie. But maybe just stop watching right when you see the car driving towards Jerry and Chrissie, and make up the ending you thought of during the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had forgotten how astounding this was. This is my second viewing, first chance I got to watch it again after the first, a few years ago, and I re-discovered it. I must say, this is difficult to take one's eyes off. The plot is very interesting, and keeps you watching throughout. The pacing is deliberate, it's seldom fast but it's not meant to be, and it's about spot-on throughout. Acting is just about perfect, for every part. Nicholson mostly drops the mannerisms that we all know, and Del Toro is barely even recognizable. There is a lot of heavy acting talent featured in this. The direction is masterful... I've made a mental note to seek out some more of Penn's directorial efforts, and I can't help but wonder why he doesn't do more. This is to an extent a psychological thriller, and so much is more hinted at than shown. The writing is remarkable, very realistic and intriguing. The camera-work is magnificent. The editing is top-notch, and very, very effective. Both should impress just for the planning that went into those aspects. The ending is powerful. The film as a whole is incredible. I recommend this to any fan of skillful movie-making, mysteries and/or thrillers. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle, slow-moving, and emotionally powerful, a real rarity for Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Pledge" is one of the most refreshing film experiences of the new millennium. In an age dominated by MTV-style blockbusters and megaplex chains only interested in profit, "The Pledge" is a film that dares to be intelligent, downbeat, and subtle. Sean Penn's previous two films were interesting and powerful if deeply flawed, but the third times a charm. In addition to his first class direction and a superb screenplay by Jerzy and Mary Olsen Kromolowski is Jack Nicholson's performance. This is easily Nicholson's best work since the 70s. Since "The Shining" (which I love), hes been type cast and relies more on charisma than actual acting chops. In "The Pledge" he gives a subtle and nuance performance, something unexpected from him recently. He hasn't been this powerful since "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" or possibly "Five Easy Pieces".The rest of the cast is quite good also. Aaron Eckhart is extremely slimy as a corrupt police officer, Robin Wright Penn is sympathetic as the single mother whom Nicholson accompanies, and Mickey Rourke deserves special mention for his brief but powerful role. Rourke is on the comeback trail with "Sin City", and thats a good thing because he is one of the best actors of his generation. The film's downbeat conclusion may seem disappointing for those expecting a more action packed finale, but upon reflection seems absolutely perfect. Its a shame (if not surprising) that this film flopped at the box office (it was thrown into theaters in January, long regarded as the worst month for movies). "The Pledge" is subtle, slow-moving, and emotionally powerful, a real rarity for Hollywood. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could see a movie anytime when I know Jack Nicholson plays. He is absolutely fantastic in his roles.This movie has a usual intrigue, but there are some "details" that make it unique: the actors, the image and the end.Keeping a promise (that he will find the killer of a girl) means for the old policeman to give up on his job and his life. But, unfortunately, no one believes his theory and he risks all his relationships just to keep the Promise.A movie about trust and mission accomplished, without even to know. A bitter end, a lost life for a dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intense drama directed by Sean Penn. Right as Reno detective Jerry Black(Jack Nicholson)is receiving his pats on the back at a retirement party; he tags along on a homicide case. The murder is brutal and disturbing; Black corners himself into making a vow to the mother of the murdered young girl to track down the killer. The force will not let him postpone his retirement, but Black is going to keep his pledge. He buys a rundown gas station that comes second to his searching for a serial killer that seeks out young blonde girls about 8 years of age and wearing a red dress. You begin having doubts like everyone else that Jerry Black may not be playing with a full deck. Tense and edge-of-your-seat crime thriller.Nicholson is, well Nicholson; absolutely fit for the part of the aging, one time slick detective. Jack is every bit the star of THE PLEDGE. A very strong supporting cast: Robin Wright Penn, Sam Shepard, Pauline Roberts, Benicio Del Toro, Michael O'Keefe and Vanessa Redgrave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marking Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beautifully rustic countryside near Reno, Nevada is the setting for "The Pledge", a modern day story about a just-retired policeman, Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), who makes a solemn promise to a child's parents that he will find the killer of their little girl. This is mostly a character study of Black, somewhat of a loner, and a person very dedicated to his profession and to the task of finding the murderer, despite the consensus among other cops that a confused Native American suspect is the killer. Nicholson gives a fine, subtle performance.The problem here is the film's pacing. I don't recall a movie wherein the plot so conveyed the impression of marking time. Some scenes, even sequences, have little or no value seemingly, apart from extending the film's runtime. You wait, and you wait, and you wait for something to happen. The film's finale does contain a major twist, one that has significant thematic value. But getting to that clever ending is mighty slow going."The Pledge" is a good film to watch for its attention to detail both in character development and in production design. Further, the film's theme of unrealized outcomes and the whims of fate is both unusual and highly relevant. I just wish the filmmaker had contracted some of the plot by expunging its nonessential parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly under-rated film (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of Sean Penn directing a film does not sound like the most promising thing in the world. However this film shows that Penn should probably give up acting and become a director.The film plays at a wonderful pace, one of those film's, which like 'The Man Who Wasn't There' never feels slow yet if you take your mind of the film very clearly is. The acting in this film is excellent, with Nicholson giving one of his best performances.The story is that of a retired police officer who has made a pledge to a woman to find the person who killed her daughter. Penn's film deals with how Nicholson deals with this pledge, but in a rather ambiguous and interesting way. We see Nicholson doing things that may or may not be to help him to carry out his pledge.There are times in the film when it appears that Nicholson may not be doing much to fulfill the pledge and this is possibly troubling him. However, these scenes are excellently written, acted and directed and leave viewer to mull over what is happening on screen.Penn has not simply made a slow burner here, he builds tension throughout. A scene where Nicholson believes a Preacher maybe the killer is one of the most tense scenes I have seen in many years.Nicholson, one of the finest actors ever, is on excellent form. This is the second of three excellent Nicholson performances, the others being As Good As It Gets and About Schmidt, which show that unlike De Niro and to a less extent Pacino, he is still an actor worth watching today. The way Nicholson uses body language and subtleties in his speech show that he is a greater actor than those who have just seen him playing 'Jack', although that actor is of course among the most watchable in the history of cinema.The film features an ending which arguably lets the film down. The film's sense of ambiguity about Nicholson's character more or less disappears at the end. The revelation that Nicholson's character was a drunk when there was nothing that implied this was totally unnecessary. The fact that the end is strongly implied at the beginning of the film does not help the film as well, because this implies an inevitability which simply is not there in the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pledge ... A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I concur that "The Pledge" is a masterpiece of sorts, and could rightly be termed a film that doesn't take the easy way out. It challenges the audience to think for itself, as opposed to simply offering the usual visceral images and noisy soundtrack.For those who seek films where the entire point is to view a series of explosions and smart-ass one-liners, "The Pledge" will indeed be a disappointment. Too bad. There's such a preponderance of pre-juvenile crap that is churned out as if on an assembly line that a thoughtful, intelligent movie should be positively revered.The scene at the end of the film, wherein Jack is seen scratching his ankle and then talking/emoting to himself, struck me as being familiar upon first viewing. Afterwards, I rewound and watched the opening moments and instantly realized that this was, in fact, the FIRST scene, playing out while the opening credits are rolling. The story is, for all intents and purposes, on a loop. In fact, we are seeing the sad conclusion first and THEN given the story and circumstances explaining Jack's eventual breakdown."The Pledge" is about one man's refusal to retire; thus, he finds a reason (making the pledge to the distraught mother of the murdered girl) to stay active on the case. He becomes consumed with it because he truly has nothing else in his life except his job as detective. He's not ready to sit on a porch, running a fishing store (despite the fact he uses this as a front). The pledge he makes is simply AN EXCUSE, so he may continue "doing something useful with his life." His motivations are propelled by selfishness and less about solving the case, although he ultimately wants to justify his stubborn outward stance with that conclusion.Still, what drives the man is his need to be doing what he must to remain alive and vital. Add to all of this yet another layer ... the question of the morality in placing another little girl in potential jeopardy, and you have a film reminiscent of the depth of the Nicholson/Rafelson collaborations of the 1970s.Those who don't wish to be so challenged by following a fully realized character and his motivations can always choose to sit back and receive the usual pablum. I don't intend to insult anyone, but to classify this offering as boring tells me the viewer was seeking a Big Mac and was accidentally served filet mignon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is great!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't bother writing down a review Jlynch-5 did it for me without even knowing it, you read my mind!!! Date: 15 July 2001 Summary: This film seems misunderstood(May contain thematic spoilers, but no plot points)Having read the reviews of this exceptional film, I have become a bit disturbed by the shallow and unimaginative expectations of the other IMDB reviewers.So often we are asked by the American film industry to pony up to $10 to watch the same old crime/police drama plots spun in a slightly different but eventually unoriginal way. Don't we want originality in the films we see, or are we happy to see the same old package in slightly different wrapping? I think the answer is yes: we want new and original films to view.The problem is that the American viewing public is addicted to action and the kind of simple-minded ideas of "justice" that spew from garbage television like "America's Most Wanted." When we walk into a theater and witness a crime in the first ten minutes, our good ol' American blood-lust view of revenge demands to be quenched by familiar plot points of car chases, gun fights and bad guys behind bars. And when an original picture fails to deliver that formula, we balk at it as being "too slow" or having a "bad ending." All our lip-service to "originality" goes out the window.This failure of evaluating art is the theme of the reviews I read here. This movie is not a action picture. It is not even a crime drama, although it uses a similar type of story to achieve its goal. This is a character study: a view of a good and decent police detective and his subtle and sorrowful descension into madness over the death of child, the final case of his career. The reviewers who pan this film do it not based on what they saw, but what they did not see but wanted to.Like any great character study, ala "The Remains of the Day," "Hurlyburly" and "American Beauty," this movie seems to move slowly to the impatient, action-oriented viewer. Also, like any great character study, it depends on the skill of its actors to convey the film's artistic message. Character study films are like great novels: they are art. Unfortunately the great American movie-going public doesn't want real art. They go to movies like they go to a roller-coaster: for a thrill. Only in America is a roller-coaster confused with art!The reasons this movie is great, interalia, is because it comes close to being a thriller, but it isn't one, and to confuse it with a thriller makes it seem flat. Review it not as the thriller it mirrors, but as the character study it is. In that light it is truly mesmerizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A World without Heroes is a Senseless World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS Although "The Pledge" is the American adaptation of a classical European movie ("Es geschah am helllichten Tag", Ladislao Vajda, 1958), which in turn is based on a script by the famous Swiss author Friedrich Dürrenmatt, the film is not typically American. In fact, we have got in front of us the rare case of an American version whose spirit is more European than the original.And yet it seems at first as if everything might amount to a positive, Hollywood-like ending including a special message for the American soul, one which could even be applied to current world events and which could read like this: "We must defeat and destroy the devil at all costs, even if innocent blood has to be spilled!"The devil as a symbolization of all evil is indeed mentioned in the film, and therefore script and camera work are at pains not to show any picture of the human who committed the abominable murders of the little girls. He is like an abstract undeterminable force hidden away somewhere in our world, but which can burst out at any time and at any possible location in order to pursue his destructive purposes.At the end of the film, however, it is not the retired police inspector Jerry Black who catches the devil, but pure coincidence: When he is driving to a meeting with the little girl that has been set up as a lure, the murderer has a fatal accident, being gruesomely burnt to death after colliding with an oncoming truck-trailer. Therefore the inspector, who is lying in ambush together with a contingent of policemen, is waiting in vain, and all his careful investigations, which have put him onto the track of the offender, come to nothing, for although the devil is duly punished, he isn't recognized by society as such, just as little as the inspector can keep the promise given to the mother of a preceding child victim "on the salvation of his soul".Now not only the feeling of triumph that he had already been sure of is denied him. By such conduct he has also gained the contempt of the mother who had believed that she might have been able to slip into a new life together with the policeman and who now has to realize that he has abused her. He therefore sees no other exit but initiating a process of disintegration which leads him to madness. At the end he stands alone at the decayed gas station which once had been his hunting ground for glory and recognition and where he now has fallen prey of imaginary voices and senseless monologues.That is purest European cinema, in succession to Bergman and Kieslowski. We are inside a world which is devoid of all sense, in which we are unable to discern any divine structures. Everything is determined by pure chance and coincidence, and whether a man is successful or not in his strivings does not depend on him. However hard he may try to give the slightest touch of significance to his existence, he will have to recognize in the end that he is no more than a tender plaything, at the mercy of the inscrutable waves, absurdly tossed about in the infinite ocean, without any support, only kept in motion by dark forces, by an obscure motor of whose intentions we know nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Jack thinking? One of the worst movies I ever saw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS INSIDE!First, I might mention that I'm a fan of some "bad movies". Also, while this is highly opinionated, let me state that this is not meant as an attack. The views mentioned below reflect on my perception of the movie as a whole, and the decision-making involved in the production. This, however, doesn't rank with them. I'll give some credit in there, the lead up was pretty good. In fact, I was really getting into the movie until the end. I was even saying "Jack's gonna mess this guy up" But, NO, due to some really terrible production decisions, the killer dies in a car accident, Jack's police friends ditch him as a drunk who imagined the whole thing, the woman he was involved with accuses him of endangering her daughter recklessly for his own sick fantasy, and Jack is left wondering "what the heck?". You think, as the police are driving past the accident, that they would do their "duty" and take a look at what happened. No chance. The end of this movie made me absolutely furious that I had brought it home, watched it, and gotten involved in what was happening. Surprises are fine, but for this, we learned that: Jack made a promise that he had every intention of keeping, and spent his retired life striving to do so. After discovering a pattern in similar homicides, he relocated to an area where he would be involved. He found a person who would fit as a likely target for the predator. He spent all his efforts to make sure she was safe. He also hoped that by doing what he was doing, he would catch the predator. This is all well and good, however it was utterly destroyed by the ending. We get a view that the police will not actually investigate something that may seem reasonable, if there is a more simple and seemingly airtight case in another direction. We see another example of "good guys get shafted"Isn't it good to see the good that comes from keeping your word?Sure there are movies where the "bad guys" win, however, typically they are the focal characters, or it is a comedy showing how through their bungling, they evade capture. Who wins here? What was ultimately resolved, other than seeing the negative repercussions of keeping your word?After watching this, I wanted my free rental back, I wanted my two hours back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst film of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Pledge" ran 124 minutes too long. One of my favorite stars, Jack Nicholson, should be forever embarrassed. I had always thought that Sean Penn was a talented young man. I've now revised my opinion.The premise of the movie could have worked. It didn't. There was no plot, just a series of semi-related and very boring scenes. They could and should have been cut, but then there would be only opening and ending credits remaining.The characters, without exception, were most unlikeable.Shots of mutilated children were obviously put in solely for shock effect.Sex was implied but not shown. Accordingly, we were even cheated out of some gratuitous sex. I postulated that Nicholson looked so grubby on the set, the woman playing his girlfriend probably wouldn't climb into bed with him, even for the sake of the film.I don't recall the word "pledge" used at any point in the movie. "Promise," yes. Maybe the title was an afterthought? Maybe the entire film was created on the spur of the moment?Apparently, the story was to have taken place in Nevada. It was patently obvious that most of the filming was done in British Columbia.The print in the theater where I saw this bomb had, from time to time, very distracting, nearly horizontal scratches. Color was less than optimal. Many scenes weren't even in sharp focus.Surprisingly, none of the audience walked out during the screening. Perhaps they were waiting to find out if anything would happen. It didn't. At the end of the movie, I've never seen an entire audience exit so quickly--grumbling about what a lousy movie "The Pledge" was.I talked with several others who had seen the film. We all thought we had been "taken" and should have asked for our money back.When I was a kid I used to make "stink bombs" out of old nitrate-base movie film. This film smells all by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully, but humorously, Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(MINOR spoilers). I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The beginning was intensely slow, and it seemed like the opening credits would never end. Once they did, the movie really didn't speed up much. There were just so many ridiculous plot elements / quirks in this movie that it lost all cinematic credibility. Here is a rundown of the some major weird things about the movie: 1) The creepiest (creepy in a "what the hell" way, not a "wow, cool" way) police interrogation scene ever, occuring between a bizarre policeman and a mentally retarded Indian. 2) A long &amp; inappropriate period of scenes alternating between Jack Nicholson's character at a party and a kid on a snowmobile. 3) The snowmobile kid showing up in a parade later in the movie. 4) The scene where "The Pledge" occurs is not well done at all, lacks any semblance of meaningfulness, suspense, or for that matter, any redeeming quality. 5) Weird, random bird scenes. 6) In the middle of what starts out to be a meaningful quest to find a killer, Jerry, for no explained reason, buys himself a gas station in the wilderness. What the heck? 7) A creepy shopkeeper at a Christmas store. 8) RIDICULOUSLY slow moving plot. 8) Way too many porcupine images to be coincidence. 9) Some weird religious symbolism that the writer and ditrector never follow up on. 10) SIMPLY THE WORST ENDING IN CINEMATIC HISTORY. This took a movie I would have possibly rated a 4 or 5 straight to the lowest 1 of all. It gave absolutely no closure, made absolutely no sense, was not set up or explained by the plot, and was simply a huge let down for what COULD have been developed into a strong, suspenseful ending. Overall, SEE THIS FOR PATHETIC LAUGHS, NOT DRAMA OR SUSPENSE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible film made worse because we expect more for Penn and Nicholson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** It's hard to believe this movie was approved by anyone for release. Perhaps the studio thought Jack Nicholson's image would sell enough tickets. It was so bad that perhaps I should be as all over the lot with this little review as the movie was. Please note that people on both sides of me checked their watches at least every five minutes, as I was. I finally couldn't stand it any longer and walked out, only to see that I was walking out at the ending, which turned out to be the least cohesive ending to a movie in the history of filmmaking. Nothing tied together. The only thing we know when the movie ended is that we just wasted eight bucks and a night out. Actually, we just spent the entire movie to learn nothing, except that movie-making and shameless movie promotion by Roger Ebert had just hit new lows together. I will use the name "Jack" here, and not the character's, because I didn't buy the character for a second.To have Jack Nicholson in a starring role, and give him NOT ONE MEMORABLE line is atrocious. There were times in the movie where he would literally just sit there dumbfounded or just be mumbling something that my kids could have written. I was waiting for a "It was like... woah."The "interrogation" of the suspect was so slow and painful... not because the killer was an interesting character, it's because the writers must have been on location and their brains must have frozen up. The cop said the same thing fifteen times, and so did the Indian. The most exciting part in what could have been a riveting scene was waiting for Benito del Toro to do that funny thing with his tongue again.Also, here's Jack Nicholson making a pledge (actually a promise) of "his salvation" (repeated about five times!!) to this couple, and yet the only time they interact again is when Jack sees them from afar as they leave the grain store! He never discusses the case with them again!!! That makes sense.And then, gee, what a coincidence, the main character just HAPPENS to meet a woman with an eight-year old girl and they end up living with him. VERY LIKELY, indeed!The red dress. Of course we were waiting for Robin Penn Wright's daughter to find herself somewhere where she could pick out a red dress... Jack's line when asked how he liked it was... "It's great." There was absolutely nothing on his face to show us the red dress bore any significance to him, while we, the audience were sitting there thinking what an expected event this was! I don't know if anyone else noticed, but the Continuity Director couldn't even get the red dress right! The dress the girl wore was not the one we had to watch them picking out in the clothing store, just another in a series of drawn out scenes that seemed never to end. Why bother, especially if that particular dress was just forgotten about later?Why was Jack so affixed on the snowmobile kid in the parade? What was the meaning of that? And if Jack is so intent on finding the real killer, how come he-- or any of the other cops-- never once talked to the only eye-witness of this killing????? At least we never saw this. That may have happened, but it would have had to have been implied. That must have been in the part of the script or film that never made it to the final edit; because they needed time for flying birds and senseless scenes that had nothing to do with the story.The stake-out. Jack was actually asked, "Are you sure he's coming?" about four times. Then to watch all the cops leave with this little girl still there as potential bait for a ruthless killer, no matter how much they thought it was folly (they brought eight cops out there--it couldn't have been TOO much of a folly, right?) was simply insane.One more... here's a guy looking for the cheapest furniture possible because he's on a retired cop's pension, and he's driving a brand new SUV (the product placement money took precedence over the integrity of the story!!) and he's buying a gas station on the spot for a figure that the real estate agent said was way too much --money he'd never be able to recover. PLEASE!!! Sean Penn is smarter than this, is he NOT?I'm done. I've wasted enough time on this terrible movie. I just had to express that this was the most insulted I've felt after a movie since Exorcist II: The Heretic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a big disappointment. A lot of stars, and what should have been a great directorial debut by Sean Penn was wasted. From the melodramatic "pledge" scene, to the lack of development of Jack Nicholson's character, this movie pushed all the wrong buttons. You never find out what's really wrong with Nicholson's character, and while not knowing the true identity of the murder should be effective, it is wasted on thin plot lines involving other characters. Did we really need a five minute fishing scene,or a ten minute scene with an art historian. Lot's of cinematic masturbation in the movie. When the most interesting scene involves a thousand chickens we have problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will not leave my mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot explain how much I liked this movie, because I cannot simply define my reasons. It is such a thrilling ride to take along side Mr. Nicholson's character Jerry Black as he literally goes crazy trying to find a killer who presumably has already been captured.The amount of dedication and love delivered is beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. There is never a moment where this lacks, and in my honest opinion it makes the film all the more captivating.In some ways there are different stories tied into this one motion picture; There is Jerry, a retired cop working on a case, then there is Jerry, an overwhelmed man adopted into a beautiful family of which he feels is his responsibility to protect. The Pledge is conclusive, it is gripping and heart wrenching.I can't say anything bad about this movie, because I literally feel as though it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flawless movies are rare. So what can you do with a perfect movie, but give it a 10 out of 10! This is a serial killer story made as a tense and haunting drama. The photography and scenery is ambient and beautiful. Jack Nicholson makes one of his best performances - and he is not playing his usual routine character.There is a harsh moral to the story, which cannot be spoken more of, unless the movie gets spoiled.Sean Penn is not only a great actor, he is as we can see here a fabulous director. The inventive and ambient, sensitive directorship of this movie also occurs, but in another tone, in Into the wild.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pointless to speculate as to who the killer is or was, largely because as with all fiction, the characters and events exist only as we see them, or rather as the author meant them to be seen. In this case the whodunnit part of the plot is clearly left unknown. Not that it is important. If you're worrying about who the killer was, you're missing the point of this beautiful movie. All that's important is that the killer got his come-uppance.The point of "the pledge" is the idea of something at work which is beyond man, something beyond "the personal". The repeated references to God, the church and angels etc would seem corny if they were not counter-balanced by references to the more primitive origins of man's longing for truth, justice and honour, expressed through the timelessness of the American wilderness, and also conveyed by the soul-wrenching song "Nwahulwana", which is heard while Jerry Black on his fishing trip.Having just watched this film, I'm moved by it, but can't really say why. There's something very special about every scene. A very well crafted film with a beautiful overtone of universal justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The night he retires as a Nevada sheriff, Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) pledges to the mother of a murdered girl that he will find the killer. A severely retarded Indian (Benico Del Toro) previously convicted of child rape is arrested, but kills himself and another officer when he is being taken to the cells. For many it is an open and shut case but Jerry doesn't believe the police arrested the right man; he discovers this is the area's third incident in the recent past with victims all being; young, blond, pretty, and small for their age. So after retirement he buys an old gas station in the mountains near the crimes in order to search for the real killer all he knows of this possible phantom is that he is; a tall man who drives a black station wagon, gives toy porcupines as gifts, and calls himself the wizard: (clues from a drawing by the dead girl). Jerry's solitary life gives way to friendship with a woman and her small, blond daughter. Has he neglected something that may prove fatal? Detective Jerry Black has made a promise he can't break, to catch a killer he can't find. This film surpasses Sean Penn's previous directorial efforts ('The Indian Runner' and 'The Crossing Guard'). Re-teamed with Jack Nicholson he has helped the legendary actor create one of his best on screen performances since his 1970s peak ('Five Easy Pieces', 'Last Detail', 'Cuckoo's Nest', 'Marvin Gardens' "shining" et al). Nicholson has always been sensational but over the last ten years or so has sleepwalked his way through way too many movies, culminating in his irritating and mannered performance in the clichéd and sentimental films such as 'Somethings gotta give', enigmatic performances in which he has commanded the screen in the nineties have been rare (batman, as good as it gets (for which he one the Oscar). 'The Pledge' has obviously recharged his creative batteries. He is simply stunning in this film, he is not as glamorous as he tends to be and has accepted a role illustrating his range as an actor today. The films musical score composed by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer is very good indeed it evokes all of the feelings of the leading man. One thing worth noting is that Mickey Rourke is outstanding in the cameo of a father whose daughter was killed years ago possibly by the man Jerry is in pursuit of. As the story develops post Blacks retirement he purchases an old gas station up in the mountains and spends all his time there believing the killer to frequently travel along that road. Nicholson's character meets and gives refuge to a battered wife (Robin Wright Penn) and her young daughter. Jerry Black may have discovered affection for Robin Penn's character that transcends his solitary life.After some time of looking after his new female companion his gas station is paid a visit by a black station wagon that reawakens Jerry's need for justice. This car may be a lead in the case but with the lead characters increasing paranoia and inability to forget the pledge he made, it becomes apparent that Black's mind may not be as it should be. A religious man who Black believes to be the killer then pays his girlfriend's daughter a visit, but could this simply be an innocent man trying to convert her to Christianity. Blacks ability to cope with the situation worsens and worsens, until the point where he stakes out his girlfriend's daughter calls out a police squad and expects the killer to arrive at a pre-arranged meeting point. No such thing takes place and Black is abandoned by Robin Wright Penn's character who is appalled he used her daughter as bait. The police leave thinking him an old drunk, and Penn (director) leaves the story open and disturbing as we realise there was in fact a man travelling to the stakeout point but who died in a car accident. Penn brilliantly creates the story of one mans turmoil with a good script, good cast and brilliant direction. His film is poignant unsettling and moving. This film may be in the murder mystery genre but more than anything else this is a blistering magnificent character study. With Penn succeeding in extracting a nuanced and powerful performance from the old pro. This is a superb modern day thriller that doesn't need the crutch of preposterous twists and gun blazing action. For people who like intelligent rather than visceral thrillers this is a class piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell is going on with this movie?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*CONTAINS SPOILERS* This film is an absolute mess! Having heard some good mutterings about this film at the previous Cannes Film Festival, I was expecting an enjoyable nights viewing and all I got was a shameful lesson in how not to direct. I started getting suspicious early on with the appearance of some rapid editing and irrelevant cinematic styles being used in such a way as to be purely for the director to practice some techniques. Unfortunately this was not to stop throughout the film, but things got worse...much worse! Now for those of you who are tempted by a raft of celebrity names this film is a must with the likes of Harry Dean Stanton, Helen Mirren, Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Vanessa Redgrave,...except for the fact that each and everyone of these great actors appears for ONE scene only (with the exception of Harry Dean Stanton, who's second scene last about 20 seconds). Admittedly, Mickey Rourke's scene is pretty well acted but at approx. 1min 30seconds doesn't really qualify as Oscar nomination material. In my opinion one or two cameo appearances is okay, but five! That is just heavy handed. In most other films they probably wouldn't even be credited but here they Headline.Maybe the story could redeem this film? Not a chance! There is no build up, scant regard for informing the viewer of the passage of time (one scene it's snowing, the next it's high summer) and dramatic scenes are clumsily foisted upon us for no apparent reason. A classic example being when Nicholson, Wright Penn and the daughter visit a local outdoor market. This seemingly innocent situation suddenly changes to a panic ridden, dodgy camera movements and high suspense music scene as... the child goes and plays on the swings. There it begins and there it ends. Bearing in mind that the mother has no knowledge of a killer whatsoever, this seems to be totally out of context and is indictative of the few so-called suspense scenes.Please don't expect any cleverly devised investigation techniques either. Nicholson uses that age old device for locating a suspected black station wagon... buying a petrol station and waiting six months for a lucky break!All in all an absolute mess of a movie that only inspires me to purchase a cinema in the hope that eventually a good movie will come along!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tough, demanding, but spine-tingling detective story from director Sean Penn. A modern-day retired police chief (Jack Nicholson) cannot let go of an unsolved serial murder case...and the pledge he made to a victim's mother that he would find the killer no matter what. After the morose, dense "The Indian Runner" and the meandering "The Crossing Guard", Penn finally found his footing here as a movie-maker, and "The Pledge" lingers in the memory long after it's over. The picture is put together very well (the puzzling opening doesn't appear to make much sense, but it connects with the finale in a fluid way) and nearly all the performances are terrific. The last-act switcheroo of suspects may leave you scratching your head--and practically requires a second viewing--yet Penn keeps the narrative taut, and Jack Nicholson (aging nicely) holds it all together firmly with his amazingly low-keyed demeanor. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those who don't understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSI could not believe the comments I read here that this movie was "boring" or "slow" or "depressing", etc. But it's the same with many of the excellent movies I look up here; unfortunately these people writing reviews have not understood the movie. Why write a review only to say "I don't understand it. Therefore don't waste your time seeing it". These people are completely uninformed and apparently unable to absorb what they see, having never read or seen tragedy (or good filmmaking).There are bad movies and stupid, pointless movies - oh, such as the teen genre - all of it - which has destroyed young peoples' ability to know good story telling by focusing on taboos and cheap laughs or gratuitous violence - but this is not one of those movies. Why is it considered a failure then? Because you have to watch it and pay attention to the story unfolding. Those who wrote that there was no story, I suppose they went out to buy popcorn and missed some key scenes. The whole story is there and it is clear. It is an ugly story, child murder, but the focus is on the retired cop, Jack Nicholson, who is determined to find the killer. It is good versus evil, the oldest plot in the world, one which is never boring. There is evil in the world; there are people who do evil and then people who try to find justice.First of all anything Jack Nicholson is in is worth your while as he is one of the greatest actors on the screen. He becomes the character. So those comments about what a stupid movie this is are way off base; even if it was pure trash, he would have made it worth while. But the movie is clearly not trash. I would totally compare it to The Swimmer with Burt Lancaster, in mood. But in this case the character is not living in his own dream world - he is right and everyone else is wrong - it is about bureaucracies and assumptions - which we are all faced with sometimes - knowing you are right but the authorities are too blind and dimwitted to admit it. A man who knows he is right and goes down to defeat and yet good still triumphs in spite of the personal tragedy to him. This is the classic storyline of all time and therefore quite like Hitchcock, but why was this movie rejected? I absolutely cringe when true trash becomes big box office and gems like this are brushed aside.And for all those who didn't understand what was happening, the writer from Germany gave the entire explanation in his post. I could not believe someone could see the movie and not be mesmerized by the horror of the story unfolding. This man dedicated himself to finding the killer, who clearly existed, but no one else believed him. We the audience are shown that he is right, but the movie does not show the killer until the end, and we are left knowing that the retired cop was right and everyone else was wrong, his life is destroyed, and yet it doesn't change that justice was indeed done even if it was by the Grim Reaper and even if no one else knew.This is chilling and this is important. I really wish ignorant viewers would not bother posting "I don't understand this movie". Next time why not watch it again before jumping on line and typing in some drivel - or read several other reviews and make an attempt to pay more attention when watching cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, first off there are those posting here talking about how those of us who didn't like this movie missed the point- it's about a man's obsession and the development of his character. But please, how many of you picked up the movie and rented it because you thought it was just a chance to see some deep character acting? People rented this movie because they thought they were getting at least some kind of thriller movie. Sure Jack's acting was good, but why would anyone rent a movie solely on the fact that there is some good acting? Does plot matter at all? It's funny to hear the reasons people have for liking this movie. Some say "Oh it's so cool the way Penn uses the camera or develops the characters through vivid scenery." I don't mind interesting camera work and great scenery shots if it serves a purpose. In this movie there really was no purpose, it just slowed the movie down. You keep watching though because you keep thinking "Something big is going to happen soon- the girl will get taken and Jack will flip out and go after the killer." Well, that doesn't happen. The ending is horrible and not even plausible. Ok, whoopie, big surprise so it's the guy from the general store and not the church leader. The killer dies in a car wreck and yet some how Jack (sorry don't even remember his name in the movie) doesn't even see or hear about the big accident on the way home? (This is a little town remember). Also the cops passing by don't even stop to investigate? Surely Jack told them all about a black car and porcupines yet they just ignore this as they pass by? Come on seriously who could like this movie? The more I write this more I realize what a joke it was. I was willing to put up with the stereotypical small town goofy Mayberry cops in the beginning and the unrealistic performance by the newbie cop on the force all for the sake of thinking it has to get better. Please I beg you not to waste you time watching this movie. I knew I should have checked the imdb site before I rented this. I would have been able to tell from those that liked it what their reasons were. They are the people that have to like a movie simply because they know others are going to say it sucked. Somehow they are more intellectual or have a better eye for fine films than the rest of us laymen. Don't worry you can still be considered a good film critic and tell the truth. Just get real, this movie was bad and you know it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... whatever the personal cost.Once a cop, always a cop, they say. Even some six potential working hours away from retirement, Det. Jerry Black's conscience and instincts are pricked by the discovery of a dead young girl out in the snowy wastes. It's an investigation he may soon wish he hadn't involved himself in however, since when his colleagues err, Jerry remembers his promise to the bereaved family...Others are reluctant to commit to the obligation he has taken on, so he is left to shoulder the burden of his task alone. His gut feeling that he is on the right track leads to a mind that can never rest and places in jeopardy a burgeoning relationship with a local woman and her young daughter. Will he come through this test with his honour and sanity intact? Much as I admire his acting skills, Sean Penn's deliberate directorial style had never really engaged me in either "The Indian Runner" or his later effort, "The Crossing Guard". Here it's a style that suits the journey however, enabling us to uncover details along with Jerry and keenly feel his anguish as he always feels he's just a short step behind the suspect he's pursuing. The closure of the film is unsettling, as we've begun to empathise with this man and understand the motivations for the decisions he makes, even if we disagree with them. He's a decent man at heart, and doesn't deserve to be so sullied by the transgressions of others, but that is the price you must pay when you've signed yourself up to live under oath...The lesson here is to always be confident you can fulfil the bets you place on yourself. As an officer of the law it's something you often have to do, but tragically, they don't always make what you would call a satisfactory return.</fullReview>

Excellent choice of pace.directing: great job by Sean Penn. Nothing more to add.Conclusion: well worth seeing, and seeing again. IF I KNEW SEAN PENN, and NICHOLSON, personally, and if I had lots of money, I'd ask them to please IMMEDIATELY start the filming of another story by Duerrenmatt with an ageing cop: SUSPICION. A nasty story of suspicion around the famous and sinister Dr Mengele (live operations in the death camps during WWII), with the retiring cop ready to sacrifice is life (and undergo torture) just to find out. Based on the job Sean Penn did with The Pledge, he'd make a great job of Suspicion, no doubt. And based on what he did in The Pledge, Nicholson would just be beyond words.

		<fullReview>This movie is really good. The only reason I gave it a 8 out of 10 is because it's slightly slow and the ending will drive you crazy. But other than that, the story is very very interesting. Nicholson's character is such a good cop, but only us, the audience, notices this. He is chasing a serial killer. A killer that has a distinct taste for little girls. **Possible Spoiler** But everyone thinks the killer is dead, except Nicholsons character. So after his (semi)retirement, he goes in search of the killer, in a low key fashion. He befriends a pitiful lady played by Robin Wright Penn. She does very well herself. She has a daughter, that fits that distinct taste for young girls the killer has. The story unfolds from there. It's not your typical cat &amp; mouse movie. One moral of the story is, always respect your elders opinions and beliefs. They've been around the block a lot more than you have. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really hoping to like this film but felt let down the whole way through. The direction was tired and lazy and some of the camera effects pointless and unnecessary. Nicholson is an acting legend and if you have him in front of a camera you don't need effects or MTV-style slo-mo's, just point and shoot. Having said that this wasn't his greatest performance.**Spoilers** It started going wrong for me at the beginning, the snowmobile cutting out right in front of the the Indian's truck. The reason being the kid gets off and takes off his helmet so we can see his shocked look when he see the girl. Poor I thought.The whole Indian storyline at the beginning was a stretch, Del Toro did not convince me and the dialogue in the interrogation scene did not flow to get the confession, even taking into account Del Toro being mentally deficient. Jerry makes a point of getting fingerprints from the girl's jacket, but yet there's no mention of trying to match this to Del Toro's character, surely that would have been an easy way to see if he was the real killer? Other things that didn't work for me were 1. How easily he made the promise in the first place, 6 hours left to retirement and a longtime cop he should have known better. 2. His relationship with the mother. 3. His cop friends don't believe his story but yet they still manage to get 8 SWAT guys to do a stakeout and they only seem to stay a short while because its too hot. Get real. 4. Jerry's descent into madness, there are pointers throughout the film and yet he then just goes barking mad. The reason we're expected to believe this is he never caught the killer. Do we honestly expect that a death in a car crash is not going to be big news round a place like that? And that when Jerry sees the crash on the news he won't piece the whole thing together?? There are too many other things to mention.For someone that enjoys slow paced, character built films this is a long way down my list and I'm amazed so many people liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful: DON'T SEE IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Pledge" starring Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright Penn and directed by her husband Sean Penn, is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The weak storyline is as follows: an aging cop named Jerry Black (Nicholson, in one of his worst movies) is retiring from the force. As he is leaving, the case of a murdered little girl pops up. Moved by the case, and making a pledge (hence the title) to the victim's parents that he will find the culprit of their daughter's killing, he undertakes the case on his own as an amateur. He finds links between several past unsolved murders of similar-looking little girls. Along the way he encounters a single mother (Wright Penn) and her daughter Chrissy, an apt candidate for another of the serial killer's murders. And Jerry is convinced there's something behind the first victim's drawing of a "giant" in the forest, porcupines, and a black station wagon. It is an overused plot, that is tired and has been done so much better in other movies. Nicholson is a bit miscast, which doesn't help. I am a fan of his works and was sorely disappointed with this. I had heard nothing but good reviews of this movie, and was considerably excited to see it. At the beginning, it started out pretty well, even if it was a little slow. About an hour into it, it became tolerable, give or take a few pointless and strange scenes, and by the last forty-five minutes I was horribly sorry that I had wasted time and money on this ridiculous film.The ending left me staring at the screen thinking "What was that?" and shaking my head at the prepostrous ending. Wright Penn, who was wonderful in such movies as "The Princess Bride", "Forrest Gump" and more recently "Unbreakable" gave a thoroughly forgettable performance.A really splendid cast with the likes of Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Dean Stanton, Aaron Eckhart, Benicio Del Toro (whose all-too-brief performance saved the film from utter bombdom) and others whose talent and on-screen power should of enhanced this movie in some way instead came on screen and left without contributing. Only Sean Penn could direct such trash. 1/2 /*****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a film of this pedigree and the sort of psychological thriller it is, I am very surprised I have never heard of this movie, The Pledge until recent weeks. I decided to check this film out, and it's not a half-bad movie. The film is very suspenseful and it has some interesting plot twists I did not see coming. The film does a good job at keeping me in the dark. If you're looking for a fast-paced thriller, or an action film, you must move on because this is a broad character study and an interesting cat-and-mouse game. Sean Penn's film is about a retiring Nevada police sheriff named Jerry who investigates the murder on his final night as a cop. The killer is caught and he confesses, but Jerry believes they caught the wrong man. Jerry decides to buy a convenience store to keep an eye on the actual killer, as there has been a pattern of the same kind of crime going around. The film has a cast that is filled with talented pedigree, though most just have small parts. Jack Nicholson does a fine job as Jerry. It may not be his best role, but Jack still plays his cards right. Helen Mirren does a good job in her brief role as the psychologist rooted in cold, hard facts. I also liked Aaron Eckhart as Jerry's fellow police officer. Overall, The Pledge is actually an interesting crime thriller that does a good job in taking its time of building up the suspense and getting to know our characters. It's a very talky thriller, but it's expertly directed. Sean Penn actually has talent behind the camera, and he creates a satisfying character study that begins well, has a suspenseful middle, and ends on a high note. Not the best thriller of all times, but it's good enough. My Grade: B+</fullReview>

I loved Nicholsons performance. He and the director got the nuances of the strengths and weaknesses of the Detective Black character just right. Even when he is just average Nicholson is worth watching. As for the movie , well it does seem that it could have been tightened up and shortened especially the first half. For me the Benicio Del Toro character was so ridiculous and OTT I nearly turned off but once the Hollywood hall of famers that Penn employed for bit parts have done their fragments there is a lot less navel gazing, bird flying and scene chewing scenes and the film picks up to finally turn into decent Saturday night cans and a curry movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a 1958 novel by a Swiss Playwright and featuring a screenplay by Polish-born, Jerzy Kromolowski and his wife, Mary Olson-Kromolowski. European roots partly explains why "The Pledge" departs from the usual formula for movies about over-the-hill cops on the trail of serial killers. The director, Sean Penn, also took a fresh path through familiar territory, but the film is uneven at best.The movie begins as Jack Nicholson wanders aimlessly in the hot sun. Jack shows his years and he appears disturbed. These early images are stark and unsettling. Two stories unfold through a series of crosscuts. The first follows the retirement of Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) from the Reno Police Department. The other involves the discovery of a little girl's body in the mountains outside the city. When police attending Jerry's goodbye party are summoned to attend the murder scene, Jerry accompanies them; he still has six hours to go before retirement. At the murder scene, the girl is identified and Jerry ends up informing the girl's parents. Jerry makes the pledge of the film's title to find the killer although he is almost retired from the force. Hardly alluded to during the rest of the film; Jerry nonetheless acts on the promise and relentlessly pursues the killer.A suspect is arrested and Jerry watches the interrogation unconvinced that this is the killer. As devotees of detective movies know, a suspect brought in early is usually not the perpetrator. This interrogation is a particularly strange encounter, almost as though Sean Penn told Benicio Del Toro to just go nuts. It's a performance that helps give an unsatisfactory flavour to much of the film. Time moves on. Jerry approaches his former police associates with evidence he has found. The police chief doesn't believe that the murders of three little girls, all in the same area, and all wearing red dresses are actually connected. Serial killer movies often demand that the head of the police be particularly obtuse so that the hero can be vindicated in the end. "The Pledge" takes this to extremes.Jerry moves into the area that he has identified through various clues as the killer's domain, and buys a gas station on a major road that leads into the area.Jerry becomes involved with Lori, a waitress played by Robin Wright Penn in a performance that allows her little glamour ? she sports a broken front tooth for much of the movie. When she eventually moves into the gas station with her eight-year old daughter, Chrissy, a warm relationship grows between the three. However, there is always the uneasy feeling that Jerry is using the girl as bait to draw out the killer he believes is still in the area. Despite a thoughtful performance by Jack Nicholson, there are gaps in the script that leave his motivations obscure. "The Pledge" does pull off an original ending with the identity of the child killer and his fate known to the audience if not to Jerry. The film ends with the scenes of Jerry wandering dazed and alone. By this time we understand the reason for this even if we do not feel totally satisfied with the resolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started with an amazing score, scenery and awesome story line. But as it moves ahead, its loses its charm and grip. Lots of talented actors seems to be wasted here. Benicio Del Toro &amp; Aaron Eckhart seems liked they are forced to act in this movie. They had nothing much to do. I expected more out of JN. I am sorry I rated the movie 4/10.No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. The climax doesn't work for many reasons. The little girl was used as a bait. Patrons are left wondering like idiots. Ending is damn weak. A man with strong will cannot be fooled so easily. JN starts drinking and goes mad in the end. No no. Finally... do not expect more. Bad bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to be a remake of a great old German movie of 1958 'It happened in broad daylight'. Original is fantastic and this one doesn't get to it's level but it is not a bad movie.The movie however is a bit slow at times and unlike the original one that is thrilling and makes you keep watching, this one has something missing.The cast is great in this movie and all do a good job without doubt. Jack Nicholson is not in his best performance but still it is Nicholson and of course it is good. Sound track is good and as the cast is done by a master of the trade and joins cast Hellen Mirren and Jack Nicholson in the Oscar winning group.Some movies don't need a love affair and this one is one of it, but I guess that is the difference of German and American film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an actor's showcase, from an actor-turned-director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A grisly child molestation/murder case in western Nevada sends a recently retired cop with a long memory on an obsessive hunt for the elusive killer. In outline it sounds like yet another Thomas Harris ('Silence of the Lambs') retread, but the film is more a character study than a criminal investigation, with a meaty star role for Jack Nicholson, proving yet again that with a halfway decent script he can still be one of the more compelling performers on this planet.But this isn't by any means a one-man show: alongside Nicholson is an astonishing surplus of supporting talent, including Benicio Del Toro, Vanessa Redgrave, Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton, Sam Shepard, Mickey Roarke, and Robin Wright Penn, most of them generously allowed their own brief share of the limelight, typically in one scene each alone with Jack. The dream cast is either an indication of how desperate some actors are for a demanding screenplay, or else it's a mark of respect toward one of their own clan (Sean Penn) turned director.The film is top heavy with sometimes distracting stylistic touches of a sort only an actor-director would indulge in, and like too many big-screen movies has one eye aimed prematurely toward the home entertainment market, with lots of TV screen filling close-ups and so forth. But the pace is effectively moody and slow, building up considerable tension (almost approaching something closer to white-knuckle dread) before the tragic and (perhaps too) downbeat ending. The R-rating is earned by some truly gruesome murder details, vividly depicted in the otherwise typically handsome cinematography by ace DP Chris Menges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really felt this was more of an OK watch. The production values were high enough for this type of film, and the acting was good enough also. Nothing really spectacular, but nothing really too terrible either. Except perhaps the ending, which I wouldn't describe as 'bad' per se, but I would definitely consider it 'clumsy'. I realize Penn is going for the eurotrash ambiguous ending, but even when the that kind of ending is really well done, it's -still- a weak way to end.I think the real story here is that he just didn't have an actual ending, and decided he didn't need one, and flat out just left it at that.Leaving the resolution up to the audience so everyone thinks your a genius. mmm hmmm. yep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this one yesterday afternoon. The premise of the movie was promising enough and the beginning, with its haunting soundtrack, pulled me into the story. However, somewhere down the line, the movie seemed to lose its way. Jack Nicholson plays a cop who is about to retire from the force, when he decides to partner another cop(Aaron Eckhart) to the scene of a brutal crime. A seven year old girl has been raped and murdered. He decides that he has to look into this case despite his retirement plans. When he goes to the girl's home, her mother makes him promise on the 'salvation of his soul' that he would find the killer of her little girl. From then on in, what could have been a taut investigative thriller, meanders into a slow moving character study. For portions during the movie, it would seem that Nicholsons character could have followed up a lead more effectively, but remains in his new life. Before suddenly, he gets the feeling the killer may not be too far away. While it is okay if a movie is more of a character study, you do feel that change in the characters behaviours are at times not really shown naturally. The ending may especially put you off. Although it is unexpected and a bit shocking, you end up feeling that the movie did not sufficiently build up the events leading upto the drastic upheaval. The movie is based on a book. I can imagine that the book probably dealt better with the inner turmoil of the characters than the movie did. The movie probably could have been a bit longer to capture this, but still, i would say this is worth a watch for some things. One is Jack Nocholsons wonderful performance. Secondly, the haunting music score at times as well as the director's(Sean Penn) deft execution of certain scenes, which leave a mark on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Huge Mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very big mistake about this movie, otherwise a great one, is the fact that the book placed the story in Switzerland (as written by a Swiss writer... Duerrenmatt, one who deserved Nobel Prize...), and the film itself placed the story in USA... The difficulty of pinpoint the next strike of a serial killer is geometrically magnified by the wideness of the area... While Kommissar Matthaei could reasonably pinpoint the next strike of the killer (and get mad when he erroneously thought he was wrong), in that small area of Switzerland, Officer Jerry Black cannot feel guilty about not pinpointing a serial killer in such a huge area of USA! Do you remember those well documented book and movie, "The Silence of the Lambs"? Well, since FBI itself can't pinpoint a serial killer in such a huge area if not by chance, the madness of Jerry Black is really unjustified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wanted to add a few of my observations. It is the story of a fully dedicated policeman to his job.The cop was watching the girl all the time as a living bait, he even set up her swing right next to the road maybe to catch his own fish. He is a fisherman and enjoys big fish. There is also a short conversation in TV at some point of movie about how living baits work better. I think, all the cop was thinking was just to keep his promise, not even the life of his stepdaughter mattered to him. He is a perfect cop just like the effigy cop in the last scene (in which he is crazy) showing an empty pledge. He somehow remembers me of the character of the inspector Javert in The Miserables. Jack Nicholson plays astonishingly well in this role, although the story line is a little vague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely worth a viewing,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently seeing The Pledge, I wasn't really sure how I felt about it. I actually bought the movie without having seen it because it came packaged with The Departed. Jack Nicholson's performance is among his best, far better (in my opinion) than his performance in The Departed or other recent films because it was more layered and textured and far more subtle. Nicholson is a retiring detective who is close to retiring when the body of a young girl is found. He makes a promise to the family to try to find the killer. He continues with his retirement, but through his contacts and many years of friendship with other detectives (most notably Aaron Eckhart, who appears to be phoning it in) he continues to try to solve the case. The story and pace are very well executed, but other elements of the direction are not. What feels right is the pace. It's very deliberate and handled expertly, walking the line between advancing the story and pausing to smell the roses, with just the right amount of pause and not moving too fast through other scenes. The problem for me starts to rear it's head in a lot of the acting. Sean Penn is a great actor, but tends to make the obvious choices in his acting and sticking to those choices. It's strong acting, but it's not always interesting. This is a major flaw with The Pledge. It feels as though most secondary characters are trying to play the obvious stereotype. It wouldn't be so jarring if Nicholson's subtlety wasn't so refined, but with Nicholson's even toned and thoughtful portrayal highlighting the ham-fisted choices a lot of the actors make, it really does remind you that it's just a movie. Another problem is some of the shots and effects and editing are very over the top. I can certainly appreciate the idea that zooming in on a character then repeating the zoom again by copying the last 10 or so frames of film is emotionally supposed to connect me with the impact of finding a dead body, but frankly, it's very poor film-making. Penn has directed before, and it's very disappointing that he uses a lot of very hackneyed editing/camera techniques that are simply out of place here. The effect of some of the editing and camera technique is very jarring simply because it doesn't work. HOWEVER, It is a very interesting story and for the most part it is well told and definitely worth watching, but the performances by usually great great actors (Benicio Del Toro, Robin Wright Penn, Aaron Eckhart) just miss the mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson delivers a haunting performance as the retired cop obsessed with finding a child killer. The movie builds exceedingly slowly, as does Nicholson's paranoia. With a stellar supporting cast, terrific atmosphere, and solid storyline, "The Pledge" delivers a fine crime movie with far less splatter and car chases than mainstream Hollywood. I would argue that the somewhat controversial ending did not leave me letdown, as other reviewers have complained, but rather concluded for me in a very satisfying way. I also found myself thinking about this movie long after it was over. Highly recommended with a solid 7.0 rating. - MERK</fullReview>

Dürrenmatt wrote the story as a screenplay for the swiss television 1956 and not until 1958 he wrote the novel "Das Versprechen" based on the screenplay. I like the movie from Sean Penn an it shows how genius Dürrenmatt was. He wrote stories that can be transported in different decades and different countries. The movie ends in a different way like the original, and this end is disturbing. But it shows (in a strange kind) what was another possible ending of Dürrenmatts script and the logical consequence of it.

		<shortDescription>Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is noteworthy because of the solid acting of Jack Nicholson and the unusual ending. But it is important to realize that the story is based on ideas of the German classic "It Happened in Broad Daylight" (German title "Es geschah am hellichten Tag", based on a story by famous writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt). Knowing that, one would have expected more of this remake! I think, in the end, the German version is better because it is richer in detail. It is literally less colorful (filmed in black and white) and overdone (as many Hollywood productions are), which intensifies the atmosphere. One positive aspect of the American version is that it is quite subtle: It judges the obsessed behavior of the cop (Nicholson's character) less. The tragedy of his behavior is heightened by the emotionally warmer relationship between Nicholson and the family he uses in his quest to find the 8murderer of several young girls.For those who can't get enough of this film: There exists a third version, also a German production, but this time in color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man so obsessed in his search for a child killer that he befriends a mother with child so he can use the child as bait for the killer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe its just me but i see this story a little differently from the other watchers.This is a man so obsessed with his search for a child murderer that he befriends a woman with a child and uses the child as bait for the murderer. That he loves the child is irrelevant to the betrayal.He allows the child to dress in red a color he knows the murderer likes. He even places a swing next to the road so that the murderer will see the child and talk to her. When eventually the weirdo he suspects is the killer stops and chats with her he allows the contact to continue instead of warning the child to ovoid him.The overall movie was fantastic. Especially the photography. One felt the loneliness and vastness of the landscape hiding the grim secrets of the child killer.The sense of loneliness and isolation as he drinks himself away where good. For a brief moment it looked like he had found happiness with the mother and her child until the moment of betrayal.At the end he allows the child to be the bait in a sting operation to get the killer and doesn't even tell the mother. He is so obsessed with his pursuit for the killer he is prepared to risk the child.What was also nice was the simple goodness of the child who believed the killer was a magician and something magical.Also watching Nicholson alone in a boat fishing and just enjoying the vastness of nature where very good scenes indeed. The ending was unexpected and shocking. That Nicholson ends up a crazy drunk all alone is on himself to blame because of his betrayal to the child and the mother.Nicholson always plays slightly seedy strange characters. I think he plays himself. Apart from the shining i don't think i've seen a bad movie from him. This one is well worth watching.</fullReview>

The retired cop, played excellent by Mr Nicholson, finds about the death of the killer from his colleague who also finds out from the old lady. In the book the old lady dies and this is why the secret is released. And also making the criminal look as a preacher isn't such a good thing( this is what the movie says).

		<shortDescription>this is really a remake - or is it a "reimagining" in today's Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Penn has directed a good film with some OK performances, especially Del Toro and Eckhart. Perhaps people who liked this film would like to check out an earlier film called "The Cold Light of Day" with Richard E Grant - if these are not basically the same film then I am a ham sandwich !!!!!In fact if the better elements of both films were combined then you would have one good film. For instance the "pledge" part of the Cold Light of Day happens too soon but the character of the Psychologist friend is well played although it could make you think of children's games in a whole new light. The killer in the Cold Light of Day is fleshed out as a character much more than he is in The Pledge but it still seems uneven and half-done. Also the part of the so-called suspect is very well done by Del Toro who seems to have been in the zone as it were during this period as Traffic was made at about the same time. Also Eckhart plays the cocky, arrogant cop to perfection whereas in the Cold Light none of this characters are really developed to any level of satisfaction for me. However Cold Light does have Richard E Grant and he gets the suitable balance between a caring cop and creepy dude about right.All in all I would recommend both films but for me the Cold Light just about wins due to some nicely shot forest in the Czech Republic (very dark and mysterious) and good performances especially from the little girl, or "victim" which I feel is important as it helps the viewer in caring what happens to her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Black is about to leave the building. His wage-working life has come to an end. Jerry's been a cop for decades in the rural, cowboy, fisherman area near Reno, Nevada. Believe me, Reno is an ugly town, but it is surrounded by great geographical beauty, filmed with fine sense in "The Pledge". Jerry is well respected by his colleagues. He has ended up top cop, chief of police. On his last day of work, he looks impishly ready. Ready to go fishing. His workmates have organized a wonderful surprise party for him on his last afternoon of work, plus they've pooled enough money together to buy him a perfect gift?a fully paid fishing holiday in Baja California.But, as Jerry's last work day is lived, so are the last moments of life for an eight-year old girl, a now brutally murdered member of the community, Jerry has pledged to protect and defend. And so, when the gruesome news is announced at Jerry's retirement gig, he feels that he has one last obligation to fulfill. Chief of police Black has six more hours of his shift to go and as far as Jerry is concerned, he's still honor bound to inspect the scene of the murder.Sean Penn directs a tense film, full of surprises. There is no "Hollywoodized" formula here, designed to fit neatly into your comfort zone. "The Pledge" contains a series of life-like twists and turns, which confront a man of solid integrity with existentially wrenching choices. The plot is peppered so nicely with the everyday mistakes and small triumphs of a man against odds, acting in ways and for things, most others might well give a miss and/or ignore altogether. Jerry is "Shane" turned inside-out, driven mad by the quirky force of circumstance and unwarranted misapprehension of those he cares most about, those who see his inherent decency when it is easy for them to do so, but who are all too easily convinced to cut him loose, to twist in the wind as a pathetic Pagliacci when the going gets complicated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the most important thing in the movie, is ...The Pledge. Jerry Black swears on the custody of his immortal soul that he will find out who is the killer. Jerry does not find the killer, and hence loses his soul. I am a huge fan of Robin Wright Penn from my favorite movie the Princess Bride, so to see her in this movie is great. Jerry makes an oath to find the killer , and there is a theme of how God could allow such devils. As we know there are terrible people and hence God exists to punish them in the afterlife. That is the reason we see the killer burning, but it is not clear who the killer is. I will watch the movie again and write down every license plate, I believe that is the key to finding the killer. Now if I do, and I cannot find the killer, should I be scared of going insane. I did not make a Pledge to find the killer. Sean Penn does a great job of making me think after I saw it.

Tom Noonan as Gary Jackson is a bold move, since he played the serial killer in Manhunter. He does that very well, since he has the ability to make the viewer believe he might be a good guy.

		<fullReview>While I thought there was much about "The Pledge" to appreciate: The homage to "..Cuckoos Nest", (Nicholson's arched eyebrow walking through the 'Solarium' door); homage to "Ransom" (Ron Howard, 1996 - lost balloon at the flea Market), the "Art House" dissolves (a la Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout') of 'Monash County's' relentlessly beautiful flora and fauna; shots through "ripple glass", reflected in mirrors etc.; there were just too many loose ends to justify a positive review. Perhaps these were left on the cutting room floor, but I felt the film's "pledge" was left unfulfilled.Director Penn "promised" the audience that Jerry Black, finding "the killer, would be granted his "Soul's Salvation": a new life with Lori and her daughter Chrissy. The hugely understated scene of his watching a sport fishing infomercial advocating the use of "live bait" to catch "aggressive fish" did not rise to the level of reneging on his part of this Faustian bargain. It was Lori who made the first romantic overtures, undercutting the premise of their relationship as "deep cover".More Nits: the "minutes-ticking-by-to-departure" scene in the airport lounge did not conclude with a forensic epiphany; only a "doesn't feel right" admission to the police chief. When he finally does identify the pattern: "Tall man in black with black car kills little blonde girls wearing a RED DRESS", there is no explanation or background on the killer's pathology, only a mother's admission that he is "waiting (to get married) for the right woman". Neither is there any background on Jerry Black's exemplary career as a detective, just the one line from Stan Krolak as they drive home from the aborted stake-out that, "You should have known Jerry 20 years ago, he was a great cop". (BTW The Isuzu Trooper Nicholson drives is missing the "Rhino Bars" on one of the takes of his mad dash to the church, ostensibly to save Chrissy.)In conclusion I never felt Jerry's fate hanging in the balance between perdition and redemption. While Sean Penn attempted to elicit (from Nicholson) the "Psychotic Spriral into Madness" that he witnessed George C Scott deliver in "Taps" (1981 - Harold Becker), leaving him a drunken storekeeper, slack-jawed and mumbling did not bring a feeling of closure.

		<shortDescription>A disturbing subject brought in a beautiful way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that "The Pledge" is much better than I expected. I thought this would be a cop thriller like Hollywood already made hundreds, but I was wrong. No big explosions, no gun fights, no car chases... This was actually a nice movie. Even though the movie is nice, the subject certainly isn't. It's about a serial killer that kidnaps little girls and kills them somewhere in the woods. For some reason or another, the serial killer always chooses an 8 to 10 year old girl with a red dress. When Jerry Black, a police officer on his last day before his retirement, goes to the parents of the last victim to tell them the horrible news, he pledges on his soul that he'll do anything to find her killer. And he does, but not in a way you might expect. He loves fishing and buys a house in the region where the murders happened. He wins the confidence of a woman who has problems with her husband and after a while she and her little daughter come to live with him. He actually uses the daughter as bait to catch the serial killer, just like if he went fishing...Even though the subject is very disturbing, the movie isn't. Somehow it manages to bring the message in such a way that you can accept it. Thanks to the beautiful surroundings (the landscapes in Nevada are absolutely astonishing), the fragile music (the fragile child's voice sent some shivers down my spine) and the excellent acting by all actors make this movie different from so many others in the genre. It's much more subtle and sober than you might expect. I reward it with an 8/10 for that. It's certainly worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil is not always always obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ponderous film which studies obligation and love via Nicholson's desire to find a child killer. The film depicts the internal struggles of a retired cop and his ultimately risks everything he treasures to prove a point. The film's end is painfully desperate but there is not even teardrop to be seen.I think that the beauty of this film is to be found in the subtle contrasts throughout. It is not only the scenery that is out of keeping with the plot but the representation of love with other motives - this can be seen in the shallowness of the retirement party at the beginning and in almost all of the protagonist's actions thereafter. A thoughtful and well paced film which will delight those who do not alwyas need pyrotechnics or aliens...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promise he shouldn't have made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A curious movie. Really horrible child murders in beautiful setting. Grizzled old Reno, Nevada cop on point of retirement investigates, becomes obsessed. Gets close to cracking the case. Then? It reminded me of 'Insomnia' where Al Pacino's character nearly goes bonkers trying to solve a similar crime, and also of Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter' where Ian Holm plays a lawyer who becomes involved in the aftermath of a horrific school bus accident. Part of the strangeness derives from seeing stock Hollywood characters played by an amazing array of well-known actors fleshing out a script which is decidedly non-Hollywood, being derived from a novel by the Swiss-German writer Friedrich Durrenmatt. The director was Sean Penn, and he gets credit for the rather wry telling of the tale, and some interesting establishing shots, but the film does suffer from slow spots which are not germane to the story. Actually the slow pace probably derives from the story being as much about fishing as criminal investigation. The newly retired Jerry is a keep fly fisherman and his approach to catching murderers owes much to fishing techniques. But when Jerry starts using a live eight-year old as the lure (while having an affair with her mother) it becomes obvious things are going to go wrong. Jack Nicholson is excellent as Jerry and the well-known explosive Nicholson persona is kept well within check. The incipient paranoia of the character is hinted at rather than proclaimed from the treetops, with the aid of some delicate direction. Jack is able to project a character who is ready for retirement and yet can't let go. Police work has ruined his personal life (two failed marriages) and he has nothing else to do except fish.The rest of the cast have relatively minor roles except for Robyn Wright Penn giving a strong performance as the mother and a charming Pauline Roberts as the daughter. Sean Penn has cast so many celebrity actors in minor roles you wonder what's going on - was the whole thing a cover for someone's birthday party? There's Patricia Clarkson as a bereaved mother, Benicio Del Toro as an Indian suspect, Aaron Eckhart as an overconfident cop, Helen Mirren as an unaccountably English doctor in the wilds of Nevada, Vanessa Redgrave as a distraught piano teacher, Harry Dean Stanton, marvelous as a boondocks gas station owner, Mickey Rourke, Sam Shepard and probably others I have missed.There is something innately disturbing about crime in a beautiful natural setting. How can evil lurk in such uplifting countryside (in this case the mountains of British Columbia though no doubt the Swiss Alps featured in the original novel)? The same tension was evident in 'Insomnia' filmed in Alaska and BC from a European (Norwegian) story. In fact backwoods murders are pretty uncommon ? there just aren't that many people out there and the tensions are by and large a lot lower than in urban areas. This of course does not deter our fictional detectives who can produce huge body counts from unlikely places. Inspector Morse found several victims a week in Oxford, where there has been precisely one murder on the campus in the last 50 years. Nevertheless this is a chilling story, if somewhat cumbersomely told, with a very un-Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Cop Thriller from Sean Penn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pledge is a small but interesting film featuring a nicely understated performance from Jack Nicholson and showing considerable promise for the future career of Sean Penn as director. It takes as its framework the conventional story of a retired cop who can't let go of an old case. Jerry Black (Nicholson) is hours from retirement when he comes across a murdered child and makes a promise to the mother that he will track down the "devil" who killed her. After handing his badge in he moves to the remote northwestern state where he has traced a pattern of similar killings. He buys a small gas station and tries to locate the murderer and his distinctive black station wagon.Meanwhile of course his ex-colleagues try to dissuade him. They think he's sliding into alcoholism and madness, and as the film develops the interest revolves around the question of how far Black has retained a grip on reality. In the exhausted, paranoid, driven hero, and its icy northwestern setting, The Pledge strongly resembles Pacino's Insomnia. It's also characterised by a portentous and Mephistophelian atmoshpere reminiscent of Angel Heart.It remains impressive in its own right, though, with a strong central performance, some stunning cinematography, and one or two unforgettable scenes. The denouement is handled with considerable subtlety and is far more impressive (and meaningful) than famous recent "twists" from films like the Sixth Sense.The weaknesses of the film include the glamorous but ineffective supporting cast and an opening scene which, as the critic Jason Solomons argues, is possibly a mistake. Start the movie three or four minutes in and settle down to enjoy an intelligent and well-made thriller that will stay with you.This is a cult movie in the making</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shock-Horror! An Intelligent Hollywood Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best films I've seen in years. Somebody here was complaining that Robin Wright looked "haggard". Well, any 30-something single mother who is working all hours to keep herself and her child looks like that - if you want to see Julia Roberts, go get a Julia Roberts movie! Robin Wright actually looked beautiful to me. That was one of the things that made this film so special - it didn't show made-up, glossed-up Hollywood stars, but real people; the stars all had their make-up scraped off, showing their real skin. And the story had that same real, raw quality as well - it didn't go the way you were expecting it to. Which is so true of life! So what if it wasn't a standard police procedural/thriller with a car-chase and a shoot-out, and the bad guy in cuffs and the good guy and his woman kissing at the end? There are plenty of those type of movies around already for those that want them. This was something different and wholly original. It defied the usual Hollywood stereotypes and actually made you think. Sean Penn is to be congratulated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive film that defies expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a powerful, fascinating film.Obviously there are people who didn't like it. Oh well. Different tastes. But I think a lot of the people who hated this film are folks who came into it with specific expectations (that it would follow the formula of a detective-looking-for-the-killer story) and who were disappointed when it evolved into something different. As for me, that's one of the reasons I liked it ... when a film confounds your expectations, it keeps you on your toes.Presumably you already know the basics of the plot by now, but if all you know is "Jack Nicholson plays a retired detective who is determined to solve a crime that others consider to be already closed," then at least understand this much: This isn't a "whodunnit," but rather, a character study.Nicholson is brilliant in a complex, understated performance. The supporting cast is fantastic, especially Robin Wright and Aaron Eckhart. The screenplay is strong, and Sean Penn's direction is confident and effective. Nicholson and the screenplay take his character in a dark, unexpected direction, and the conclusion of the film, which is radically different that what most people would expect, is heartbreaking and thoughtful.A very good movie, but not for someone who is expecting to see car chases, gun battles and a formulaic ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should've Promised Something Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My impression of Sean Penn is that everything he can get his filthy little hands on turns to crap. I think he is a no-talent hack that just lucked out in Hollywood. I was especially disappointed in Benicio Del Toro in what seemed to be his worst performance to date as his retarded person was horrible. He just didn't convey the messages in the same manner that a mentally challenged man would and all he really did for the role was change his voice pattern...big whoop! I usually like him too. This was a bad role for Jack Nicholson as well since it didn't seem to challenge him at all and he basically just walked through the movie aimlessly. Perhaps his next pledge should be to steer clear of doing garbage like this in the future. I for one would be much more satisfied with that than any killers he could catch. The movie was depressing for no reason and the ending sucked. The only actor I think did well was Mickey Rourke which was a surprise since his new movies usually suck. But he had a somewhat powerful performance. It's a boring film and isn't even a real detective movie so don't expect much from it at all.Final Bore:Movies: I would've left before it finished I think.DVD Purchase: No way no how!Rental: If you have no life then by all means!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful and sensitive tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught the last 2/3 of the movie, and became immediately involved in each character. The movie is very real, as are all the characters, and the setting. I cared immediately for the characters, and was shocked and hurt at the ending: we moviegoers are like God, omniscient because we see it all, and I wanted to intervene and rescue Jack Nicholson's character and preserve the family he was beginning to form. In real life, of course, tragedies such as these occur all the time. I think Jack Nicholson is amazing, and I particularly admired the scene with Helen Mirren, who is also an unusual find. The film was also visually very beautiful and expertly edited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpredictable thriller, beautifully realized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ending of this movie, of which we see glimpses in the beginning, is an example of the sort of cosmic irony that some world-renown writers apply to human affairs. It is not the sort of thing usually seen in a movie of course, since the mass mind at which most movies are directed will find it dissatisfying, even irritating.The world-renowned author responsible for the ending of this tale of a retired cop on the trail of a serial killer of blond little girls in red dresses is none other than Swiss novelist and playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt who wrote the novel from which the screen play was adapted.The "pledge" in the title is that of just-retiring Reno, Nevada cop Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) who is not convinced that a confession by a mentally-disturbed Native American, played convincingly by Benicio Del Toro, is genuine. Jerry Black gives his word to the mother of the murdered little girl that he will find the killer. However, he is no longer on the force and gets only intermittent help from his colleagues who think he has gone a little daffy. Nicholson, as usual, totally becomes the character he is playing and gives an outstanding performance. He is assisted by Aaron Eckhart who plays the detective who got the "confession," and by Robin Wright Penn who plays Lori, the mother of another little girl.The direction by Sean Penn is uncluttered, focused and visually astute. For example, note the way the little girl playing in the swings between the highway and the gas station affects our expectation of what is to come. Penn also captures well the high country atmosphere around Reno, Nevada and attendant lifestyles, and for the most part keeps his auteur ambitions secondary to the telling of the story. The script by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski is artistically true with crisp, direct dialogue and a fine dramatic structure. The film is also nicely cut so that everything is clear without any belaboring of the obvious. Some of the set scenes as Jerry Black interviews the grandmother of the slain little girl (Vanessa Redgrave in a cameo) and then a psychiatrist (..., who is just perfect in her experienced skepticism) are very well done. Most importantly though, Penn did not give in to those who would demand a commercial ending over an artistic one. And for this he paid the price, since this film was not well-received by the mass audience.Of course it is impossible to discuss the ending without giving away too much, but I think we can safely say that in real life sometimes chance and fate (if you will) step in and change things dramatically which makes us see our limitations and realize that some of what happens to us is beyond our control. I think that is what happened to Jerry Black and Lori; yet notice, too, that it is integral to Jerry Black's character and all that he has been all his life for him to make the insensitive mistake that he does.Incidentally the ending can be fixed in a sequel... Well, that is not likely to happen since this was NOT a box office success. Only box office successes get to be sequels--which somehow (bizarrely) reminds me of the line from the old Charlie the Tuna TV commercial: "Only good-tasting tunas get to be Starkist."For those who are wondering who really did kill the little girls, I will give you a hint: he got his just deserts in a symbolically appropriate manner.Bottom line: a fine artistic achievement, an excellent diversion, and a treat for those who are fed up with films that play out in a tiresome, predictable manner.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>A pandering "thriller" that aims squarely at the 55+ audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film received some great reviews, but I just don't get it. Sure, it's got Nicholson going for it, and there's a great scene with Benicio del Toro. To be fair, I had an inkling going into the theater that its main audience would probably comprise senior citizens- Jack's getting pretty old, though his acting hasn't deteriorated- but 45 minutes into the movie I was fed up with it.The simple premise- retiring detective makes an oath that he will find a vicious child murderer- is grounds for a subtle thriller. Instead, the film plays up the atrocity of the crime poorly, as if it's expecting us to say, "Wow! A child-molesting murderer! This movie has got guts delving into such an unimaginably repulsive taboo! Whoever the killer is, that man must be PURE EVIL!" As Jack tracks down some clues, the aged detective also shacks up with a foxy thirty- or fortysomething single mom and her adorable kid. Without giving anything away, the revelation of the killer's identity isn't much of a surprise, since so few supporting characters develop a personality, and although we're supposed to be even further shocked and disgusted, I was simply disgusted by the film's pandering clumsiness.Leave this on the shelf at the nursing home- it'll scare the pants off some unsuspecting septuagenarian. Now go rent Lang's "M", a vastly superior film that achieved exponentially more than this blunder in 1931.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long and boring, this movie had was a huge disappointment. There were many scenes that could have been shorter and made the movie more watchable, such as the retirement party, and Jack Nicholson's scoping out of the small town and buying property, and the scenes with his new family. Very very dull. A lot of this could have been implied and more time given to the details of the criminal's exploits. Jack Nicholson's character was a pathetic old drunk who could have been redeemed, but just ended up a complete loser in the end. If it wasn't for the amusing scene with Benecio Del Toro, I'd rate this movie a 1. Benecio plays a great crazyman, so the other 2 points are for his bit part!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie that should be incredibly good, is incredibly bad. Why?First, it isn't honest about where it wants to take the story. Is there a killer out there? Then make it a decent procedural. Is it all in the Nicholson character's head? Then what are the flashes of the guy with the "porcupines" (which looked like hedgehogs to me).The clichéd use of Tom Noonan, who has been playing serial killers since Manhunter (1986), including in one X-Files episode.The police being blundering idiots or disinterested in their jobs is one of the devices you are told to avoid, because it is lazy.Why does Robin Wright-Penn look so haggard? What was the entire purpose of Benicio del Toro's role?This could have been a great movie about a very disturbing theme, but somehow Sean Penn doesn't have the chops to make a truly suspenseful police procedural. Leave that to Michael Mann and Jonathan Demme instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film goes through the motions in a straightforward manner, going from one cliche to another. The cop on a mission that the policeforce don't understand (how very 1980s); the little girl who's feared lost only to be found on a swing in order to show the growing sense of paranoia; the cop growing close to a family with a child the same age as the one who was murdered in order to personalise the experience; etc, etc, blah, blah, blah, haven't we all been here a hundred times before?! The pace is slow, the story predictable, the plot has been done to death a million times over, and the dialogue is nothing special. The only saving grace is Nicholson's performance, which is very good. Onto the direction - it isn't artistic but it is also not very well hidden, in fact it finds a middle ground that just doesn't work. It's clear Penn is trying to make a point with his direction, but his technique is just not good enough to convey it effectively or to add to the film in a constructive way. That said, the scene with the turkeys used interesting cinematography. The message of the film is clear though: obsession is as dangerous as the crime it's trying to prevent. Hitchcock convinced us of this in Rear Window, Penn fails to do so in The Pledge.</fullReview>

Children's drawing are often used in kindergartens and grade schools to help psychologist discover the student's problems:Penn made no mistake when he made the drawing the center of the drama.Penn is a great director when it comes to make his stars give their best: a jaded Nicholson ,far from the handsome figure we used to know or his wife Robin Wright Penn .But three actors ,in parts never exceeding four or five minutes,stand out:Vanessa Redgrave ,in the victim's grandma part,whose voice falters in her last worlds;Mickey Rourke,on the verge of tears,in a mental hospital;and Helen Mirren,studying the drawing and realizing something goes wrong with Nicholson and uttering the line above.Unlike the serial killers movies directors,Penn shows compassion for the dead ... and for the living too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I had not read the book, on which the movie is based, I did get the feeling however that I knew the story and discovered that, years ago, I had seen a German or Austrian version, whatever, entitled "It Happened in Broad Daylight" with Gert Fröbe or Mr Goldfinger for you younger fans. Maybe it was this fact that prompted me to watch "The Pledge" with a somewhat critical attitude.As the story was familiar, I concentrated on what Sean Penn had added to the original plot. Very little, I am sorry to say.The story evolves well up to a certain point and then seems to stagnate as if there was a degree of hesitation as to how to define the climax.I still can't figure out what all those outstanding actors really added to the context by their very short appearances on the screen. Jack Nicholson acts very well and as he gets older or "ripens" as one could say, he radiates that rich personality which can easily be compared to that of an exceptionally good vintage port.I could hardly contain a laugh however when he arrived at the church and swung open the doors: I was reminded in a flash of that unforgettable scene in "The Witches of Eastwick" (Nicholson's best performance ever!). As to the ending: well, let us accept that the body in the burnt out car was that of the murderer, although, in the scene were the black car nears the approaching truck, the speed was visibly so slow that one wonders how that could have contributed to a fatal accident.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible ending mars this suspense thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate movies like this. I mean, I really hate movies like this.For nearly two hours, you're convinced you're watching a suspense thriller. And then, for no good reason, the director throws you a curveball and you're left there feeling stupid for having just wasted two hours.Jack Nicholson plays Jerry Black, a retired police detective in Reno, who catches a murder case on his last day on the job. A little girl has been brutally murdered up in the mountains. He shows up on the scene, volunteers to tell the parents the news, and then winds up promising the mother (the pledge in the title) to find her little girl's killer. Police pick up some retarded Indian with a record, he's coerced into giving a confession, and then he kills himself. Case closed. Right? Black suspects they've got the wrong man and soon finds out that there have been two other girls killed or missing in the area over the last eight years who fit the same description as this last one. His old buddies at the station don't want to help him - they think he's losing it - so he decides to honor his promise and find the real killer himself.The premise is good and Nicholson is fine as the detective on a mission, but the film doesn't bring us the ending we want. We're pointed in certain suspects' direction - is it Tom Noonan, the tall preacher who likes little girls, or is it the mysterious Wizard? *** SPOILERS ***But, just as the story winds to its climax and Black is in position on a stakeout to catch the guy as he's about to meet the daughter of the woman he's living with, the movie suddenly becomes all about him. There's a crash on the highway and it appears that the stalker is killed in a head-on collision with a logging truck. Who was it? You never see because he's burnt to a crisp. Black's stakeout team alerts the mother that her daughter's been used as bait and she storms into the park and takes her away.The movie ends with Nicholson drinking from a bottle of hootch and mumbling to himself in front of the gas station he owns, which looks as rundown and abandoned as he does. So, the two hours of murder mystery was all a ruse, the real point of the film was to chronicle Nicholson's deteriorating mental condition and descent into alcoholism. I like surprise endings, but they should be in the context of the film, and this one wasn't. Very unsatisfying and an insult to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the trappings of a great film. Nicholson. Harry Dean Stanton. Sam Shepard. Great location. Classic film noir! Ahhhh! No! I was goofy enough to believe, that this was a can't-miss combination and watched it from terrific beginning and slow-paced middle, to agonizing, predictable ending. The bottom fell out, twenty minutes into the film.Seeing a man with Jack Nicholson's acting ability, wasted on this meatball, was a real downer. Funny thing is, if I saw that lineup of actors again,I'd watch it without thinking twice! The Pledge, what a rotter! All that being said, Jack Nicholson remains one of my favorite actors and anyone else, in that part, would probably have done worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that begins in the same vain as other murder mysteries, slowly develops into something more; a much deeper study into one mans psyche as he spirals into paranoia and depression. You will soon find that your mind begins no longer to wonder who the killer is, but begins to think more about Jack Nicholson's character (Jerry Black) and his motives. Black is a detective who, on the day of his retirement, takes one last case - the murder of a young girl. On the same day he promises the parents of this girl that he will find the killer. This promise will haunt the man for the rest of his life and, unsurprisingly (given the title), the film is centred around Black's search for the killer. However, it is not a simple, formulaic plot about car chases, hidden clues, Hollywood pizazz and an easy revelation at the end of it all. The story is handled masterfully by Sean Penn who manages to create tension and suspense while presenting us with a character we both care and worry for. The film becomes more about Jerry Black than about the search for the killer.This is one of Nicholson's best performances for quite some time and with a slight look at the camera, he is able to provide us with greater insight into his character (something lesser actors strive all their career to accomplish). What we are seeing is one of the greatest actors of all time, at his best. Like in About Schmidt, Nicholson gives us a subdued, understated performance - both much better than what he won an Oscar for in 'As Good As It Gets.'Now, on to Sean Penn. This is only his third film to date as director and is also his best. Penn has previously said that he would rather be a director than an actor. If this were true, although we would lose one of our generations best actors, we would also gain a great director. He manages to handle the material brilliantly and provides us with a stylish and thoughtful film. By the end, the revelation of who is the killer becomes overshadowed by Nicholson's decent into paranoia, alcoholism and eventually madness (something more expertly done than in The Shining - a much overrated film, in my opinion). He loses the people he cares for and his oldest and dearest friends begin to call him a 'clown.' He becomes so obsessed with the search for the killer he makes decisions that would put people he loved in harms way - using a young girl as bait, for example. This is not the portrayal of a great man nor does it have a happy ending. But, it is the portrayal of a man who has the right intentions and of a man who wants to see justice served.For those that care, I gave this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholson here extends on his recent mature everyman roles to play a man utterly devoid of charisma or personality. Recently retired Detective Jerry Black is a figure animated only by his vocational drive and a morbid and eventually destructive need to fulfil the promise he has made to the mother of a murdered 8 year-old girl. We learn small details of his life such as his two failed marriages and his love of fishing but it is made clear that there is very little to the man except his job. He is another in the actor's long line of characters in search of self-definition and redemption although we never learn from what. He is cut from the same cloth as searchers and lost figures such as Melvin Udall and R.P. McMurphy , but performance, direction and film are in a more minor key. The Pledge is a film strong on atmosphere and short on detail. It is shot through with continuity problems. In the cold Nebraska weather, some characters have frost on their breath while others do not, people start smoking in the middle of scenes without lighting up, Helen Mirren appears giving advice on psychology although we never find out who the hell she is, and crucially the film chooses not to reveal the girls killer leaving the audience to draw what conclusions it can from the film's heavy fairytale symbolism. Having said that The Pledge is redeemed by Nicholson's quiet and restrained performance as a man trying to do the right thing and not knowing why. His encroaching madness is revealed by small verbal slips and director Sean Penn's blurring and repetition of everyday images. There is no hint, as there is in any other Jack Nicholson film that the mask could at any moment be lifted and `Jack' will appear in some wild outburst of anger or magnetism.Even in the centre of the film, when he is playing the family man to a battered wife and her young daughter, he is not the swaggering patriarch we are used to but a man as moved as the child is by the stories he reads to her. Briefly he is a genuinely contented retiree, but the moment he starts to engage in the case he has come to crack he is pitched into a world, possibly imaginary, with which he can no longer deal.There are a string of well acted cameos, which are variously touching (Vannessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke), some upsetting (Benicio Del Torro), others indicative of the condescension with which older people are treated (Mirren, Sam Shepard). The film deals with the theme of child related crime in an oblique way. Possibly because to deal with it directly would involve putting a genuine extended portrait of a paedophile or child-killer on the screen. This is certainly not the film to do that, it deals with the issue purely in terms of others reaction to the events. All characters are naturally outraged by the original murder but in an unarticulated way. The police are quick to frame a conviction and Black willingly hands his life and sanity over to the pursuit of the real killer. Would this have been the case had the victim not been a child. There is therefore a touch of tabloid panic bubbling away beneath the murky ambiguities of the plot and the sepia-tint of much of the photography. One cannot help but admire the moral courage and self-sacrifice of the movies central character but its passivity and emphasis on decency means the film is ultimately a missed opportunity. Engaging, even briefly, in the mentality of the murderer would have made the film an even greater indictment of the type of crime it deals with,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading most of the reviews here, I don't understand what everyone's *beef* is. Ok, so this was a remake; so what. This is new movie version, so stop trying to pick this film apart. I never saw the original, nor read the book, but I felt this was an excellent film. The plot is basic; a cop "pledges" to a parent of a child who was murdered, that he will find the killer. He swears his soul to it. After Nicholson's character believes that the wrong man was arrested, he decides to reopen the case himself. Now, this is where the movie shines. There are numerous actors who appear in the film for a mere minute or two, but in memorable roles. In my opinion, the stand out is Mickey Rourke. A few reviewers actually *made fun* of his crying? Give me a break, people! For once, Mr. Rourke plays a very sympathetic character who had lost his daughter to the same killer. I only wished he had more screen time. I don't want to give away the story/spoilers, but Nicholson's character gives too much of his life into this case, &amp; the outcome for him is sad. Since he never arrested/killed the suspect, did he lose his soul? Or did he just go mad? With many movies, different people have different takes. This one is worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To see Jack Nicholson's work in this film is to witness why he remains the most potent superstar of his era. Sure, he probably didn't deserve an Oscar for playing such an obvious "character" in "As Good As It Gets," but here he's as good as he's ever been.The premise of the film -- retiring cop takes one last job -- may sound routine, but the performances and direction elevate the material to something almost surreal and since the film is more interested in behaviour than plot, the film achieves a level of greatness. The editing and camerawork in the film, as well as the music, work together beautifully and aid the viewer in becoming fully engrossed with Nicholson's character. The script has some moments of brilliance, and even the regular thriller moments are handled superbly -- we never see it coming. (If you're a fan of emotional cliffs, you're in luck).The film is peppered with familiar faces -- Mirren, Redgrave, Rourke, Del Toro, Eckhart, Shepard -- but it isn't until afterward that we realize what a short time most of them are onscreen for. Nicholson's character is the center of the film and we are so drawn into him that the supporting players become peripheral. Some of the acting, such as Rourke's, is not easy to watch. I've always believed that there's a fine line between great and terrible acting, and a few of the actors -- Del Toro and Rourke, especially -- straddle the line without ever crossing onto the wrong side. With Nicholson we are in the hands of an old master in one of his best roles, well, ever. To see that this film is rated only 7.0/10 is a travesty.I haven't seen Penn's other two movies, but I will seek them out now. The performances in the film are relentless in their power, as is the film. There is only one moment where the film takes an awkward misstep, but the scene directly after it gets us right back on track.I can't remember the last "thriller" (and I use the term very loosely) that had such an impact on me. That's such a lame thing to say, but throughout I felt as if my mind was stretching and there was more than one moment where I was left gasping. If you can receive on its frequency, "The Pledge" is a harsh, stressful work. And we need more of those.The film is like a continual punch in the gut without being in any way exploitative. In its own ways -- and it's very much its own film -- it reminded me of "Affliction," "Dead Man Walking," "The Sweet Herafter" and "The Thin Red Line". This is one of the****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: Spoilers ahead! THE PLEDGE is by far one of the best films I've seen. Not many thrillers in this style have been brave enough to let a 'good guy' fail so horribly, yet this one does and still concludes the story! (ie: Tom Noonan's demise) Penn's moods are not only depressing but also tense and alluring. At first I passed it off as just another Penn-Nicholson tearjerk drama, (ie: The Crossing Guard)but I have to say this film grew on me! However, this film is not for everyone, and I don't mean that the violence is too graphic, or the language is too strong, I mean not everyone will like this picture because many people like to root for the hero! However, this film does not make you boo the hero, it makes you genuiney feel sorry for him! All the performances were incredibly good, except for that of Mickey Rourke. I've seen better weeping from worse actours. I need not say how wonderfully obsessed the hero is, and I need not say how frightening Tom Noonan can be. But there were a few surprising artists I found to be quite believable, like the characters portrayed by Benicio Del Toro and Aaron Eckhart. Heh I can't really compose a great review, but all can say is, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE GIVE IT A CHANCE! If you haven't seen it, see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you need confirmation that some parts of life are indeed depressing look no further than this psychological thriller. The Pledge is a very good film that will leave you not feeling very good after having seen it - there is almost no sunshine in this movie, literally and figuratively. There are more than a few strands to this film, and which ones are significant can be left to the individual viewer; one or two seem a bit heavy-handed, while others are so subtle as to almost pass unnoticed. You may find The Pledge boring, or it may put you through wringer of emotions, especially in your rush to judgement. A superb film, but not a happy one.It is eye-opening to notice how many reviewers on these pages take gratuitous swipes at Americans, especially inasmuch as this is an American web site and that the director and most actors in The Pledge are American. It is undoubtedly true that due to the huge reach of American media - film, television, and the internet, itself - other peoples of the world know much more about America than Americans can ever know about them; but would the average viewer in Manchester or Melbourne appreciate The Pledge more? To those who actually think they can appreciate The Pledge much more than their counterparts in America I can only say that they seem to have missed the whole point of this excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very non-American movie, and reading some of the other viewers comment I cannot stop remarking that the US audiences may not get it. The film is very true to the ambiguity and twisted logic of Durrennmatt, by I wonder how well known and understood the great Swiss writer is in the US. The story of a retired cop, looking for the killer of the girl in his last case turns in a story of obsession, or maybe is it a story of seeking happiness? Is the policemen as guilty as the criminal? The right to judge, and the fact that jurors and accused do not necessarily stand on different sides of the moral chasm is a very European theme as well.The movie is superbly acted - Jack Nicholson is better than ever, and a plethora of more or less actors play memorable acts. Yes, this is not a well-paced film as Hollywood does, it may be a little melodramatic sometimes - but overall a good cinema experience. 8/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First-rate thriller and 64 year old Nicholson's sensational performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point of his career the good old Jack Nicholson just simply doesn't have to proof anything to anybody. He is already one of the biggest, finest, greatest and the most charismatic, impressive, ingenious and gifted blokes of the cinema history - god among actors. "Easy rider", "Chinatown", "One flew over the cuckoo's nest", "The Shining", "Prizzi's honor", "A Few good men", "Hoffa" and so on and so on. Movie classics that speak for themselves.He has done it all. However, Nicholson still does it at the age of 64 like everybody who's seen "The Pledge" can witness. Four years after his sensational Oscar awarded performance in marvelous "As good as it gets" Nicholson comes back with a gripping and stylish first-rate thriller and another stirring performance. He's not the only good actor of "The Pledge", though. For example Benicio Del Toro makes one of his heaviest roles alongside Dr. Gonzo in "Fear and loathing in Las Vegas.The story of "The Pledge" is actually rather typical. Rigid and laconic veteran cop Jerry Black is about to retire but he takes this one last case that eventually drives him to realize the darkness of the world and the abysses of his own mind. Typical or not, this is a classic story that always seems to work. In my review of "The Crossing guard" I presumed that it's perhaps the best one of Sean Penn's three directions. That was after I saw "The Pledge", so I guess I have something new to tell you...</fullReview>

When Jack interviews a little girl and finds out the killed girl had received porcupines from a giant, it hit me that I had seen the movie about ten years ago - in german. Since I knew how it would end (although I was still surprised!) I could fully enjoy the acting, filming and use of foreshadowing. I guess "not much" happens in the movie.

		<shortDescription>Powerful Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This moody, brooding character study examines how intuition born of a lifetime's work can lead to unhealthy obsession, the effects of which, in the end, can ultimately render the basis for it irrelevant, especially when particular circumstances are introduced that serve to derail the initial focus and prevent the possibility of a tenable resolution. `The Pledge,' directed by Sean Penn, is an incisive, probing drama of a driven man who is psychologically and emotionally incapable of letting go of an event that-- in his mind, at least-- remains unresolved. And it explores that aspect of human nature that, in certain individuals, at any rate, refuses to allow disregard of even a perceived infraction of justice; it's a matter of being imbued with a kind of innate moral code and being obliged to follow it-- regardless of where it may lead.Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) of the Reno P.D. has come to the end of an illustrious career; it's time to pull the pin and go fishing. But Jerry's retirement party is interrupted by the report of the brutal murder of a young girl, whose body has just been found in the woods. Officially, Jerry only has six hours left on the clock, but he insists on being a part of the investigation. And it's a decision that is ultimately going to have a decided effect on the rest of his life; not only because of the heinousness of the crime, which creates the kind of image that will forever haunt even a seasoned professional like Jerry, but because Jerry makes a promise to Margaret Larsen (Patricia Clarkson), the bereaved mother of the murdered girl, that the individual responsible will be found and brought to justice. Jerry's life takes an irreversible turn, however, when a suspect is apprehended and charged with the crime, but prevailing circumstances and Jerry's intuition lead him to believe they have the wrong man. By the cold light of the next morning, though, Jerry is retired, and the case is no longer his concern; but justice, and the promise he made to the girl's mother still is, and whether he wants it or not, Jerry's involvement with this case is going to follow him into retirement. No matter where he goes or what he does, it will always be a part of him, a constant companion. And sooner or later, it's something that is going to have to be resolved, with or without the help and resources of the department to which he dedicated so much of his life. One way or another, Jerry-- responding to some subconscious impetus-- is going to solve this case, and he's going to do it his way, and to his satisfaction. Until then, in his mind anyway, this case is still `open,' and will remain so, until he deems otherwise and the forces compelling him at last subside. And leave him in peace.As an actor, Sean Penn has demonstrated a range and depth of emotion that at times fairly implodes (as with his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet in `Dead Man Walking'), and with such strength that the outward reverberations of it have a decided impact on the film. And his subtle approach as a director has the same effect here. His studied presentation and deliberate pace creates an underlying tension that runs through the film like a wire being slowly drawn tighter and tighter until it is taut to the point of breaking, and his hand is constantly on that wire, controlling it-- allowing it some slack to effect a false sense of security, for example, before snapping! it back again, and making the drama of the story riveting in a way that definitely keeps the attention of the audience. He attaches you to Jerry Black as he quietly leads him through a field of emotional land mines, and it keeps you involved; indeed, as a viewer, you have no choice, and like Jerry, you have no respite from the situation, which enables you to relate to Jerry on a very personal level. And that connection is reinforced further by Jerry's involvement with a single mother, Lori (Robin Wright Penn), a waitress at a local diner; and as their friendship evolves, Penn twists that wire even more, and the tension escalates. This is commendable work by Penn, who has taken a basically good story (the screenplay is by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski, based on the book by Friedrich Durrenmatt) to a higher level and turned it into a penetrating, insightful drama.The combination of Penn and Jack Nicholson makes for an effective collaboration, in that Nicholson approaches his character, Jerry, with that same sense of reflective introspection that Penn brings to the film as director. And it works splendidly; Nicholson creates a character who is always seemingly on the edge, and you can feel that ever present tension and sense of discontent that defines who Jerry really is and what he's all about. On a certain level, Nicholson's portrayal is reminiscent in attitude and perspective of the character he created so memorably in `Ironweed,' Francis Phelan. This is a guy who plays the game of life with a perpetual poker face on; he maintains a reserved countenance that belies the constant roiling going on behind his eyes. And the fact that Nicholson can convey all of this so well, even in his (or Jerry's) most guarded moments, is what makes his performance so powerful and convincing. He plays it entirely from the inside out, and the result is an absorbing, unforgettable character.The supporting cast includes Benicio Del Toro (Wadenah), Vanessa Redgrave (Annalise), Sam Shepard (Eric), Aaron Eckhart (Sam), Mickey Rourke (Jim) and Tom Noonan (Gary). Sean Penn has a way of telling a story that is uniquely his own, and it's that distinction that sets `The Pledge,' apart and makes it so engaging. This isn't a `throw-away popcorner,' but one you're going to want to mull over for awhile after the screen has gone dark. 8/10.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, contemplative thriller with religious overtones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`I made a promise Eric. You're old enough to remember when it meant something'?The Pledge', downbeat and slow moving, inevitably divides viewers probably used to a different sort of crime movie. A remake of an earlier film by Ladislao Vajda (?Es Geschah am Helllichten Tag' /`It Happened In Broad Day Light' (1958)), from a novel by Durenmatt, Penn's third feature is both his finest to date, as well as that rarest of commodities in American cinema: a contemplative thriller. It also marks to return to form of Jack Nicholson who, after a number of disappointing appearances, creates a vivid and moving portrait of retiring, alcoholic cop (Jerry Black) with one last brutal murder to solve. Like the itch on Jerry's ankle which opens and closes the film, the killing of the little girl is something which Black finds continuously nagging. He's an amateur angler, a man at the very end of his working life, promised a retirement fishing trip to Mexico by his colleagues. Later he promises on his `soul's salvation' to find the Larsen child's killer. Either way, like a fisher of men, Black ends up waiting for the right ?catch', whether marlin or murderer. Perhaps the presumably twice-married, now separated detective feels that his remaining life needs commitment and a purpose. His motives for taking his last case, his investing so much in the dogged pursuit of the truth, are otherwise unclear. His sincerity pledged to the victim's mother, and the troth sworn on the dead girl's straw crucifix, makes Black's investigative obsession suggestive of a religious quest - as does the grandmother's tearful story of the angels, and his own straight-faced confirmation to the mother that `there are such devils'. Add the birds (?angels) wheeling around Black's head as he stumbles and drinks, his blundering into the church service held by the suspect Jackson, the child at the picnic ground singing `The Bible tells me so' etc, and clear spiritual parallels are at work. Of course the final, shocking scene, with the ravaged detective mouthing his convictions to the air is a bleak one. It suggests of a loss of faith, if not in God, certainly in himself. But the Christian philosophy is that of good works done in secret, with no hope of earthly reward. Black is unaware of his ?success' and has sacrificed his last chance at mortal happiness. Like God the viewer, at least, is privileged to know the truth. The bleakness is not as it first seems.As Black's belated chief suspect, Jackson's appearance unfortunately telegraphs likely guilt to any cine literate audience. The actor Tom Noonan, playing Jackson, has had several villainous parts in his career. He earlier played the demented killer Francis Dollarhyde in Mann's frightening ?Manhunter' (1986), as well as the parody villain in McTiernan's ?Last Action Hero' (1993). Its only because other concrete elements of the case remain tantalisingly unresolved at the end that this one unimaginative casting decision proves less damaging.Black's retirement at the start of the movie, intelligently intercut with the discovery of the body, recalls that of Inspector Prendergast in ?Falling Down' (1993). Like Black, Prendergast is in the last hours of employment with the force. Like him too, his insights on a new case are treated impatiently by his successors and superiors. ?The Pledge' features a cop who has made his pledge to a victim's mother while ?Falling Down' a detective who has promised his wife to retire gracefully. Black's decline more distressing because he has sacrifices the chance of what little happiness he finds, to solve a case. In a further parallel, ?Falling Down's final scene shows Prendergast's ultimate self assertion, perhaps reconsidering plans for early retirement. Black's end is of despair and isolation, talking to himself outside of the dilapidated diner..It is interesting to consider whether the hero is a victim of fate or circumstance. Is Black's final misery foreordained, or just the result of an unlucky accident? Part of the problem lies in how we view the character of a man who can be his own worst enemy. Like the miniature porcupines offered by the murderer to his young victim, Nicholson's cop is a prickly, independently minded creature. More explicitly, Penn frames the action of the film between scenes of Black's obvious mental confusion, making mental ambiguity a point of narrative reference. Beside the hero, there is the indian Wadenah (the original suspect in the case), as well as the presumed disturbance of the real killer to contend with. Nicholson's performance is superb, his character alternating between crusty, confused, and convinced. As his ex-colleagues point out, his retreat into obsessive retirement affects his ability to stay objective. For much of the film he is working `on a hunch', relying on circumstantial evidence at best. Past experience of such scenarios suggests that such long shots tend to work out correct, but of course we can never be sure. As a disinterested third party, the profiler/doctor whom he visits (Helen Mirren) certainly has her doubts. She questions in turn his chain smoking, sexual dysfunctionalism, and his distinction between reality and fantasy. Black's abstention from sexual relations, whether forced or not (until he hesitantly embraces Lori) is in stark contrast to the interview of Wadenah by Detective Krolak. Less of an interrogation than an act of sexual humiliation, Krolak's work is profoundly uncomfortable for Black, on a personal and professional level. One senses that Black is a man who is awkward with intimacy ? a further example of his ?disengagement' from normal human relations. The fact that he is willing to sacrifice a possible family of his own just to close the case, says it all. Ultimately, while Krolak reaffirms his status by an aggressive invasion of another's personal space, inducing a confession, Black, broken by what he perceives as private and professional failure, retreats further into himself. The result is a frightening film, dark and adult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst films i have ever seen. It does involve some interesting gestures by the tic-ridden ham Nicholson in the direction of "acting", but unfortunately these finish when he opens his mouth. (Is that a Nevada accent? Or is that the way Jack speaks in every film he has ever made, no matter what part he is playing, in whatever country, age, or universe it is set, and whether it be corporeal or supernatural?)The plot is some of the most wretched mechanical product ever, embroidered with extra nastiness, from the genre of rubbish-about-serial killers.It contains the line, "He was a good cop. He was a damn good cop."The nadir of Hollywood. Perhaps saves itself through not having one of those adjective+abstract noun titles, "Unreconstructed Nonsense". But then it does include the "there's a little boy playing/ oh vicious murder!" cliche, so maybe not. Photography is OK for 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: not bad, but really a drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an action movie buff with, frankly, little tolerance for dramas that become melancholy or that require some film schooling to appreciate the nuances.But I quite enjoyed "The Pledge", which has some arty in it -- notably the spectacular performance of Jack Nicholson, whom its nice to see playing a regular guy. The film is neither slow-paced nor melancholy, and it reminded me of "Pay it Forward", where the excellent acting conveys a lot of emotion without these long drawn-out scenes as in "Forrest Gump".The film is really a drama with some suspense, not an action movie. So I can't recommend it to pure action types who only enjoy a film when stuff blows up every moment. And, without giving anything away, I found the ending unsatisfying -- like the movie is trying to say something deep, but isn't sure what that deep thing is.Who should see this film:-- Suspense movie buffs with a tolerance for arty and don'tmind that the plot isn't Hollywood Generic. Or on a rainyday with nothing better to do.-- Drama / arty types who won't mind that there's a little gorein the film. And -- maybe I missed it -- there is no deep theme.I'll give "The Pledge" a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholic beauty in a horrifying frame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn the director of this film has grown a lot in my eyes from the days I first saw him as an actor. It turns out that he has a sharp sense for the humanistic factor. This movie is about a melancholic lonely detective at a turning point in his life that is retirement when a horrifying child murder occurs in his jurisdiction. He is the only one who can muster the courage to deliver the news to the parents and from then on he is fixated to this case in spite of retirement. The mother and the granny have deep emotional effect on him and the former one, in a state of grief, dares him to make a pledge to find the murderer, which he does, like in a trance. This is somewhat unusual and perhaps unlikely in reality from a experienced detective but it underscored the unusual horror of the case even in the eyes of "seen it all" professionals. The weakest performance was perhaps from the mother, since it could have been more dramatic, given the circumstances and the importance of that scene in the movie. Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is nothing less than spectacular and he is very convincing as this melancholic, altruistic detective who doesn't have any clear purpose of life after retirement other than to try to fulfill his pledge. He never uses his famous "grin" and reveals only a miniature of his joyful side with a subtle wave of a eyebrow in one scene. His connection to the daughter of Robin Wright Penn's character is very convincing and makes the key "relationship" in the movie. The end is simply brilliant although ironic, but sorry, this is how many of real life's mysteries end. No Hollywood ending here. Like with so many movies that have a slow humanistic pace this one did not get its proper chance at the box office and it was out of theaters before I could take a turn. I was disappointed in seeing it as a DVD edition because the Wisconsin scenery is very beautiful. Hans Zimmer's musical score and the great trail of supporting actors made this film even a greater one. I give it 8.5-9.0/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive character study and metaphysical thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An adaptation of a downbeat European novel, set in the States (Nevada) instead of Switzerland, but which, interestingly, retains its European sensibilities (gloomy ending, slow pace). Harshly neglected in the US, I hope ?The Pledge' found a more appreciative audience in Europe. Its somewhat ironical that a previous European version, starring Richard E Grant (Richard E Grant?!) &amp; Lynsey Baxter, was a complete farce and had a ?happy' ending. Really, how can one compare Richard E Grant &amp; Jack Nicholson in the role of a single-minded detective teetering on the edge: it's a no contest.The opening of the film is slow but it's a film which builds up in power so that its final ending lingers in the mind. The novel is about the grotesque nature of chance/fate and how the world, in which Jerry Black operates, is one indifferent to suffering, notions of justice. It's about how people such as Jerry cannot control events and the failure to legislate for these ?chance occurrences' can lead to madness.Having read the novel, I liked the script's use of a red-herring (not in the original) and how we never actually see the real murderer, just a passing glimpse in a car. The film is Jack Nicholson's no doubt about it; he grows into the role of the patient fisherman who plays an elaborate, dangerous game. Nicholson's character loses all sense of morality as the end justifies the means he uses to trap ?the Wizard'. Occasionally, the cameos slightly detracted from the viewing; Vanessa Redgrave's ?mittel European' grandmother of the victim, but it was intriguing watching two very great but different actors (Nicholson &amp; Redgrave) in an emotionally charged scene. Helen Mirren too provided good support as a psychiatrist who Black seeks out for help but who, in turn, probes into his vulnerabilities. Aaron Eckhardt as a slightly arrogant buffoon of a detective and I was interested in another reviewer's comment that his interrogation of Wadenah (del Toro) was almost ?sexual'; it certainly is very uncomfortable to watch as he exploits the vulnerable drifter. The cinematography was excellent, the wide Nevada surroundings emphasising the powerlessness of men as they foolishly strive to control fate. The soundtrack too is haunting in scenes.All in all, a character study and a meditative thriller ? perhaps in a few years this film will garner the respect it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary performance by Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this film on cable last night (only the last hr. or so) &amp; it was extraordinary. Nicholson gives both a moving &amp; harrowing performance as an old, hard-drinking, washed up police detective. Though his character is in the dregs, he still manages to compel our empathy. Not since "Ironweed" has he attempted a character so thoroughly seedy.His relationship w. Robin WRight &amp; Wright's daughter is affecting; and the plot developments around the child murderer stalking the daughter are riveting.The film concludes in a downbeat way that only a director like Sean Penn would have been brave enough to attempt in this era of happy Hollywood endings. Though we as audience know that Nicholson was right in his suspicions of the murderer, none of the characters (including Nicholson's) realize this. At the end, everyone gives up on Nicholson, believes he is nuts; &amp; he in turn reverts to a life of booze &amp; unintelligble muttering. It is heartbreaking to watch. As you watch Wright flay Nicholson for letting her daughter be a lure for the murderer; and we watch Nicholson react w. sullen silence to the onslaught, we are twisted into paroxysms of sadness for him. You realize the moral complexity of the situation: in order to keep faith w. other parents who've lost children to this murderer, Nicholson has endangered the daughter of a woman he has come to love. And she in turn comes to hate him when she learns what he has done. This is a profound moral dilemma.Penn has created a masterful film, proving yet again that he is one of our better (or perhaps best?) directors. "The Pledge" is one of which he can rightly feel proud.</fullReview>

Other actors are Nicholson's equal, especially Mickey Rourke in the harrowing role of a man who has lost his daughter.

He's determined to show that police arrested wrong man (del Toro) for the crime. But determination begets obsession begets--insanity?The merits of this fine movie, I think the most intense drama I've seen in 10 years, could rest on story alone or on the cadre of excellent actors. Sean Penn has achieved something really remarkable here: so many actors playing against type; so many nonstereotypical scenes.Nicholson's character reads bedtime stories to little girl, even as he suspects she's being stalked by killer. Mickey Rourke as grieving father? Yes, &amp; also driven mad. Vanessa Redgrave as grandma.Everybody's perverse here: mother who forces Nicholson to "pledge" on cross that dead daughter made. Aaron Eckart &amp; del Toro turn your standard interrogation room scene into one of sexual seduction: Eckart stops short of sticking his tongue in del Toro's ear.Mesmerizing &amp; unnerving.

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson has been a first class actor for over 30 years, winning many awards in this time.. HE WAS CHEATED OUT OF AN OSCAR, for his performance as a retired cop who attempts to fullfill a promise made to murdered childs motherin this film. Sean Penn directed this excellent all star cast, among the being Benicio Del Toro, Aaron Eckhart, Helen Mirren, Sam Sheppard, Harry Dean Stanton, Robin Wright Penn(Sean`s spouse) shines as usual as the mother of a young girl who may be the next victim. Mr, Penn is even a better director than he is as an actor.This is his 3rd directed film,as with The Indian Runner &amp; The Crossing Guard (also with Nicholson), He has a way with the camera that captures every little nuance in a scene. The ending is different than in most films of this type,it may seem confusing but with a little thought on the viewers part, you will understand it. This is not an action type film, but a thoughtful insightful drama about people and how situations can affect us. Minumal violence &amp; no sex scenes, very little adult language. (the violence is mainly pictures of the victims). Recommeded for all who love good stories well acted &amp; told, rating **** : 97 point/100 : 10 on IMDb</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid character study of a retired Reno detective (Nicholson) who makes a promise to the mother of a murdered child that he will find her killer. By story's end you'll think about those guys you see in run-down towns who manage to survive half-drunk and with a tale to tell -- if anyone will listen. Three other notable actors (Mirren, Redgrave, &amp; Del Toro) have brief but telling scenes but Wright-Penn glows as a lower-class single mother who falls for Nicholson's innate goodness. She's a fine, underrated actress who isn't afraid to dress down for a meaty role. The denouement has a kind of brilliance to it and Jack comes out the sort of anti-hero he was as Jake Gittes in "Chinatown" or even the loser in "Blood &amp; Wine", another little-seen classic of his. Much better than the first Penn/Nicholson collaboration, "The Crossing Guard", including a coal-black bit of humor involving a likely suspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the spectacular countryside of Nevada comes the grim tale of an aged copper's pursuit of justice and spiritual closure. He is police detective Jerry Black and on the night of his retirement party arrives a murder case that will drive him to the point of insanity. A young girl is found dead and almost immediately a local nutcase is arrested and appears to confess his guilt. However, when the suspect proceeds to commit suicide, the case is thrown wide-open in Jerry Black's mind. Following a series of superstitious hunches and having made a pledge to the victim's mother, Black becomes obsessed with finding the killer. Jack Nicholson plays the lead role in a part that only an actor of his calibre can master. His gradual descent into monomania is directed brilliantly by Sean Penn, who is perhaps more famous for being an actor in such films as Dead Man Walking. Penn moves at a very slow pace and often seems too preoccupied with the dazzling scenery. But this suits the film's mood and can only be seen as a put-off by the most impatient of cinema-goers. At times The Pledge is very disturbing. Benecio del Toro's (The Usual Suspects, Traffic) cameo performance as the suspect who kills himself is especially worrying. This is no feel-good movie and the final conclusion, despite being appropriate, is somewhat depressing. There are also several cameo roles for character actors such as Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton, Vanessa Redgrave, and even Helen Mirren. The quality of these supporting members ensures that Nicholson?s superlative acting presence does not become isolated. Nicholson is back to his best after Mars Attacks, the mediocre Blood and Wine, and his amusing but hardly painstaking performance in as Good As It Gets. This is his finest movie in years and I would not be surprised if he wins his ninth nomination and fourth Oscar. The legendary shark's grin is still there and Nicholson seems determined to be remembered as the greatest actor of all time. It isn't beyond the realms of possibilty that he may achieve his goal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Classic. Spoiler warning, as always...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, Benicio Del Toro, Sam Shepard, Tom Noonan, Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton. Faces on which the last fifty years of American movie history are engraved. Putting all these people in any film (even "American Pie 3") would be enough to make it worth your while. Putting them in "The Pledge" however, is enough to make it worthy of almost boundless praise. For, make no mistake, this is American cinema at is finest. Back in the seventies, a film of this calibre would be rightly praised, endlessly discussed, viewed repeatedly by loyal fans throughout the world. These days it wins a few prizes at the odd festival, limps into cinemas, limps out again, and disappears. Which is nothing less than a disgrace, for "The Pledge" is infinitely superior to the mass of junk clogging up your local multiplex. The deceptively simple story (a cop, on his last day at work, gets involved in a murder case, and promises the dead girl's mother that he will catch the killer) leads us on a journey of almost unbearable tension and unease, as Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson, in a performance which, I am sure, will one day come to be seen as his finest of the last ten years) gets more and more embroiled in the case, and the other unsolved cases which come to light. Yes, the "retiring cop's one last case" is a huge cliché. Yes, the celebrity cameos are rather distracting at times. But none of this matters when dealing with a film that transcends all genres, all clichés, all expectations. Sean Penn directs with skill and style. Action erupts out of nowhere, especially in the early scene in the police station with an almost unrecognisable Benicio Del Toro. Jack's leaving party is also worthy of note, as the cinematographer keeps Jack out of focus, in the foreground, with the party, in focus, occurring behind - and effectively without - him. Jack is a great character, full of turmoil and doubts. Nicholson was born to play the role. Note the scene in which the woman from the coffee shop, who has moved in with him to escape her abusive boyfriend, strokes his face. The confusion and uncertainty are amazing to behold. As Jack becomes more obsessed with the case, we share his fear and confusion. Just what is going on? Who is killing these kids? And will his own sort-of-adopted-daughter be next? Or is Jack losing sight of what really matters, and putting her in danger so he can finally solve the case? It's a terrible dilemma at the dark heart of this amazing film. All the performances are excellent, from good old Harry Dean Stanton (how old IS he? Two hundred?) through the surprisingly effective Helen Mirren and Vanessa Redgrave to Mickey Rourke and the aforementioned Del Toro. Robin Wright Penn of course is also superb, as the single mother, so pleasantly surprised to find someone like Jack, so desperately appalled when it all goes wrong. And what a treat to see Tom Noonan not playing the killer. Makes a change. The other thing that makes a change, of course, is seeing a star-packed American movie that does not insult your intelligence. Seek this one out, see it, cherish it. It's an American classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When "The Pledge" came out in theatres, my friend told me it was the best movie he'd seen in a long, long time and that I owed it to myself to go check it out. I didn't. But I finally saw it on DVD, and it is a good movie, but it's not the best thing in the world, either.Jack Nicholson -- man, is this guy amazing. It's sad "The Pledge" had to come out so early in the year, because if it had come out in November or December, all the Oscar buzz would be for him. And it would've helped out Robin Wright Penn, who undergoes an amazing transformation to look like a white trash waitress, not one of those Hollywoodized-type white trash gals. Like Nicholson, she too is quite, quite amazing.But I have a problem with the story (this is the part where the spoilers happen), namely, I don't buy the whole underlying premise of the movie (i.e. the "pledge" of the film's title). Here's a guy who's a grizzled homicide detective -- he's seen probably hundreds of murders over his career -- what the heck is it about this one that makes him so obsessed with it? People will argue that it's because he promised on his eternal soul, but I disagree.There's nothing in the film to suggest that Detective Black is a God-fearing man (in fact, if memory serves me correctly, he even says he isn't), so why should he care if he promised on his eternal soul. I understand that he'd want to find the real killer and that he would buck the system to do it, but to go as far as he did (putting out a kid as live bait, essentially) -- it just doesn't ring true to me. Sorry.Other than that, though, I thought it was a darn fine film, and worth your time, should you be so inclined to check it out.</fullReview>

Since I'm doing a long write-up here, let me say up front that I recommend it, it's the kind of experience that movie lovers really embrace.The Good Stuff: The film is thoughtful and takes its time. It is full of startling imagery - the turkey farm alone is worth the ticket price. It's also got a dynamite cast - mostly in cameos. I guess if you're Sean Penn you can get Harry Dean Stanton, Mickey Rourke, Vanessa Redgrave, and Sam Shephard to take tiny roles that, with the exception of Redgrave's, anyone could have handled. Penn cast his wife (Robin Wright Penn) in a role that screams `battered woman' from the moment she appears on screen. She is fine as a needy woman who loves Nicholson's surfaces and doesn't notice the obsession roiling beneath. Newcomer Pauline Roberts is extraordinary as her daughter; the camera allows her to be radiant, almost angelic, without digging for cute.Nicholson is amazing. He looks like an old cop, he talks like an old cop, his posture says `old cop.' Embodying that character, he makes the dreadful promise to catch a killer or forsake his soul's salvation, and then takes that promise in bit by bit, allowing it to change and reshape him. The viewer roots for him, believes in him, and maybe is as deceived by his cleverness as much as he deceives himself. Aaron Eckhert, who isn't deceived, is so slimy that you want to dismiss him out of hand. One thing you know is that Nicholson is a good cop and Eckhert is a bad cop, and you've seen that movie before. The Pledge plays with your expectations about how cop films go, and allows your faith in the tried and true, and in your identification with the protagonist, to fool you.(As an aside, there are three mentally retarded characters in this film, and in two cases, their condition has no bearing on the plot. It made me wonder if Penn didn't have a long-standing interest in the mentally retarded, which is a better explanation for I Am Sam than the `cynical Oscar grab' version.)The Bad Stuff: The Pledge is too canny about movies and moviegoers' expectations. At times it seemed it was more about busting open cop movie cliches than it was about its own story. At a climactic moment, the viewer is led to believe that a typical (and exciting) climax is about to unfold, but it doesn't. Although the meaning of the scene has major and powerful impact, there are a couple of problems. First, it was too self-aware, it was too much `Look, this is how movies do it but I'm not doing that? Aren't I a surprising and interesting director?' Second, the means by which the climax was averted was itself a movie cliche, and a less plausible one. The self-consciousness of the direction is what leads, in my opinion, to problems of length and too many lingering camera shots (`Aren't my camera shots gorgeous? Hey, look at this one!')All sarcasm aside, and all flaws acknowledged, see it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best in 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, and absolute ten. Sean Penn has directed a masterpiece that few have seen, and surely, few will appreciate if only for the un-American "depressing" ending. American movie viewers seem to have a fixation with all plot elements being wrapped up by the end of a film, and of course, the happy ending. Life doesn't always have a happy ending, and I thank Mr. Penn for having guts to display this fact. Also, Jack Nicholson deserves a Best Actor nomination for his efforts, but as the film came out early in 2001, I am sure he will be overlooked. After all, how often do the deserving films and actors actually win? Last year Russel Crowe won best actor when Ed Harris should have for Pollack, when the year before Russel Crowe should have won for The Insider. Excuse my bitterness, but the Academy doesn't have a clue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, complex and fascinating film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most positive commentators I truly enjoyed the care that director Sean Penn put into building a story that, on the surface, balances on the edge of disaster. Instead of failing the movie instead turns into one of those few american films that you end up being deeply impressed and moved by, and not because of the special effects but due to the story and the psychological depth.First of all I want to point out that you should not expect highpaced action or even suspense in the traditional action/thriller sense. The suspense, and thus the entire film, is instead built around the slowly crumbling mind of the lead character played by Jack Nicholson. Nicholson has the tendency, like for example Al Pacino, to overact and in the hands of a less competent director this might just as well have ended in disaster. In this movie he manages to deliver a balanced portrait of a man who starts of losing his identity (he retires) and ends up losing his sanity.I really don´t have anything but praise for this movie, but I do wan´t to point out one more thing, the way Sean Penn uses the sound, especially simple every day noises. For instance in the scene where the would be killer ends his life and when Nicholson fills up gas at his station. In addition to the wonderful photography and acting this gives the movie an almost three dimensional quality.If you are tired of watching supercops solving the most complicated crimes in the matter of minutes and blowing up everything around them before riding off with the modell, this is something for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "The Pledge" lives mostly on its excellent story which is due to the Swiss novelist Friedrich Duerrenmatt (so much for "great AMERICAN cinema"). And because the story is so good, it has already been filmed several times. Personally, I know two versions besides "The Pledge". The first one is the classical one with Gerd Froebe and Heinz Ruehmann and has a happy ending. The second one is a Swiss one with more or less the same action and ending (except that the little girl turned into a whore - but this appearantly would have been too strong for an American major production). If I remember correctly, the tone of the latter movie was very much like the one in "The Pledge".Sean Penn's movie is quite well done. The direction is good. The movie has a dark undertone and the cast is, of course, excellent. For anyone who hasn't seen any version based on that novel (as probably most of the American audience), the movie will definitely appear as one of the outstanding movies of 2001. If you have, however, seen one or more versions of that material, you will notice that Sean Penn really didn't have anything new to contribute to the interpretation of the story but just made a relatively tame adaptation. His only merit is that he has successfully transplanted it to the United States without spoiling it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out-riddles "The Usual Suspects" but likewise has Benicio.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILER(S) HEREIN.This movie is a definite work of art. The entire cast and crew are superb in their production.Basically, anyone could be the murderer in this film or there may be more than one murderer or a murderer or murderers with an accomplice or accomplices. In any event, deciphering it will keep you on your toes, figuratively speaking.The heaviest suspects are the construction worker/snow plow driver/minister fellow known as Gary Jackson, the elusive and possibly non-existent "Oliver", and the investigating detective known as Detective Jerry Black.Benicio Del Toro's character, Toby Jay Wadenah, was essentially ruled out by the fact that he was imprisoned at the time of the first murder which occurred on July 18, 1992 in Monash County, Nevada, if one agrees with the modus operandi theory. From a psychological viewpoint, Mr. Wadenah was lead into a confession via duress from the egotistical and impatient Detective Stan Krolak.The teenage boy who appeared on the scene of the second murder dealt with in the movie arrived there as a result of bogging his snowmobile down into snow. His curiosity at seeing Mr. Wadenah departing the wooded area in an apparent state of stress and/or fear prompted him to go into the wooded area whereupon he encountered the crime scene.The good minister whom his mother believed that the good Lord had not yet seen fit to provide him with a perfect-enough wife as yet, is a strong suspect due to the unusualness of his stopping his truck on the side of the road, getting out of it, and striking a conversation with a young female child with whom he is not acquainted, nor is there any indication in the movie that he is acquainted with the child's mother. Additionally, working as a construction worker during the summer and a snow plow driver during the winter puts him in a state of freedom, comparatively speaking, to be on the scene of the first murder which was committed in July and the second murder which was committed in the winter of 2000, as well as possibly having some association with the missing child.Oliver's name is called out by the Christmas store lady a total six times, once on the first occasion and five times on the second. But, to our knowledge, we are never given any further information regarding Oliver. The Christmas store lady could have been talking to an imaginary character, a ghost, herself, or a host of other possibilities. Furthermore, if there is in reality an Oliver, he is associated with chocolate porcupine candies.Detective Jerry Black is a suspect for a minimum of four reasons: 1) he makes the statement to his former colleagues, "At the time of the murders Toby Wadenah was in Stillwater Penitentiary doing time on his own rape conviction, so he couldn't have done it". The problem with his statement is that at that time which would have been during July of 1992, there was only one murder confirmed, that of Luanne Fay Rotze. The case of Catherine Anne Olstad, reported missing on October 12, 1997, was not classified as a murder but as "Missing - Presumed Dead". Either Jack's character made a Freudian slip, a simple mistake in language, or an assumption not characteristic for a law enforcement officer, retired or not. 2) Jack's character likewise talked with Chrissy in the restaurant and seemed a little "too" interested in her. 3) He made the statement at the Crazy Daze Parade/Festival in re the red dress which Chrissy picked out, "Well, that'll look real nice. It is her colour". 4) He made the statement at the crime scene regarding a knife being easily thrown far away, "Assuming it was a knife".Furthermore, the question can be legitimately posed as to why he was the person to inform the Larsens of their daughter's murder out of all the other officers in attendance at the crime scene.We are not given much information regarding Detective Black's background other than he's been divorced twice, he is a chain smoker, a possible alcoholic, lifted evidence from Sheriff P. Adrien Dorval's file without permission, didn't appear to be concerned about lying to James Olstad in stating that he was a detective instead of a retired detective, his office was decorated with pictures of himself and fish indicating self-centeredness and/or self-obsession and/or narcissism, was controlling in his offer to pay a high price to the owner of the gas station for his own self-serving purposes as well as other instances of control, broke out into a sweat upon questioning by his therapist regarding current sexual activity while hearing the words in his head "There are such devils", as well as other parts of the conversation between Mrs. Larsen and himself. Those are just the starters.Detective Black was definitely obsessed with the case and was clearly baiting Chrissy into a similar situation as the previous girls had encountered.The question is, who was he baiting? The murders and missing girl's cases seemed to give his life meaning. What were his motives? What did he want? Why was he willing to leave his own retirement party to investigate a case in another county? Additionally, he was dimensionally slowed down consciousness-wise at his retirement party possibly indicating depression and/or "black hole" effect, superficial, and appeared ungrateful.Then there is the situation wherein Chrissy is swinging in her red dress, the black station wagon with a porcupine creation hanging from the rear-view mirror drives by and stops just out of forward sight Chrissy dismounts the swing to meet whomever was driving the vehicle, and the sound of the door opening. The scene just prior to that one depicted Jerry's character on the lake fishing. That night she told Jerry about having met the wizard and showed him the porcupine candies which she stated that the wizard had given her and also that he would provide more the next day.There are more than one black station wagons in the vicinity and portrayed in the movie or else they are changing license plates frequently. The wagon which the minister is driving in one scene is not the same style station wagon as the one shown in the scene with Chrissy or in the wreck. Nor is it clear that the station wagon at the service station when Jerry pumps gas and tells the driver that his type of vehicle sticks out is definitely being driven by the minister.The mysteries abound in this movie. Enjoy them but don't become obsessed with them. This is excellent work mystery-wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Penn is one of the most talented actors in his generation and he should keep that way, not trying to be something else. The Pledge is at least half an hour to long, and that half hour is filled with "deep" feelings considering a threatened little girl, which sentimentality Americans seem to love, but most of us Europeans hate from the bottoms of our hearts.There are quite good first 30 minutes here. The retired investigating policeman...well you've seen him before, but Jack Nicholson is great, acting in a much more quiet way than usual, without rising eyebrows and without giving us that tiring wolf smile. But then this isn't much of a thriller anymore. It becomes a relation drama. That might go together, but not in Sean Penn's very average directing.But Penn's casting is sublime of course, including names (in small parts) like Mickey Rourke (one of his best performances ever), Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton, Sam Shepard. Its the actors who are doing this film, not the directing. The end of the movie is surprising however and very non-american. You didn't expect that person to be the loser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A retired cop hunts a serial killer. Psychological drama about an old man who becomes obsessive. Good but lacks focus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pledge is a psychological drama dressed up as a serial killer hunt. Or is it? We're not sure and there's the problem with this pledge. Sean Penn and Jack Nicholson combined previously in 1995 on The Crossing Guard which was also written by Penn. Penn directed both and there are similar strong themes. A child has died. Nicholson plays a flawed character hunting for the killer and both films are more about the Nicholson character than anything else. But whereas The Crossing Guard was explanatory, The Pledge leaves us dangling, wondering what the hell is going on. That's not very satisfying. In The Pledge Nicholson plays Jerry who's a cop about to retire. His last day sees a young girl murdered and Jerry pledges to the girl's mother that he'll hunt down the killer.  As he makes the pledge Jerry looks away momentarily. We know he's retiring that day, he knows it of course, still the promise is made. A man (Benicio Del Toro in a memorable cameo) seemingly confesses and then suicides but Jerry goes on the hunt. Or does he? We're not really sure. Jerry buys a service station near a lake he loves to fish which also is in the area he suspects a serial killer is operating. Jerry then meets a much younger woman Lori (Robin Wright Penn) whose young daughter fits the description of the killer's victims. Jerry watches the little girl carefully. We guess that perhaps he's using the young girl as bait. But would he? Could he? The plot develops. Jerry's motivations are obscure. Jerry probably doesn't even know exactly what he's doing or why he's doing it. The relationship with Lori certainly wasn't planned but what of the rest? Nicholson gives a very strong performance and Penn adds some interesting touches as he develops the story. But The Pledge lacks focus. It's all well and good being obscure but in this case it's unsatisfying. There are none of the expositions we saw in The Crossing Guard. We're just left to guess at what Jerry's doing.  If he's just a confused old man battling on from day to day, thrown a late lifeline he didn't expect, and finding a little girl he's grown to love in danger then all well and good. But we needed to know. Perhaps a voice over by Jerry would have done the job, or a confidante, but the film needed something like that.3 And A Half Wispy Flys out of five</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Penn in European mode; Nicholson on top form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Penn can be proud of this intriguing and gripping drama, adapted from a story by the Swiss novelist, Friedrich Durrenmatt. The action has successfully been transferred from Europe to the Nevada mountains (though, inevitably, the movie was shot in Canada). But at the same time Penn has given the film a bleak, low-key, character-driven feel, more often associated with European directors, such as Claude Chabrol. The movie's theme is obsession, but not the blatant version of that aberration, frequently depicted in Hollywood movies, often in the form of paranoia. What afflicts Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is the kind of obsession that creeps up on its subject, without them noticing, until it is too late and the compulsion has taken control of their thoughts and actions. As Black, a Reno detective on the point of retirement at the start of the movie, Nicholson delivers a masterful portrayal, free from the clichéd mugging and over-the-top histrionics that often mar the credibility of his performances, entertaining though they may be. Here, he convinces as a devoted, honest cop, who feels bound by a pledge he made to the mother of a murdered child, to catch the killer. He believes the culprit is still out there, though his colleagues have closed the case. But his dedication gradually morphs into fixation; and eventually his good intentions rebound on those closest to him and on himself. Nicholson's subtle, restrained performance is matched by that of Robin Wright, who abandons glamour to play a single mother who, with her child, moves in with the lonely Black. Aaron Eckhart has a more stereotyped part, as a brash, insensitive detective, reluctant to go along with Black's line of enquiry. The supporting cast is star-studded, with Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Dean Stanton, Benicio del Toro and Mickey Rourke in small but key roles. Some may regret the lack of an exciting climax to the movie; but personally I was happy with its unresolved and more complex ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare quality of what a good movie is all about!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pledge is an excellent movie. Would you expect less from Director Sean Penn &amp; Jack Nicholson ? Everything here adds up to make this an amazing experience. To start with, Sean Penn offers his first rate direction, that captures your senses. The story is a classic, a great tragedy that will touch your heart. The scenes are shot beautifully just to add a little more amusement to this piece if gold. Jack Nicholson ... one of the greatest actors of all time ... No doubt about it.The story briefly is about a retired Detective (Nicholson), that decides to give up his long awaited vacation, because he has a hunch about a case that occurred on the night of his retirement party. The case was the rape and murder of a little girl. The police department tell him: Go rest ... you deserve it ... this is our case, not yours. Nicholson seems to agree to leave it all behind, but he made a promise to the parents of the little girl that he will find the killer. He has to keep his promise. Things are not looking good for him, the Police found the killer as they claim just hours after they discovered the body. What is he looking for? The suspect confessed already.Nicholson not convinced, takes another path. He buys a gas station and adopts his life in a manner that should help him find the killer. He is introduced to Robin Wright (Lori), and her daughter. He starts to discover new things about life, that he forgot for quite some time, yet he never forgets his cause ... his promise. I will leave you to watch the rest, It is very entertaining. Also an advice: Don't expect a normal story, like all other serial killers movies, this offer much more, and is indeed involved deeply with each character's emotions and feelings. Nicholson is an amazing actor, no doubt about it, will this win him an Oscar nomination? I wonder. Robin Wright offers a solid performance of a broken character. Benicio Del Toro is Fabulous, Can he ever stop surprising us? Great cast. As for Sean Penn, he doesn't need my recommendation. This is doing what "Dead Man Walking" once did. This is Oscar material.Go watch it if you are hungry for some good acting, Nicholson and the rest of the cast deliver. Enjoy Sean as he moves the Camera's to paint this piece of art. This is a rare quality of what a good movie is all about. 9/10 </fullReview>

The way he unscupulously uses his friend and her daughter to catch the murderer in an almost casual manner is the most intriguing and perhaps also most shocking part of the movie.The film could have used a bit less slow motion, and Black's obsession with fishing is perhaps a bit to overtly symbolic, but those few complaints aside, this is a very solid, moving, intense, and in the end also deeply tragic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly thought-provoking [POTENTIAL SPOILERS WITHIN]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this film, I was very unsatisfied with the ending. It didn't seem to answer anything, nobody seemed the better, and it was tremendously sad. However, in retrospect, I'm finding myself going over the elements of the movie more and more (which, in my mind usually marks the better films) and I think the ending, while truly sad is the ultimate conclusion to actual title of the film. Nicholson makes a promise to find the killer and keep it from happening again to another child... a very strong promise, which he takes so seriously that he literally devotes the remainder of his life to fulfilling it, even though I don't think even he is truly aware that he is even doing it. He fulfills his pledge; he knows that the person accused of the crimes was not the guilty party, while none of the other cops care... to them, it's a closed case, time to move on. But Nicholson knows that the real villain is still out there and still a threat and attempts to track him down in a most remarkable way. Like I say, he fulfills his pledge to the mother. In the end, the true killer can never perform an evil deed, but Nicholson is totally unaware of it. To make matters worse, his retirement was turning into a much better lifestyle than his entire life as a cop in Reno, and yet his continued attempt to find the killer destroys even this. His former co-workers are left thinking that he has literally gone off the deep end, and he has lost any respect that they had for him. His 'new family' turns their back on him (and rightfully so, I believe) once the mother finds out what was actually going on. In his death, the true killer ends up utterly destroying Nicholson's very existence.My wife and I debated over what would have happened next at the end of the film. I can't imagine anything other than Nicholson's complete self-destruction, either by deliberate action (suicide) or eventually through alcohol, but my wife was convinced that he would have had to have found out about the fatal accident since he did know who the killer's mother was and would have known that the guy was dead. In either case, I give the most credit to Sean Penn for ending the film in the fashion in which he does. You simply don't know what Jack's going to do, and that truly puts you in Nicholson's mind at that very moment. Any film that can get right into your head like that has really achieved something special. Once again, Jack (very similar to in 'The Shining') is absolutely incredible as a man slowly losing his mind, but a lesser director would have made the ending much more obvious, more blatant, more satisfying to a lesser audience. Kudos to Mr. Penn for a thought-provoking, intelligent yet truly disturbing piece of work.</fullReview>

He creates a thick and totally believable atmosphere throughout the movie. This level of perfection is what was missing from his previous attempts.Jack Nicholson hasn't been in such sublime form since The Shining. He didn't deserve it for As Good As It Gets, but he does now. Great performances also from Benecio del Toro and Robin Wright. The supporting cast is alo great.If you have any interest in landmark movies, you need to see this.

Slow paced as Fargo (maybe its just the snow and new age music overdose) this movie does not rely on graphic depiction of murders, but on showing the passion of the detective.Dürrenmatt would have like the end better than in the other versions, because its his end of the story identical with the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My God was this movie bad.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this movie a 3 only out of respect for Jack Nicholson. While the cast was decent, even they could not save The Pledge from Sean Penn's directing. It's filled with a bunch of elements that were apparently intended to be inciteful and thought-provoking, but instead come over as comical and amateurish. For some strange reason, everyone Jack Nicholson's detective character interviewed seemed to be retarded, an invalid, senile, or poor white trash. There do not appear to be many normal, coherent people in Sean Penn's world.As a viewer, I begged for the plot to finally develop. When it finally did, it had absolutely no meaning whatsoever. The movie bores you at length, and simply falls apart at the end. Sean Penn's idea of a great who-done-it movie would seem to be making the viewer choose from possible culprits A through E, and then telling you it's F, "None of the above". But only after subjecting you to two hours of pain. Anyone who gives this thing over a 5 is probably working for the studio. It's that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, haunting mystery with a questionable ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson has always been one of my favorite actors, so it's a treat to watch him grace the big screen after a long break (I think his last film was "As Good As It Gets"). Not to my surprise, he turns in yet another impressive performance. This one is more low-key, emotional, disciplined and subtle than most of his roles, and it's one that will stand out, along with his other landmark performances in "As Good As It Gets" and "A Few Good Men." The plot is intriguing, haunting and compelling. It's equivalent to a great book that you can't put down. In this case, I had trouble hitting the stop button. I just couldn't wait to see what would happen next! Of course, Sean Penn (one actor who proves to serve greatness in directing as well) helps create the tension with his vivid direction. I've heard many audiences discussing the film's ending. Some like it, some don't. Naturally, I braced myself for this acclaimed ending, on the edge of my seat. And my reaction was, "Huh?" Though I'm grateful that Penn didn't decide to go with a cheap surprise ending, I also felt like I was let down. It was a fairly good ending, but I felt it needed more suspense, even without going for a cheap plot twist.Overall, I was impressed with the film. It's one that definitely keeps you in suspense, with some fine performances to spare. Aside from the great Nicholson, Benicio Del Toro has a short but unusual role that proves his versatility as a method actor. "The Pledge" is a high-octane thriller that delivers, and one I would definitely recommend.My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

It was basically Jack mumbling, fishing, and smoking. Jesus, this guy was better in his previous worst "as good as it gets".

Penn attempts, it seems, to put together a Who Done It, but this just simply does not work. The acting is first rate, the directing is second. At some point you begin to wonder when this film is going to take off. It seems obvious that Penn desperately follows film making 101 to languish us through the second half of The Pledge. Nice try but no cigar on this one. Penn's later work is better....in fact, each film he makes gets better. Having said all that, I gave the movie a five because it's worth seeing. ONCE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys, you all have for sure read others books written by Friedrich Dürrenmatt. He was, by the way, one of the greatest European writer. You might take into consideration that: 1. (pedophile) Serial Killers in Europe can be counted by the finger of two hands 2. the notion "Serial Killer" has been used after the so-called "nowadays" Ted Bundy's killings 3. Dürrenmatt has done his best writing about facts that would have a profile and a definition in his afterlife. I do not want to show myself here as an idiot pretending to preach lessons to you. I really think that Dürrenmatt himself could not deal with a decent ending. Director Sean Penn has done a great job with this movie, considering all that issues, plus, maybe he really has felt the need to respect the original novella.I have not liked the ending: fishtail, we use to say in my country. I certainly do not like the obviously clues: 8/10 year pretty girl in red dress. (I hate the ending and the red dress).Nevertheless, 10 stars for Sean Penn' courage to bring in an USA movie a 1958 novella. Sean Penn could not use CSI's methods, but he has been great in story-flow here. Oh, Jack Nicholson in a drama, fat, alcoholic and obsessed by his golden retirement watch ( that is for me a real clue)... Fascinating!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the center of The Pledge is a rather large void. It never feels like a complete film; poorly focused, plodding, and without major drama or emotion. It offers picturesque photography and hauntingly beautiful music, in an otherwise dull movie.Retiring cop Jerry Black promises to the traumatized parents of a murdered daughter that he will catch the killer, despite the fact that the department believed they have caught him already. Black's quiet solo investigation takes him to a small rural community, where he buys a new place and he hopes to get some peace while conducting his business. He meets a mother and child and offers to let them move in with him. A family bond develops as the months go by, and It looks as though Black is ready to put his obsession behind him, but is he?Jack Nicholson does a slightly better job of playing the character rather than himself in this movie, but he still seems rather devoid of talent. The Pledge focuses too much on character interaction which ends up becoming essentially useless to the plot. There are some touching and mildly suspenseful moments, but this is not a particularly strong drama. The Pledge sets itself up to be a 'catch a killer' story, which is what the audience intends to get, but does not. The movie does not commit so why should the viewers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crossing Guard excepted, this film marked a serious return to form for Jack Nicholson. The most telling acting happens from the opening as Nicholson's Sheriff Black undertakes a leaving party and one final murder investigation with a the spectre of the some personal privation gnawing at him. It's not distraction but need. When he makes the eponymous promise to find a child's murder we begin to feels this chemical reaction, a warping of reality as he slips into an unwanted retirement unsatisfied and unresolved.Robin Wright Penn is magnificent support in this fateful drama, a redeeming angel who heralds the tragedy. The rest of the ensemble (including Del Toro's wacky cameo) are also fine. Sean Penn directs with candour and a cold, sad heart. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..thought-provoking movie..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it to be amazing that IMDb.com fails to list the leading character's name in the cast line-up, in so many of it's reviews. I see a picture of Nicholson, but his name is not there.As so many users commented, "The Pledge" haunted me for several days after I watched it on TCM. I was totally taken aback at its ending, and really had to ponder if I understood it's message. I wasn't aware that Nicholson's character was sliding toward insanity. I wondered why he would allow his lover's daughter (no listing of her, either) to wear a red dress and play practically in the middle of the road passing his shop; I didn't understand it was a major subplot to find the killer. Nor was I aware that a couple of suspects were living in the area his shop was located. Must be, I wasn't paying too much attention as the plot progressed, but Sean Penn (director) didn't wave any flags to project it......maybe he should go back to his acting-job.I didn't catch-onto the significance of "the crash" and the burning body till it happened, nor why the mom was rushing to pick-up her daughter. I was also wondering why all those cops were staked-out. I admit, I had to go to these comments to get the whole picture. I was really enjoying the movie......I also wonder why there were SO MANY major actors/actresses in this film. Maybe they owed Penn a favor ? I suppose he's trying to make a masterpiece. It's my opinion that actors of that caliber need very little direction, except to capture what the director is trying to film. I need to go to eBay to buy "The Pledge," so I can really study the plot. The ending shocked me, because I, too, think it is heinous for anyone to place another human being in danger just to achieve a goal that can almost never can be reached.After all these negative comments, I certainly recommend this movie to all adults. I have written before that I like movies that lay-out it's message in an easily-understood story. Guess I was caught sleeping on this one. Hope it's shown again soon........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for those who enjoy a more sinister and emotionally disturbing plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pledge is a film that definitely invokes a reaction from the viewer. I was left considering the storyline, and in particular the ending, for some time after watching it.The plot is rather sluggish in it's progression. However, the tone, location, and fitting selection of music appropriately fit the sombre and disturbing feel to this film.When a relationship develops between Detective Black, (Nicholas), and a single mother of an 8 year old, blonde girl, one feels that there is an air of predictability to the storyline. However, the expectation of a thrilling and predictable confrontation between killer and little girl do not arrive as expected.Instead of the climax to a seemingly inevitable fate that the viewer expects, the overwhelming sense of doubt and suspected delusional obsession that everyone else in the film has put upon Nicholson overpowers these expectations, leaving you not knowing what to expect next.I would say that this film strikes best when viewed alone. Not because of it's disturbing nature, or sinister overtone, but because it leaves the viewer feeling uneasy and not totally satisfied. Although the film ends with the killer bearing some form of justice, it would appear that this justice is not what the viewer expected, or perhaps hoped for. However, this is for me what makes this film as memorable and as disturbing as it was.Overall Rating: (6.8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unrealistic Promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't ever make a promise you can't keep. That's the lesson from Sean Penn's talented and infuriating psychological crime drama, The Pledge. A promise is made to the grieving parents of a dead child that the killer will be found, and that promise proves to be both beyond reach and corrosive.In real life, Penn is a bloviating nincompoop, but here he elicits a great performance from his central character, Jack Nicholson. Jack and the rest of the cast of The Pledge are constrained, real people drawn into a grisly and obsessive search for a serial killer of little girls.Although the movie has its pacing problems, alternating from unfocused and turgid to squirm-in-your-recliner suspenseful, by the ending credits, you'll find two things to be true (unless you just have to have your endings tidy and Police Squad-happy). You'll feel as unsettled as you are relieved that the movie is over. The overriding effect The Pledge had on me is that, since it defies the Hollywood, happy ending tradition, it is deflating. What I mean by "deflating" is that happy-crappy seems to pump air into one's lungs (you leave the theatre or turn off the TV with a breeze at your back and fresh air in your chest). Happy endings are American to the marrow. The Pledge has a victorious ending, but no one knows it.That's infuriating and deflating, and if you can't handle that sort of conclusion, stick with a Die Hard or a Lethal Weapon. That's not meant to be snotty or stuck-up, just realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete waste of wonderful performances *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a severe disappointment, and actually made me quite angry. (Judging from those who walked out of my screening, I was not alone.) Sean Penn - an excellent actor - did a terrible job here as a director. What could have been a wonderfully subtle story was instead hammered painfully at the viewer. Penn's direction was ham-fisted and often bordering on the sadistic. A wonderfully interesting performance by Nicholson is completely ruined by Penn's choppy cutaways to ridiculous shots of flying birds and zooming cars, (or worse, violent burning corpses and shocking crime scene shots), when we would really rather be seeing Nicholson's emotions. Worse, Penn seems to take particular glee in portraying literally every man in this film as a closet pedophile. Then we have the only woman in the movie as a horribly battered woman who finds love with a man who ends up using her child as bait for a sex killer. (Charmingly, Penn cast his wife in this role.) I mean, I don't need my movies to be totally politically correct. I saw this movie at a noir film festival. I am a serious fan of noir and of dark films in general. However, this is a pretentiously directed movie that somehow manages to be both totally offensive AND boring. Also be aware that even if you have a strong stomach, if you think you might have a problem seeing horribly graphic shots of brutally butchered 6-year-old girls, (as most of us do), you should probably avoid this movie. It's got a lot to disgust you with nothing to redeem it, other than some vestiges of what clearly could have been great performances by Del Toro, Nicholson, Penn, and Eckhart. Unfortunately, the director frustratingly cut away from those actors just as their performances were getting interesting. I almost never write reviews, but wanted to warn you off this one. Do yourself a favor and see "M" instead - a much better noir film about a similar subject.</fullReview>

Now Jack Nicholson finds out, that he wasn't the true murderer but a serial killer is still at large. Bounded through his pledge to the family of the little girl, he wants to find the true serial killer. OK, so long the story. This movie uses an awful lot of known actors, and so it hurts very much when they are wasted on a bad story like this. All in this story you certainly have seen here or there. So normally such a patchwork would make a 5, but with this actors it got highented up to a 6.

They invented such an end, that they put all on the table', and lost all!!! I will forever remember this movie for it's end!! The utmost possible breakdown of an end!!!

		<fullReview>Director Sean Penn (that should have been my first warning signal) gives us a tedious movie about a retired cop (Jack Nicholson) who, in his last case, swears "on his salvation" that he'll track down the killer of a young girl, then - to keep his pledge - won't give up the case. Instead, he buys a gas station, befriends a young woman and her young daughter (becomes kind of a husband/father/grandfather figure to them), conveniently believing the little girl is the next target so he can capture the killer. Running through the whole thing is a weird religious undertone that doesn't exactly cast people of faith in a very positive light.This was terrible. My real question is what in the world ever possessed Jack Nicholson to accept this role!

As a result, several key events that lead to the movies conlusion just don't make sense. The theoretically normal people, Jerry's former police mates, and people he has become close to in his new life, behave too irrationally for suspension of disbelief.Yes, I know the world contains stupid cops and fickle friends.

Heplayed a serial killer in Manhunter (1986), aka Red Dragon, soPenn served him up here as the blatantly obvious suspect andthen played him off shamelessly as either the real killer or the redherring, and in a stunningly cheap rip-off, never disclosed whichhe was!The ending? Pure artless pap. It ignored good science, goodpolice work, and especially, good film making.I didn't know that you go through life not finding out the answers toproblems that vex you. Thanks, Master Penn, for taking severalhours to tell me that.I only voted 1 because the IMDb doesn't let you vote 0.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was so bad, and on so many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the Legendary Jack Nicholson, couldn't save this stinker from the bowels of boring, and utterly pointless movie pile. The Pledge was 2.5 hours of my life that I'll never get back, and now, some six days later, I still regret not sneaking out and going to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon again. For me, when I have to look at my watch during a movie, it's a sign that it just isn't doing to for me. Well five minutes into the Pledge, I was watching the second hand of my Rolex go round and round and round . . . .The movie revolves around a promise, Nicholson makes, and vows to keep. This takes him on a long, excruciatingly boring quest to find a killer. Now when I say excruciating, I, in this instance, refer to length. The editors of this film could easily have edited this movie down to 1.5 hours, and perhaps save us some of the un-necessarily long bits where nothing at all happens.Perhaps I was a little harsh giving it a 1 out of 10, for it did have one saving grace, it did after all end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know it is early for me to say 'The Pledge is one of the best films of the year.' But damn, this film does deserve it. It is a film that really had me with great thrilling drama and some great acting, directing and scenery.Jack Nicholson stars (in one of his better roles) as retiring cop Jerry Black who makes a promise to the parents of a girl who was viciously raped and murdered to find the man who did it. Even after what police know (or think they know) is the killer offs himself, Black knows this is deeper and starts on a year and a half long obsession in search. What could've been a pretty typical cop thriller (which going into the theater thinking it was) turned into a grabber with Sean Penn delivering fine direction to his cast. Nicholson steals the show though at the age of 64 in his role and makes the film worth every penny. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I want to say that Jack Nicholson and Sean Penn are two of the greatest actors of our era. Which makes "The Pledge" somewhat strange. It's not a bad movie, just confusing. With Nicholson as a detective trying to find a killer, the movie delivers good performances from everyone, but I couldn't really tell what the ending meant. Maybe if I saw it again, I might understand it. See whether or not you can understand it. Also starring Robin Wright Penn, Benicio Del Toro (happy 40th, Benicio!), Patricia Clarkson, Aaron Eckhart and Helen Mirren; I guess that they're not embarrassed about this.All in all, a very bizarre effort from all involved.</fullReview>

Considering the heavy guns involved in this movie, I expected something of a different caliber. I want to rate this movie with one star, but the acting bumps it up a notch. Nevertheless, I am border-lining suing the production company for allowing this garbage to hit the public.As the heading states, I want my two hours back. And my faith in Jack Nicholson restored. I cannot believe he willingly signed this contract, or at least not while sober.This is amongst the few times I've been down right angry after watching a movie, for the sole reason that it stole time I will never get back. To add insult to injury, I actually BOUGHT the DVD, I didn't even have the foresight to rent it first. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a DVD to destroy.If you have some cash you are contemplating using on this movie, I recommend donating it for your favorite charity instead. At least they will not steal your time in the process.And Mr. Penn.... PLEASE stick to acting in the future. Most of us movie-watchers out here have never hurt you in any way, so I think it is unfair of you punishing us like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Jack Why???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the life of me I can't understand why a brilliant actor such as Jack Nicholson took this roll. This movie (if you can call it that) was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. To be honest I really can't say what it was about. It jumps all over the place and goes nowhere. I think Jack's character is a police officer who is about to retire when he gets a case involving the murder of a little girl. He vows to the mother to find the killer. After that he winds up running a gas station in the middle of nowhere. He spends most of his time fishing. It was horrible. I wouldn't recommend this move to my worst enemy. Who ever wrote the script for this thing should never be allowed to write ever again. Save your time, leave this one alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Next to Here On Earth, the worst movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a film like this before. It was only a couple of years ago that I sat in the theater against my better judgment and watched Nick Nolte get afflicted in his movie Affliction. It seems to happen once every few years. A-list actors do small pictures as a favour or as a way to try to garner some Oscar consideration. I'm not sure which one this was, probably the first, but whatever the reason Jack took this is not a noble enough reason to make anyone sit through this film. This story could have been told in about a half an hour. There was not enough material in here to garner a 100 minute film. The way it was turned into a standard length film was with a lot of fancy camera work that added at least an extra fifteen minutes to the film and the rest was just window dressing. This is the kind of film that oozes at a snails pace and asks its audience to maintain an interest, when there is nothing there to hold that interest. Sean Penn may be a good director, I don't know, but he certainly hasn't shown me anything with this film.Jack plays Detective Jerry Black who is retiring and is at a retirement party thrown by the department. In a very well done scene, simultaneously, a young boy sees a scared looking Native American run out of the bushes. The young boy wanders off to take a look. This is the dead of winter in Nevada and the boy has to go through knee deep snow to find that of a seven year old girl that has been raped and murdered. The police are called upon to investigate and Jerry asks if he can go along, even though he has six hours until retirement. Jerry then has the dauntless task of informing the parents that their daughter has been killed. Once at the parents farm he makes a promise, the Pledge that the title refers to, to the mother and to God himself that he will find the killer. Soon thereafter, they pick up the Indian seen at the site of the murder and the police think they can get a confession out of the man in record time. His priors reads like a grocery list so the potential is there. The confession does come from him but he doesn't seem to lucid to what is being asked of him and then soon thereafter he kills himself. Case closed, but Jack has second thoughts. He does some digging and finds that in the last ten years there have been three cases that sound similar to this one and thinks that it is the same person. But no one buys it and Jack moves off and buys a gas station where he meets a young woman who has a daughter and they seem to fall in love and then at the end..... well, read the other reviews in here. It's the same thing. The story sounds good but it is executed very poorly. I didn't believe any of the characters. I didn't buy any of them doing what they did. The film moves too slowly and there are so many fillers that it is impossible to get any momentum going.The Pledge is one of those films that is supposed to be categorized as 'ambitious' and 'important' and 'worthy' and not a 'sell out'. What all that really means is that it is boring, tedious and gets recognition from deteriorating film critics like Roger Ebert because it is Sean Penn. Penn may have been one of the best actors of his generation but that does not automatically catapult him into the likes of Tartantino and Stone and Spielberg. You have to pay your dues and every once in a while make a film that people care about. This is not that film.1 out of 10- This is a bad film and one to avoid at all costs. It may be a City TV Late Great Movie one day and that should be the time to view it..... or if you have a bad case of insomnia.</fullReview>

The ambiance doesn't really sit well the cinematography. Story isn't anything special--there are many one-dimensional characters, and overall the movie is full of your usual whodunit clichés. Even Nicholson really seemed out-of-place, at times. There's just something very off with this. Doesn't quite sit well.Robin, perhaps, might be the only redeeming aspect; she's brilliant!

		<fullReview>What is this movie? A murder mystery? A character study? It's neither and both. It is in fact two movies in one. For the first 95%, it is an involving mystery. For the last 5%, it is a character study. In the end, the mystery is barely resolved while the character Jack Nicholson plays is unconvincingly left hanging. You feel cheated. The action so carefully built up in the first part falls apart in seconds near the end. The resolution happens so quickly you hardly know it happened. Or did it? You almost wonder.Nicholson's character is sketched so lightly, with so few clues to his inner workings, that you never really get a look at what makes him tick, making the ending feel like you have wasted the first almost two hours of your life. I don't blame Nicholson, he gives it his all. There must be a story to this. Penn is a fine director with a sure hand. In fact, his direction for the most part here works as a story. But it is so poorly put together, I wonder if a producer or the studio took the film from Penn and re-cut it. In the end, the viewer is left without an adequate resolution, without knowing why Nicholson's character ended up the way he did.The sad thing is that there is almost enough here to re-cut the movie for it be both a satisfying mystery while building the demise of Nicholson's character in an involving, empathetic way.

I suppose if you suck at the teat of political correctness then you might not get the joke, but otherwise it's one of the funnier scenes in the movie (the running 90210 joke being the funniest). At this point you're probably wondering what in the world Mo'Nique, Jerry Springer, mixed flow charts, and 90210 have to do with a movie about bounty hunters. It's a legit question.

		<shortDescription>Slow-paced drama, not my cup of tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was labeled a "thriller" when it ran on a television channel recently. Seeing Jack Nicholson in a thriller, I looked forward to a good time. But it was not so.The plot evolves around a pledge that Jack Nicholson (Jerry Black) made to the mother of a murdered child: he would find and convict the child's murderer. The police catches some guy who is (all too obviously for us) not guilty, and Nicholson (Jerry Black) decides to locate the real killer. It starts out well with some action, but then the drama starts.... drama, drama... And I wondered: when will something happen, so this film can finally end? I identified three major flaws of this film that were prominent all the way through: (1) Flat characters (2) Uninspired directing (3) Slow-paced script.There are some good stuff too (I did give it five stars): (1) Nice nature photo -- actually it's a really good camera work overall (2) Good acting, as one could expect of the cast (3) there is a plot.Let me explain why the characters are flat. Nicholson is supposed to retire from his job at the police. He settles himself down in some remote place and buys a gas station and then he goes fishing every day. This continues for 1,5 years. During that time, there are scattered and very short scenes of occasional intimacy, love and caring. We never learn who Nicholson is or what he has done in his life.I want to conclude with mentioning how I had waited for the expected ending. I won't tell what kind of ending I expected, but I think most intelligent people could figure out how such a story is expected to end. Then -- a rip-off. The film doesn't really end! For a film called "The Pledge", one should expect a conclusion related to the pledge made by Nicholson, but what happened? I don't know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inscrutable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is a retired cop whose last minutes on the job are ruined by the discovery of the mutilated and raped body of a little girl. A retarded Indian (Benicio del Toro) is picked up for the crime. Del Toro has a record of child abuse and other offenses, some physical evidence linking him to the girl is found in the cab of his truck, an eyewitness places him at the scene of the killing, and under coaxing he confesses. Then he grabs a gun and shoots himself. The horrified Nicholson doesn't believe the confession and thinks Del Toro was innocent. He pledges to the dead girl's parents that he'll find the killer. Nicholson settles into an old café. Soon a beautiful younger woman (Robin Wright Penn) and her daughter move in with him and they become a family. The problem is that Penn's daughter is a beautiful eight-year-old girl child who reminds Nicholson of the murder victim. He goes to such unusual lengths to protect her from the killer he believes to be still at large and operating in the vicinity that he alienates his friends on the police force and drives Penn and her daughter away. He uses the girl as bait to trap the rapist who, the film suggests, was killed in a highway accident while hurrying to meet and harm the girl. Of course, no one realizes that the charred corpse in the burning car is the rapist, and that Nicholson's anxiety was justified. The last scene has a half-mad, fainéant Nicholson sitting in the dust in front of his now-dilapidated and ruined café, drunk, gesticulating wildly and talking to himself -- a lone and tragic figure in the wind.I was unable to figure out what all the fuss was about. I don't mind tragedies but they have to develop out of something, don't they? Nicholson promises to catch the killer/rapist. He does what he can, even at the risk of his own family, and he appears to succeed, though he doesn't know it, and it costs him everything he has. Where is his tragic flaw? His downfall, like the car accident that kills the rapist, seems entirely arbitrary. It doesn't flow out of anything that has preceded it. Okay, let Nicholson fall, but give us a reason for it, some hamartia -- Othello's jealousy or Caesar's ambition -- even on a small scale. But what do we carry away from this film? Don't make promises you can't keep? Sometimes a film can get away with this kind of diffuse narrative if it's handled stylishly. (I still have to concentrate in order to figure out the plot of "Chinatown.") But this isn't handled with any kind of artistry. The director, Sean Penn, sets the story in and around Reno but we get no sense of place. Reno is a raffish, vulgar little city. The surroundings, the Great Basin Desert and the Sierra Nevada, are raw and majestic. But, aside from a few shots of Nicholson fishing, we don't get much of an impression of it. I'm not asking for pretty postcards, just some atmosphere.Nicholson gives a performance that is slow and stiff or, let's say, thoughtful, but mostly he's Jake Gittes with a hangover. Robin Wright Penn is more animated, perhaps the liveliest person in the movie, and she's just about the right age. The little girl is enchanting, like a painting of a beautiful child, and she seems like a natural actress. Other actors of note have small roles that don't add much. But Benicio Del Toro is great as the barely interpretable Indian, his face mostly hidden by a voluminous witch-like growth of hair.Penn seems to love close ups. There are a plenitude of close up. Not just close ups of faces, but close ups of eyes and close ups of noses and close ups of ornaments dangling from rear-view mirrors. There's a close up of a hook being removed from a trout's mouth. Is "claustrophobia" supposed to be a THEME of some sort? The motivations are weak as well. What is it that convinces Nicholson's cop that Del Toro is innocent? And why does Nicholson so stupidly swear on a home-made cross, "pledge your soul's salvation", that he will catch the killer? When Nicholson learns from the little girl that she has made a date with the "wizard" who gives her bon-bons, he lets her bicycle to the picnic site, and then surrounds it with policemen, including a SWAT team. At no time is she in any danger. So why does this drive Robin Wright Penn into hysterics so that she beats Nicholson, clutches her wailing daughter, and leaves him flat? Why doesn't she just heap her calumny upon him. Or make him take ANOTHER pledge on a home-made cross that he'll never do it again.The film is sluggish and unenlightening. The story remains an interesting promise, unfulfilled.</fullReview>

Okay, sometimes there were some moments where I thought be careful and so on but that was all. One advice to all parents of children: Pay attention to your kids. The running time is no doubt too long and the movie as I said too slow paced. I missed suspense and some action. Then me and my wife were disappointed about the end because I expected a more emotional and intense countdown. I cannot understand why they ruined it and didn't therefore develop a better one.

Here I was, asked to believe that a retired detective would take such a foolish pledge upon a matchstick cross. Then he spends all he has to live in a town, set up a little girl as bait,all while wooing her mother.At least we could be shown why he would do that. Perhaps a past case in which he became over involved or something. And why would a SWAT team from another city stake out the woods with little evidence? Just too many unbelievable things going on for the ending that it has. Acting? Good, but what good is it if the story is stupid? The story was unbelievable, I didn't buy the line and if you do, that is up to you. But I expect some good reasons to buy in to such a strung out story like this one. I say to you, don't waste your time watching this nonsense. It didn't last long at the cinema for good reasons.I don't see it jumping off the shelves at the stores either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a remake, folks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And a very bad one of The Cold Light of Day, a fantastic Dutch film starring Richard E. Grant (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Gosford Park). I saw the original not long after it first hit the shelves in the mid-90's and was appalled by this watered-down tripe. Sean Penn duplicated the original film nearly scene for scene here. Hollywood irks the crap out of me when they remake films and, by omission, pass them off as original creations. Far worse than this was The Vanishing, another superb Dutch film vs. the dumbed down American version, and Insomnia (I was ashamed that Chris Nolan, a great director, would stoop to remaking such a terrific film). Remakes CAN be good (King Kong, The Thing), but generally remakes are for the lazy director: instead of creating, they're Xeroxing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether music or film more powerfully compels the human spirit is anyone's guess. A high-volume blast through Deep Purple's "Highway Star" is as likely to result in a hideously expensive speeding ticket as is an HD viewing of "Rocky" apt to start one on a program of vigorous exercise. One imagines, after suffering through "The Pledge," that the film's purpose consists entirely of instilling misery in the joyful and moving the sorrowful along an expedient line from despondency to suicide. Persons interested in an emotional experience similar to that precipitated by "The Pledge" are encouraged to scrutinize the corpse of a beloved pet decomposing in the street after having been run down by a drunken neighbor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) A retiring police chief pledges to catch the killer of a young child.Sean Penn has created something with his vision that didn't stimulate me at all. It is far too murky, gloomy and excruciatingly boring to get into. I love Jack Nicholson, especially when he's on top of his game. His performance isn't the problem in this one, just the script. I had a miserable experience, so much that I couldn't finish watching it. I really do try to finish all movies, regardless of how horrible it is. I couldn't finish this one. Others may get into Penn's style, but it isn't for me. The long running time certainly doesn't help matters. Recommended for die hard Nicholson fans only!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a movie night I can never reclaim--DISAPPOINT ENDING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this film is actually captivating. It held my interest all the way 'til the VERY BITTER end. Simply put, there is no redemption. Some reviews I've read site the character development as the movie's strength. However, there's not much development. There are just hints here and there that there's something else at play with the character's psyche.It had so much potential. The plot uses the brutal murder of little girls to really pull at your heart strings and get you to invest your emotion. And the only kind of resolve you're left with pretty much screws the good guy.My husband and I do a movie night almost every single night. We can deal with most movies and chalk them up to however their supposed to be taken. But this...this one had us feeling like we really wasted our time. Again, not because it was bad but because it had so much potential just thrown into the black hole of a very disappointing ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One other reviewer said this was gripping, oh my, I was bored to tears, for most of the movie nothing really happens. The acting is wooden. Please do not waste your time. I can not believe that this movie got a rating of 7 on IMDb, that is ridiculous. This is why I gave the movie a 3 just to bring down that stupid rating. Actually I think the movie is worth about a 4 or 5. I wish I could get back the last hour and a half of my life. I keep reading that Nicholson is excellent in it, but I don't see it. It was basically Jack mumbling, fishing, and smoking. Jesus, this guy was better in his previous worst "as good as it gets". As for the other actors, they each got about 90 seconds of air time.I guarantee that if you showed this movie on an airplane, people would throw up and try and jump out of the airplane. Sean Penn takes what could have been one of Jack Nicholson's best performances and screws it up with a movie that just drags on and on and on. It is beyond bad. It is bad AND stupid AND has a terrible script. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Nicholson always gives 110% of himself in his roles, even he couldn't save this one. This by far is the most depressing and boring movie I've ever seen in my life. Not only is the scenery dull and uninteresting but it's not even enough to prop up the weak script. If this film doesn't leave you feeling hopeless, nothing will. From the start it's melancholy and barely keeps your interest but you do expect at least something to happen. As the story goes on you get inside the character and simply want to quit the role before the film finishes, yes it's truly that bad. Normally I'd never give any Jack Nicholson movie any less than a 7 but this one is so horrible I considered not even giving it a review but zero's on the scale are not an option. Save your time and money on this one and find something that's more entertaining AND interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a real bad remake of a 1958 film (see: "Es geschah am hellichten Tage" - "It happened in broad daylight"). The original play by Dürrenmatt is distorted beyond recognition, the happy end of the film/play has been diverted to total depression. Please don't waste the time looking at this awful movie. Too bad that a good actor like Nicholson had to participate in it. The 1958 movie is real good (assuming that you understand German ;-)I saw the movie yesterday on German cable TV and was very disappointed by it. There is generally no use transferring a genuine Switzerland story to the US, changing a Jurassian into a Native American, Graubünden into Monash county and so on. And changing the sense of the story completely. People should never be allowed to do such things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without exaggerating, THE best American film in a very long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to look hard these days but they're still made! Ambitious, daring and beautifully elaborated films that look in fact anti-American due to their sense of reality and non-commercial goals. The third film by Sean Penn as a director easily could have been the umpteenth cop-chases-serial killer movie but instead, it became a deeply intriguing and thematically rich psychological portrait about a man collapsing under his own mental scars. Jack Nicholson, who hasn't acted this impressively since "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, stars as the cop Jerry Black who occupies with the murder case of an 8-year-old child on the day he's supposed to retire. Totally overpowered by the sadness and desperation of the child's mother, he promises her he won't rest until he arrests the murderer. What follows is a slow and intense picture in which the viewer witnesses how Jerry becomes the more and more introvert and obsessed by the hunt, even willing to risk the safety of his new girlfriend and her daughter.If you're expecting wild car chases and boisterous gunfights, this really isn't your type of cop-thriller as Penn also takes to opportunity to "return" to the beauty of the unspoiled American outlands and its inhabitants. Brilliant music and absolutely stunning camera-work by Chris Menges stresses the depressing tone of the story extra, without downgrading into a sentimental requiem. Even though several sequences (like when Jerry faces the emotionally torn mother) are seriously touching, the sentiment isn't cheaply exploited, as it is the case in so many other social dramas. "The Pledge" is based on a novel by the Swiss writer Friedrich Dürenmatt that already formed the premise of European cinema highlights. Considering Penn's film flopped at the American registers, you can only conclude that many types of audiences aren't ready for this type of storytelling. Quite a shame because I rarely seen a movie that approaches the style of early 70's independent cinema this efficiently. Sean Penn, whose style and professionalism here reminds you Terrence Mallick, should have received the Oscar, if it were only for rewarding the way he guided his all-star cast through this wonderful movie. For the first time in decades, Jack Nicholson depends on his true acting talents instead of his charismatic grimaces and the supportive cast contains lots of strong actors and actresses who add extra brilliance to this tale. Benicio Del Toro, Tom Noonan, Helen Mirren, Sam Sheppard, Harry Dean Stanton and even Mickey Rourke make remarkable appearances even though their screen time is extremely limited. And it also clearly shows that Sean Penn didn't cast his wife Robin Wright Penn just to do her a favor, but because she's an extremely talented actress, capable of giving strong feedback to Jack Nicholson's tormented protagonist.Without exaggerating, I dare to see "The Pledge" is a visual and emotional masterpiece that should have reached a much wider audience. I honestly can't remember the last American film that had such an impact on me. In all honesty I should mention there are a few minor flaws ? like the use of some stereotype characters ? but these are just forgettable aspects featuring in a magnificent wholesome. If you consider yourself to be a fan of superior cinema, this film belongs on your shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Penn delivers a highly original (albeit flawed) "serial killer movie" - or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some very minor spoilers!Sean Penn must have a thing for revenge films. His first film with Jack Nicholson, "The Crossing Guard," was about a man whose daughter is murdered by a drunk driver, and he takes revenge. Penn himself has starred in many revenge movies, including recently "21 Grams" and "Mystic River" to some extent. Which is fine with me, because revenge films are one of my favorite genres and I always like unique ones. "The Pledge" - loosely based on a 1958 foreign novel - is extremely original. Penn has taken together some clichés and tossed them in a blender, turning everything upside down.Nicholson gives one of his finest performances as Det. Jerry Black (no relation to Jack!), who - on the day of his retirement party - swears to a mother that he'll find the unidentified man who murdered her daughter.Soon a rapist (Benicio Del Toro) shows up and confesses to the crime, but Jerry is unconvinced and takes his own time to hunt down the "true killer" of the girl - and a string of other nearby similar murders...The movie features some fantastic cameo performances by the likes of Del Toro, Harry Dean Stanton, Sam Shepard and Mickey Rourke (who, as always, proves in no more than two minutes on-screen that he is one of the finest living actors and deserves better roles - just see "Angel Heart" for his excellent performance!).Overall the ending of "The Pledge" really blew me away. I didn't like it because it's sad, but I DID like it because it makes you think. Most thrillers nowadays - particularly serial killer films - start with a central concept, move towards absurdity and end with a disappointing big-bang finale where the good guys win and finally prove they were right all along with their suspicions.Not here. This is an ultra-depressing movie, but one that definitely makes you sit there and wonder to yourself: What just happened? If you thought the finale of "Se7en" was unexpected, just watch this.Penn does have stylistic flaws - he's a bit too pretentious at times and almost seems to purposely reach for the unusual in an effort to make his film stand out, which - at times - almost seems a bit snotty or something. But overall I really felt he brought a strong presence to this movie, regardless of its flaws (which include a runtime which could easily have benefited from some major edits - there a number of scenes that aren't necessary at all and only slow down the pace).All in all, really good and highly recommended, with some of the best performances of the decade and a really gut-wrenching surprise ending unlike any other - but the movie is not without its errors and as a result I can't say it's as good as "Se7en." It is better than "Silence of the Lambs," though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson's most snooze worthy movie. A serial killer movie that has no coherence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is hands down one of the worst Jack Nicholson movies ever, give me Wolf, give me the way underrated The Two Jakes. But god, this is bad, and it's even more baffling when Sean Penn put out a similar flick with Nicholson in the lead as a determined man and it was a better movie than this. I'm talking about 1995's The Crossing Guard, which was a really good emotional movie, this I don't even know what emotion I'm suppose to feel. I can't even go into how horrible the ending is, and I'm not going to. Let's just say it was one of the worst anti-climatic bullshit endings ever and I felt like hitting my head against something for wasting over two hours of my time watching the countless arty scenes of Nicholson fishing. How many times did this movie cut to him fishing, 10 or something. Nicholson gives the best performance he can, but given the material he's provided is so head scratchingly bad, he can't seem to make the movie better. Then there's the wasted cameos from Bendicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke, Tom Noonan and Vanessa Redgrave. Del Toro does some prime scenery chewing and Rourke provides a brief exceptional performance before sinking away. The acting's good, but it's all in a search for a better script. The directing too,I tell you go watch The Indian Runner or The Crossing Guard for a better Sean Penn movie. He's done way better than this movie, way. And yet this movie, gets so much critical recognition, for what, for being an arty pretentious movie that goes nowhere spinning its wheels. I tell you never seek this movie out, it will just frustrate you, go watch About Schmidt or As Good as it gets, The Shining, Chinatown, The Crossing Guard, or The Indian Runner. Hell, go watch Wolf. This is one of the worst movies of 2001, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise of this movie was good. A cop, Jack Nichols retires but made a pledge to find the killer of a little girl that was murdered a while back. He is haunted by it and made fun of by fellow officers.Jack goes off into the country and buys a local store near where the little girl got killed. He has a drawing she made of a tall man in a dark suit giving her something that looks like pine cones. Jack comes to think this is the man that killed her and other children by getting close to them and offering them gifts.Jack befriends barmaid and her young daughter. He is very protective of the child. He finds out that she has been given little cookies from a man that tells her he is a wizard and not to tell anyone. Jack gets the police to keep track of this girl and they are on a stake out by the river where she is to meet the wizard. The police feel he is wrong and they leave the scene of where they were watching the girl. Jack is disappointed, he knows something is up and the killer will be coming. He starts acting nuts. He is a good actor but I felt like he over-acted in playing this troubled policeman. I watched to the end. I guess I am used to movies with a good or satisfactory conclusion and all ends well. This was not the case. Very disappointing ending but then again Sean Penn is the director and I don't think he has all his marbles anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is retiring. While in his farewell party, his colleagues are informed that an eight years old girl has been raped and murdered. Jerry decides to go to the crime scene with his colleagues. There, they realized that the child parents have not been informed about the crime, and Jerry goes to their home to give them the bad news. The child's mother Margaret Larsen (Patricia Clarkson) challenges him to promise that he would catch the criminal. The fulfillment of this promise becomes an obsession to Jerry. A tragic and dark end finishes his haunting. This thriller is really great, having a excellent director, cast and screenplay. The end of the story is not for all tastes, but I liked it a lot. Fortunately this film was not produced by a big Hollywood producer, otherwise the end of the story would be commercial and the film would lose its impact. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `A Promessa' (`The Promise')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumbled Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, a cop thriller starring Jack Nicholson, was a jumbled waste of time, although the location Nevada (actually British Columbia), was beautiful. Nicholson, a homicide detective, is called out on a murder of a little girl while at his retirement party. His younger colleagues are dirt bag cops who are willing to pin the murder on anyone from whom they can coerce a confession. The obvious choice was a retarded Indian. Jack promises the turkey farming mother on "hazard to his mortal soul" that he will find the killer. The theological reasoning for doing this is unclear. Wouldn't it have been better and more sensible after a lifetime of doing this work to say "Hey, lady, I'll do what I can."Jack becomes convinced it is not the Indian. He is right, but of course no one believes him, especially not the turkeys he works with. He buys a run down gas station based on his suspicion that the killer frequents the area. He befriends a woman and her 10 year old child that fits perfectly the profile of the killer's victim and then puts the swing-set out front as bait. The killer finally takes the bait but in a weird turn of events is killed on the way to his crime and Jack is left without lady love or credibility with his erstwhile colleagues. We last see him drinking his brains out on the front stoop of the gas station. Whoopee.The accidental demise of the killer was necessary because if it has been a conventional grab and chase and shoot em up it would have been reduced to the usual kind of cop show ending. "Book him, Danno".The character of the killer was not adequately drawn either. Many things in this film do not make sense except as a superficial means to moving the plot along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know who the murderer is ( ****** SPOILER ******* ) it`s the character played by Tom Noonan who was killed in a car crash ( ***** END SPOILER ******* ) I can understand why some people thought it was someone else because Sean Penn`s pretentious directing and a woefully underdeveloped script left me and no doubt plenty of other people confused throughout. It`s obvious from the outset Jerry isn`t a paedophile or a child killer so why does the therapist indicate he could be ? Jerry Black is a fine upstanding cop so why are his colleagues sceptical about his suspicions ? Ah because he used to have a drink problem according to one cop . Perhaps but we see no sign of this drink problem on screen so Jerry Black is a character without any real foundation , we can only go on what sketchy info we get from other characters . This is a symptom of a poor screenplay .In TRAFFIC Benecio Del Toro gives a very memorable performance as does he here. However while his acting in TRAFFIC is memorable for the right reasons here it`s memorable for all wrong reasons . Does anyone remember that character from the Bugs Bunny cartoons the one from another planet that is dressed like a roman soldier ? Compare the voices from that character and the one played by Del Toro , I swear I`m not making this up but they`ve got the exact same voice ! Seriously THE PLEDGE is a mess . What might have been a good study of obsession and honour is ruined by the director and screenwriter</fullReview>
