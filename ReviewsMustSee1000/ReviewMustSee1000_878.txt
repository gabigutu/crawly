		<shortDescription>An underrated jewel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the box-office failure of "Memoirs of an Invisible Man" in 1992 forced him to work in TV (with the movie "Body Bags"), director John Carpenter returned to his roots in the horror genre and began working in what would be his return to the big screen with the 1995 horror film, "In the Mouth of Madness", a movie that would become the third and final part of his Apocalypse Trilogy (an unrelated series of horror films started with "The Thing" and followed by "Prince of Darkness"). Together with writer Michael De Luca, Carpenter crafted a film that pays honest tribute to the genre's original root: the written word.In the film, Sam Neill plays John Trent, a freelance insurance investigator hired to find out if the disappearance of horror writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) is part of a complicated marketing plan, as he is the most popular writer at the moment. However, it seems that Cane has really disappeared, as not even his publishers know where he is. Together with Cane's editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), Trent will attempt to find out where Cane is, but will discover that the famed horror writer has a deep dark secret hidden in the apparently not so fictional town of "Hobb's End".Inspired by legendary horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, De Luca's story is a powerful ride to the dark side where the line of fiction and reality disappear. Themes such as the duality of reality and fantasy and the concepts of God and free will are carried through the film's remarkably well-done script, becoming one of the most interesting, intelligent and insightful horror stories ever put on film. As a tribute to Lovecraft, De Luca captures that atmosphere of dread and madness that was so characteristic of Lovecraft's works and that no film adaptation of his works has managed to capture.A fitting return to form, "In the Mouth of Madness" is again John Carpenter at his best, giving form to De Luca's imaginative script with amazing talent and an effective care for the story not seen since "The Thing". While the plot is clearly inspired on the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Carpenter completed the "tribute" by adding countless of references to Stephen King and Nigel Kneale (his own favorite writer), making "In the Mouth of Madness" a homage to writers of horror fiction. With great skill, Carpenter crafts a film that is never boring nor tiresome, and that even manages to transmit the feeling one would get by reading a book.Sam Neill delivers an excellent performance as John Trent, who incredulous of Cane's talent, enters the unknown and discovers the source of Cane's popularity. It is a very natural and believable performance that can give the chills as Neill makes his character to be so easy to be identified with. Jürgen Prochnow and Julie Carmen deliver both excellent performances too, although their characters receive few screen time (even for important supporting roles) as it is truly Neill who carries the film becoming the focus of the story."In the Mouth of Madness" is a haunting horror film that is both intelligent and effective thanks to Carpenter's expertise as director, and more than 10 years after is release it's hard to see why it failed at the box-office. While it's not a perfect film, it's a lot better than the average, and while it's true that it seems to lose some steam in the last third, the ending is really one of the best in horror history. Despite some quibbles with the special effects (as I think that Carpenter shows a lot more than what was needed), the film is overall a very well-done film that deserved a better reception in its day.With an excellent cast and a superb story, "In the Mouth of Madness" ends up as a really inventive story that proves that horror in film can deliver the same creative as it has in literature. An intelligent and twisted tale of horror, this homage to horror fiction makes a really great film. To most people, the name John Carpenter is (and will always be) related to the "Halloween" franchise, but personally, I find "The Thing" and this film as the best works of his career. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Insurance claims expert John Trent (Sam Neill) Goes off on a search for missing horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), convinced his disappearance is a hoax. Once Trent goes looking for the missing author, he's lead to Hobb's End, a supposedly fictional New England town, to discover that something very wrong is going on?and Sutter Cane is responsible. "In the Mouth of Madness" came as a delightful surprise to me.I rented the DVD solely because I'd been wandering the video store shelves for close to 45 minutes (I have a little too much free time) and figured I'd be kicked out so I grabbed a handful of movies. This was one of them, and let me tell you I'm sure glad I did, because this is a damn fine flick!To start, Sam Neill is excellent, as is Mr. Prochnow. The only bad performer here is Julie Carmen (Regina from Fright Night 2), who gives a wooden and thoroughly unconvincing "when-the-hell-do-I-get-my-paycheck?" performance. Michael De Luca's script is sharp enough to never takes itself too seriously, while at the same time it can be very scary and dark. John Carpenter's direction was top-notch. Some of the guy's recent films have been?disappointing, to say the least, but here he delivers the gore, suspense and action like a pro.The special effects are great. The boys over at KNB effects studios cook up lots of monsters, gore and slime, delivering the goods as usual. The creatures here are indeed reminiscent of Carpenter's "The Thing", their creative and all look very lovecraftian in design. At times the film can be extremely scary. The old trick of using darkness and shadows to convey creepiness that Carpenter's so good at are present and good as ever. "In the mouth of madness" pulled all the right strings and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended.8/10.Oh, and great ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Mind of John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a treat of a film this was. It is witty, intelligent, and scary. The basic plot premise is anything but basic as the line between reality and fantasy is almost indistinguishable through most of the film. What is going on? Who really knows...I'm not sure even director John Carpenter knows. But what we do get is a guessing game of what is real and un-real in a very stylish, sophisticated, almost bizarre fashion. The film opens in a mental asylum with protagonist Sam Neill being put in a padded cell whilst in a straight-jacket. The setting is larger than life. The characters around Neill are caricatures for the most part. John Glover plays a doctor(Doctor Saperstein...a possible homage to Rosemary's Baby) with complete camp. David Warner, another doctor, begins talking to Neill and asking him about what happened. The rest of the film then details what Neill did working with regards to a lost author named Sutter Cane. The plot is much more complicated than that and may take subsequent viewings to fully understand WHAT can be understood. The end result is at the very least a very gratifying one as Carpenter constructs a dream-like story that has obvious roots in both the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. The acting is good all around...Neill is excellent as John Trent. He makes a very believable presence in a sea of un-reality. Julie Carmen is also very good in her role. Look for Charlton Heston as a publisher and Bernie Casey in a cameo as well. Kudos to Mr. Carpenter for bringing his visions of horror to the silver screen once again. This may be his best film...certainly his most thought-provoking and sophisticated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Carpenter's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta say that when I first saw this movie, it blew me away. It's not as good as The Thing, but it's a great horror movie. It has everything that makes John Carpenter the master of horror. He is one man that can still scare the crap out of me.In The Mouth Of Madness is about Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow), this century's most widely-read author. When Cane disappears, his publishing company Arcane, run by the very gruff-looking Jackson Harglow (Charleton Heston), enlists John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance investigator, to find him. Trent agrees after he is almost killed by an axe-wielding maniac that turns out to be Cane's agent. He and Arcane editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) find Cane's fictional town of Hobb's End and then all hell breaks loose.First things first. I loved the opening score. It starts off very simplistic and then goes into full hard rock mode. Excellent music throughout, too.Onto the characters. Before I say anything, I have to say the Sam Neill is one of my favorite actors. He can truly act, expressing a full range of emotions: angry, annoyed, happy, cocky, flabbergasted, etc. You name it, he can pull it off. Anyway, Sam Neill plays John Trent perfectly. This is a guy who's good at his job and he likes it. He can see right through you; see what you're capable of. It's fun to watch him try to make sense out of all the madness around him, especially once he arrives in Hobb's End. Julie Carmen, unfortunately, looks as if she's about to fall asleep or that she's stoned (I don't know which, probably both) throughout the whole movie. She serves her purpose though. Let's talk about the real star of this movie. As with Sam Neill, Jurgen Prochnow is perfect as Sutter Cane. I can't think of anyone who could have played the part better. This man's got the look, the voice, and the attitude to make Cane extremely believable. If anyone can play the bringer of the apocalypse, it's this guy. Charleton Heston looks like he's got something stuck up his butt, but plays Harglow just fine (I think this actually helps his character!). I personally think he could beat the crap out of Sutter Cane if it really came down to it. The other characters are all minor, but one deserves an honorable mention. David Warner as Dr. Wrenn is great. This man can handle himself and can give Sam Neill a run for his money (even though he doesn't try to here).The gore and special effects are fantastic. It's nice to see a movie in the 90's where CGI is non-existent. (The only two movies where CGI has tricked me into thinking what I was watching was real (or at least animatronic) are Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers. Most of the time, I (or anyone else for that matter) can spot CGI easily. Not so in those two movies.) Anyway, (I go off on tangents a lot, so get used to it) everything from the dead/undead cop, the axe-maniac's eyes, the creature that's part of Cane's back, and the vile abominations, was superb. Nice work guys at KNB! No complaints here.I will admit that Carpenter got me with almost every "boo" scare in the movie, particularly the one at the end (used to a far better effect here than at the end of Resident Evil). But those scares are only temporary. When someone says a movie was "really scary", I want to see something that will stick with me and always be in the back of my mind. These are the best kind of scares which define "true" horror. We don't get very many of these types of scares anymore, which really makes me mad. But just as I had hoped, Carpenter pulls it off here (and in a few of his other movies, too) perfectly.Finally, I loved the ending! Apocalyptic endings always so much more satisfying than happy endings. Carpenter is always known for his "hook" endings and this was one of his best.I've said it before and I'll say it again, John Carpenter was, is, and always will be the master of horror. 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review contains some slight spoilers. Many people say that John Carpenter does either GREAT or VERY BAD films. I think his only two duds were Escape from LA and Village of the Damned. But he is one of my two fave directors (David Lynch is the other) and this is one of his best movies.It may seem confusing at first but trust me?it does make sense. The premise of this film fascinates me. What happens when the line between fantasy and reality disappears and creatures from fiction can exist in the real world? Wow! This makes the basis of a totally cool movie.John Carpenter always used 2.35:1 photography and in this film we get a screen filled with creepy imagery and cool locations. The film was shot entirely in Canada in 1993 and was released in 1995. It is set basically in the city and in the fictional town of Hobbs End. When I say that Hobbs End is fictional I really mean it. In the film the town does not exist but Sam Neill ends up there. Some dark magick/logic at work methinks.This is definitely a horror film for the thinking audience. If you like your horror deep, intriguing and downbeat without being depressing?you'll LOVE this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scary And Frightening Film And One Of The Best Horror Films Of The 90s. Another Carpenter Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best.In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy.The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter.The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B.In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter delivers again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In The Mouth of Madness" is one of John Carpenter's better flicks. It features the usually bland Sam Neill in a surprisingly good and likable performance, and is packed with oodles of intriguing concepts and spiffy details. The music is good (it was cowritten by Carpenter) and the movie has a great look. There are also lots and lots of ginchy make-up effects, and while some are better than others (the kid who turns into an old man looks like a kid wearing a Spencer's Gifts Old Man mask and fright wig), but the sheer abundance of them make this unique.Neill plays John Trent, a no-nonsense insurance investigator who loves his job and has disdain for most of humanity- but with a sense of humor. He's sent to find a missing mega-selling author Sutter Caine (Jurgen Prochnow, in a role that would have been kick-ass if played by Stephen King), whose books are a nation-wide craze. Trent ends up in Hobb's End, a town right out of Caine's books (literally) where the morbid tales of fiction are becoming reality.The movie, although muddled in places, too repetitive (on purpose), and too reliant on flash forwards, has lots of things to say about the perception of reality and it interesting and entertaining.The supporting cast is good: John Glover and David Warner are psychiatrists, a subdued Charleton Heston is a publisher, and Bernie "Revenge of the Nerds" Casey is Trent's boss, but the highlight is Frances Bay as the sweet Mrs. Pickman. She provides the film's high points and ends up looking like something from the director's "The Thing". The weak link in the cast is the leading lady, Julie Carmen, who delivers every line like she just chugged a case of Nyquil. In addition to her lousy acting, she's dressed in ugly outfits and has a kind of "in-your-face" ugliness. In one scene there is a special effects dummy head in place of Carmen's and the dummy head out-acts her.This is not as great as "The Thing" but better than "They Live" as far as John Carpenter's paranoid, reality-bending flicks go, and is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2/3 brilliant, final third not so brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to go deeply into the story of In the Mouth of Madness without spoiling it. It's best to know absolutely nothing at all. That was my experience with this film and I was completely blown away. The story is very original and inventive and also has a good critique about the influences of the horror franchise.The first 2/3 of the film are masterful, the old John Carpenter seems to have returned at full force. Effortlessly creating a creepy atmosphere, astounding visuals, some gross-out horror combined with a Chandleresque detective mystery, In the Mouth of Madness seems to be competing for the title of Carpenter's best ever film. But the final third is a letdown, the conclusion not satisfactory and the terribly slow pacing kills the momentum so memorably established before.Still, overall this is one effective horror film made by a master filmmaker. Although it misses the bull's eye, it ranks as the best of Carpenter's later works. He has a good cast to work with here; Sam Neill is terrific in the lead, Jurgen Prochnow is creepy and it's fun to see Charlton Heston in a small role.For horror fans and Carpenter disciples this film is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to spoil anything so i'll keep this short. It's about an insurance investigator (Sam Neill) who seeks out to find a famous horror writer after his books seems to have a very odd effect on his readers, only to actually find the village in his novels. Suddenly it seems like his books are coming true. Now I'll stop there and leave the rest for you to see. This movie is both a tribute to the genre (and maybe a slight parody) and literally an existentialism story(you know what I mean when you finish the movie). This movie is scary, horrifying, intelligent, well written, well acted, and also somehow a bit funny. (Warning, this is not for the light hearted, freakiest thing I've ever seen, but still made me laugh somehow)I can only say in conclusion Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter at his most surreal, most sickening, and, in his own devilish way, most self-deprecating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think In the Mouth of Madness falls into that column of John Carpenter films that fans of his will either like a lot or wont, and I could understand the points made for the latter. It is a little hard to get into, at first, as being a very strong film based on the sharply timed shocks and paranoia of Carpenter's horror as a director as well as the ideas presented by the writer, and it does veer into going into the same wild level of deliriousness that soon enough becomes the lead character. But it's a work as well where Carpenter is testing himself, and succeeding in a carefree but controlled way, where he goes for having his cake and eating it too. He gets to throw up on the screen some grisly (and, as a possible tip of the hat to the groundbreaking effects from the Thing, a sometimes funny knock-off) special creature effects and with some masterful displays in editing through the images of abstractions into the character's subconscious, while questioning what he's doing all the time, or at least the genre he and others (notably Stephen King) make their bread and butter.It's a sort of slightly smarter pulp sci-fi/horror piece, not quite at the insane brilliance of They Live though perhaps in its more deliberate fashion a little creepier, as investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is investigating the disappearance of a severely popular horror novelist, who's books sometimes make people go a little nuts. Trent sees this first-hand from novelist Sutter Cane's agent, who comes at him wielding an axe (it's one of those pure points in the film that mixed the macabre and satire, something Craven didn't quite get at with New Nightmare). He thinks it's a hoax, and soon discovers that he may be in a (fictional?) town called Hobbs End in New Hampshire. What he finds, in typical Carpenter fashion, is describable as being a psychological flip-flopper, where Trent goes from thinking it's all a gag with it being very elaborate, to it suddenly not being, at all. Creatures (supplied wonderfully by KNB) start popping out, disgusting ones that aren't much human, and it even gets to Trett's female companion/literary liaison on the trip. Soon Cane is found in some dank cellar (Jurgen Purchnow, one of Carpenter's most chilling villains in how subtle he is), and he has a new book ready for Trett to bring to the world...This isn't quite where the film gets weird, though it's probably a little before or a little after this point, and the kind of weirdness I had been hoping to build up. Although it does get close for writer De Luca to being shaky with balancing really dark humor- however in small doses, and depending on how seriously one takes the more overt horror elements- and at the plight of Trent's mind-set in the midst of total Armageddon, Carpenter levels the playing field without missing too many beats. I kept having my mouth hang open either in a 'what the hell' mode or just in sort of plain shock. But it's an entertaining mix and match all the way for a genre fan, and Sam Neill is definitely up for the challenge of playing as well level-headed and rational Trett for the first half, then slowly but surely descending into his own subconscious state of peril- or, perhaps, Trent losing sight on what is perceived as reality or not. Only Neill could go between serious dramatic roles to films like this and Jurassic Park, where his characters' confidence as the practical pragmatist starts to waver as a descent into disaster goes further and further.What Carpenter ends on in the last section of his "apocalypse" trilogy isn't necessarily a closed-and-shut ending either; I sense that he wants things to be a little closer to the Thing's end, where it's all doom and gloom but there's a wink to the protagonist's state of mind. Trett's last minutes wandering the streets and going into the movie theater watching himself doesn't really spell anything conclusive, I think, which adds all the more to the fun and intrigue. He could just be still in his hospital room, still in the world that dismisses Cane as pulp-sensationalist trash, albeit successful pulp-sensationalist trash (a little relevant today, eg Dan Brown), and not among the total bat-s*** mess that the world has become while locked in his padded room. It's a question left to the viewer, and a smart one to put up in a film that has by this point thrived mostly on its own sensationalism as well, tongue-in-cheek in the guise of crazy small-town break-out scenario. As a Carpenter fan, I say, bring it on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Changing the Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The efficient and skeptical freelance insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is hired by the publisher Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston) to find where the famous writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) might be. After writing a series of best-sellers in the horror genre, affecting the reason and causing disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in the readers, Sutter has simply vanished near the release of his new novel, "Horror in Hobb's End". There is a mass hysteria of his anxious fans waiting for the new release, and John believes that his disappearance is a strategy of marketing. John follows his instincts and travels with Cane's editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), to New Hampshire seeking for the apparently fictional town of Hobb's End. While driving along the night, Linda reaches the Hobb's End, and John discloses that Sutter Cane has unleashed a powerful evil force in the black church of the mysterious town, and his twisted imagination is changing the reality and perception of those that read his novels."In the Mouth of Madness" is a journey to fear and madness through the darkness of a twisted mind of a writer. This story follows the style of "Twilight Zone" and actually shows how a writer with the support of the media is able to manipulate hearts and minds. Further, there is a certain criticism in the values and standards of the society where those who think differently or have a different behavior are outcast or even considered crazy. John Carpenter is one of my favorite directors and Sam Neil is perfect in the role of a skeptical man, used to find schemes and con everywhere, having difficulties to accept what is happening. The conclusion is very dark and without perspective to mankind. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "? Beira da Loucura" ("On the Edge of Madness")Note: On 23 June 2015 I saw this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film terrifying. Sure there is no man in a stripy jumper coming to 'stab you up' and no one is tied to a chair and worked on with an angle grinder.This film makes excellent use of those iconic every day objects that become scary in the correct context. (E.G Clowns, mannequins, Victorian prams or a child's ball bouncing down a stair case.) People who have seen this will know what I mean when I say the word bicycle.Rather than physical peril this film uses assaults on your grasp of reality. mine obviously isn't that great as I find this movie petrifying.The production of the film isn't great and there are more exciting films out there. But if you have some imagination, are a little romantic and like being scared without having to sit through some poor soul forced to spectate live at their own autopsy, then this deserves every one of its eight stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter does Lovecraft!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carpenter is a genius of horror movies. They are not just mindless boo scares and gory torture porn, they have a story, they draw you in, they make you part of it. That is why In the Mouth of Madness is ironic, since it is about people getting drawn in someone else's story.What I didn't know, but I suspected, was that this film was inspired by H.P.Lovecraft. And if you know anything about that guy, not only was he an influential horror writer himself, kickstarting the horror genre in the 20th century, but his books and stories are almost impossible to translate to screen, as they are always introspections of people of a certain type, people that would feel really outdated and out of place in the modern world. Yet the writer does manage to bring H.P.'s grand madness to the screen, by mixing it up with a little Stephen King magic.Indeed, this is like a horror fan's dream come true: Carpenter making a movie to answer the question "What would Stephen King write if he had Lovecraft's madness?". The writer is Michael de Luca, who also wrote the script for Lawnmower Man, another movie about breaking the limits of reality.Now, the film is not perfect. It is a bit cheesy at times and the movie feels dated, even for 1994. The cast helps bring it to life. Even if Sam Neil is basically carrying the film by his lonesome, you can still enjoy Jurgen Prochnow, Charlton Heston and David Warner in secondary roles, as well as a kind of weakly written role for Fright Night's Julie Carmen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not insane. You hear me? I'M NOT INSANE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second favorite horror film of all time mainly because it still weirds me out (a horror movie plus in my book) and it reminds me of the work of our lord - H.P. Lovecraft.Sam Neil is a great actor and before watching this, I had only seen him in dramas and thrillers, so I did not know what to expect - believe me, it is the best way with this film. I actually caught the film (on TV) at the point when he begins his journey in the car with Linda. "Another road movie" I remember thinking to myself - hah! Was I in for a shock/good time.It involves an insurance detective named Trent (Neil), who is asked to investigate a mysterious horror novelist called Sutter Cane (by ape-hater, Charlton Heston). Unfortunately, Cane's work has a nasty habit of turning its' reader insane in the membrane. So Trent teams up with Linda styles, a foxy brunette to search for the strange one, and believe me things do get strange.This film seams like a dream, no... a nightmare.Is this reality...or not?Oh damn, I've poo-poo'd myself again.

		<shortDescription>"Do you read Sutter Cane?" - the great Lovecraftian homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this movie is the best and most faithful to the works of the late cosmic horror author H.P. Lovecraft not just in the appearance of the monsters and the plot ideas, but in the idea that we are all so small and insignificant to the horrible things that we have no knowledge of. There are a few flaws in it, but I don't let them get in the way of a great movie.The movie begins with John Trent (Sam Neill) being dragged into an insane asylum in a straitjacket, trying to tell the orderlies that he's not insane. He is visited by Dr. Wren (David Warner), who is trying to help get him out of there. When asked how he got to the hospital, Trent tells him about his job as a freelance insurance investigator and that it all started with the disappearance of Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow). At the diner, Robbie (Bernie Casey), who runs the insurance company Trent worked at, is at a diner trying to convince him to start working for him and tells him that there's a claim that Sutter Cane is missing that cost millions. Suddenly, an axe-wielding maniac smashes the diner window and asks Trent, "Do you read Sutter Cane?" before he's shot to death by police. Later, Trent is told by Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) that Cane's books have a mentally scarring effect on his less stable readers. He discovers a couple nights later that Hobb's End, the town from many of Cane's novels is real, and starts to see the nightmarish truth behind the strange behavior of his readers ... and his own existence.Really creepy movie that deserves to have others similar to it, and a great homage to one of my favorite horror authors. My only complaint is Julie Carmen. I don't remember much about her in Fright Night Part II, but her acting in this movie was really bad. Still, it doesn't kill the movie, and towards the end, Trent says something that has haunted me for a long time: "Every species can smell its own extinction. The last ones left won't have a pretty time with it. In ten years, the human race will just be a bedtime story for the children, a myth. Nothing more." 10/10 (highly recommended for Lovecraft and horror fans)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few Lovecraftian films around that actually succeed in conveying some of the essence of Lovecraft's writing and mythos. Though great Cthulhu himself does not appear in this movie, and John Carpenter still hasn't learned to play the guitar properly, the movie is still absolutely fantastic.The ending itself conveys the basic theme of the cthulhu mythos: You are all equally worthless and your lives are pathetically tiny and insignificant. A non-happy ending, for you who are slow in the uptake.Sam Neill is crazy as always, and the supporting cast is great too. Some of the plastic monsters are somewhat crappy, but mercifully only shown for a few seconds with good scary lighting and sounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Concept, interesting direction, but still a "B" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently when In the Mouth of Madness was released HP Lovecraft received no credit of any kind. I can't honestly speak for whether the current IMDb credit that he gets is referring to a specific Lovecraft story, but it's clear that Michael DeLuca's script was heavily influenced by the general themes of Lovecraft's work, the blending of fact and fantasy and the doubt of whether there is such a thing as absolute truth and absolute reality.Frankly, In the Mouth of Madness is a super concept and then very little more. It shouldn't be surprising that DeLuca's day job involves running New Line Pictures. This movie is a great pitch and then no real story telling, despite the game efforts of director John Carpenter.Sam Neill plays John Trent, an insurance investigator who always know when people are lying. As the film begins, Trent is already several tacos short of a combination plate. He's been tossed in an asylum and you know that this is a bad asylum because John Glover (generally prone to playing crazy characters himself) is sitting at the front desk. And then, to make matters worse, David Warner (who absurdly is now best known to audiences as one of the heavies in Titanic...) is called in to get his story.Apparently Trent was called in to track down a reclusive mystery writer who disappeared several chapters short of the conclusion of his most recent novel. Trent, of course, is a man you can't fool. You can't mess with his head. And the writer, Sutter Cane, has a reputation for writing books that drive people crazy. So it would be a battle of wills if it weren't so one-sided. Trent is sent off to a small New Hampshire town with Cane's editor (or agent, the distinctions get confusing at a certain point) and as soon as they get to the town they discover that something really bad is brewing. And to say anything more would probably confuse you, me, and anybody planning on seeing the movie.In the Mouth of Madness has a very familiar feel for fans of Carpenter's work. The plot contains elements of Village of the Damned and the special effects look a bit like the nasty creature in The Thing. Everything, however, looks really cheap. The New Hampshire town looks like a two location set. There's a town square and a scary Byzantine church. The actors are all cardboard cutouts, from Neill, who's completely incapable of carrying the film by himself (in fact, including his best Australian films, has he ever been given so much responsibility on screen?) to the completely amateurish Julie Carmen as his travelling companion. The supporting performances by Warner, Glover, Jurgen Prochnow, and Jurgen Prochnow are all just awful. The raises my major question: (And the is accompanied by a **MAJOR SPOILER!!!!**)Is the movie supposed to be bad? Or at least tacky in the ways that I've mentioned? As the final scene involves Trent going to see In the Mouth of Madness, can we just assume that in a metatextual sense this movie is cheesy because it's a cheesy adapatation of a cheesy imaginary book? Is the Hobb's End silly looking because it's not even supposed to be a real city? Are the performances bad because the characters are intentionally one dimensional? Is the entire film just supposed to be a bad film within a film? And as such is it just an homage to the classic British science fiction tradition from Lovecraft to Quatermass, etc?I think I may enjoy it more on that level. If there's a kind of multi-layered calculation that restricts quality than maybe it even succeeds for me. If you take the film as an examination of diminished audience returns, than it comments of low brow adapations of good books, etc. The evil force taking over the minds of everybody who reads Cane's books may capture the minds of the intelligent, but the film is supposed to attack people who don't read. It's low brow, then, for the sake of being low brow. And that may be very interesting.Left to its own devices, though, I just found myself remembering how wonderfully scary The Thing, Halloween, and the Fog are. And how Carpenter at his best used to be the master of tightly wound action plots, like Escape from New York and Assault on Precinct 13. I also found myself appreciating Lovecraft's skill even though he's never been a favorite of mine. At least he was always more successful in examining the rips in reality that he depicted. DeLuca just isn't up to the challenge.Since the movie did make me think and since I also accept the possibility that there is depth here that I'm not fully crediting, I'd give this one a 5/10. But even that may be a little high.</fullReview>

Loosley based upon The case of Charles dexter ward, with bits of Stephen king thrown in for good measure. Carpenter pulls out all of his toys with this hypnotic visceral piece of horror mastery. IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is a great movie to watch on a Friday night with a few beers and the light off. Hopefully John Carpenter will be back to form with his new movie next year.

		<fullReview>"I think, therefore you are."John Carpenter is a patron saint of the macabre. There's really been no arguing that statement since "Halloween", and after you get a taste of his Apocalypse Trilogy it will be engraved forever in your unconscious. At first consideration, a movie about a book seems like a retread and certainly ill-fated for the horror genre. Thankfully, Carpenter binds the idea like a hardcover classic, and shakes our preconceptions of the timeless film adaptation."Beware the hobby that eats." -Benjamin FranklinHobbies that become obsessions often alienate us from the rest of society. Yet, reading, although when we are young is almost a magical escape from reality, is more and more as we grow older and progress through schooling, simply about unanimous interpretation and less about anonymous opinion. We can all of course, hold our personal thoughts on an excerpt, but even the Bible itself has been analyzed to the point that most passages are agreed upon by the majority of experts as to their meanings. Before you read to much further into this review, try to empathize with the writer at this junction of expression. If a book has a theme, and the theme is powerful enough to capture the reader for a certain amount of time, wouldn't it be the author's integrity to attempt to change the reader's viewpoint after completion of a novel?The question posed by "In The Mouth Of Madness", the third and last installment in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy, is what would happen if a book contained a theme and underlying message so strong, that it not only changed the readers' lives, but their entire perception of reality? Some may credit Wes Craven for laying out groundwork for this startling look at popular culture in "New Nightmare", but the major difference for "In The Mouth Of Madness" is the seriousness of the subject. There are plenty of people that cite films as being big inspirations in their lives, but there is a much vaster populace that will directly relate themselves to a book, whether religious, fictional, or historic. What if these people were to read a different type of book, by an insane genius, and took the inspiration in a slightly different way? It is, after all, the most hands-on experience to be in control of your own imagination.The story offered in the movie is very concept-driven. A world-renown novelist, Sutter Cane (played by Jurgen Prochnow, of "The Seventh Seal") disappears off of the face of the planet right before the publication of his proclaimed last book in a series that has stormed the country with fanatic rage. It becomes the job of Sam Neill as John Trent, an insurance investigator, to decide where Sutter Cane has holed himself up, and whether the whole fiasco is actually a publicity stunt. Julie Carmen as Linda Styles, Cane's editor, accompanies him in his search. Charlton Heston also has a cameo appearance as the executive of Cane's publishing company.To get off on the right foot, Trent caves in and begins to read the Cane books. Immediately he realizes the potency of the writing and begins having nightmares. So when he convinces himself that the author has retreated to a town called "Hobb's End", located in New Hampshire, we can't help but wonder whether he is already losing his mind. Hobb, in ancient writing was a word used to refer to the devil, and the town with the namesake is not found on any modern map.So Styles and Trent are in a sense signing away their souls. Hobb's End, as it turns out is one of the most memorably creepy towns in movie history. Sutter Cane is pretty easy to find, on the other hand, once they arrive. Too bad nobody packed a Bible, is all I can say. It turns out that Cane has already planned for their arrival, leading Trent to become the skeptist, and Styles to act more as a guide for the duo. Hobb's End is directly out of Cane's last novel, and it definitely adds to the atmosphere when Trent is being read directions from it, as if it were a travel guide.Well, I've avoided spoiling many of the plot points and surprises in this film. This is one of the few horrors that I find myself watching again and again, without losing understanding of the original foreboding ambiance, or respect for the scenes where blood pressure raises. Loosely based on H.P. Lovecraft stories, and with a lot of homage paid to Stephen King and many of the campy B-movies that Carpenter grew up watching, this film is indeed chilling and thought-provoking."A reality is just what we tell each other it is.""In The Mouth Of Madness" (1995) 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I think this movie was excellent. John carpenter has put together one of his most interesting, and unique films in his career that rarely gets the credit it deserves. Think of this movie like a twisted version of the matrix for horror geeks such as myself. This movie asks the question is reality what it seems, or are we all just pawns in the hands of a messed up creator, or author for that matter.Sam Neil plays John Trent. A hired investigator on a hunt for the best selling horror novelists known as Sutter Cane played by Jurgen Prochnow. As Trent comes closer and closer to finding Cane, horrible, and grotesque things start to happen, and reality just seems to fall apart. His search leads him to a place called Hobbs End, a place surprisingly not on any map, with good reason, because no one would want to live in a place like that, trust me. When Trent finally discovers his real reason for existing, his world and yours will be completely turned upside down. Big ups to John Carpenter on this fine piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality isn't what it used to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Veteran filmmaker John Carpenter gets a lot of flak for the admittedly spotty latter half of his career, but can still take pride in this stylish bit of mind-bending, nightmarish insanity. It does lose a little something once the mystery elements are de-emphasized and the lunatic imagery takes over, but there is something here for a variety of horror fans, those who crave imaginative effects work and those who simply enjoy the idea of imagination run amok, as characters end up in a place where fantasy and reality are no longer distinguishable from each other. It also utilizes a doomsday theme, and is the final film in what the director calls his "Apocalypse Trilogy" (after "The Thing" and "Prince of Darkness"). The visual effects are simply spectacular, with the renowned KNB group obviously having a ball coming up with assorted gore and creature gags.Sam Neill, who'd previously played the villain in Carpenters' "Memoirs of an Invisible Man", stars here as John Trent, a cynical freelance insurance investigator who is good at what he does, and also *enjoys* what he does. He's hired by a publishing magnate, Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston), to look into the disappearance of a phenomenally successful horror author Sutter Cane (an obvious nod to a certain other famous horror writer). When he and his travelling companion, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), arrive in the small town of Hobbs End - a place that supposedly *only* exists in Canes' mind - things take an extremely bizarre turn, and poor Trent, one of those hardcore rational types who is sure there must be some logic to all of this, is taken for a dark and interesting ride.This had been written a few years previous by future big time Hollywood executive Michael De Luca, and was intended to be a derivation of concepts created by the legendary H.P. Lovecraft. Carpenter clearly saw the potential for some true horror in this script, and does a bang-up job in crafting a continuously ominous mood and plenty of weird atmosphere. As usual, his score (composed in collaboration with Jim Lang) is excellent. The ending is downright brilliant (at least, in this viewers' opinion), and getting there is just as much fun. Neill is superb in the lead; this is almost entirely his show, although the great German actor Jurgen Prochnow makes the most of his limited screen time as Cane. Some of the supporting actors - David Warner, John Glover, Bernie Casey, Peter Jason, Frances Bay - aren't seen all that much, but it's still nice to see them here.Like a lot of Carpenters' work, it just wasn't appreciated that much in its time (20 years ago now), but it's gained a fair amount of respect in the years since among horror fans.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bizarre thing sometimes about writing and reading fictional books are they are always about heightened or different realities. Each of the characters that are written and involved in the action depending on how their written feel like regular people despite whatever role their suppose to play. In a way these things are practically creating a certain existence and when we read or write these stories we suspend our disbelief because depending on how much we enjoy the story we want to almost believe it's real.This is my third favorite movie from my favorite movie director John Carpenter and it's also one of my personal favorite films in general; but also the last in his apocalypse trilogy (my favorite is "The Thing") It's one of those surreal horror films or just films in general you don't see often it's something that shows up on an occasional amount of years or could slip though the cracks. This isn't just a film it's an experience, because it thinks outside the box and beyond. It was also a little love letter and satire of H.P. Lovecroft stories which is cool because I'm a fan of his stories.I like it's plot which it's a bit uncannily similar to the film "The Ninth Gate" but that's a different story. Anyway in format it seems like a simple tracking mission mystery but what makes those kinds of plots interesting is one thing always turns into another, and this film does that but takes a more radical approach because it screws with you perception of reality in the film and pulls the rug from under you when you least expect it to.The protagonist despite unreliable is good, Insurance investigator John Trent played well by underrated actor Sam Neil. John is a cynic/realist and control freak. He loves to exercise disillusionment and his job supports it, but the thing about him is he has a low viewpoint on humanity in general probably due to the encounter of one scam artist too many in his profession. This fallible almost could make him unlikeable but what makes him likable at least to me is he always has a sense of humor, he's not afraid to satires on himself, this almost gives us a small sense of hope that he will be capable of doing what he should to combat evil. But as I've said he's an unreliable protagonist I like at times how you question this character's sanity because there are time it seems like he could be losing it, like when he cut the covers of the paperback copies of Sutter Kane. And just the simple fact these are forces that are forces beyond his control and understanding. The antagonist Sutter Kane is also great despite not being in the film that long he just has this presence where on the outside he seems like an ordinary guy (like most authors are) but you sense there is something supernatural about him, after all everything he's written has came true.I love the unsettling feeling it gives you, once again John's trademark feeling of isolation, doom and dread which help successfully add to the feeling that the world could be ending. From all the weird crap that happens in the film you just aren't sure of anything. The special effects from K and B are great, I even like the town setting which are reminiscent of the Silent Hill video game series since it always takes place in a town with supernatural activity. We see some Chtulu like creatures, some street gang that look all messed up, and one scene that always gave me the creeps was the infamous boy on a bike scene, it was creepy because it underlined the inescapable truth that we were young once but growing old. And my favorite set piece is the Black Chirch which is the spookiest church I've ever seen, with it's inverted crosses and that mural one look at it gave me the creeps. There is just so much going on in the film that it would require more than one watch to see it all. It's the philosophical conundrum of the giant floating turtle all over again only in a really twisted sense, in that story it was about how our world was really the back of a giant floating turtle; in this film it's on the possibility our world is really a story written by a writer. And of course the music as usual is great, I love the theme song it's just so cool it's one of my favorite movie themes ever.The film really gets at our perception of reality, are we really in reality or could we truly be characters from a book after all as a saying goes "life is a story". As well as something dark that is if we really have it in us to save humanity as a whole. The task to finding a book has became a cause to save humankind but the thing is Trent is good at dealing with only the practical problems in his profession which is pulling the curtain of fraud from fraud, here it's different because the problem is supernatural which are forces beyond his understanding which makes Trent powerless, despite Trent's efforts at trying to save humanity we discover they prove fruitless."In the Mouth of Madness" is a roller coaster ride into the heart and soul of darkness that you wouldn't mind riding again and read some good books.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the concept of this film is what made it truly awesome. The questions "What is fiction?", "What is reality?", "Does life imitate art or does art imitate life?". These questions make this film truly terrifying. When even the characters in this film don't know what is reality and what isn't reality, the viewer has twice the amount of struggle. Great acting by Sam Neill and an effectively creepy storyline draw the viewer further into the depths of this film. Most of us know that John Carpenter is an outstanding director and he doesn't let us down on this one in that department, but some of the music soundtrack (the beginning and end credits) is a cheesy rock/heavy metal sound when Carpenter has been composing wonderfully simplistic and eerie soundtracks in the past (ala 'Halloween' &amp; 'Prince of Darkness'). But the soundtrack is my only gripe about this film, so get up off your computer, rent this flick, and prepare for a dose of cinematic madness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In The Mouth of Madness" puts forth an interesting premise ? what if H.P. Lovecraft was right? What if portals to horrific dimensions are waiting to be opened, and what if slavering, horrific creatures with god-like powers are waiting to return to Earth . . . and to destroy mankind?.Well, `In the Mouth of Madness' is a lot like other John Carpenter films ? interesting concepts, but the results are often hit or miss. The film itself deals with an insurance investigator named John Trent (Sam Neill, in an unexpectedly great performance), a man who defines rational, logical thought. A book publisher (a feisty Charlton Heston, who steals every scene he's in) sends Trent looking for a missing best-selling author ? Sutter Caine, who's supposed to be a cross between H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. During his search for Sutter Caine, Trent finds himself encountering bizarre situations that literally come straight out of Sutter Caine's novels. . . and the situations get progressively worse and worse. The film moves along at a decent pace, and manages to put together a number of shocking, disturbing scenes (and also makes the viewer wonder at times if the horror onscreen is `real' or just in Trent's head), but it never manages to sustain its intensity for any significant length of time. Some of the scenes which try to be horrifying wind up just being confusing, or stupid, or both. Carpenter also relies a lot on camera tricks (extreme close-ups, quick scene cuts, etc.) which are supposed to be disturbing ? and instead, they're intrusive and annoying. Also, the special effects budget must've been awful, because the effects are a joke ? check out Julie Carmen's dummy head! Clint Eastwood made a more realistic looking head in `Escape From Alcatraz'! Still, the good outweighs the bad, and I have to give John Carpenter credit for at least trying to create a chilling horror film, even if the results are somewhat spotty.`In the Mouth of Madness' is decent, but not one of Carpenter's best. For a great example of a John Carpenter horror mind-trip, check out `The Thing' first. When you're finished with that, then watch `In the Mouth of Madness.' It's slightly stupid at times, but fun nonetheless. B-/C+</fullReview>

Sam Neill (badly miscast) is the insurance investigator who's assigned to track down a world-famous horror writer who's gone missing with his latest manuscript, a (literally) mind-twisting book set in the town of Hobb's End. Having located this 'mythical' venue, Neill falls prey to a variety of monstrous visions conjured by the writer's imagination, at which point the plot becomes irrelevant and the casual viewer might just as well pack up and go home. To be fair, Carpenter still knows how to set up the kind of shocks and scares which made him famous, and he makes fascinating use of the wide Panavision frame, but the tissue-thin tale wasn't worth telling in the first place. And unless I've misconstrued the final sequence, the film concludes with an uncomfortable suggestion that Carpenter is laughing at his audience for taking such rubbish even remotely seriously. A waste of time and talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>31 Days Of Horror: Day 28John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness may just be one of the director's most underrated films. It's certainly one of his most effective and intelligent. It's got a story with in a story mentality to it, a handful of really gruesome practical effects, and a story worth telling. Sam Neill plays Trent, an insurance investigator hired by a book firm to locate a missing horror author who owes them an unpublished volume. The author in question is Sutter Kane (more than a few references to Stephen King are slyly dropped), played by classic villain actor Jürgen Prochnow, who's never been eerier, given a meaty, theatrical role to play here that he fits like a glove. Trent is led to a small, deserted New England town, where the weirdness really starts. Kane has, through his horrific novels, somehow tapped into an ancient, Lovecraftian evil from the dark recesses of the space between our dimension and others, and now it wants out. It's bringing his work to slimy, squirming life and bending the rules of reality for everyone in our world. It's a super fun concept that keeps you interested the whole way through, and visually puts on quite a show as well, giving us a parade of all sorts of impressive horrors. Charlton Heston shows up as the head of the book firm, David Warner as a sceptical psychiatrist, and wiry John Glover is priceless as the world's most awkward asylum doctor. Carpenter makes a bit of a departure from simplistic, single idea driven frights and tries his hand at high concept, large scale horror. The result is a highly unsettling, really fun piece that ranks with his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Read Sutter Cane?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie over the weekend and loved how it had that Twilight Zone/Stephen King feel to it. John Trent, Sam Neill, is an Insurance Investigator, who is assigned to investigate the disappearance of horror author Sutter Cane. He does some investigating of his own before taking on the assignment. He starts by reading most of Sutter Cane's novels. While reading them he thinks he knows where he might have gone. He rips up the front covers of each book and discover's it a puzzle of the state of New Hampshire and the star is Hobb's End. He goes back to Cane's publisher, Charlton Heston, and shows him and Linda Stilles this. It's a done deal, Trent takes along Linda and they are on there way to Hobb's End.Anlong their journey the both of them find and enter the strange town of Hobb's End. In Hobb's End people are turning into creatures and things are not what they seem. While there Trent discovers that Cane's disappearance was a publicity stunt; but according to Stilles he never reached his destination. This is were the movie can become confusing and where reality and fiction mix.While in Hobb's End, Trent thinks he is still apart of some stunt. As the movie continues the Twilight Zone feel comes into play. The children getting some kind of virus that turns them into creature's and it spreads to most of the adults in the town. It is up to Trent to find out what is going on, discover the truth; and find Sutter Cane before Trent cracks up.The reason why I liked this film is because it has that Stephen King vibe in it. To me it's like a story within a story, plus it has that creep factor in it from the beginning to the ending. In The Mouth of Madness is no Halloween, it's not Carpenter's best; but it's far from being his worst. It deserves an 8/10 stars, great story, but the movie is not for those under 13 due to the some violence. Kris L. CocKayne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is a masterpiece of cinema and specially of the horror genre. This film also marked the return of the genius of director John Carpenter. A few of the projects Carpenter directed leading up to this film left a little to be desired. Some had poor scripts and some were horribly mangled by the studio, but even the ones that were truly great, didn't meet up to the standard the Carpenter had set for himself in his earlier work (like in THE THING and HALLOWEEN). When this film was released in 1995 Carpenter showed his fans and critics that he was indeed the master of the genre film and truly a cinematic craftsman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Postmodernistic approach to horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this movie as the best, the most intelligent and the most shocking horror film of the decade! Carpenter pursuits his career with a coherency seldom met at the American directors; his obsessions and preferences become an ars poetica, shaping more elaborate forms. Carpenter's horror touches us deep inside not by what we are shown, but by what we are suggested to believe. Just like many pop and movie stars do nowadays, Sutter Cane has a whole world down on its knees. This evil wants reduction to sameness, wants to make the audiences all around the world think the same, be the same, act the same. Only then is Cane, as he proclaims, God. The entire horror phenomenon is pointed at and -in a way- mocked at, because the bad influence of horror products is revealed fully.A continual and dark nightmare, the movie proves to be a skilled postmodernistic approach to H.P. Lovecraft's writings, not only in the atmosphere, but also in the visualisation and plot. Sam Neill is flawless as detective John Trent and Julie Carmen-comfortable in her part. The writer is the German actor Jurgen Prochnow who brings a necessary European flavour to the character. Extremely well-made visual effects (the scene where Cane tears himself like a page is impressive) and haunting score. Well done, John Carpenter!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film. Let me tell you why. I loved this film becuase it's pretty scary. I'm a horror fan and a movie that scares me is something I look forward to. This movie is strange which makes it very creepy. I loved how the music makes you jump at certain parts of the film. John Carpenter is great at composing music for this reason. I loved where the movie was filmed. It's film in a small deserted town and that makes every all the more creepy. Sam Neille does a great job of struggling about whether he is in the real world or a made up character by Sutter Kane. For those of you who have not seen it, one of the creepiest scenes, I think, was during the road scene. You have to watch it so you know what I mean. If you want a good scare, watch this movie and make sure the lights are off. Also a good date movie becuase the girl might sit closer to you and grab you. Great John Carpenter movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With such classics as "Halloween", "Assault on Precinct 13", "They Live" and so many more under his belt, Carpenter created his best film to date in 1995. "In the Mouth of Madness" is the rarest of horror films, the scary type. Carpenter weaves a great tale of a horror writer whose work causes readers to go insane. Everything he writes happens and it all begins in Hobb's End, New Hampshire. Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a Stephen King-like novelist whose next work is about the end to everything. Sam Neill is an insurance investigator searching for Cane, as instructed by Cane's publisher Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston), who sends the beautiful Julie Carmen to assist Neill.Well-acted and great direction by Carpenter make this ultimate horror film is you actually want to be frightened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best HP Lovecraft film done to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Mouth Of Madness is without a doubt the best Lovecraftian movie ever made, even though it is an original script not taken directly from one of his works. There are a number of references to Stephen King in this film, but King himself admits to a deep love of all things Lovecraft; and the writer in the film, Sutter Kane, is closer to Charles Dexter Ward than Stephen King.New England settings, different dimensions, what you don't see is what will kill you (and thereby all of us), and the return of elder gods (or eldritch gods if you prefer) to reclaim this plane and planet as their own are all central parts of the stories and novels of HP Lovecraft. The scriptwriter does a wonderful job of combining so many elements of the Cthulhu mythos without ever actually referring to any of them as such.The third installment in Carpenter's apocalypse trilogy. The end of the world is coming. Soon! And we cannot stop it.</fullReview>

But this movie scares you in a very sweet way and you dont want to give up watching it. You dont know what is real and not, and i think there are more than one reality in this movie. The main character,Sam Neill, is fighting through the whole movie to find what is real or not. Unfortunately, he is not able to win the battle. At the end of the movie, he recognizes that he had and has no chance, and he starts to laugh (and cry) and gives everything up. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Species Can Smell Its Own Extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ...I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling meta-horror from the master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror meister John Carpenter's 'In the Mouth of Madness' is an unholy fusion of high-falutin meta-narrative and B-movie glory; essentially a postmodern cinematic rework reworking of H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos whose denizens from unimaginable realms constantly threaten to break free from captivity and wreck havoc upon earth.John Trent (Sam Neill) is a freelance insurance investigator who is hired by a publishing company to track down the insanely popular (and recently missing) horror writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), whose latest book inspires crazed schizophrenic delirium in its readers. Trent is initially sceptical and dismissive, even when he begins seeing unsettling portents all around him and having disturbing nightmares, and soon believes to have located Cane in a town called Hobb's End in New England. Accompanied by Cane's editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) they travel to the town where the unsettling portents grow more frequent and more sinister as Styles believes they have inadvertently crossed the barrier between reality and fiction and have actually become involved in the narrative of a Sutter Cane novel. When they eventually do track down Cane, Trent's scepticism crumbles in the face of all manner of inexplicable phenomena culminating in an encounter with the Great Old Ones and the collapse of his reality.In attempting a post-modern horror film Carpenter successfully adds a much-needed cerebral dimension to an otherwise visceral genre and has made a movie which can be appreciated by a horror neophyte as well as offering a wealth of references weaved in for seasoned horror fans to delight over. However, be warned: while this reviewer found the balance effective, I can see how the po-mo, meta, chin-strokey elements of the film could grate with some fans of classic (read: visceral) horror while being too cheesy (especially in some of the special effects) for the more discerning cinephile. This said, 'In the Mouth of Madness' is a fine addition to Carpenter's oeuvre and a dizzying descent into madness indeed.</fullReview>

Perfect film to watch around October and Halloween.Find it, buy it, watch it. Let's just hope Carpenter has at least one more like this still in him.

It also has a very weird story line to go with it! It takes you on a creepy ride through some of the most surreal settings in cinema...OK, maybe in some places, the plot goes a bit haywire, but c'mon, give this film the credit for being so different from other tripe like mindless slasher movies with some stupid looking boogey-men!This is a very memorable movie, very atmospheric and has some nightmarish scenes never before seen in other clichéd horror movies.A true trip in the mouth of madness!

Also plenty of black humour to be had.I think it's way better than Halloween (I find slasher movies a bore).

		<shortDescription>Haunting chiller from the master of Terror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is one of the most prolific horror movie directors, a man who directed such masterpieces as 'Halloween', 'Assault on precinct 13', 'Christine', or the less known 'Prince of Darkness'. The horror in his movies comes from the feeling of alienation in a world that has turned cold, menacing, emotionless and violent. His originality resides however in the fact that he emphasizes on the MENACE. The horror lies in the atmosphere(his music, too, is brilliantly simple and haunting) and builds up in the mind of the viewer. This one is one of his best, if not the best, certainly his most elaborate and stylish. As insurance investigator John Trent(brilliant Sam Neill) is sent to investigate horror novelist Sutter Cane's(brilliant Jurgen Prochnow) mysterious vanishing, he ends up finding him in a town that exists only as a figment of Cane's twisted imagination. Trent is assisted in his search by Linda Styler(also brilliantly played by Julie Carmen). The estranged Trent goes deeper and deeper into the mind of a madman, to finally discover that his very existence is inseparably linked to his character in Cane's newest novel, which proclaims the beginning of a reign of madness, the book itself being the catalyst. As Trent discovers that all bets are off, and the borders between real life and fiction completely disappear, the viewer will be left wandering the streets into the mouth of madness. Brilliant!</fullReview>

Lovecraft and Stephen King, with typical John Carpenter flair. The effects are great, often reminiscent of JC's own The Thing, though I was disappointed with how the Great Old Ones were presented.

		<shortDescription>A huge success from John Carpenter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Mouth of Madness is one of those horror movies that blurs the line between reality and fantasy in order to create a horror film that creeps more than it shocks. There are several instances in the film where sudden shocks are delivered by things jumping onscreen with a nice shrieking sound, but these are really only there because what horror movie doesn't have these? That's a horror movie staple, but the film as a whole presents plenty of creepy and spooky stuff that goes beyond simply a lot of cheesy scares. In a lot of ways, In the Mouth of Madness is a situational horror film, which throws its characters into situations that are just horribly creepy.(spoilers) When John (Sam Niell) and Linda (Julie Carmen) are driving down a country road late at night on their way to the theoretically fictional town Hobb's End, they pass a young kid (who you will probably not recognize as a young Hayden Christensen) riding a bicycle down the middle of the street with no lights. John is asleep when this happens, and then a few seconds later they pass an old man also riding a bike down the middle of the street, this time in the opposite direction and stone-faced forward like a zombie. Linda grows concerned at this point, obviously wondering what the hell is going on, and then the next thing you know the same old man is in front of them and she hits him.So far, the movie seems to be just paying homage to Stephen King, from which it borrows heavily (what with the Children of the Corn sequence that this is), but there is something creepy about being in a strange place in the dark and suddenly seeing a bicyclist outside in the blackness, riding merrily along. The problem, however, is that the movie presents even the most creepy scenes like this, but then turns right around and trips over itself. After they run down the old man, John is obviously jolted out of sleep, they go back to see if the man's dead, and after he tells them that he's trapped and he won't let him out, he gets right up, gets on his bike, and continues on his way. This all fits with the situation and the movie's plot, but then we see John and Linda get back into the car, and not only does John not even offer to drive since Linda just ran someone down, but he gets back in the passenger seat and goes right back to sleep! What the hell!The best scenes in the movie are the ones that deal with stuff from the novels of Sutter Cane (Stephen King Sutter Cane Stephen King Sutter Cane ? get it?) and the way that they seem to drive people insane. The man with the axe slowly crossing a crowded street to John and his boss sitting in a café, the later revelation that that man was Cane's agent, the painting in the hotel where they stay in Hobb's End, the way John kept coming right back to the crowded street of zombies when he was trying to leave Hobb's End, etc. The movie succeeds wonderfully with this creepy stuff, but trips a little when it goes too far, as it did with some more graphic parts like that goofy pulsating door in Cane's office in the church and, more than anything else in the film, the ridiculous monster that the little old lady in the hotel turned into whenever she was spending quality time with her husband.But on the whole, In the Mouth of Madness sits comfortably within the top 5% or 10% of horror films, even the ending was satisfactory. I have a strange fascination with movies that present insanity this way, first from the point of view of the supposedly insane person, and eventually from the point of view of reality. In Dreams also did this really well. When John walks into the theater with his popcorn (but no soda, how can you possibly eat popcorn and not have soda? The guy's definitely insane!) and watches the movie that was made out of Cane's new book, he sees himself in the movie doing what we've seen him do throughout this movie, `This is reality,' `I'm not insane,' etc. Everything that he did that was a little nuts throughout the entire movie is edited together, and John sits there watching fascinated like a child and then slowly goes off into rolling laughter, and you just have to grin.Movies and books are supposed to get into your head, but only the best ones do. Sutter Cane obviously knew how to do it. I'm curious as to what Stephen King thought of this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Be Given A Second Chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's too bad that "In The Mouth Of Madness" didn't do so hot at the box office, but even classic films are flops. John Carpenter creates a story which leaves one wonder what exactly "reality" is.As the film opens, John Trent (Sam Neil)is dragged kicking and screaming into a mental asylum. But as you soon discover, he is not insane. In fact, it seems that the entire world is slowly going to hell. There are outbreaks of violence throughout the world. As Dr. Wrenn (David Warner) listens, we find out what is going on.Months before,Trent (Who is an insurance fraud investigator)nearly gets killed by a crazed man with an ax. Soon afterward, he finds out that the man that nearly killed him was the former agent of Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow), who has been missing for months. He finds this out from Cane's publisher (Charlton Heston). His editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) tells Trent that Cane's books have a weird effect on those who read the books. His latest book, "In The Mouth Of Madness" is way overdue, and his fans are going mad, wanting the book. Trent, who thinks that the whole thing is a publicity stunt, discovers that the paperback book covers when pieced together create a map to the fictional town of Hobb's End. No side trusting the other, both Trent and Styles goes on the search for Cane.Despite the fact that there is no such town as Hobb's End, they manage to find the town. And that is where things get weird. The town totally looks like what is described in the books.And then events start to happen, just like in the novel. People are turning into mutants creatures with a thirst for violence. The reason behind this is Cane: What he writes turns into a horrifying reality. But his words on paper is creating a way for nightmarish creatures to enter our world and to end human existence.The best performance of the film is Neil. His skepticism is understandable: there is no way that our life can be controlled by anyone but himself, and cannot accept that his version of reality may indeed be wrong. But, like him, we soon have to accept that reality is never pretty.If you have never seen this film, then it is a must see. Part of what Carpenter called his "Apocalypse Trilogy." So, rent this along with "The Thing" and "Prince of Darkness" and have a really good scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Promising Idea that Doesn't Quite Find Its' Groove</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was released at a time that the horror genre was at one of its' all time lows. There was very little quality horror releasing at the time. Slashers had been declared "uncool" and the horror community was struggling to find the right ingredients to be successful. Look at most of the well-known horror of the era and a good deal of it were movies that were actually trying hard not to be labeled as horror, in THE SIXTH SENSE, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or SEVEN. John Carpenter is an icon of horror, but by this point his best work was a decade behind him. This was the decade that brought us GHOSTS OF MARS and VAMPIRES. While both have their strong points, they are far from the movies like HALLOWEEN and THE FOG that brought Carpenter the legendary status that he now enjoys. So, in an era where horror was trying hard to be "serious", Carpenter brought us a tribute to two of his favorite horror writers, King and Lovecraft.Sam Neill (from JURASSIC PARK) is top notch insurance investigator, who has an encounter in the early moments with an ax-wielding psycho. Turns out the psycho was an agent for the most popular horror writer in the world, Sutter Kane. Turns out, even more, that Kane is missing and his firm is a client of the insurance where Neill works, so naturally he is brought in to help investigate the disappearance. This leads him to a town called Hobb's End which is on no map and, in fact, may not even be real at all, as our hero's life and reality begin to unravel.The movie is, basically, a really good idea that is never developed enough to truly works, but when it does hit it hits really well. What I find appealing is the reality-warping moments. Hobb's End is an amalgam of all sorts of crazy horror ideas - shotgun toting townies, evil children, a dark church, a scary old lady, on and on. They are all plot strands from Kane's novels, come together in one crazy little town. As a big fan, myself, of both King and Lovecraft, I appreciate the token nod to their work and the idea of paying tribute to the both of them in film.That's part of where the problems develop too. King and Lovecraft's work are not that similar and trying to mingle the two doesn't truly let the flavor of either shine. King's work is most masterful when lettings its' characters shine through and develop them into sympathetic stand ins for the viewer/ reader. This movie never really lets us get to know any of the characters well enough and, certainly, not to "like them" in any real way. On the other hand, Lovecraft worked in cosmic mysteries, ancient evils and nebulous terrors. The movie tries to bring this in, but doesn't seem to understand what is is about Lovecraft that really worked.Part of the problem is the acting. Sam Neill is just fine. The heroine is neither a memorable enough actor to bring any flavor to the role, or attractive enough to make us forget that she's not that great an actor. The dude that played the Duke in DUNE is Sutter Kane, the horror writer, and he's completely forgettable. This needed to be the most impact-ful role in this movie, but he is not frightening or convincing. The other major issue is that the movie just feels so Nineties. As a guy show spent the last part of his teens and early twenties in that decade, I think I'm pretty versed in the Nineties. This is all the worst parts of it. Overly done production with too much sheen on it, poor practical effects, mingled by early computer imagery and too much attempt to replace the villains of Eighties horror with the "scary themes" horror of the Nineties (at least until SCREAM saved us).It's not a bad film and for those who haven't seen it, I would recommend giving it a go, just don't think it's one of those movies that will go on your list of repeat spins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know how to appreciate an "Old" movie, but i have to say that i was pretty excited about viewing this one, and found me laughing on the creepy parts. That is the only negative thing i have to say about this movie, and was really disappointing. Nevertheless the script is FREAKING AMAZING. The way the movie is directed and its development is really good. Dialogues are impregnated of religious and evolution theories topics. I personally loved the way how all this conversations and subject-matter were developed in the movie's plot... that isn't predictable. It's a good movie to see and pay attention, surely wont burn your brain but if you have a good sense for hidden things, you'll be thinking about them for quite a while. So in summary: great movie! (all thanks to the script and directors ability), failed horror intention and smart people plot.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Mouth Of Madness is a very cerebral and very intense horror film from one of the genre's greats, John Carpenter. Sam Neil is John Trent, a private detective that is on a special job. He is to find its best selling horror author Sutter Cane (played with diabolical brilliance by Jurgen Prochnow) and get the remaining materials needed to release Cane's next book. The film is greatly inspired by the works of HP Lovecraft, but has many twists and turns that take place in the 95 minutes of the film. In The Mouth Of Madness is the third installment in what John Carpenter refers to as his apocalpse trilogy. The three films in question are The Thing, Prince Of Darkness and this. The end of the world theme is the only common thread between the three films. All three films have separate story lines and are all approached differently and are all brilliant in their own right. In The Mouth Of Madness is a very classy and well done horror film that could inspire some deep, existential discussions, but also delivers on madness, terror and suspense. The tone of the film is very dark and the film is creepy, unpredictable and totally intense. The music for the film was done by John Carpenter and Jim Lang. The Carpenter stuff is pretty distinct and is easy for fans(such as myself)to pick up on. The ambiance brings unease and dread(and complements the film well). Sam Neil is absolutely fantastic as the lead. I do think he is good in everything, but my favorite performances of his are in horror. Mr. Neil brings it and delivers a very complex performance from a very complex, cynical character. The support cast is equally impressive and has actors I really respect like David Warner, Bernie Casey and Charlton Heston. Julie Carmen is more than just a pretty face and her performance and chemistry with Sam Neil was excellent as well. Jurgen Prochnow brought intellect, darkness and class to author/villain Cane. In The Mouth Of Madness is a very original and well crafted horror film and in my opinion some of John Carpenter's best film work in the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Wrenn comes to interview volatile psych patient John Trent (Sam Neill). Trent was an independent insurance investigator. The movie flashes back to an ax welding stranger who tells him about successful horror writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow). Publisher Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston) asks him to find the missing Cane. People seems to turn violent from Cane's books. The next book is suppose to be In the Mouth of Madness. Using the book covers, Trent discovers the location of Hobb's End, New Hampshire. Harglow sends editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) to join Trent on the search.This is more ambitious than most slasher horrors. It tries to bring in the nature of reality. It's rather disjointed with random apparitions. Essentially, nothing is real and therefore there is nothing solid to hold on to. Sam Neill is great but Julie Carmen is not particularly good. The premise is interesting but it's not that thrilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sent to an insane asylum, a man recalls how his search for a reclusive horror novelist in a small town began to experience the events of his stories come to life and torment him while he struggles to maintain his sanity.This was an incredibly fun and enjoyable entry. One of the biggest pluses is that there's a completely unnerving and insanely off-the- charts creepy atmosphere here, utilizing a ton of successful tactics to creep the viewer out. The mystery over the books and the effect they have on readers is great, making excellent use of a great concept and keeping the mystery alive through some really great scenes. That the story is so strong is another big plus, as it really allows for all the stuff to happen in the first place. It's really smart and unique, which allows for the good parts to occur since it's so detailed and flexible at the same time. That creepiness here aids the action really well with even more fun once it gets to the town, as nearly everything from the repeated gag of the bicycle rider to the haunted hotel's paintings, the attacks by the kids in the alleyway chasing them off and the general air around town is creepy. Since they play-off both short-term and for the long haul as well makes them even better as the repeat showings still get the jump while the one-time gags help deepen the mystery, and plays off each set-piece for an impressive air of creepiness and suspense. There's also the way the film manages to keep the whole air of creepiness without ever showing the creatures, which this one could've done so for several different scenes, yet all we see are glimpses of humanoid, fish-like things, yet even that is debatable because the glimpses are done so fast that there's not even a completely accurate view. The gore in here really helps the film as well, and holds the film up as there wasn't too much wrong here. Among the minor flaws is the extremely confusing manner of the ending as there's hardly anything in here that makes sense. The way the plot unfolds to the rationale behind the decisions and how the film resolves itself have little to no sense of what's happening going all over the place yet nothing is told or explained and that makes what happens really hard to understand. The last flaw in here is that the film decides to hide its money shots, as it's impossible to determine what kind of creatures they are in the brief scenes they're in and all the gore is off-screen. It's not a true detriment, but it is something that does have to be overcome, and they are the only things keeping it down.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an odd movie. At times a love letter to the works of H.P Lovecraft, In the Mouth of Madness is like Chinatown but freakish old ladies on bikes and villains straight out of Scooby Doo. You're always on edge when watching it, and due to the meta-like narrative it's difficult to work out just what the hell is going on. The movie tries to be too clever, and in doing so it trips over its own feet. Was Sam Neil living in a book? Was he even real? Was Sutter Cane real? Was he crazy? Why am I watching Sam Neil watch In the Mouth of Madness in cinemas? Am I crazy? Am I real? Who the hell are you?The muddled nature of the film is unfortunate, because this film feels like a missed opportunity for a superb horror-thriller. The camera work felt very mature and developed ? I've got no complaints with how Carpenter filmed the movie. It's just?it didn't work. Whatever the movie tried to do, it didn't work. And Julie Carmen was horrible.Best Scene: Just what was that thing on the bike?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Neill can't believe that Jurgen Prochnow writes reality into existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Neill's excellent performance is the center of this film. He's looking for horror writer Jurgen Prochnow and finds him in a devilish town in New Hampshire named Hobbs End (a reference to "Quatermass and the Pit"). He's accompanied by Prochnow's editor, Linda Styles in a bland performance.Prochnow has established contact with monsters of darkness, who have been kept at bay for eons but who are unleashed by his writing of horror novels. These have the capacity when read to unleash the dark sides in human beings, and this is transforming the planet into a ghoulish hell. Neill holds to the idea that reality is what he has seen in the past and that Hobbs End, with all its horrors, is being staged to fool him. Eventually he comes to believe that a new reality is being fashioned by Prochnow's stimulative writing.There are genuinely chilling moments in this horror movie. It is ribbing Stephen King and doing a take on H.P. Lovecraft as well. And it's very dark. It's a horror-neo-noir because of its darkness and its themes. The story raises the question of the creation itself and the creation of good and evil as we see them. It raises a question of God's nature. It doesn't answer them and cannot because of their essentially mysterious nature, but it suggests that human beings can create a hell on earth. It suggests that this is a kind of mass paranoid schizophrenia or mass epidemic of mental illness that destroys human society. This is a warning for these times, an apocalyptic vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched it, I was still a youngster and I got scared. Not because of the monsters, but because of the psychological creepiness. Every movie that deals with the human psyche, if it is done successfully, can cause that (see Jacob's Ladder). But this movie has something different going on here and can only be observed if you see the patterns emerging. This is a movie about the nature of reality. It could be seen like a horror interpretation of Plato's Cave analogy. The main character seems trapped into this reality, forced unto him by the Godlike powers of the Writer. In the scene inside the church where they talk, Sutter Cane tells him that the only thing necessary for something to become reality is belief. Even if there is denial and resistance to it, it is still a belief. In other words, we see the struggle of a man, who feels trapped into a horrifying novel, determined by forces outside of him. He wants to get out, but he can't and the reason is belief. The ending seems mysterious, but it closes the movie with the right way. Going into the theater, as a guest and watching the movie of his life. He cries and then he laughs. He realized that everything was in his head. Just a movie playing and the stronger he believed in it, the more real it became. Of course, there is subtle humor from everyone involved and can be seen in their performances. And the Lovecraftian references, (see monsters and the deterministic nature of one's life), just make it more enjoyable. A highly entertaining horror movie, that pays tribute to the creators of such books and movies but with an underlying philosophical aspect. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In The Mouth Of Madness" . . . what a whacked-out thing this is; a surreal mix of macabre/detective story, steeped in Lovecraft. Does it work? Mostly, it does, although the movie started to lose me big time during the second act. All I really wanted to do was escape Hobb's End. That segment is very (verrry) '90s horror in a small town, which is not at all my thing. Is that a silly thing to gripe about? Probably, but what're you gonna do? Sam Neill does eventually return to the city and with him, the movie. We leave the dogpile of horror tropes behind and can finally get to the paranoid delusional payoff.This is Carpenter in true horror fashion, which would probably explain my lack of enthusiasm for the movie (horror tends not to be my thing). That said, it's frightening, a bit of a mind-screw, and definitely unnerving.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is hired by a publisher to find missing horror novelist Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow) before his new novel is released. Following clues hidden in the covers of Cane's books, Trent and editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) drive to a small town in New England. There they discover that Cane has unleashed a powerful evil on the world and it may be too late to stop it.Considered by many to be John Carpenter's last great movie. I'm hard-pressed to disagree with that. I think it's the last one that really feels like a Carpenter film. Fans of his will probably know what I mean. Here he crafts a number of creepy images and scary moments that are very effective. If you are a fan of his previous horror films, I think you will like this one. Sam Neill starts out a little rough but he gets better as the film progresses. His American accent is strained at times but it's never too distracting. Jurgen Prochnow is perfectly cast and brings a presence to the role of Sutter Cane that the movie depends upon. Julie Carmen is the weak link in the cast. Neither the way her part is written nor how she acts it is impressive. She has a colorless personality and I just couldn't care what happened to her. It reminds me somewhat of some of the odd performances in Prince of Darkness, which was also part of Carpenter's so-called Apocalypse Trilogy, along with this movie and The Thing. It's an entertaining movie, particularly for Carpenter fans. Not perfect and far from his best but very good nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is your complete John Carpenter experience right here, the perfect type of film for his crazy ass imagination. Everything Carpenter made prior to this has elements all rolled in resulting in classic Carpenter horror mixed with body shock mutations.The plot is creepy as it is surreal. Sam Neill is hired to find a missing horror writer in a small sleepy leafy US town, boy does Carpenter love small US towns. He must find Sutter Cane and retrieve his final novel for publishing. Sounds simple eh? well think again.When I first saw this film it creeped me out a lot, these days it doesn't have the same kind of punch but its still solid. Carpenter goes into overdrive here with lots of trademark icky effects and monsters, most of which look like ideas from 'The Thing'. As usual effects are created with models and puppets which do now look a bit hokey but plenty of makeup and prosthetics and good use of suggestion.The whole film is extremely surreal and plays out like a nightmare, in fact the whole point is you don't know if it is a nightmare or reality. Pretty much anything goes really as Sam Neill goes nuts trying to get out of Hobb's End and destroy the final evil horror manuscript. This surrealist approach does work and offers up plenty of weirdness which does equal some nice eerie moments, the ghostly boy cycling along the dark deserted highway at night being a good one.The start of the film is definitely better than the second half and ending. The film is much more creepy as Neill and his female sidekick leave for and arrive at Hobb's End. After Neill gets what he needs and we return to reality the film slightly loses its mysterious spooky essence, the final sequence is an interesting twist to make you think.Basically a descent into madness for Neill's character, but we're not even sure if he is a real person or not, could it all be part of the horror novel itself?. Its left to your own thoughts really which is cool but annoying also, I like to know what happens period.If your a Carpenter fan then this will appeal with tentacled monster puppetry, creepy kids running about, satanic references and all set within a Michael Myers type American pie town. Just don't expect too many final answers regarding characters and plot.6/10</fullReview>

Sam Neil plays a man called John Trent who gets put into a psychiatric hospital because of something he did which the viewers don't know about,he then talks to a doctor and tells him the story of how he ended up there so everything we see in the film is everything before Sam Neil is put into the hospital. At the start of the film Sam Neil buys a bunch of books written by a man named Sutter cane who is a horror novelist. Sam Neils character doesn't really like horror books but he heard how popular they were and how well they were selling so he buys a few out of curiosity to see how scary these books actually are and he reads the books and he slowly starts to become interested in them. we also find out that some people that read these books slowly start to go mad and its announced that Sutter canes books seem to have a weird effect on its readers and throughout the film Sam Neil starts to see weird deformed people and unknown creatures and he thinks he's going crazy but is he really going crazy or are these creatures he's seeing real?. Sam Neil plays a freelance insurance investigator and he's hired to look for the horror novelist Sutter cane who has mysteriously gone missing. Sam Neil teams up with Julie Carmen to go searching for Sutter cane and they go off on an adventure together to find this man and figure out what is going on.Later in the film Sam Neil becomes convinced the whole disappearance is a publicity stunt but Julie Carmen thinks something has happened to Sutter cane and she tries to convince Sam Neil Something weird is going on. Throughout the film the two characters see weird people and strange things happening and some of the things they see are very bizarre and creepy. To sum things up in the mouth of madness is a very good film it was very gripping and has a cool unique storyline with two likable characters that i enjoyed watching.i definitely recommend the film its a must see.</fullReview>

It must have been a bit embarrassing after In the Mouth of Madness died at the box office without so much as a whimper. The film is hardly one of Carpenter's best, but it's entertaining and would have benefited from a different lead. Sam Neill does not pull off crazy, unless hammy over acting passes for loosing one's mind. The first 2/3 of the film have a nice aire of mystery as we follow him into a fictitious town full of horrors, but the last act looses its way.

Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed.Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years.Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been.Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions.Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension.Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

Neill (Memoirs of an Invisible Man) plays John Trent, an insurance agent who is hired by businessman, Jackson Harglow (Heston) to find missing horror author, Sutter Cane (Prochnow). He's sent with his associate, Linda Stiles (Carmen) to find Hobb's End, a town that Cane may be at that's also written in one of his books. They find it where strange things begin happening and Trent thinks it's all a setup. He realizes nothing is what it seems and that Cane's books effect it's readers. Warner (Body Bags) plays Wrenn, a doctor who tries to help Trent and Glover (Gremlins 2) plays Saperstein, a mental ward associate. This is one of Carpenter's most underrated, Neill is great in it and there's neat effects. I recommend this good horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this is a great movie that can best be classified as a horror film (best that is). It is more a psychological mind trip than a horror movie though, I have to say, but it was a good movie; one of Carpenters best. It has imagination, color, and makes you think twice about what you just saw afterwards. Most people I know who have scene this movie missed what it was about, or just got confused, but I think that why it is good. It confuses you and makes you want to see it again.One thing I hate is when people automatically say it is a bad Lovecraft movie for whatever reason; it never claims to be a Lovecraft movie, and on some boxes it says it is like Lovecraft, which I have to agree. Carpenter never shows real gore, just hints of it that seem to make it all the more scarier; he flashes images in front of you quickly and allows you to know what's going on without overwhelming you, like Lovecraft who doesn't show you everything, but what he does show you is in terrible detail. This movie is more a tribute to him than anything, and I think it does a good job.Over all a great film to watch if you want something to make you think a little, if you enjoy Lovecraft in the least (or hate him, either way), or like Sam Neil, who does an awesome job here; very believable. It's definitely worth the rent. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the initial promise of his early movies, from "Assault On Precinct 13" to "The Thing", Carpenter drifted into the mundane. During the 1980's his output sported little that would lead you believe he was the man behind some of the greatest thrillers of the last decade. With "In The Mouth Of Madness", he goes some way to redeeming his reputation, and it's his best film for nearly 15 years.Carpenter was never just a horror movie director, his films were pertinent views of American culture and society, which is one of the reasons his work elevated him above that of his contemporaries (Tobe Hooper, Sean Cunningham etc). In this movie he takes the familiar accusation of violence in the movies, and turns it on it's head - what if a book were written that was so influential that those who read it were warped by it's very existence? A black bible, in the form of a bestselling horror novel. With this in mind we are taken on a mindbending journey into the novel itself, a King-esque world of quiet New England townsfolk, and deep, hidden evil. Reality is skewed as Sam Neill searches for the missing author of the book, and finds himself seemingly INSIDE the unfolding story, unable to escape, or to rationalise the situation, however hard he tries. The film has some genuine scares, and Carpenter uses his trademark 'stings' and score to good effect. Unfortunately it slides into gross out effects, rather than menace, the creatures are a let down, and throughout there is an uneasy mix of comedy and horror, which CAN work well. Here, the cast seem ill at ease with the combination. With a budget, Carpenter appears to lose his way, and maybe if the studios stopped giving him money, he'd return to the filmmaker he once was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first part is good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the first part of this horror movie and found it quite interesting. There's a sense of hidden evil slowly building up over the two main actors, Sam Neill and Julie Carmen. It culminates in the introduction to a few strange characters of Hobb's End that made me yearn for more of that madness which has the little town in its firm grip.And then, they have to ruin everything by going to that church. Special effects take over (and they're certainly not the best of their kind) and we're treated with the usual mishmash of symbolic scenes. The whole story becomes simply too offbeat to be 'believed' and raises too many questions without providing the answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this movie was creepy and twisted, but really, really good. The effects aren't the best, but that is easily overlooked (if you aren't a nitpicker).John Trent is sent to find Sutter Cane, a fiction writer, who mysteriously disappeared shortly before he was supposed to hand over his latest horror story. Accompanying Trent is Linda Styles. Together, they begin to drive to a town from one of Cane's earlier books, Hobb's End, previously thought to just be fictious. However, as Trent and Linda drive, the lines between fiction and reality blur, and they end up in Hobb's End, a town that really does just belong in a horror novel. Once there, a disbelieving Trent must figure out exactly what is going on and where Cane is.John Carpenter outdid himself with this one. In my opinion, it beats out Halloween even. The movie keeps you thinking on your toes, but somehow stays one ironic step ahead of you. While somewhat confusing, everything DOES come together eventually, so don't give up on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following a trend later expanded-upon by The Matrix and The 13th Floor, In the Mouth of Madness is the story of a man who finds he can no longer distinguish fact from fiction--but is it a fault within his own mind, or is reality itself at fault? A spooky takeoff of the works of H.P. Lovecraft will likely give you the willies for the rest of the night, and may cause you to question your role in the grand scheme of existence. The special effects weren't bad, really, considering how cheesy they had the potential to be. The movie lacks the "splatter" of other horror films, but brief partial nudity and some profanity render this one unfit for the kiddies. Adults with weak minds probably shouldn't watch, either, as they may think too much and accidentally set their own heads on fire.</fullReview>

John Carpenter does it again with a story so out of this world you might have to rewind bits just to make sure they really happened.Sam Neill has a career best performance where he his one-liners make you think why doesn't he do it more often? Charlton Heston almost snatches the entire show with just his presence on the screen, but is almost forgotten thanks to the total bizzareness of this film. John Carpenter has truly made some classics, this'll never stand on the same level as 'The Thing' or 'Halloween' but don't deny the fact he made what should of been a quick cash in into a should be cult classic.If you ever encounter this film for sale ignore the box's tag lines ("The Slimy Things Are Excellent") and get ready for one crazy ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>H.P. Lovecraft Lives through the Eyes of John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one but screenwriter Michael DeLuca and director John Carpenter has ever fully realized the beautifully, horrifying visions penned in the 1920s florid writing style of H.P. Lovecraft. The film embodies the frightening creations that Lovecraft gloried in a series of short stories, culminating in his masterpiece: The Cthulhu Mythos. The ominous prehistoric creatures, which held sway over earth prior to our existence, are at the center of most Lovecraft's tales. They are forever trying to return and take back what was once theirs. The tales revolved around individuals unlucky enough to encounter the monsters mid-plight. Carpenter and DeLuca follow in the bloodied footsteps of Lovecraft so faithfully we are given a true tour de force of the grotesque, demons from the vile pit and a slew of distorted human beings. The production brings the writer's horrific visions to full light -- Aye: there's the rub. The price of these colorful -- wild visuals expose Mr. Lovecraft's failure as a writer. That very thing makes it a true interpretation of his work but mortally wounds the film in the process.We have no narrative, no starting point at which the horror begins. Insanity without any background knowledge or a set-up is nothing more than horror for the sake of horror. The film, like H.P. Lovecraft's work, skirts answering intelligent questions. Who are the creatures? Why are they here? How did Sutter meet them? Why does Trent continue denying that something's not right -well into the madness? What is the Madness? Why is the book driving people mad? What we are given is a playful joke on a Stephen King like writer and the universe he has created. A story with in a story -- without knowing why Sutter has been seeing and writing about Trent. Why Trent was picked?Wouldn't it have been better to use H.P. instead of Sutter . H.P. was a much more colorful character than what we are given in the film. Lovecraft had many problems but his imagination will live on forever. Do not misunderstand me -- I have always enjoyed his short stories, however, were it not for a sudden interest in his work during the 70s no one today would know he ever lived. And H.P's fate? His work and his name are now being exploited by film makers. It would have been the one thing that would have truly horrified him. All in all I recommend the film for its stunning visuals and incoherent narrative -- it is, in fact, like a nightmare. Personally I have always found that the shock of horror second to the psychological horror, the creature in us all, the id of someone like Sutter Cain, Stephen King or H.P. Lovecraft -- to dwell in their universes would truly scare me.One finally note: Reading a Lovecraft tale is very different than watching one. Very, very frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the year 2000, we have lived through the enormous blockbuster The Matrix, and its subsequent rip-offs such as the 13th floor. Both films make us want to question reality. The Matrix throws it in your face and makes you eat it for breakfast. In the Mouth of Madness is a little more subtle. It lets you do a little thinking on your own, and the result is a much more terrifying film. I saw the movie 3 years ago and it frightened me, and i don't find movies frightening very often. Then, i just bought the DVD a watched it again and realized how terrifying it really is. But this time I started to laugh with Trent. It's all you can do at that point, right? Are you somebody's character? Are you meant to interact with the people you know because it's been scripted? What does such knowledge mean? Who controls your world? Do you have a world? This is reality. This is not reality. This is the mouth of madness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only two films have ever had such suspense and horrifying imagery to scare me this bad. The other film is phantasm, so go read my review for that to hear about it. This film is so terrifying and very smart, and has great monster effects (which are very subtle, but scary) I like how it doesn't give it's plot away in a linear way, it presents the scary plot through clues and flashbacks and the ending will leave you freaked out, as it doesn't show what you know is about to happen (if you payed enough attention). IF you have seen the movie, read on-Spoilers below- read only if you've seen the movie:My take on the ending: So everybody who read the book became a monster, and they made a movie so people who didn't read would still be turned into monsters also. So the main character is going to become one as he watches himself. Yet we, as the viewer, are also watching the movie, so we are going to turn into monsters! A real shocker of a multiple-meaning ending, huh?</fullReview>

I rented this like almost 2 yrs ago, when I was home alone &amp; my family was camping. I watched in the dark &amp; alone(same with THE THING) &amp; boy, this movie is creppy. The old lady riding on the bike scene was 1 of the scariest parts. S. Neill is a investagator who is told 2 search 4 the author who has made the scariest books which have made people go mad-SUTTER CANE. He goes out with the help of J. Carmen to look 4 Cane. ***spoliers*** They enter a town which is in his books &amp; realize is this Reality or Fiction. The gore was great, this is his best movie since THE THING. Great special effects &amp; yes, his endings r different. I like them, he leaves them open with a sense of what will happen or plans of a sequel(which is not really a ood idea though). So, if u r a fan of Carpenter, this movie is 4 u, its a excellent horror movie that will keep u on the edge of your seat. U just got 2 laugh at the idea that S. King-BEST HORROR AUTHOR ever's name is mentioned in the movie, saying that Sutter Cane outsells them all. Its worth seeing &amp; having.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter is one of the very few directors who has built a profitable and popular career directing almost nothing but horror films ("Dark Star" excepted). But as a fan, nothing is more depressing than slumping down in my chair in a movie theater, horribly embarrassed that I am actually viewing something like "Village of the Damned" or "Vampires". Having said that, I was not exactly excited when I bought the ticket for this one. Surprise, surprise. This film hit me directly between the eyes, starting with the savagely intelligent (and more than a tad tongue-in-cheek) screenplay and Sam Neill's dynamite performance. The concept is a little shopworn, but given the Lovecraft homage, not inappropriately. The only real quibble I have is the same one everyone has: namely, Julie Carmen (sorry, Julie, but this is not your finest 90 minutes). And lest I forget, the classic John Carpenter nihilistic ending (did you expect anything less?). See it and then be sure to avoid all the sorry excuses for Carpenter movies that come before and after it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This entire movie evokes the feeling of a nightmare right down to that nagging feeling in your stomach that something is terribly wrong.  John Trent (Sam Niel) is sent to find an author, Sutter Cane, who's publishers are afraid has made off on his substantial book advance. Trent gets pulled into something much deeper when he discovers people privy to advance copies have turned into homicidal maniacs with very strange eyeballs. He finds (in a fun scene) the town where all of Cane's books took place complete with giant, eerie demon cathedral, possessed elderly, murderous children, and roads that take you right back to where you came from no matter how far and fast you drive. Trent realizes the release of Cane's latest novel will free an unstoppable evil onto the world, and must be halted by all means necessary. The way the movie jumps around is not only scary and VERY dreamlike, but it makes perfect sense as the movie progresses. The end is a corker.  If there was any justice this movie would have made all the money ID4 made and more. This movie sticks with you for days. Full of haunting imagery, suspense, great effects, and big ole globs of humor. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I am a fan of John Carpenter and his film-making. I especially liked "the Thing". I was left with a feeling that this film could have been much better. It had everything a horror story needed including a great director (Carpenter), a great cast which acted superbly, Sam Neill in particular. It even had Charlton Heston in a small role. It even had a story line. So what was wrong? Maybe its just that there has been one too many of these kind of films done and we are all a little bored. This is a film that is ok to watch on Video on a night when you have absolutely nothing else on. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underestimated pulp horror fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie for the same reason that I love reading H.P. Lovecraft: it's a cheesy but enjoyable psychological horror yarn. It can be contrived and melodramatic at times, just like Lovecraft's stories, but this is actually used positively in this film. The tongue-in-cheek approach, emphasized by Neill's transition from skeptic to raving lunatic, will make any pulp fiction reader smile knowingly.There aren't any real scares in this one, per se, but it does well enough in establishing a surreal, claustrophobic atmosphere that makes you wonder exactly where reality ends. When it's campy it's fun, but it also has its share of good horror scenes that can also make you think.After watching the horrible "Vampires," I had to watch this one again to make sure it was the same director, but Carpenter did, in fact, do a good job on this one. Jürgen Prochnow has a relatively small, but juicy part as the reclusive horror writer Cane, and the appearance of various Cthulhu-esque monsters seems to be Carpenter's way of paying tribute to HPL. Good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty good movie. I liked its blend of different horror concepts, but after reading all of the other negative reviews (which I always do to help form my opinions) I can see the flaws. Personally I loved it. But I think it's pretty accurate to say that about 8 out of 10 people will enjoy it so that's what I gave it. Another reveiw said that they should have left out the scenes with the author. I agree with that. Also the girl could have been a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it real....or is it madness?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the first movies to really scare me since I saw Alien when I was 6 years old. An excellent view on our interpretations of fantasy and reality, and a frightening view of what could happen if "the insane were the majority". The movie leaves you wondering when events are actually happening to Trent, and which are being concocted in the twisted mind of Sutter Cane. The acting was very good, save a less-than-fabulous perfomance from actress Julie Carmen. Scenes like the boy on the bike, old woman and her husband, and (even more so) the ever changing scenery, will give you goose bumps for hours after the movie ends. One of Carpenter's best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting....but more story!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the mouth of madness had the potential to become one of the coolest movies of the year. Three quarters of the film built up a great plot, then it drowned as it tried to close up too much in the end, this reminded me of Event Horizon. The key to a good thinking movie is to leave some laces untied to make you think once you leave the theatre (i.e. The Truman Show, 2001 a space oddesy). In the mouth of madness was scary and (at some times) thought provoking but the horror was too over the top for its own good. The story is about an author whose books lead the reader into psychotic breakdown. Sam Neil portrays a man looking for this author in an imaginary town set in one of his books. From this point all reality becomes fiction and people are drawn into this world of books. Trying not to spoil too much I wanted to tell you that all the scenes with the actual author could have been left out altogether. This took the mystery out of the horror which in some cases needs to go hand in hand</fullReview>

Its surreal and horrifying visuals are the kind I'd really like to see a lot more often in horror today. I'm really quite sick of all the dull teenage slasher films that have unfortunately dominated the genre. 'Mouth' seems to be inspired by the work of master horrorologist, H. P. Lovecraft, and any horror buff who has never read Lovecraft is seriously missing out. I must give grand recommendations for Lovecraft's "Cthulhu Mythos".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Books really can take you anywhere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A clever thriller that went virtually unnoticed during its theatrical release, "In the Mouth of Madness" features an intriguing premise, some genuine shocks and top-notch performances from its cast, especially Neill and Prochnow.Neill plays a slimy investigator who seems to thrive on bringing down fraudulent insurance claims. He is very skeptical, then, when he is asked to find a bestselling author who seems to have quite literally dropped off the face of the earth. Horror writer Sutter Cane (sound like any real-life bestselling horror authors?), whose books are so vivid they have caused some readers to actually go insane, has vanished along with the manuscript for his new novel. When Neill goes after him, he finds himself trapped in one of Cane's fictional towns, and then the real fun begins.Like Wes Craven's "Nightmare on Elm Street", this film works because it is able to bend the line between fantasy and reality; at some points the viewer is left uncertain whether the events of the film aren't just all in Neill's imagination. And the idea of a horror author being so popular that bookstores that sell out of his new releases are scenes of riots doesn't seem that far-fetched; after all, Stephen King's works are bestsellers as soon as they can be published.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of fantastic genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, as I read it, is loved by everybody. And I cannot say I'm not because it's one of the best Carpenter's movies (I did not see "Dark Star", "Assault on the precinct 13" and "The thing" yet. I still don't know what was reality, what was not. It's the only movie where the physical fear (quite tough) is weaker than mental fear. It's a masterpiece. Really scary (just forget about "I know what you did last summer", b*******t for tourists as Mister Brown would say). Carpenter is the only director where the titles say exactly what is gonna be shown in the movie. That's why we're never disappointed. If he had been called for "Armageddon", for example, the world would have been destroyed, "Godzilla", there would have been a scary monster and not a tiny saurian. Carpenter wants people to spend time watching a movie for something, that's what he does with his movies. This is a movie whose pictures can't be forgotten. You can't forget the cyclist, Sutter Cane's "house", the corridor, the bleed tears... As I said, it's a masterpiece of fantastic genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Lovecraftian horror flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In The Mouth Of Madness" was another great horror film from John Carpenter, packed with surprises and suspense. Some Carpenter films have fallen below expectations, but this is surely not one of them.This film was downright frightening. Most horror films are easily figured out about 5 minutes into the film. "In The Mouth Of Madness" keeps surprising the viewer every scene, right up until the film's climax.Sam Neill is fantastic - is there anyone better at playing a man going insane than Sam Neill? Jürgen Prochnow also does a fine job as the scary and "a few cards short of a full deck" villain. Julie Carmen is adequate, if unimpressive, and doesn't detract from the rest of the cast.The film has many scenes based on works of horror by H.P. Lovecraft. If you are familiar with Lovecraft's work you will probably find the film more enjoyable, simply because there are some inside jokes that only a Lovecraft fan would understand. Also the "Sutter Kane" books in the film are parodies of H.P. Lovecraft stories - very amusing if you know the works.If you aren't a fan of the horror genre, you'll probably avoid seeing this film - but you'd be missing a wonderfully done tale of suspense in the process.</fullReview>

The thing is that this film has so much more than the immediate entertainment-value (which is considerable) because it exposes the very core of human perception. This one SHOULD make you think!

		<fullReview>"In the Mouth of Madness" has the great premise of books inspiring madness in people, and it's written and directed skillfully enough to effectively play with the question: "Exactly how insane Sam Neill's character really is?" The plot is so distinctive and twisted that it's a wonder why the movie never got the attention it deserved. If there is one drawback to the plot, it would be that it was unclear whether or not it went a little TOO far. The movie would have been just as scary and more believable if they left it with Sutter Cane's books causing mass insanity rather than going on with the books actually being self-fulfilling prophecies. But then again, the self-fulfilling prophecy angle could all be a delusion from Sam Neill too, which would be plausible. If that was the case, then it was too bad that they didn't make that clear at the end. Regardless of the shortcoming, it's still a worthwhile movie to check out at the video rentals...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenters last great movie...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last great John Carpenter film before he started to regurgitate and recycle his own movies. This is the final part of his apocalypse trilogy which started off with "The Thing" (1982), then following on with "The Prince Of Darkness"(1987) and ending with this Lovecraftian influenced story.The story involves an author aptly named Stutter Cane (sounds remarkably similar to Stephen King) who has disappeared on the eve of the launch of his latest masterpiece. Enter our "hero", John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance fraud investigator hired by the publisher to locate the author and the unreleased novel. Rumblings through the press and media describe how some fans of the books become crazed and deranged by the effects the books have on them and become hysterical, eagerly awaiting the release of the forthcoming book.Sceptical over the whole media circus revolving over the disappearance and believing it all to be a ploy to drum up more frenzy and interest for the new novel , Trent sets out to prove it as just a marketing strategy to increase sales. Accompanying Trent is Cane's editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), who tags along to make sure the novel is found and delivered on time for publication Over the course of the film Trent discovers not all what it seems. He tracks Cane down through his book covers which lead him a town written in his books called Hobb's End which doesn't appear on any maps and finds them driving on a freeway for hours and hours aimlessly before they suddenly stumble upon this eerie and dis-quietening town. Of course Trent still thinks that all of this is some sort of gimmick and a trick where the town and it's townsfolk are played by actors to represent the fictional characters along with the buildings and locations written in the novels by Cane. As the unexpected start to happen, Trent realises that the towns folk and the town isn't a theme park based on the books but in actual fact, reality and fiction mixing and merging where the words of the author becoming a deadly reality and leaving is not so easy.That's the main arc of the narrative and Carpenter manages to weave the complex and interesting ideas which not all come off but manages to combine suspense with a few jumpy moments (some which are cheap and expected) but a John Carpenter film is always watchable. It's only let down by the sheer weight of the story, it doesn't finish as strongly as it starts. But that doesn't mean it's not an enjoyable film. The direction by Carpenter is by far the strongest element though soundtrack isn't one of the more memorable Carpenter compositions. The acting on the whole is good, though some actors do look a little out of place (Charlton Heston as the publisher being one) not saying the performances were bad, they just felt odd.There are some great set pieces and great build ups to some of the scenes that it makes me sad to think Carpenter hasn't had a hit or made a good film in such a long time. Like I stated at the beginning, this is the last great John Carpenter film which is cruelly unavailable in the UK (you can import the French DVD which is compatible in the UK but has French subs if you can stand it). I luckily have a copy as I was sick and tired of waiting for UK release. If you can find a copy on VHS or it scheduled to show on TV give it a go. The last great, master of suspense horror film that isn't all blood, guts and gore but a great showmanship of skill and talent from what was once a brilliant director who seems intent on tarnishing the memories of what was once a glittering career. I am holding my breath for his new film "The Ward" which is due to be released this year. Lets keep those fingers crossed....if you like my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an aspiring author seeing this film was something magical and at the same time extremely disturbing. In the Mouth of Madness is not your typical horror, it may look like that from the trailer but let me tell you first hand that this film, as the title suggest, is pure and unflinching madness.In the Mouth of Madness has to be one of the most effective and well thought out horror pictures of the 90's maybe even today. It draws it's brilliance and dark theme straight from the minds of John Carpenter and Stephen King. It's morbid, dark, ingenious and oh so spooky. It's a film that resonates with the earlier works of John"Spooky" Carpenter and without him this film would have failed miserably to really induce any real madness or scares. It's a brilliant and severely underrated film that if you watch it It will driver you mad.San Neill(Who does good here.) has some charm and great skill to be in horror as in half the movie once he get's to Hobbs End he is almost always petrified with fear at the horrific things he seems. It's quite amazing to watch and see how your fear can mount and grow into your worst paranoiac nightmare when you least expect it. But none the less the cast does great in this dark psychological horror film.This film is to me what Titanic is to romance fans. It's a horror gem the likes you have never really quite seen it's the type of film that will haunt your dreams and it will bleed into your reality making everything around you into something horrifying. it's a great film to see, but I have just one request if you do, be careful because if your not I can promise you this film will drive you absolutely mad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Mouth of Madness is a brilliant movie in a Lovcraftian style. John Carpenter did an excellent job on this film, but he usually does with most films. All of his films have a very Lovecraft feel to it. If you're a Lovecraft geek (like me) see this film. You won't be disappointed. One of the most scary parts of the film is when Trent is running away from the monsters. But overall, the most scary aspect of this film is that you don't know what's fiction or reality. Even in the end... Take my advice and see it, preferably in the dark, where you don't know if a tentacle might come out from behind your closet door or maybe even under your bed...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning, God exposed the darkness to the light, there for- locking all the terrible thing's which hid within the dark once- into a void, allowing the beauty of nature to grow &amp; shine.So... here we are, in all of Gods glory! So what?! Well, what if it were time for what once was- to be set free &amp; inherit back what was their's?... reverse the light, back to darkness."In The Mouth Of Madness" has an atmosphere eerie &amp; somber, yet, completely enticing. When it's all over, I feel as though I've awoken from a lucid dream, wondering if the ancient tale's we know &amp; even fanatically believe, are a possible re-occurrence or just what they seem to be... tale's."Carpenter" knows how to create an eerie vibe in a horror film, with a chilling affect &amp; the visceral cinematic beauty he captures through out- pulls me further into the story every time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential for the Lovecraft Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think its safe to say that a full appreciation of this film requires some understanding of 1920's horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft is actually credited by Carpenter as the inspiration for In The Mouth of Madness, not to mention several of his other films. As a stand alone film, I find the plot to be bizarre and incomprehensible, but as an elucidation of Lovecraft's vision it was right on the mark.Order and sanity were not requisite components of Lovecraft's fiction, and you won't find them in this film either. The enduring suspicion throughout is that humans may be merely the temporal pawns of "the old ones;" god-like beings that hilariously delude humans into worshipping them. Also like Lovecraft's work, there is a serious thread of humor running through the film. Underlying the gore and confusion, there is a comical, nearly academic compulsion to examine existential questions. The incongruous mix of profundity and silliness makes this movie unbalancing and more than a little funny. The absurdity, like the visceral horror, is simply something that viewer will have to take at face value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated horror diamond in the rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is my favorite of John Carpenter's (well, to be fair, I've only seen The Thing, The Fog, Prince of Darkness, and Halloween). I wasn't expecting much but this blew me away. It's easily one of the most satisfyingly scary movies I've seen, and I'm a big horror nerd. One thing I've learned is that to truly enjoy a horror movie, you have to get in the right mindset - lower your guard, crank the volume up, and most importantly you have to want to be scared. It may not be the same for everyone, but if you're desensitized like me from seeing almost all the movies on everyone's top horror film lists and coming away untouched, it's the only way to go. This movie brought me back to the experience of fear I haven't felt since childhood.If supernatural thrillers are far more terrifying than real-life horror, then definitely check this out. It's a living nightmare in the vein of Jacob's Ladder and is epic, sophisticated horror at its best. The atmosphere is unnerving and the tension and shocks are jarring, to say the least. The scene on the highway with a boy on a bicycle simultaneously is chilling and full of pure horror. A scene in a hotel lobby involving people moving in a painting and a sweet old lady that is hiding something sinister is one that created a major impact on me. After certain scenes where I had the pants scared off me I was left with an adrenaline rush that filled me with joy. If you were scared during any of these movies: THE SHINING, THE EXORCIST, THE RING, JACOB'S LADDER, DIABOLIQUE, and THE OMEN, you should be terrified by this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the movie of my life.I watched it when I was a child and looked for it for years.(I really asked everyone I met about it)Finally I found it and can still say that it's king of fiction. No need to say something about acting cause it's SAM NEILL. No other scenario can be so fascinating.It catches you from the beginning and hold you jumpy to the end. Usually horror films have ordinary endings but this one is also different by its surprising end. I can't compare it with any other films cause it is matchless. Jonh Carpenter proves that he deserves his fame and success. It is a result of a brilliant brain. Interesting by its subject and the messages on the background that can be easily understood if watched carefully. I was afraid not to see it before I die.Now I'm happy to have its unforgettable scenes on my mind.I can find nothing negative to say about it. You must find and watch it as soon as possible.It is a film that can't be summarized. You will have dreams after it and won't enjoy any other horror films. OK may be I'm exaggerating a little but believe me it deserves it all. I am sure you won't regret and will thank me. I hadn't written any comment for a film but I want people to hear me and see it.Here is a sentence from the film: "a reality is what we tell each other it is." Doesn't it attracts you ,well, it does me .You will be IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Carpenter gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter has always been one of my favorite directors. I kick myself for waiting so long to see In the Mouth of Madness.An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) is hired to track down the whereabouts of Sutter Cane, the most popular thriller author since Stephen King. He along with a secretary embark on a journey to find Cane's hometown. After a very bizarre car ride, they find the remote town and some very strange things start to happen. Fiction and reality combine to a world of horror.The eeriest scene I thought was during the car ride they pass a young boy on a bike. Seconds later a much older biker peddles by again and again. The older man is creepy looking and watching the movie for the first time I thought the biker was John Carpenter himself! The hair matched his, but after watching it in slo-mo, I could tell the person was way too short to be Carpenter.Overall it's a real shame this movie wasn't more successful in it's initial release, but then again most of Carpenter's movies bomb in theaters then become cult classics. It's bizarre and creepy atmosphere make this a worthwhile edition to the career of John Carpenter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real madness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Neil plays a private detective hired to investigate the disappearance of one very famous author, much tougher than world-known Mr. Steven King. His name is Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow). It must be pointed out people are ready to kill for his books. To get well known to the man he's looking for Neil passes through his "masterpieces". Step by step he realizes something's happening to his mind. I mean he loses it step by step. At first nightmares, or closer ? sometimes he can't feel the broad between reality and endless terror nightmarish world created by the man he's after. Seeking the guy brings him to a town called Hob's end. It's a fictitious place either. At first one could read about it only in Sutter Cane's book. Strange, freaky and terrible things happen here all the time. Despite of real mental problems Neil still has to bring Cane back. I think Carpenter wanted to say "guys, if you want somebody back, it's O.K. Go get him, find him. Go anywhere, to the end of the world if you like, but not into the madness. You can't turn back then". Really, this movie has something to do with our minds. It has no scary scenes. I mean scary the way we used to consider like in a standard horror movie ? sudden, unexpected and loud? No, perhaps one or two episodes, that's not the point. You'll get scared for what a single man can do to the world with a single book. Now, that's really scary. And really global. Cult, cult, cult! I just can't be Carpenter's stable fan. I still remember troubles caused by this "thriller" in 96, first time I saw it, but what's more amazing. I didn't lose my chance to watch it again recently. This time I thought I can handle it. You think I could do it? You guess right. Of course ? no. You can't get used to it or fight it. Just sit back to enjoy the show. Enjoy it. If you don't, there won't be mercy from Carpenter. I really advice you to have some breaks during watching, may be have some TV talk-show pause for 5 minutes, then continue watching. Just find the way of not going too deep. Otherwise, you don't know what you're dealing with. Perhaps when you read the script is not written by John, you don't expect much, but you'll get much more you need. It's rich in everything. I don't even want to encounter, but the mix done by Carpenter really makes troubles. It makes mad. Highly recommended! (sorry for you, guys, I'm so sorry) Perfect! (what is true, it is true)Just be careful! He sees you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Carpenters better jobs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently we have seen some truly awful work of the great man. Yes i still regard him as the great man because we should always remember the great films he did release that made an impact in the 80's and 90's. Forget Vampires and Ghost of Mars and let us remember his work such as The Thing, Haloween, The Fog, Prince of Darkness......and this little gem.In the Mouth of Madness is one of those horror films, just like The Thing, where at the time of its release not many people really acknowledged it. But now 10 years on because horror movies are being made so badly at the moment we have to rely on the past to show us how a true horror movie is really done.The film is about Sam Neils character John Trent who is a hired Insurance Investigator trying to track down Cult Horror writer Sutter Cane played by Jurgen Prochnow, who apparently has gone missing. Trent accompanied by Julie Carmens character Linda Styles journey to a town to find the writer only to discover they have entered a place which breaks the realms of reality.From there on it becomes a question of where is Sutter Cane and what has happened to him.The assembled cast is reasonably good. Sam Neil and Jurgen Prochnow do good jobs and Carmen is okay as the lead female. Add in a few star short appearances from David Warner and Charlton Heston and you've overall got a pretty decent crew.The effects are good. Some of the creature designs remind me of 'The Things' work back in the 80's. CGI is so overrated when it comes to capturing a persons imagination based on horror i feel.As for the music, yep its got the recognisable John Carpenter work as usual. The guys multi-talented what can i say? A good film.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was an excellent view on how reality may one day change and that every that was rational and sane can become irrational and dive beyond the depths of madness of the human mind. The dark overtones of the movie makes it a classic Carpenter film along the lines of The Thing, Prince of Darkness, and They Live. Where the existence of the human race will only become a fairy tale. The visual effects were decent, but the focus on John Trent (Sam Neill's character) trying to rationalize what is happening with the books written by Sutter Cane and how it begins to effect the public and the plunge into madness and mass hysteria and reports of people turning into monsters. Definitely a film that is a must to see for any horror movie fans out there.</fullReview>

You have to really think about the movie for a whole day after watching it.In The Mouth Of Madness is completely set in the mind of the writer Sutter Cane straight from the beginning and Sam Neill is a character invented (just like every other character) by Sutter Cane. This is why Sutter is like a God because he is the writer and it is his mind. Hobb's End is a quaint little town that for some reason gives off an Agatha Christie vibe but heck when i turn 65 in a few decades time i wouldn't mind retiring there. Great film worth seeing once but should be viewed three or four times to be really appreciated. 9/10</fullReview>

This is probably the most Lovecraftian main-stream horror-movie ever made. A must see for all horror fans who likes Stephen King and Lovecraft and Carpenters work. I don't think he really lives up to this standard since but there is still great hope that Carpenter will create more classic work. With horror being in a crisis right now it is good to go back to the roots with this Barker-like terror. The main actor is so good in portraying madness it is almost beyond belief. A surprisingly great movie! Must see for horror fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Mouth of Madness is definitely the most disturbing film I have ever seen Sam Neill in, and easily the best. This is one of the few times when a movie has really stuck in my head for days after and freaked me out all the way from start to finish.Despite the cheap-looking monsters, John Carpenter uses this to his advantage, and the movie is even nastier thanks to it. The script is intelligent and the acting brilliant, so I really can't think of a bad thing to say about it. The ending literally made me shiver, and although I didn't think any of the film was actually scary, it definitely plays with your head and gives you a chill.I've only watched it once as it really is one of those films you can only see once, but I strongly recommend it, especially if you can forgive the cheap production. This is the only film I've given a 10 star to so far, and for good reasons. The best horror I've ever seen, and easily one my favourite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is John Carpenter's most overlooked movie other than the Fog and I guess I understand why. A lot of people aren't intelligent enough to enjoy a movie that relies on stunning visuals, a great plot, and chilling atmosphere. How can you lose with Sam Neill being the lead actor? Watching his descent into madness as reality and fantasy merge is actually pretty funny. To me it's more funny than hearing Busta Rhymes say, "Trick or treat motha fuc*a!" This is not a movie where there are a bunch of stupid teenagers running around so if your favorite movie is Urban Legends avoid this. But if you like a deep horror movie that lets you think and see some amazing acting, definitely check this out. Oh yeah, if you're not a fan of horror movies meaning if you like 10 horror movies and all of them star someone from Dawson's Creek(of course you think you're a horror freak), you'll hate this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF CARPENTER'S BEST!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge horror movie fan, I am also a huge fan of John Carpenter. This movie is one of the best and also one of the last to come out in a great time for horror. Ever since Scream came out, it seems that most horror movies are more and more watered down so they can be marketed to a younger audience. This film was released a year before this disappointing trend arrived. Not only that, this is almost a forgotten gem and a link to the heyday of his career. Carpenter has always put out great work, but hasn't put anything out to rival his "platinum era." I call the time between 1978-1984 the platinum era, seeing as each one of his films from the era or masterpieces. Not only are they masterpieces in their own right, but it seems like each film gets better in its own way. It started with the beginning of the franchise/slasher era with Halloween. He followed up Halloween with the excellent ghost story that is The Fog. After The Fog he put out 4 more classics: Escape from New York, with the antihero Snake Plissken; The Thing, a landmark in special effects which could be argued to be the best film of his career; Christine, which gets my vote for best Stephen King adaption and coolest car; and the touching Starman, a sci-fi love story. After this his work was still golden, but had more of a b-movie feel to it. This included the camp classic They Live and the anthology Body Bags. In the Mouth of Madness displays the brilliance shown in the "platinum era." I don't want to spoil anything, but this is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years. Of course, this didn't break any records at the box office. Not only did this come out in a time before horror became cool again, it was also a time when tickets were $5 for evening shows. Nevertheless, this movie is done well on all fronts. Carpenter knows how to make you jump out of your seat and presents some really unsettling visuals. I get a little more creeped out with each viewing. Sam Neill puts in a great performance, and Julie Carmen also does well in her supporting role. Another Carpenter score to perfectly compliment the movie. This movie is also shot very well, and boasts an excellent script. A must for all Carpenter fans and highly recommended to any fans new to the horror genre. Turn the lights down low and enjoy!</fullReview>

Lovecraft effectively blurs the fine line between fantasy and reality, and in so doing takes a much-deserved place at the head of the list of "Lovecraft-inspired" fright films. (The next closest thing would probably have to be DIE,MONSTER,DIE!) Carpenter's ever-fluid style of filmmaking is a perfect compliment to the subject matter: he manipulates reality for us to great effect, and that aforementioned distinction becomes... much less distinct. One can only imagine what Carpenter could do with an outright adaptation of, say, THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really weird and scary at times. The story is brilliant, just out of H.P. Lovecraft. It carries out like a Nightmare in which you never know what's real and what's not. Carpenter builds the suspense beautifully, Sam Neil gives one of his greatest performances ever, and Heston is terrific, even though his part is short. The only downside is that the visual effects are REALLY lousy.The storyline and the characters are more complex and interesting that the ones in 'The Thing' but Carpenter doesn't handle them as well as he does in The Thing. Bottomline: The Thing is scarier, but In the Mouth of Madness is cool, because it is much stranger, suspenseful and has better performances than its predecessor.I won't go into the plot, plenty reviews have done that, but basically the film is about separating reality from fiction and it presents us with the possibility of being just fictional characters in some dream. I gave it an 8/10 because the make-up and visual effects are pathetic, so it takes some of the charm away from the movie. But still the great story keeps it interesting. A Must See for horror enthusiasts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is so strange and surreal...I love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film came out in 1994 and featured Sam Neil right off his run as Dr. Grant in Jurassic Park. Suffice to say, it did not come close to the totals that the mega hit did; however, that should not be too surprising seeing as how this is a horror film. That being said, the total run at the box office was pretty underwhelming and it baffles me that this one did not do more than the paltry sum of 8.9 million. Sure, I'd love to have that much money as I could live out the rest of my days without working at a job I hate and stressing over bills, but for a movie that had a budget of 8 million that total just is not that great. To me, this was a fantastically strange film with so much freaking weird random things going on that it just clicked for me in a way that it probably did not do for most movie goers back in the day. I do have a warped imagination and I like the whole premise of the film and certain areas of the film are almost perfect to me. John Carpenter made a film that was more Lovecraftian in tone that nearly all the actual films based on Lovecraft have been and it kind of adds a dose of Stephen King in there as well. Not the type of story mind you as that is nearly all Lovecraft, but more the whole prolific horror writer angle and the part of the country this film takes place in. A strange film to be sure, but one that really works for me.The story has a man who investigates insurance claims tasked with finding a missing author. He is good at his job and is an ideal person for the job. It is almost all too perfect! Well, he nearly is killed by a man who is apparently Sutter Cane's agent (the author) and this is only the first of many strange occurrences that happen that suggest there is something more going on here than a simple insurance fraud investigation. However, John Trent (the investigator) still believes he is being set up and everything is being staged. He manages to find out the probable location of Sutter Cane in a place called Hobb's End, which also happens to be a town that Sutter Cane has written about. John and a female who is Sutter's editor try to find this town that doesn't exist on any map and soon find more strange occurrences on the trip to this place and once they arrive. The town is exactly as it has been written by Cane and soon Trent will learn that everything is how it is written! The film really has some great stuff going for it. It has supernatural elements that I really like and one of my favorite horror conventions not done enough for my tastes, a town with a very dark secret. Sam Neil is very good in this role as John Trent and probably another reason why I enjoy this film so much. He is the reason I enjoy the first and third installments of Jurassic Park the best. Only a few minor gripes to go along with the film as they could have set a couple of things up better and had a bit more exploring of the town before things really went downhill, but overall it was a very fun and fast ride! So a very good John Carpenter film, one of the last that he did that I really enjoyed. The only thing he did after this that I liked a bit was his Vampire film. This one just had so many strange and interesting elements all thrown in to make a very bizarre film that really hooked me in. I almost wish those books by Sutter Cane were real as they seem like they would be interesting, though without the whole going insane by reading them aspect to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie, often overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart.The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane.I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself.Three of the actors ? Sam Neill, Jürgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house ? simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part.The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying "horrors beyond imagining", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort.Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares ? the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected.But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock ? if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing ("We've only just begun", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line "Sorry about the balls ? it was a lucky shot" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: "Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy." As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural.All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Reality is not what it used to be" (Wilhelm Von Homburg)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the Mouth of Madness" (1994) is a jewel of a horror movie. However, in reality, the things are a bit more complicated. The question is only: in which reality? - Probably in the reality of the audience that is absorbed into the maelstrom of the story. Strongly simplified, this movie is a movie about a movie about a book which does not deliver the scenario of that movie but whose scenario is delivered by that movie. In addition, the time-lines have been scrambled. If you do not realize that, then the things get slightly more complicated, because in that case, the movie is not only a movie about a movie about a book, but a movie about an actor who plays an agent who plays an actor who cannot remember that he played in a movie. A movie that gives the audience the feeling, that it can control the situations from the beginning to the end and can, at every point, exactly determine who is who, would not be appropriate to the story. "In the Mouth of Madness" is the very seldom case of a movie that does not succumb to the cozy armchair at home or in the cinema.For all those who loved him: "In the Mouth of Madness" is the last international film of Prince Wilhelm Von Homburg (Berlin, 1940 - Puerto Vallarta (Mexico) 2004) who worked with so famous directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Werner Herzog, John Carpenter, Bernhard Wicki, in so famous films like "Ghostbusters II", "Morituri", "Die Hard", "Stroszek", in such famous TV series like "Wild Wild West", "The Invaders", "Gunsmoke", with so famous actor colleagues like Paul Newman, Yul Brynner, Bruce Willis, Mario Adorf and many more and whose life has been documented in 2002 by Gerd Kroske in the award-winning documentary "The Boxing Prince".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were no really horrifying monsters. Whoever reads the book the story becomes about them. John Trent was the whole story, but only for John Trent. If David Moody had read it, it would then be about David Moody, and that would be his name under the title. That's how the people went insane.The monsters are just a point to help drive you mad. Imagine you are being chased by monsters and you are just about to get away but you bump into a police officer and he try's to keep you from running off. Well that officer is now a threat to you because there are monsters after you and you have get away. So you attack maybe even kill the cop just to get away. Problem is there were no monsters. Only in you mind were they real. Thats what makes you crazy. Now you are insane to the public. Though if everyone reads the book, then insanity is real and everyone else are the truly afflicted because the can't see the monster that could be right behind them. That is the genius and I believe the point of this film. Wonderfully introspective. You have every right to disagree though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is touted as one of Carpenter's best; the epitome of his genius. I disagree. In my opinion this is a lesser work for which he may only take 1/4 of the credit. (Very loosely) Based on Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness, this work was written by DeLuca who is only marginally talented. In my opinion, the atmosphere was wrong for anything more than a horror/comedy. This work has some creepy moments, but nothing out of the nightmare that is Lovecraft. The effects are passable, but did little to generate the feeling of outright dread necessary to subscribe to the Lovecraftian style. Nor did the effects come of as anything special when dealing with the "demons" from the other side of the dark veil within the black tower. I mean...let's face it: they were not as well developed as the "dark overlords" from Howard the Duck!If you want good Carpenter I suggest Halloween 1 &amp; 2, the Fog, or Assault on Precinct 13.It rates a 5.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film carries a hidden meaning and message that is far too abstruse, difficult, and complex, for most to fully comprehend. A must see for any adherent to aesthetics: the science of the beautiful; and the doctrines of taste, who truly seeks to know what's really "wrong with this picture".The power of suggestion, a dynamic that is already at work, and most effectively in force in this world, is the real underlying plot, or back story here; and one that is so ingeniously conceived, and well hidden, that it is almost as completely invisible to the casual observer as it's (so-called) real-life counterpart.The evidence of which being most clearly exemplified through any number of the various different viewers comments upon the film.The film itself is much less about the director John Carpenter, than it is about the writer and executive producer Michael De Luca. A man of many considerable means himself, who is not only the one who really truly see's here, but the real"ghost-in-the-machine", or man behind the curtain, as well.The very title of the film is an alliteration to"from out of the mouths of babes", and infralapsarianism; both of which being reflective of such recondite and esoteric principles as which can only be understood by "following the white rabbit", and employing the process of "syntactic bootstrapping", by carrying out such propositions as "reality is only what people tell us it is", and "the problem with religion is that nobody really believes it", to their ultimate conclusions. Do this, and perhaps you too will be able to see.If this movie doesn't quite literally scare the hell out of you, then you just might very well be, one of "them".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cinema of John Carpenter: The Final Chapter in the Trilogy of the Apocalypse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Mouth of Madness (1994) was the final chapter in the loosely linked trilogy of the Apocalypse. John Carpenter returns to the silver screen with another dark and depressing film (yay!). This tale is about the disappearance of one of the World's most sought after and best selling novelist Sutter Kane (Jurgen Prochnow). His publisher has hired a private investigator (Sam Neil) to look for the writer, Sutter Kane's latest novel is well over due. The consumers are waiting with cash in hand.After searching high and low, the investigator decides to look in to the writings of the novelist to search for clues into where he might be hiding. The clues lead to New England. Whilst searching in the North Atlantic area, he finds a strange town that's located in the middle of nowhere. What he discovers literally blows his mind. He finds Sutter Kane alright, and things that the living were never meant to see. The P.I. awakes some time later. Every thing is different. Confused, he tries to find the odd hamlet but it's like it's never existed. Weirdness and madness over comes the P.I. The World seems to have gone insane. People are going crazy over the latest Sutter Kane novel. The P.I. is also confused by the growing madness as well. He goes over the edge when he kills a Sutter Kane fanatic. Killing the fans puts the P.I. into a mental institution. But that doesn't stop his vision of the Apocalypse. While the world around him crumbles, he rots away inside a padded cell. What is going on in the P.I.'s head? Has he become part of the novel? Is he the story? Soon he hears the unspeakable beasts from the depths of hell rip through his asylum. When the carnage is over, the P.I. leaves his cell and finds a world that has been destroyed. Wandering through the remains of humanity, he hears the voices from a few survivors on the radio. After walking the streets for sometime, he stumbles across the movie version of Sutter Kane's last novel. To his horror he realizes that he's the star! Madness over comes the poor P.I. as he finally realizes the truth behind everything and just goes with it.Another classic film from John Carpenter. It's not as great as THE THING or PRINCE OF DARKNESS but it'll entertain you none the less. You'll need to bring your brain with you when you watch this movie. I recommend this final chapter of the Trilogy of the Apocalypse. You wont regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from Carpenter's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm sorry about the balls! It was a lucky shot, that's all!" Sam Neill's strained delivery of this line managed to illicit an early chuckle. As In the Mouth of Madness continued, I began to notice that this lament applied to the entirety of the proceedings. Any impact, testicular or otherwise, that the film had seemed to be down to "a lucky shot" rather than crafted direction.John Carpenter is a director with a somewhat chequered record. Responsible for classics such as Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), Halloween (1978) and The Thing (1982), Carpenter also has the dubious distinction of helming misfires like Ghosts of Mars (2001), Escape from L.A. (1996) and Big Trouble in Little China (1986). In the Mouth of Madness falls somewhere muddy in between the extremes.Penned by studio executive and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) author Michael De Luca, the film plays like a TV movie mystery with a H.P. Lovecraft pre-occupation. Sam Neill plays John Trent, a seemingly pre-eminent freelance insurance claims investigator, hired by a publisher to locate their missing star talent, Sutter Cane, played Jurgen Prochnow. Cane is a ubiquitous horror writer, one of those literally 'big names' who's moniker dwarfs the title on the cover. Apparently his works have a profoundly disquieting affect on the less mentally stable members of his vast fan base, and the anticipation for his latest volume is at a violent fever pitch. In what is probably the film's most successful scene, even Cane's agent succumbs to the hysteria in time tested axe wielding fashion. The ever sceptical Trent is eventually dispatched to a possibly non-existent little corner of New England, along with the horribly stilted Julie Carmen playing Cane's editor, Linda Styles. The spookiness then begins in earnest, is it all a publicity stunt? Has Cane gone mad? Can Carpenter manage to hold things together long enough for us to care? In the Mouth of Madness clearly has lofty ambitions. The framing device initially seems hackneyed but grows in to almost David Lynch territory. H.P. Lovecraft's material, although not directly adapted here, is notoriously difficult to bring to the screen, and has been unsuccessfully relied upon to bring the bulk of the scares. My ultimate impression is that neither De Luca nor Carpenter have a firm enough grasp on the material to make a coherent or entertaining film.My expectations of the film were immediately lowered by the horribly clichéd heavy rock opening music. I think this interview extract (originally from Violet Veil magazine) humorously demonstrates just how far of the mark Carpenter's judgement was with this film: Interviewer: "In the Mouth lightly satirised the horror genre, but did you also do that with the music? The opening number has a very heavy metal feel?" JC: "What you do when you're screening for audiences you put temporary music on, when you don't have it done. And we put on Metallica's 'Enter Sandman' and the whole audience, their heads were bobbing and I said 'You know what, why don't we start the movie with something like that?' So one of my pals Dave Davies (the lead guitarist from the Kinks) wrote the song. It was a great way to get the movie going, it gets you cranked, it gets you going!" The fact Carpenter thought a limp, public domain doppelganger track would have a similar affect to the biggest ever metal band's most famous song pretty much sums up the level of competence, or lack thereof, on show. The genre references and instances of dark humour are too few and far between for the film to be considered a send up, and the horror is far too anaemic for it be straight. The globally poor standard of acting on show does little to help matters. Horror fans may find the less usual elements and Lovecraft flavour worth watching for, less passionate viewers should dust off a copy of Halloween, The Thing, or even Prince of Darkness (1987) before resorting to slumming it in the mouth of mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A World Gone Insane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(+SPOILERS+) " In The Mouth of Madness" is a movie that completely freaks out some 40 minutes into the story and never comes back to sanity again. It leaves you confused and befuddled to just what your watching. It seems like the movie ran out of a story and just slapped together a number of out-take footage to have it completed for release. John Trent, Sam Neill, is institutionalized for a serious mental breakdown at the beginning of the movie and is being interviewed by Dr. Wrenn, David Warner, in a padded cell with nothing but black crosses drawn by John with a crayon that he was given by one of the attendants.John tells his story in flashback about him being an insurance investigator that is called by the Arcane Publishing House to find it's top writer Sutter Cane, Jurgen Prochnow, a Steven King like horror/mystery writer. Cane mysteriously disappeared, just before his latest book "In The Mouth of Madness" was to be released. Not a Sutter Cane fan John, trying to get an idea to what makes him tick, reads a number of his books and starts to slowly freak out. He begins to see things and go nutty as the real world morphs into a Sutter Cane story with John being the main character. With John's mind being taken over by the Cane books one night he notices that, when he spread them out on his coffee table, they form some kind of jigsaw puzzle that is a map that Cane himself put on the book covers. Put together it's a map of Western New Hampshire with a cross at the town of Hobb's End a non-existent town from one of Cane's book titles. John driving with Linda Styles, Juli Carmen, an executive of Arcane Publishing to were Hobb's End is on his map. After a harrowing night on the road like magic it's daylight and their in the town of Hobb's End. It's at this point where the movie goes off the deep end and into the outer limits of reality. Interesting but somewhat disjointed film about mass-madness that keeps you guessing if the story is real or some kind of hallucination on the part of John Trent. The movie "In The Mouth of Madness" does keep you interested and is never really boring but does confuse you and leaves you somewhat empty in the end. I for one gave up trying to figure out what was happening when it became obvious after both John and Linda entered the town of Hobb's End. It was then that everything became so wacko where it just didn't surprise me anymore to what was happening because it made no sense at all to me or for that matter both John and Linda too. We see john insane at the beginning of the movie to being normal during the flashback scenes of what happened to put him in that padded cell to were he slowly looses his mind. As the movie moves towards it's conclusion John finally accepting his fate of his distorted sense reality. Sam Neill is very good in the movie and his top-notch acting makes the role he has believable because you can see that he realizes what he's up against and gives in to it at the end.Neill is last seen laughing his head off and popping popcorn in his mouth in an empty movie house enjoying the film on the screen that he's staring in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a better effort than 'Event Horizon', but it still doesn't get a much higher rating in my book. For all its perverseness and slight pretenses of originality, 'Madness' is a piece of blood-soaked mutilation that can easily be passed up by moviegoers with taste and weak stomachs alike.I saw Neill in 'Horizon' and merely passed it off as a blotch on a generally decent career. Now, as I go back to review past movies, I'm seeing him pop up in more grotesque cinema features. (Spoilers abound beyond here) The idea of the characters being "written" into the plot by the author was a nice little twist, though.The plot flowed fairly well, but Trent's (Neill) partner was a LOUSY actress with a lousy voice. The script was awful: Neill's British accent didn't conform well to the American slang he used, and his partner had some lame lines. The part about reality getting twisted around was ok...but the part where the deformed people come after him was just such a ripoff of countless horror flicks from ages past. The suspense combined with the innate stupidity of the characters wasn't suspenseful at all: it was frustrating and downright annoying at times.Yet...it's not a totally awful movie; there were some likeable things to it, some neat little bits for horror fans...but just not enough. Thank God one didn't end up getting lost between the fantasy world and reality, even though the former took over the latter and became it in the end. Again, I'm grateful for the clarity there. That helps improve it a bit. But not by much. And the ending was incredibly, incredibly stupid, as it had been built up the entire running time of the film, only to end up as a let down. *2.4 out of 5*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Carpenter Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have lots of reasons not to like Mouth of Madness, but I find it charming in a fun, goofy, horror spoof-ish kinda way. It doesn't really have much point to it so it stumbles along pulling a rabbit out of its hat and other assorted magic tricks along the way . . . but ya know, I kinda liked it anyway, and the film feels right this way. The contrasting personalities of Julie Carmen and Sam Neill along with the villain Jurgen Prochnow (who somehow reminds me of Ernest Thesiger in Bride of Frankestein) are all fun to watch as they embrace this over the top, wacky little world.I love the dialogue - the bickering of Neill and Carmen. Sam Neill's character arc throughout the film. Prochnow's elusive and enigmatic presence - him driving poor Sam to the edge of sanity. Whether the writer's vision or the actor's improvisation, it has a certain flair that's entertaining to follow. Another aspect I love are things thrown in seemingly for the hell of it; spontaneity is always welcomed if handled appropriately. And if you had power over reality, what would you do? `My favorite color is blue.' Completely out of left field. Completely unnecessary. Great stuff. My biggest complaint is that I felt Carpenter went too far and showed too much in places, especially when Neill acquires the manuscript and the monsters chase him. An unseen force or fleeting glimpses would've worked better than what we do see (admittingly, it is brief glimpses . . . it's still too much). That pushes it over the line into overly-corny territory. As silly and over the top as the previous weird occurrences are, Carpenter exercises just enough restraint to keep it hovering above the b-grade material that it's poking fun at. It's not a horror classic like Hitchcock's Psycho, Friedkin's Exorcist, or even Carpenter's own Halloween. It's not meant to be. In the Mouth of Madness was entertaining, that's all it wants to be, and that's all I need it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the mouth of madness is quite a hard film to review because it doesn't quite seem to know what it wants to be and the result is a film that had potential but unfortunately spirals a little out of control. When the film first starts we see an old horror classic setting in the lunatic asylum and John Trent (Sam Neil) has just checked in. Once Neil is being interviewed about how he got there we see the film as told by his recollection of the past events that led up to him arriving there. Now this is where I got interested as it did a good job of setting up the premise and for the first 40 minutes or so it really is an interesting ride. There are a some nicely shot scenes and you do get a sense of eeriness and it is a little unsettling in parts but unfortunately the film runs out of steam fairly quickly and the end result was disappointing as the film is too all over the place and disjointed by the time the credits roll. The acting on the whole wasn't too great either, I thought Sam Neil did a good enough job but the supporting cast were pretty poor as were some of the special effects. It's a film that had potential but ultimately winds up being too clever for it's own good. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the last good movie of John Carpenter . It's a horror movie that has more plot than most movies of this genre , since it plays with the "what is reality ?" idea. The script is quite complex and serious , yet never takes itself too seriously. I loved the references to H.P. Lovecraft stories , Stephen King and even Carpenter himself. Once again Carpenter composed and played all the music by himself and once again the music is great. The ending is one of the greatest I have ever seen . Simple , but very effective.The cast is good with Sam Neill , Julie Carmen , Jurgen Prochnow , Charlton Heston , John Glover and Bernie Casey. Neill proves he's a better actor than most of the audience thinks , while Carmen gives a performance full of confidence and charisma.The only problem I have with this movie is that it isn't scary for me. Carpenter tries to scare the viewer , but in too Hollywood-like way (something suddenly appears or flashy light) , too plastic. Maybe it's because the special effects are dated (funny thing ? I don't have that problem while watching many 80's horror movies). There is something lacking about his direction , that magic touch that would made me forget that this is just a movie . When I watch "Hellraiser" or "From beyond" I have goose bumps all over my body ? I miss that feeling here.The movie holds good on repeated viewings . I'm not necessary a fan of horror movies , yet I have this one in my collection. I really like it. If you're a fan of the genre you should give this movie one star more. I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Gem for Horror Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film.The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear.The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King.John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly.For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments.Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this movie came out almost 2 decades ago, it is so good that it will always stand the test of time. Being a fan of H. P. Lovecraft, as well as any and all books and movies where you spend a lot of time afterward wondering what just happened but totally enjoying that time trying to figure it out, all I can say is that Carpenter managed to stay on track. It may not seem so as the movie develops and I can see where a lot of people would be going, HUH? a lot, even after the movie ends. Especially as the viewer wonders, just as Trent wonders, if this is truly real or not. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT. STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIE. Here is my take on it: Trent is actually Cane. It is the real author (Trent/Cane) who has gone insane and is living out his own works of fiction. Everything we see we see through his eyes as scenes from his previous books are revealed to be incorporated into this final story of his (the title of his book and of this movie). Therefore, nothing is real to anyone else, but it is all real to Trent/Cane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the sole diamond in the latter day career of John Carpenter. Alas this return to form manifested itself in this film only. It could also be the best portrayal of Lovecraft's vision on screen without of course being directly sourced from Lovecraft.The character of Trent brilliantly played by the ever reliable Sam Neill relays his story to David Warner's character explaining how he has ended up in an asylum. As the movie progresses the worlds of fiction and reality merge and you are not sure if Trents story is the ramblings of a madman or if the events are actually happening. The opening shot of the ambulance abandoned outside the institution is one of several hints that the nightmare Trent describes may have begun in the world outside.Credit also to Jurgen Prochnow for his performance as horror novelist Sutter Cane. Cane is the conduit through which the "old ones" come through from the other side, their purpose being to destroy humanity. When the monsters do appear their screen time is rationed which is no bad thing.The movie is well paced with an intriguing plot and is laced with touches of trademark Carpenter humour. The first time i watched this movie the ending somewhat threw me but on repeat viewings makes perfect sense. (just look at the title of the movie)For whatever reason the critics hated this movie while praising the vaguely similar but vastly inferior Wes Cravens New Nightmare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of John Carpenter's Movies, my opinion on this particular title could be deemed as being biased. However I sincerely enjoyed this dark, comic and sometimes disturbing little gem. The plot was done in the usual Carpenter-esquire trademark with it's uglier than life anti-heroes trying to survive in an inhospitable environment whilst occasionally spitting out some witty if somewhat corny one-liners. The camera work is what to be expected from the director as is the trademark music that always adds that little extra atmosphere to his movies. The one thing that makes In the Mouth of Madness unique to John Carpenter's other films is the connection to a certain Lovecraft Mythos. This film has a strong sub plot of the weakness of the protagonist's sanity. You have your freaky town with its dark secrets and mutating indigenous population and not to mention the tonnes of tentacles thrown into the mix. All in all I really enjoyed the movie, but if you disagree then try a Barbera Streisand flick, that's sure to scare you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my humble opinion this is John Carpenter's finest work. I haddifficulty finding a great deal of flaw in the making of this film,particularly after viewing and evaluating it on a realistic level. Ithought the film was better classified as a psychological thriller thana horror movie. One that happened to be superbly written and very welldirected. Not to mention the cinematography which was better thanaverage, along with impressive special effects. Granted, some of the dialogue is wooden, particularly early on. However,it seemed to evolve and become significantly sharper as the filmprogresses. This may very well have been a planned effect to keep thefilm in perspective.The primary focal point is Sam Neill who is terrific in his portrayal ofa talented, ever skeptical freelance insurance investigator. He beginshis newest assignment coupled with the beautiful editor of a missinghorror novelist of cult status. He begins this excursion with noknowledge of the fact that his life and state of mind will soon beforever altered along with his perception of fraud and reality.I'm convinced that most of the individuals who really disliked thisflick were simply unable to follow it. Either it flew right over theirhead or they spent too much time at the snack bar, (trust me, any timeat all would have been too much). The plot and story line areconsiderably more intricate than most films of this nature. At the sametime it is highly structured, although somewhat chaotic, but completelypurposeful nevertheless. This selection is understandably not for everyone. If you've seen thesuspenseful sleeper "Session 9" chances are you've already seen "In theMouth". The reverse is considerably less likely. If you found either oneto be worthwhile viewing experience then you should make it a point tosee the other.</fullReview>

MOM is filled with lovecraftian themes, like the stygian monsters waiting to enter our dimension, the madness which fills the world, the uneasy and unsteady line between fantasy and reality. Sam Neill does an excellent job characterizing Trent, and Mr. Hargrove's persona is equally well personified by an already ailing Charles Heston..Not to forget Sutter Cane, the mad writer who's the instrument of the old gods re-entrance into the universe..This is a movie well suited for a stormy night, I would say...</fullReview>

The plot is quite similar to Adaptation in that it's a book within a book within a movie. Great blend of computer-generated effects as well as pixelations and puppetry.

Shortly after the beginning of the film, I realized I was watching a story crudely cobbled together from elements of H. P. Lovecraft's "The Cthulu Mythos" and Ursula K. LeGuin's "The Lathe Of Heaven". Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this blatant example of plagiarism from John Carpenter, whose past work has generally been very enjoyable. The title is even a direct steal from Lovecraft's "At The Mountains Of Madness". Mr. Carpenter, shame on you. You didn't even have the courtesy to credit the two real authors of your film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's one thing I really don't understand with John Carpenter's movies: why does he always shows some (more or less ridiculous) monsters which steal all of the horror? Doesn't he trust us to work them out in our own phantasy?This also kills that movie, unfortunately. In the Mouth of Madness is kind of a good horror movie with some great moments of thrill (and Juergen Prochnow is great as Sutter Kane), but it wastes it's full potential by showing all those slime creatures. I think that the audiences phantasy had done a much better job. But that's the same with "The Thing".Nevertheless I enjoyed it though. Good idea, good movie, but I had made it differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In John Carpenter's "Prince of Darkness" (1987), Satan is revealed to be alive and well, although entombed in a canister in the basement of an L.A. church. In the director's "They Live" (1988), hideous aliens are shown to be living in our midst, only visible via special lenses. And in Carpenter's 1995 offering, "In the Mouth of Madness," the paranoia quotient is ratcheted up yet again. Here, tentacled monstrosities from another dimension, clearly patterned on the Elder Gods of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, seek to sow insanity amongst humankind as a means of abetting their arrival. Whew! In the film, Sam Neill (truly excellent here) plays John Trent, a hard-bitten freelance insurance investigator who is hired by the Arcane publishing firm to track down a Stephen King-like author named Sutter Cane, whose books have begun to cause his readers to go mad. Trent and Cane's editor, Linda (the lovely Julie Carmen), track the missing author to a town in New Hampshire that was previously thought merely one of the author's fictional constructs, leading to one of the townspeople uttering what is perhaps the film's most famous line: "Reality isn't what it used to be." A seeming mashup of Lovecraft's 1936 novella "At the Mountains of Madness" and Jonathan Carroll's brilliant 1980 fantasy/horror novel "The Land of Laughs" (in which famous children's author Marshall France's fictional works strangely come to life), Carpenter's film is easily one of the more challenging in his oeuvre, and one of his eeriest. It is not a film that allows for easy analysis and explication, and will likely leave many shaking their head in bewilderment. Those with an affinity for Lovecraft's work, and the concept of malignant entities trying to reassert themselves in our world, may have an easier time of it, but even they might require a repeat viewing to help all the pieces fall into place. "Lived any good books lately?" the trailer for the film teasingly inquired; sometimes, it seems, reality is not only stranger than fiction...it is CAUSED by fiction! In all, some very impressive work here by screenwriter Michael De Luca and Mr. Carpenter, in a film loaded with jolts and shivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Sam Neil went off his rocker in EVENT HORIZON, he lost his marbles in John Carpenter's hallucinatory IN THE MOUTH. Meilbplays an insurance investigator on the trail of a missing writer, modeled on Dean Koontz and Stephen King. His journey takes him to a small town where he finds the writer working on his next novel, which will bring an end to the world. Problem is, the town in which the author is working may not be real. And there are demons waiting on the other side of every door. Veyr Lovecraftian. Jurgen Prochnow plays the missing author and Julie Carmen is his editor. Special effects are pretty good for 1994, and Neil does a terrific job playing an agnostic who will soon learn to worship a most unusual sort of deity. Great Halloween flick full of scares and subdued violence, much like the original HALLOWEEN, Carpenter's all-time masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being weird, incoherent, and not particularly scary, In the Mouth of Madness has a strong level of creativity to it which makes it an interesting watch if you approach it with the right mindset. The story feels like a blend of, Adam Simon's 'Brain Dead' and David Cronenberg's 'Naked Lunch'. If you love either of those films than you will worship In the Mouth of Madness. To put it quite literally, this is a crazy movie.Insurance investigator John Trent is given the task of locating famed horror author Sutton Cane who has mysteriously disappeared. Cane is famous because his novels have such a profound effect on his readers that they get mentally unstable and even violent. After flipping through some of his books one night, John finds a clue to the author's possible whereabouts. He follows the lead which takes him down a strange path. Shortly after arriving at this destination, (an unknown town New Hampshire), he slowly begins to realize that he is inside the story of Cane's new novel, entitled 'In the Mouth of Madness'. The question is it real or is it in his mind, or is it something else.There are two ways to approach this story. You can choose to hate it, see it as bad filmaking with incompetent story telling, leaving you frustrated from trying to figure out if what you see is fantasy or reality. The other way would be just to watch it with an open mind, and let the art of movie making guide you through, without questioning the messiness.If you choose the latter way, I think you'll agree with me that the movie is not great, but it intrigues you to the level that you will find strange pleasure in watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. I like Sam Neil playing as the character John Trent. Perfect role for him. And if you liked him in this film you'd enjoy "Event Horizon". Generally, both creepy and truly frightening films. It's the year 2008 now, and I just saw this movie. Realizing the year it was made and watching it now almost fourteen years later, honestly made me realize the quality of the movie. It's a film that contains some good freakishness in it as well as some genuine horror. A generally one of it's kind film you probably won't see anything like it. Just the fact that it's not really comparable to those classic horror films like Halloween or Friday the 13th. Which you can't beat, those are great films of their own. "In the House of Madness" is genuine, probably won't have a sequel, but honestly could because it's possible. and if they came out with one I would definitely watch it.I regret seeing the film when I did and not any sooner. Now that I have watched it and enjoyed it I'll definitely be more likely to watch this again. It's definitely not a boring movie. Then, combined with it's atmosphere and story-line, becomes so much more intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this nasty little number in years. Sam Neil, who would go on to star in an even scarier film EVENT HORIZON, three years later, here plays a buttoned-down, by-the-numbers insurance investigator hot on the trail of a missing author. His search takes him into a town wholly created by the missing author, a place where all sorts of terrible things lie in wait. The author himself is hidden away in the town, but to say more would be to give away too much. While the author is supposedly a Stephen King type, the movie itself and the horrors that await the investigator are right out of H.P. Lovecraft, being far more psychological than visceral. I have said from the day I first saw this film that it is a study in madness more than it is a straight horror film. We start out with Neil in a straitjacket, being locked away in a padded cell. The rest of the movie is told in flashback, as the fastidious insurance man slowly comes apart at the seams. The final shot of this now-completely mad man laughing hysterically is extremely unsettling. So whether the plot is about demons from another world invading ours (which is what author Jurgen Prochnow tells Neil's investigator at one point) or it is about a man descending into madness step by step, the movie is enjoyable interpreted either way, Neil is at the top of his game in this one, and is very believable as a man of the physical world who cannot deal with the thought of Hell coming to Earth. Charlon Heston has a small but significant role as the author's agent. Bernie Casey has a cameo as Neil's boss. See it, by all means. The only reason I don't give it an 8, my top number for any film, is that it is a trifle clunky in its presentation, something that has plagued all Carpenter films of more recent years. See GHOSTS OF MARS to witness an even greater degree of clunkiness. I think it is a sign of the director's advancing age. It has been a long road since HALLOWEEN, after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before the The Signal was turning viewers mad, there was 'In the Mouth of Madness'. . . After the Stephen King-like horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) mysteriously disappears, an insurance adjuster, John Trent (Sam Neill), is hired to find him by Cane's publisher. Trent, however, discovers that Cane's written world has filtered into reality and taken hold of him. Is this fictional world actually becoming real? Or are crazed fans and Sutter himself responsible?John Carpenter is deservedly known as a true master of horror, and one of the best American filmmakers in the business (even with his many slip ups). Although 'In the Mouth of Madness' isn't among the top couple of Carpenter's best or most famous, it still borders on greatness. The story, though not as original these days as it was back then, is fantastic. Then again, my horror-writer side has always had an infatuation with flicks about the profession. 'In the Mouth of Madness,' however, goes beyond the 'writer' film, and focuses more on the seeker of the writer. De Luca's script and Carpenter's direction blend wonderfully to make a film that perfectly blurs the lines of reality and fiction (especially in the dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream sequences), Sam Neill delivers his usual good performance (even though Julie Carmen was pretty bad), and the scares and thrills made for some edge-of-your-seat entertainment. I highly suggest this film for anyone looking for a genuinely scary and intriguing mystery.Final verdict: 8/10.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual Carpenter tale is like an episode of The Twilight Zone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is similar to watching an episode of Rod Serling's "Twilight Zone"--it's that kind of tale.Obviously, the character of Sutter Cane is based on the eminently popular writer of horror stories, Stephen King, who also sets most of his novels in Maine--usually in a quaint New England town. King's name is even mentioned a couple of times by insurance inspector SAM NEILL.Neill and JULIE CARMEN go on a wild goose search for the author who seems to have disappeared just when his latest book is about to hit the best-seller lists. They both begin to believe that the author's horror books are having an effect on their reasoning when they begin to experience unexplainable happenings with horror overtones.SAM NEILL seems to relish his role as the crazed insurance man who begins to wish he never read a Sutter Cane novel--and for good reason, as the viewer will find as soon as they do reach the town where Cane is hiding out.John Carpenter delivers a subtle, chilling horror story that will keep you wondering if you too are losing a sense of what's real and what isn't. Clever plotting and good performances make this one a better than average thriller, even if the ending is somewhat unsatisfying.Nice to see CHARLTON HESTON in a small but pivotal role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Insurance Freelance Invesgator John Treat (Sam Neill) is been sent to a mental institution after murdering someone in the city of New York. John is frighten of something of the unknown, thinking it's going to get him sooner or later. A psychiatrist (David Warner) comes to meet John and asks him how he got here before he was sent to the institution. John's tale is a crazy, unlikely story of the disappearance of popular horror novelist Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow). Which John's is been hired by a publisher Jackson Harglow (Oscar-Winner:Charlton Heston) and a publicist Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) to look for Cane and his latest book "In the Mouth of Madness". Which Cane's latest work is been delayed for months and his fans can't wait for his new book. Which some of his fans are absolutely crazy after reading his book. When John finds parts of hidden maps in the book covers of Cane's novels. John thinks that Cane is hiding somewhere in New England of a forgotten town. John and Linda are going to try to find this mysterious town. While John is a sleep in the car, while Linda is driving in a dark night. They have been brought mysteriously in the town of Hobb's End. Which this town is supposedly to be fictional, nothing more. John and Linda are been seeing strange things in this town that they are unexplainable. Cane is been living in a Gothic church. The two of them are seeing bizarre things that they are not possible. All of the things, they are seeing are based on the previous works of Cane. John and Linda are a strange world that is living somewhere between reality and fiction. Which it seems there's no escape inside of the world of Cane.Directed by John Carpenter (The Fog, Halloween, Memoirs of an Invisible Man) made an suspenseful, Gothic horror film with plenty of atmosphere and dark fantasy. This is Carpenter's third apocalyptic movie, which the first it was "The Thing" and the second was "Prince of Darkness". Neill gives an outstanding performance in this picture, which one of his best performances in his career. Carpenter's does one of his best work as a filmmaker, which he gives plenty of suspense and it is probably the most stylish of his movies. This mysterious horror fantasy got mixed reviews back in 1995 and it didn't find an audience of this movie. Which it could have been Carpenter's comeback film and this film wasn't well marketed as well. It was released in the early winter of 1995.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an technical commentary track by the director and cinematographer Gary B. Kibbe (Escape from L.A., Vampires, Village of the Damned "1995"). DVD also has the original theatrical trailer and cast &amp; crew information. I know Carpenter cut several scenes in the final cut, which i seen photos of scenes are not in the movie from different magazines. Including an different ending wasn't used in the final cut. Which involved the character of Linda and John sitting in a dark movie theater. Probably one of few flaws of Carpenter's movie from being perfect. It's not very scary as it should have been or creepy but Carpenter's makes it up by giving it plenty of atmosphere, stylish sequences and good performances by the cast.The "famous scene" where Cane rips himself as a piece of paper was done by George Lucas' effects company "Industrial, Light &amp; Magic" is one of the highlights. Which it was originally written as a scene, where everything in the fictional was supposed to be sucked back in the latest book of Cane. But that effect was too ambitious and probably didn't have enough money of effects budget. Which the budget of the movie was $10 million (The original budget was $15 million before New Line Cinema changed it). Although that "sucked back in the book sequence" was supposed to be filmed but the special effects company thought it would be great if Cane ripped himself instead. Which that similar sequence was never filmed was done later back in 1995 in a different movie called same year was "Jumanji", where the game sucked back all the wild animals, the hunter and various poison plants back into the board game. "In the Mouth of Madness" asks the audiences more questions than by giving you answers. Which this keeps this movie mysterious. I felt it was an excellent movie, when i was younger. But once you are older, you could see certain flaws. But it doesn't keep from being a boring movie. I think, it's still a very good movie and i know, it has a huge cult following like many Carpenter's movies. Carpenter co-written the music score along with Jim Lang. Some familiar faces appears in Cameos. Don't miss this ambitious movie that mixes Horror, Suspense, Fantasy and Black Comedy as well. Written by Michael De Luca (Freddy's Dead:The Final Nightmare, Judge Dreed). Which De Luca and Carpenter were certainly inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Panavision. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uneven, but intriguing supernatural thriller is one of those rare movies that starts out as a mess and slowly comes together as it moves along. Insurance investigator Sam Neill relays his story to psychiatrist David Warner from a padded cell: hired by a publishing company to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a popular horror writer (Jurgen Prochnow), his investigation leads him to a small New England town which bears an eerie resemblance to the fictional town in which all of Prochnow's stories take place. Soon, people, places and reality itself begin to warp and transform into a nightmare world of horror, and Neill can't tell if it's really happening or all in his head. As with many of John Carpenter's more recent movies, it's extremely well-made, but lacking in the screenplay department. The plot is under-thought, the dialogue under-written, the characters under-developed. Julie Carmen's dreadful performance is also a major flaw. But the positives outweigh the negatives, and the movie has enough suspense and visual flair to keep more patient viewers interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some great moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some great moments, but ultimately it falls apart toward the end. I'm a huge John Carpenter fan and I believe this film is one of his better efforts lately. I don't really care for films that double back on it's screenplay. I do however think that if you like any of Carpenter's other films, you'll probably dig this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of two halves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I call this a film of two halves as I fell asleep halfway through watching it and had to restart the tape when I woke up. Not many films have made me fall asleep and I wouldn't use that as a recommendation.I was quite incensed by the high votes attributed to this one (at date of writing the film has received a reasonably high 6.3) and surmise that this is because of the nature of the film. Horror/Carpenter fans will form a huge percentage of the audience, fans of neither will not see it therefore won't get to vote.I was looking forward to seeing this film, as the tale of a man who loses his sanity and becomes mentally enmeshed in a work of fiction is a strong and original idea. When the film was first released I read a review that claimed the film had "no bearing in reality". Rather a strange thing to say about a film that covers monsters, deities and insanity, but watching this movie you can see what he meant. None of the characters, even Sam Neill's lead, have any sense of depth or purpose. We never get to know or particularly like the characters, so we cannot empathise with any perils they may encounter. Maybe Neill lacks the necessary depth to pull off such a role - when I see him laughing maniacally I remember how much better Antony Perkins did it in Le Proc?s - but even strong actors, such as Charlton Heston (who plays a publishing manager with nothing to do, and not, unfortunately, someone who drops to his knees at the sight of the Statue of Liberty, damning everyone to Hell) fail to make this work.Music is important to set a tone in film. Musical snobbery is not an issue. The Ink Spots set off the Shawshank Redemption's pleasingly pedestrian pace, but here we have a "psychological" horror that is bookended by heavy metal. I have nothing against the genre, but it does not work for film, or at least this type of film. But then so many things do not work.Neill tracks down best-selling author "Sutter Cane", a man whom, we are told, is brilliant with words and description. Maybe they should have let him write the script. For the whole movie is populated by mindless gore, monsters with gnashing teeth, women with heads on backwards, walking spider-like in a bizarre mish-mash of Death Becomes Her and The Exorcist. Most importantly, it just isn't scary. Extreme close-ups and over-emphasised reactions with buckets of silly monsters and blood hurled at the screen. This could have been Carpenter's `Jacob's Ladder'. Instead it insults its audience and doesn't even compare to the worst of the `Halloween' sequels.Thankfully this film was the first part of a horror double-bill that included the satirical zombie shoot-em-up that is `Dawn of the Dead', so my evening wasn't a complete waste of time. Lastly, I've noticed that Sutter Cane's name is a malapropism of `Cutter Sane'. Coincidence?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>read, they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I will say that the events portrayed in John Carpenter's "In the Mouth of Madness" are some of the most outlandish things ever to grace the silver screen. Second, I will say that I'm glad that it's like that: this movie is supposed to be outlandish. I've liked every John Carpenter movie that I've seen, and this is one of them (of course, I can't vouch for the ones that I haven't seen). Portraying a horror novel affecting people in evil ways, they throw in anything that they want.Are there any parts of the movie where they got just too far out to merit any credit? Maybe one such scene is the part where Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow) tears himself open, but what happens to John Trent (Sam Neill) right after that more than makes up for anything unrealistic in the movie. And then, what he discovers about Hobb's End raises the stakes even further.So, while the plot line may border on complete nonsense, they keep it cool by not taking anything too seriously. Worth seeing, if only once. And remember this movie the next time that you decide to read a book; it might just save your life.I bet that back in the days when Charlton Heston was starring in movies like "The Ten Commandments" and "Ben-Hur" - not to mention participating in civil rights marches - he never imagined that he would co-star in a movie like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment from Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite his loyal cult following, John Carpenter's filmmaking resume remains a most uneven one. His career began on a high note with the legendary "Halloween" (still regarded as his best work), and other slightly less-known but still notable thrillers such as "The Thing," "Escape From New York," and "Dark Star." However, in the past decade or so, even his fans have admitted that his recent work has been mediocre, sometimes just plain bad. His latest film, "Ghosts of Mars," has served as another nail in his coffin. For many of his fans, "In the Mouth of Madness" was his only recent film to live up to his past success. As much as I would like to agree with that assessment, my commitment to writing honest reviews compels me to state my opinion that it is not. I truly envy those who enjoyed it--perhaps this is one of these movies that one must be on a certain wavelength in order to like. From my perspective, it was just plain boring. I was looking forwards to this one, regarded in many circles as one of the director's best films. Watching it, I had the sinking suspicion that Carpenter is simply overrated. I hope completing his filmography will give me a more balanced assessment of his work, but even with my incomplete knowledge, it is not difficult to see his creative limitations. I can't help but feel a bit cheated.The plot concerns an insurance investigator trying to locate a missing horror novelist, whose books are so popular they have begun to inspire violent behavior in his fans--a crisis that is reaching epidemic proportions. He happens upon a small town that seems to have been based directly on the author's books. It is not long before the powers of darkness make their presence known--they have been using literature as a means of carrying out their sadistic plan against mankind. While not officially adapted from any particular book, "Mouth" owes more than a bit to Stephen King. Making a central character a writer has been used numerous times by the real-life author (see "Misery" and "The Dark Half"). I recall one reviewer saying that the town bears some resemblance to the setting of "Needful Things." Of course, all this is much more ambitious than the average horror movie, with some potentially interesting ideas, but the filmmakers fail to give the audience any reason why we should care about the protagonist. Sam Neill does his best, but the pace is tedious and the material is treated in a manner that is completely uninspired--it just lacks that "spark of energy." As an editor from the publisher, Julie Carmen is simply dreadful; her wooden performance could serve as a cure for insomnia. Charlton Heston plays the publisher, but he fares no better. As the ill-fated novelist, Jurgen Prochnow does what he can, but is nonetheless overshadowed by the boring movie he's trapped in. Finally, the ending is actually fairly interesting, but by then it's too late. The film is slickly photographed, but there are next to no chills. Perhaps "Halloween" was a bit drawn-out at times, yet it still displayed a life and strong directorial presence lacking in much of Carpenter's work. Even "Prince of Darkness," while uneven, nonetheless had some genuinely creepy moments. "In the Mouth of Madness" is simply a turkey that disappointed me in every respect.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovecraft Fans: Don't watch this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie said that it was inspired by Lovecraft's stories and they use many references but the movie is just making fun of Lovecraftian tales. It's just a big joke with a punchline at the end.A bestselling author Sutter Cane (like Stephen King) whose books make people have strange experiences, is writing a novel called In the Mouth of Madness. The main character unknowingly enters into the author's story and he sees "horryfiyng things".The entire movie just shows supposedly creepy or horrifying scenes in quick succesion (sometimes the same scene would be shown about four times). Also the movie fails horribly in creating atmosphere which is what Lovecraftian tales are about, not just mentioning that the world will end or showing Cthulhu-like monsters (which by the way I think their appearance is the only good point). Overall they take the Lovecraft name and style for granted and is a shame for the Cthulhu mythos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good as a Lovecraft tribute, not so good as anything else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back.So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays "mind twisting" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary "before it was cool" (if you don't consider "The Good Son" and "The Omen"). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15" black and white TV screen. Sorry.All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is no dream! This is really happening!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's horror movies have almost always avoided gore in favor of the implication of it. Films like "Halloween" and "The Fog" obviously have some horrific acts of violence occurring in them, yet Carpenter only hints at it. It is around for just a second so that you know well what happened, but didn't quite get the best look at it. I always thought that it was a great technique as I have always enjoyed the horror films that raise the hair on the back of my neck and not the ones that make me cringe from seeing acts of dismemberment. Even in gory films like "The Thing" Carpenter never sacrifices atmosphere or tension, but develops it into something very palpable that really begins to raise those hairs on the back of your neck."In the Mouth of Madness" is no exception. There is virtually no on-screen gore, just a few hints here and there. Not too many uses of the "jump scare" that has unfortunately become a horror genre staple now. There is, on the other hand, a genuine surreal atmosphere that inexorably becomes more and more nightmare-like. I think what today's audience fails to do is to place themselves in the position of the protagonist. Today people simply like to watch - reality TV, big loud action flicks, and increasingly gory horror films to name a few examples. They want to see someone in danger, they want to see someone get diced and they want to see that hideous demon that does the dicing of a preferably big breasted victim with as little clothes on as possible. Sheer terror simply cannot be manifested with such callous and cheaply sensationalist techniques. A good "jump" or a temporary increase in adrenaline, for sure, but terror? No. With "In the Mouth of Madness" John Carpenter, slowly but surely, takes his audience from a normal everyday start in the life of his protagonist to a reality bending nightmare conclusion of the first order.Obviously produced on a limited budget and with virtually no special effects it is easily seen why such a film would be ignored by the crazed audiences of today. There is a lot to think about after the credits roll and the film easily invites second viewings to see things you've missed. --- 8/10Rated R for violent content/terror. Ages 13+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is the question that pours forth from an ax swinging lunatic that tries to decapitate special investigator JOHN TRENT before he's gunned down by a cop at a restaurant. Locked away in a mental institution for his crazy "story" &amp; the murder of one of Caine's readers, Trent tells his story to a psychiatrist on how he was hired to find the author himself who went missing &amp; who's recent books are driving readers completely insane, Trent along with an avid reader of Canes books, enters a small &amp; uncharted town that is really a nest full of goopy monsters &amp; characters &amp; situations that occur in Caine's books (Not friendly situations or people mind you!) soon Trent must confront what's happening in the town &amp; locate the author who not only holds the detectives fate in his hands, but has the power to erase people from his "story" (rubbing out actual people from existence) &amp; may end the entire world!. I loved IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS it was a well balanced suspense/Horror thriller that supplied good scares, creepy situations, slimy monsters &amp; an interesting display of story. The actors fit well in their roles &amp; Carpenter does well behind the camera, making a well made horror tale that is so much better than his more recent work. Still I couldn't help but feel that the film could have been just a few minutes longer. Recommended to horror fans, this film completed Carpenter's "Apocolypse" trilogy that began with THE THING &amp; then PRINCE OF DARKNESS. *** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Efficient and sceptical freelance insurance investigator John Trent is hired by publisher Jackson Harglow to find where the famous writer Sutter Cane might be.After writing a series of best-sellers in the horror genre, affecting the reason and causing disorientation, memory loss, and paranoia in readers, Sutter has simply vanished near the release of his new novel, "Horror in Hobb's End." There is mass hysteria of his anxious fans waiting for the new release, and John believes that his disappearance is a marketing strategy.John follows his instincts and travels with Cane's editor, Linda Styles, to New Hampshire, seeking for the apparently fictional town of Hobb's End.While driving along in the night, Linda reaches Hobb's End, and John discloses that Sutter Cane has unleashed a powerful evil force in the black church of the mysterious town.His twisted imagination is changing the reality and perception of those who read his novels.Even though the film is visually spectacular, one cannot deny that the execution of the film is decidedly dodgy, and ruins the atmosphere of the whole thing.As usual, there is some stark imagery from Carpenter, particularly the scene with the Agent with the axe approaching Trent, and the boy on the bicycle, bu these are few and far between, and special effects do not make a film any better.Neill is good in his role, but there times when he hams it up too much, and in 1995, it appears he had an air of 'i'm the star of the biggest film ever' about him, which is evident in this.There are many nods to the world of Stephen King, it's almost a homage/micky take of the author and his fans.For Carpenter fans, they will appreciate hi imagery and his trademark feel to it, other will just find this as bizarre as Neill sitting in a cinema at the end, watching the best bits of the film.A strangely watchable mess.</fullReview>

A horror film that is unusual and unpredictable, with the sort of plot that quite clearly could never stem from a moron writer like Stephen King.The film moves at a brisk pace. There are no time-wasting scenes like in so many other horror movies, with their very thin plots. The special effects are okay, the soundtrack is solid, and the dialogue and acting aren't moronic. Pretty much Carpenter's last good movie. What followed was junk like "Escape From L.A." and "Ghosts Of Mars".Certainly one of the best horror film of the 90s.There is a brief appearance by the future Darth Vader, Hayden C.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In the Mouth of Madness" is not a very good movie, it's far from bad, but it lacks a very important thing for being a horror film -- it does not scare the viewer. At least not me. However, Sam Neill does a good job as a man who is trapped in a nightmare -- or is it reality? -- or is he mad? Thinking about the movie, though, I can't think of any particularly scary scenes. And I hate it when they bring in the monsters!! Monsters are not scary -- they're about as scary as that pathetic skeleton in "Hellraiser". Well, I shouldn't just complain because even if it's not a scary film, and even if it does get a bit ridiculous at times, it's still a *very* fascinating story. The ideas in the script are pretty brilliant and I believe that Carpenter manages to realize those ideas. The "scary" scenes though? they are sadly a failure. Well, I quite enjoyed the film and it is (despite its flaws) the best horror film I have seen in a looong time (apart from "The Shining" which I saw recently). (5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Carpenter's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a pretty big fan of John Carpenter's work, but In the Mouth of Madness has to be near the top. The film is a pretty original take on the end of the world. That's something that should be appreciated today since so many films are about the apocalypse and they all seem to tread familiar ground. In the Mouth of Madness goes in a different direction and it's just one of its many charms.The first thing that comes to mind with this film is the score by both Carpenter and Jim Lang. Carpenter's scores are usually pretty memorable anyway and this one is no exception. As soon as you hear it, it immediately reminds you of the early to mid-nineties. Even though the soundtrack is obviously dated, it fits the film incredibly well and it's difficult not to admire how great it really is.Sam Neill is another huge factor to this film being so well done. He's at his best here. Plain and simple. His struggle with his possible insanity regarding everything that's happened to him with the Sutter Cane case is where he truly shines. John Trent scrambles to find a logical explanation with everything he's seeing due to his job, but he eventually runs out of reasoning and panic begins to set in. Watching him lose it is just as entertaining as watching every other event in the film unfold.It's not like In the Mouth of Madness isn't flawed, but everything that happens in the second half of the film makes up for any flaw that takes places in the first half. John and Linda's journey to Hobb's End to the finale is what's held in such high regard. The Lovecraftian influences, the similarities to The Thing, the last showdown with Cane, the importance of repetition, all of it is just spectacular.In the Mouth of Madness is not a perfect film. It's a little slow to get things rolling, Julie Carmen proves that she can't act, and the computer generated special effects in the film are clearly dated. The odd thing though is that nearly everything in the latter half of the film makes up for that. The H.P. Lovecraft influence, Sam Neill's top notch performance, and the originality displayed in the film seems to breath life into an idea that's been done to death. In the Mouth of Madness is arguably one of the best film's of John Carpenter's career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly muddled H.P. Lovecraft inspired end of the world horror thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Mouth of Madness starts in New York where freelance insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is hired by an insurance firm to check the claim of Arcane Publishing who say that their best-selling horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) has disappeared &amp; is believed to be dead. The insurance firm feel it may all be a publicity scam &amp; send Trent in to uncover the truth either way, after reading Cane's first five novels Trent becomes convinced that it's a con &amp; after some inspired detective work feels he has the answer. The illustrations on the covers of Cane's books when pieced together form a map leading to the town of Hobb's End which is where all of Cane's novels are set. Trent is certain that is where Cane is &amp; drives out there to prove it, however the fiction of cane's books &amp; reality blur into one another as the terrifying things in the novels begin to happen for real including the end of the world &amp; reality as we know it...Directed by John Carpenter who apparently calls this his third film in his self titled Apocalypse Trilogy after The Thing (1982) &amp; Prince of Darkness (1987) &amp; while I liked a lot of it an equal amount left me rather frustrated &amp; unsatisfied, the potential for something special was here for sure but it doesn't quite work for several reasons. The script by Michael De Luca (who at the time was President of Production at New Line the company that produced In the Mouth of Madness) is very H.P. Lovecraft in it's style, ideas about evil forces from beyond reality, the end of the world apocalypse as it's engulfed by slimy monsters from beyond, all the Lovecraft references &amp; the fact the majority of the story is narrated by a patient in a mental institute also comes straight from a Lovecraft novel. The first thirty odd minutes is rather good as the mystery surrounding Sutter Cane is explored &amp; once the action shifts to Hobb's End itself the films gets weirder &amp; weirder as fantasy &amp; reality mix &amp; lots of slimy monsters pop up all over the place. The twist that a very rational cynical man such as Trent is merely a work of fiction made up by Cane to bring about the end of the world is reasonable if a little uninspired while the final twist in which Trent goes into a cinema to watch the film we have just seen made no sense to me at all &amp; ended things on a bit of a downer. The character's are alright although Linda Styles is a bit useless. The plot is interesting for sure, it's something different &amp; tries to be mysterious, scary, gross &amp; surprising &amp; it almost succeeds but several loose ends &amp; a plot that fizzles out as the film progresses stop it from being classic Carpenter in my humble opinion.Quite a lot of fantasy horror from the 80's &amp; 90's did the whole blurring of reality &amp; fiction &amp; specifically focused on books the most popular of which were probably the rather excellent I, Madman (1989) &amp; the not so excellent The Dark Half (1993) both of which featured killers from the pages of novels coming to life. There's some really stylish Lovecraftian imagery here with a wall of slimy tentacled creatures chasing Sam Neill being one in particular that stands out. The film has a few creepy moments, there's some impressive monster &amp; creature effects on show although there's not really any gore. There's a good atmosphere &amp; there are definitely a couple of unsettling scenes here but they are few &amp; far between unfortunately. The town of Hobb's End is obviously a reference to Quatermass and the Pit (1967) in which the alien spaceship is found in a subway station named Hobb's End too.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 this was another box-office failure for Carpenter who just couldn't repeat his earlier critical or financial success he had with films such as Halloween (1978) &amp; Escape from New York (1981). Although set entirely in the US this was actually filmed in Ontario in Canada. The acting varies, Sam Neill is alright but Julie Carmen as Styles is absolutely awful while veteran old timer actors David Warner &amp; Charlton Heston have nice cameos.In the Mouth of Madness is a H.P. Lovecraft inspired end of the world John carpenter directed horror film that tries to mix reality &amp; fantasy to mixed effect really, I thought it was above average for sure but overall the film didn't convince me &amp; it felt a little muddled at times especially that ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films like In The Mouth Of Madness are admittedly not my cup of tea. Still when a writer of horror lives in a place like Hobb's Lane in New Hampshire, that's an open invitation to stay away.Noted Stephen King like horror story writer Jurgen Prochnow has disappeared and he's a guy who's even more secretive than J.D. Salinger in his quest for privacy. But he's missed a deadline and he's got a load of fans out there who are actually rioting because they are salivating over a new novel.Concerned about his contract, the advance they've given, the general investment they have in Prochnow, Charlton Heston, Prochnow's publisher has hired insurance investigator Sam Neill to locate this guy who they can't find. They used to communicate with him through his agent, but almost at the film's beginning the agent goes berserk and starts taking an ax to people and is shot down.Protecting his investment further, Heston sends Julie Carmen his girl Friday along with Neill where they discover Hobb's Lane, New Hampshire. Remember this is New England, host of the Salem Witch Trials back in the day, and they know Satan and his works when they see it. These people keep clear of a place like Hobb's Lane, but Neill and Carmen go blundering in and meet up with Prochnow and it's an experience to put it mildly.The ending is one pessimistic one for the human race, but I've got a theological question worth pondering. If reading works like this from the mind of Satan himself affect people so powerfully as described here, why doesn't reading the Bible, or C.S. Lewis, or Lloyd C. Douglas, or G.K. Chesterton have a similar affect?I'm not a big fan of this genre in general, but those devoted to these films should have enough fright and violence to satisfy.</fullReview>

Caine's publisher Linda (Julie Carmen) goes with him. Trent slowly finds out that there is a lot more to Caine--and his writing--then people know about and events slowly get darker.This was a big bomb in 1995 and it's easy to see why. It's not your typical horror movie--it forces you to think things out for yourself. I didn't like it myself back then but I find it very interesting now. Basically this is director Carpenter taking elements from old H.P. Lovecraft stories and putting them in a modern day setting. That's a risky move because Lovecraft is very difficult to do in a movie. His descriptions of events and things are virtually impossible to visualize. Still Carpenter gives it a try.He doesn't entirely succeed but he doesn't bomb out either. The story itself is fairly easy to follow at first--then it gets stranger and darker as it goes along. There's talk of the Old Ones and (in one genuinely terrifying scene) Trent is chased down a long tunnel by the monsters. Wisely Carpenter doesn't give us a totally clear view of the monsters--just glimpses that really work. It all leads to an ending which is wide open to interpretation. That may annoy some people but I loved it. Also it IS a scary film.Acting is mostly good. Neill chews the scenery in his role but in an amusing way. Camen was just so-so in her role. Prochnow is obviously having a LOT of fun with his role. Also we see Charlton Heston and John Glover doing good jobs in their short parts. There's also a great music score by Carpenter. This is a complex and frightening horror movie that's just been dismissed as another Carpenter bomb. Worth seeing. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an incredibly strange movie. Seldom would I ever even consider writing a comment/review for a movie, but I feel moved by the Holy Spirit to spread the word of this piece of cinematic art. I can say in confidence that never have I seen a movie with such bizarre events taking place. Sure, they have some value for being something that you don't see in every movie, but, unfortunately, the movie, at the same time, takes itself way too seriously and not seriously at all. Plenty of times during the movie did I catch myself feeling embarrassed for watching this... film. I guess it's worth watching simply because it goes places other movies wouldn't dare to go, but, this isn't necessarily a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter at is Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start off by saying this movie is awful. I found myself laughing at scenes such as the girl eating her own finger, and the random "monsters" walking around in several scenes. I was incredibly disappointed in this film, simply because it had such a good plot, but it failed miserably. The movie was weird, dumb, and very boring at times, and outside of the guy who played Kent, the acting was bad. One of my favorite scenes is when they are in the car on the way to the town. I found myself in disbelief because Kent would barely look at the road while driving. It is little things like that which make the movie so lame. Please, do not waste your time watching this movie. If you want entertainment, watch the halloween series...better yet, staring at a wall for several hours would do as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneven script drags this one down. Far from Carpenter's best work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter directed a string of imaginative and highly entertaining movies in the Seventies and Eighties, from 'Dark Star' to his masterpiece 'The Thing'. All great favourites of mine. After that his output became less impressive, particularly since 'They Live', the last one of his movies I really enjoyed. Many Carpenter fans regard 'In The Mouth Of Madness' to be a real return to form, but I really can't share their enthusiasm. I watched it again this week for the first time in about seven or eight years to see if I had underrated it, but no, it just really doesn't work for me. I think the major problem is the uneven script by Michael De Luca, which fails to capitalize on a interesting premise. By the last third of the movie the story has degenerated into one "twist" or "shock" too many, and I started to get bored. Also, and this is a very personal thing, the movie just wasn't scary. The outbreak of mass hysteria depicted in the early scenes had a lot of potential. If Carpenter and De Luca had explored the apocalyptic theme more and the Lovecraftian idea of a book which drives the reader mad they might have ended up with a pretty good movie. But for me, the Hobb's End scenes just didn't cut it. (and what was up with the old geezer on the bike? That's supposed to be scary?!) Anyway, Sam Neill gives a decent performance, Julie Carmen makes a so-so leading lady, and Jurgen Prochnow hams it up as the Stephen King/H.P. Lovecraft character Sutter Kane. The real disappointment was seeing talented actors like David Warner, Charlton Heston and John Glover wasted in underwritten roles. Despite its many flaws 'In The Mouth Of Madness' is still better than Carpenter's last few movies like 'Vampires' and 'Ghosts Of Mars', but we shouldn't measure it against these weaker efforts, we should compare it to his best movies like 'Assault On Precinct 13', 'Halloween' and 'The Thing'. And compared to those it's a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best cheese-horror movie ever made, but still that: cheesy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two types of horror fans: those that want truly original, scary, and well-done genre pieces, and those who hail the old cheese-horror movies?like A Nightmare on Elm Street?as "classics" and anything new as "trash". In the Mouth of Madness tries to have it both ways. It uses some interesting, fresh ideas while also using tired genre clichés without any constraint whatsoever.The good: In the Mouth of Madness does have an intelligent point to make about how obsessive some people are with horror fiction (movie, book, video game, it doesn't matter) that very few horror movies would ever dare go. Some of the surrealist moments are the best I've personally ever seen, and I've seen a lot. The overall plot, while not really original, is not something that is overused in the genre by any means, and is very entertaining.The bad: Cheese?the majority of this movie plays out like a bad 40s B-movie, which is sort of is. The creature effects suck, even for their time, and a lot of the acting is insanely over-the-top and just downright funny. Some of the scenes even have laugh-out-loud horror montages that you've seen in so many b-movies it's just ridicules. I couldn't even talk half of this movie seriously. The very last scene of the movie almost even seems like a punch-line.Clichés?at one point in the movie a character says: "All horror movies have the same plug. Bumps in the night, axes, people turning into monsters . . ." and that is pretty much how the entire movie plays out. And while the movie continuously mentions Stephen King's name in passing reference, the screenwriter just doesn't seem to get it: this movie is nearly a rip-off of Stephen King's The Dark Tower books, as well as some of his short stories. It even has some near ripped-off elements of a few Dean Koontz's short stories, as well. But this movie simply isn't even half as well-done or original as wither writer's work.The ugly: I really wanted to like this movie, but the lack of originality and prevalence of cheese kept me from it. Even though this movie is worth watching, it's not worth paying money for. Just watch it on Cartoon Network whenever they play their Halloween lineup.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre, and it pains me to say it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a very promising outline. And near the ending, it was very promising as well. But the ending itself sucked. Even if it was a tad clever, it was a very unsatisfying finish to everything you had been put through for the entire movie. And the full HOUR between the start and the finish is just awful. It was boring and rather lacking of substance.I don't know how to explain it. The outline for the plot is just fantastic, it is intelligent and the beginning definitely has potential. But what they DO with it just becomes so tacky! It feels like they really don't use the plot for what it can be. And so it just turns into a C-action horror movie. Not even a B.Im sorry John Carpenter. I didn't think I would say it, but this movie could definitely use a remake by someone who knows how to make it interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Adventure Of The Disappearing Author.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My usually reliable TV Guide gave this three stars out of four and described it as the story of a horror writer (think Stephen King) who has gone missing. There's also a rumor floating around that those who read his works go mad. The publisher, a splendidly aged Charlton Heston, is distressed over the loss of his cash cow and coaxes the prosaic Sam Neill to search for him. Neill skims through some of the author's books and dismisses them as routine plots, though better written than he'd expected.Well -- okay. It might be interesting.My heart sank when I saw the prominence in the credits given to "Special Visual Effects." When I saw it was directed by John Carpenter the depths became positively benthic, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway and hope for the best.The opening was tranquil and sane enough. Sam Neill isn't an actor given to menace or outrage. But five minutes into the film, a bald and drooling madman smashes through a restaurant window and attacks Neill with an ax. It gets worse when Neill begins to hallucinate, having read the books.It isn't boring. That would just signal a failure in the conception and execution of the project. The problem is that it apparently succeeds in what it sets out to do, but what it sets out to do is revolting.After the third or fourth ugly, bloodied face of a fascist police officer, I gave up and tuned out.You have to be of an age to appreciate this crap. You have to be delicate and innocent. I became far too debauched, far too many years ago.Good luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am a Horror Whore, this was zzzzzzzzzzzzz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I have followed and loved John Carpenter's work for years, his work as a director and composer are legendary. So I encourage you to ignore this. The film was an interesting idea, sort of, but failed in totality. There were no shocking moments, no scary scenes, a boring cast, the mystery aspect was about 30 sec long. It had hot themes that "Blair Witch," author Dan Brown made fame with, and what "Borat" did for comedy, but none of the impact. Teen slasher movies are superior to this. I cannot encourage you more strongly to avoid this and NEVER think of this as John Carpenter's work, the Rob Zombie song that mentions the same title is better than this whole production. I watched "The Thing" the night before to prep myself, all I can say is where was that director?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiction...or reality? Ah, who cares! It's all nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supposedly Carpenter's return to the more eerie, atmospheric ? and most importantly ? story driven horror! Maybe so, but I don't really share the enthusiasm. Personally, I think this film is a little TOO story-driven and it ends up being an over-ambitious and confusing mess. The typically Lovecraftian themes and atmosphere don't always work and the film can actually only depend on a few powerful sequences and a fascinating performance by Sam Neill. He's a sceptical fraud investigator who's been hired to track down the missing horror author, Sutter Cane. The popularity of this writer is endless and the delay of his new book causes mass hysteria. Along with an editor, John Trent chases the writer (a spooky Jurchen Prochnow) to a quite and forgotten little town where reality and fiction completely become merged. Does the town even exist? Are the people real?? The film bears down upon an apocalyptic ending, complete with abandon streets, slaughtering and individual madness. As said before, there definitely are a few sequences that are full of potential! Like the entire opening with Neill in the asylum! That one ? and a few others ? are the real proof that Carpenter still is a solid horror director, only a little too sure of himself. The script is too weak for an idea like this. Written down by a completely untalented Michael De Luca (Freddy's Dead, Judge Dredd) who clearly cannot handle supernatural matters such as the parallel universe! In the Mouth of Madness received tons of great reviews and a lot of praising. Often even called Carpenter most compelling film. To me it's just a bearable waste of time with good creature effects and semi-inventive twists. John Carpenter's best work is still found in the low-budget quickies he started out with: Halloween, Assault on Precinct 13 and The Fog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, not the Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie is piece of crap. To start of with, its full of goofs right from the beginning.I can close my eyes to "They gave him pencil, without precautions of him suicide", but "Lighting Flash comes up in the closed room" is just intolerable, especially for such director as John Carpenter. Okay, what did i expected from that movie? I thought that was from the period when John grew up, and made horror about insanity and hallucinations.He didn't grew up.In fact, he became stupider.Movie starts of protagonist in asylum, telling how he ended up here. Sheesh, just like in 50s, really? And here he using cheap tricks to "convince" us how "Insane" he is.Look! I am insane, that must mean something, are you intrigued yet?But then what, after flashback to the past again cheap tricks to prove how cool he is as a detective.(YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!)Then we meet that editor woman.Styles or something.Again shitty stereotype of stony bitch, that become flat in danger.Blah blah blah.Then something happens, it ends.Look, i made the movie. I didn't actually watched it to the end, but i guess i know what would be.Three.</fullReview>

This film was rubbish! easily one of the worst films i have ever seen and I have seen some crackers!!! There was nothing good about the film. The acting was bad. the story was bad. the effects were terrible and the whole film wasn't scary in the slightest. i was laughing in all the "scary" scenes and i'm sorry but puppets and rubbery monster suits don't particularly strike fear into me. I actually have nothing more to say about this horrible film but unfortunately "IMDB" instructs me to write at least ten lines about the film. Bugger!A lame film. Avoid.</fullReview>

It moved much to slowly, the ending was predictable, and it contained scenes that did nothing to add to the sad excuse for a plot. "In the Mouth of Madness" could have been editted down to about five minutes: H.P. Lovecraft wanna-be writes hack novel, drives world insane with bad writing and big movie deal. However, I do have to say that it worked, I was driven insane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that one and one-half hours of my life was wasted watching this horrible, low-budget piece of junk. The actors (as good as some of them have proved to be in other movies they have done) were terrible. The director failed miserably to elicit anything approaching a decent, believable performance. Of course, that shouldn't have been surprising given the complete lack of worthwhile material. I find it hard to believe that even hard-core fans of the Horror genre would have the patience or stomach to sit through this vile crock of manure, let alone find anything at all worth praising.I could write volumes of explicit, detailed explanations for my above assertions, but why waste such an extraordinary amount of time in a valueless endeavor that could be better spent doing something more important, say like trying to perfect the perfect belch, or performing a genetic experiment such as cross-breeding a dung beetle, with a housefly, a mosquito, a moron, and a spineless wimp, with a politician who used his family clout to avoid military service in Viet Nam. (Oh wait, that's already been done: see George W. Bush.)Take my advice: do ANYTHING other than subject yourself to his horrendous joke on the movie-going public, like poking out your eyes with a dull stick, getting someone to pull out your fingernails very slowly, drinking battery acid or bleach, etc. Any of these actions would be far less painful than sitting through "In the Mouth of Madness." (If you're not mad before you see it, you will be far before the movie's end.)</fullReview>
