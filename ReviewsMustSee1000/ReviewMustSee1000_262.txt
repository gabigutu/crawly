		<shortDescription>Really good and full of powerful performances - underrated if a bit flawed overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made a fuss when it came out because there were claims that its author had lied about it being "based on a true story." As a result it become a sort of infamous title and people cared less about the film's content and more about its "accuracies."Well, frankly I don't really care about whether or not the story is true because I know things similar to this _do_ happen - children are abused and using this as a backbone for a revenge film may seem a bit inappropriate but it is handled with care by director Barry Levinson and the highly talented ensemble cast treat it with caution.Robert De Niro gives a convincing performance as the Catholic priest who is a father-figure to a bunch of disillusioned Brooklyn youth. After they accidentally injure a man during a rebellious incident they are sent away to a juvenile facility where they are sexually and physically abused by the evil warden (Kevin Bacon). Years later two of the boys (now grown men) take revenge on Bacon and kill him in a public area. They are sent to trial but not all is what it seems - representing the case is someone involved with the past and there are some other interesting twists along the way.The abuse isn't really the subject of this movie - instead the "what if a trial could be rigged?" question is more prescient. (Think "Runaway Jury" meets "Deliverance.") The cast is fantastic - De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver, Bacon, et al. It's a movie buff's dream come true! If only Al Pacino had popped up....De Niro has been given a bad reputation lately as a "sell-out" - but he provides a really deep and multi-layered performance here. It's too bad people forget about this movie along with some others he made around the turn of the decade because a lot of them were very good. This is one of them.Levinson ("Rain Man," "Diner") is sometimes a bit too heavy on schmaltz in his films and that's the reason many people (myself NOT included) disliked "Rain Man." However here - for the most part - he abandons this and presents the material with a good touch. It's atmospheric and dark - it feels a bit like De Niro's "A Bronx Tale" and "Diner" colliding together.Overall this is a really good film that is not without its flaws but is still engaging and surprising and underrated - a must-see for any self-respecting film buff.4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. Great acting, great direction, great plot!As another reviewer pointed out, the movie indeed has 3 parts. before,at and after the correction center. All three parts are equaly gripping. Except that the part in the correction center is very dark and disturbing.Brad Pitt shines in a small role he has. So does Jason Patrick. Hoffman has his ususal confused charisma. Rest of the supporting cast is excellent too. Especially the denizens of hell's kitchen. Kevin Bacon looks realy menacing. But the person who realy shows his caliber again is de niro. He has one of these rare "non-swearing" roles of his. There is a scene where Jason Patric tells the story of the abuses they faced, and the camera focusses on Robert De Niro's face. Only thing changes is his eyes, from sharp and focussed at the first, you see them widening and then you see some trace of tears. Great! This scence reminds me of Omar Shariff standing on a balcony while soldiers start mayhem on the streets, in Dr. Zhivago.A good care has been taken in getting child stars and adult stars look pretty similar.Only thing li'll bit out of the place is constant referance to Count of montecristo. The revenge in the book is "sweet lasting revenge" where in this movie its straight shot. But heck! this is real life!the last night the friends spend together is also really touching.my rating 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies made in a long time. Previous comments seem to focus more on whether or not the story is true and seem to forget the phenomenal story. Who cares if the story is true or not? If it is, it only makes the movie that much more disturbing and heart-breaking. What is the big deal if it is or isn't true? It is still an amazing movie with a great story. Most so-called "classics" are not based on true stories, so what makes this movie any different? OK, now that I have said my peace about my feelings about the authenticity of the story, I can now comment on the actual movie. I can not say enough positive things about the movie. The actors are perfectly casted. I think every single one of them do an outstanding job in their portrayal. The story is heart-wrenching and it does an excellent job of getting its point across without showing or saying too much. This movie deserves more than it got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sleeper of 1996</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleeper(1996) is a deeply emotional and brilliant film that was overlooked in 1996. It deals with the past and how events from the past can be instrumential in shaping the present. The movie was very controversial due to the subject matter. I believe that one reason that Sleepers(1996) didn't get the praise it deserved is the film deals with things that were already present in Mean Streets(1973) and Once Upon a Time in America(1984). The first half of the feature reminds me a lot of the flash back sequences from Once Upon a Time in America(1984). Brad Pitt gives what I see as the best performance of his life. What I also like about Sleepers(1996) is that it puts together two of the best actors of their genreation in Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last third makes it worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the controversial book, the movie SLEEPERS is divided into three parts; before reform school, during, and after. But whereas the parts in the book all worked together into a satisfying(albeit disturbing) whole, the movie only really catches fire in the last third, which is enough to recommend it. Before I get to why, regarding on whether it really happened; that's irrelevant. It could have happened.Part one of the book, like the movie, establishes our protagonists and their personalities, as well as draw out the supporting characters. We get to know and like them, and therefore the climax to the first part is quite disturbing. The movie, alas, relies too much on voice-over narration. A former friend once called movies like these "narration from hell" movies, and this one certainly qualifies. It tells us, rather than shows us, about the main characters. The four young actors are certainly appealing enough, but they're left with nothing to work with. Perhaps because it's so poorly written, Jason Patric, the one who narrates it, seems to do his job badly a la Harrison Ford in BLADE RUNNER. Or maybe he's just not good at it(he is a good actor). Only the supporting characters, like De Niro as the priest and the great Italian actor Vittorio Gassman as King Benny, come through.Part II takes place at the reform school/prison, and it's the weakest part of the book, simply because it's all been done before, although this one is more sadistic than usual. What helps the movie, besides keeping DeNiro around, is the performances. Kevin Bacon is chilling as the head guard, and Terry Kinney, who usually plays weak-willed men, is surprisingly effective here as well.Part III is the most controversial part of the book and movie, since it alleges a prosecutor threw a case, and a priest lied to help two murderers get off. Also, like A TIME TO KILL, it raises the question of whether revenge killing is justified. Unlike A TIME TO KILL, however, this movie and book don't take the easy way out, but look at both sides. You may not agree with what the priest character does, but you can't say it was easy for him, and like the book, the movie implies a little shame for having to ask him in the first place. And DeNiro's performance here is excellent; the look on his face when he hears for the first time what the boys went through in prison says a lot. The third part is where the movie finally comes alive, even though that annoying narration is still there, because the actors have something to work with, and they work with it. In addition to DeNiro and Gassman, I'm thinking in particular of Minnie Driver, Brad Pitt, and Dustin Hoffman. Driver and Pitt have to suggest earlier involvement, and they do in their powerful scene together in the subway when she reveals she now knows what went on at the prison(her reaction when she finds out is also powerful). As for Hoffman, one reason I am tired of courtroom movies and shows is the assertion that yelling is the only way lawyers examine people, and Hoffman resists the urge to overact. Watch him particularly when he destroys Kinney's character on the stand, with a low but probing voice that nicely plays against his questioning, rather than blow it up. And so, when the four main characters(along with Driver) come together for the last time, you really feel the moment, more than you'd suspect from the start. It's not a perfect movie, but stick with it and it is worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell's Kitchen's legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic. The story is complex and very sophisticated. The cast is sheer brilliant and hardly to surpass. Here we get first-class entertainment in combination with suspense and a variety of themes that are fairly well known to anyone, just as revenge, justice, murder, abuse, atonement etc. The kids do a fine job, really. They add tremendous depth to the deeds and to the behave of the grown ups. Their genuine and sure-handed performances grant the movie a considerable amount of emotional recognition and chain anyone who soaks up and identifies with the storyline and the characters. The very end closes the circle and makes us aware of how quickly our lives can fall apart. Thrilling and suspense is guaranteed. Very recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies (and book) ever being told!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie for its honesty, and sadness... But most of all i feel for these 4 boys, and all the other young boys around in this world being abused. Carcaterra you have my respect! I think the cast in this movies is awesome and they all do an incredible job playing the main characters... The boys in particular... I am sure those scenes where they were abused was hard to do...This is a must see film for all people, and a must read book as well. It is brilliant, and really honest. A true story about 4 boys worst nightmares at a boys home, and how they got their revenge...It is so brilliant that i am amused it is a true story, and not a Hollywood written screenplay.... Amused in a positive way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sleepers," is a captivating, taut, ride. It's well-crafted visually and storywise, keeping my attention from the first plot point to the last, which is hard to do, as I see dozens of movies each week. I can't believe I missed this back in '96. It must have been the pedestrian title, but at any rate, the performances were top-notch and the story, both intriguing and heart-wrenching. One seemingly harmless lifting of a hot dog, places four lives in a juvenile system that rips their promise apart. Wow. Who cares if the story is true, the movie is entertaining and a fun ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first hour of Sleepers is highly impressive, with the account of the protagonists' fall into the hands of their oppressors and the subsequent atrocities dealt with very well. The images of what happens to the boys are sensational but realistic, avoiding, except at one key point, the kind of triumphal uprising-against-the-system plot line that normally takes over. Here there are no heroes and no courage - just blunt brutality.Unfortunately, the second half of the film, in which convoluted courtroom-revenge theatrics take over, is unable to deliver such a punch. The only interesting character from the prison meets his end far too early, and we are left, apparently, to cheer on the demise of characters whom we have only seen in half-glimpsed slow-motion fragments. We know nothing of them, and don't care about their plight, other than in a general 'they're bad so they must die' Hollywood kind of way.We are also asked to support a priest who lies under oath to protect two boys who, by their own admission, have murdered a man in the middle of a bar. That several witnesses saw the murders happen in front of them is ignored by the end of the film - all logic having been cast to the four winds to support a system of values which, while intuitively just, is, on reflection, highly tenuous.An interesting film, then, but one which needed less Hollywoodisation and a little more thoughtfulness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sleepers' is a good film, existing out of two parts. The first part is a drama that involves four young teenagers in the sixties, Hell's Kitchen, New York. They make a stupid mistake that sends them to a reformatory, the Wilkinson home for boys. Here they are sexually abused by the guards including Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). The second parts is about the revenge the four boys have when they are grown up. If you do not want to know what they're plan is, read no further.Two of the boys, John (Ron Eldard) and Tommy (Billy Crudup), have become killers and one day, 1981, they see Nokes in a restaurant. They walk up to him, shoot him, and leave. The District Attorney who handles their case is Michael (Brad Pitt), one of the four. He has asked for the case, not to win, but to lose. It is time for revenge. Together with Shakes (Jason Patric), the narrator of the story, they come up with a plan to expose events at Wilkinson. Key figures here are John and Tommy's lawyer Snyder (Dustin Hoffman), the girl they all like Carol (Minnie Driver), the Mafia boss from the neighborhood King Benny (Vittorio Gassman), and a priest who has been friends with the four forever, Father Bobby (Robert De Niro). Especially he has a very important role.The first part is very good with four kid actors who are not annoying and a Bacon who is close to pure evil. The way they set up the story is very good as well. We learn to know the kids, King Benny, Father Bobby, the neighborhood. We feel we understand how things work in Hell's Kitchen which is pretty important to make events plausible when the kids have grown up. The second part is not as good but as least as interesting. There are more question we could ask here, but fine actors like De Niro, Hoffman, Pitt and Patric know how to create believable characters. Although what they do might not be the right thing, we somehow hope they pull it off.Director Barry Levinson has made a good film, with 147 minutes a little too long maybe. He finds the right way to tell this sad story, with a perfect set-up and with interesting courtroom scenes in the second part. That is sort of an achievement since we know the whole thing is scripted there. The star power probably does the rest. Hoffman and De Niro are great as always, Bacon is perfectly creepy, Pitt, Patric and Driver are effective. John Williams' score is great. We feel it, but it never distracts from the story. 'Sleepers' is most definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this film so many times and it never fails to break my heart. I wasn't expecting it to be so deep and emotional but the story is told in such a way that you can really feel the fear and other feelings that the characters are experiencing.Of course I think the cast was fantastically chosen, I especially give praise to Kevin Bacon, Jason Patric, Joe Perrino and Dustin Hoffman for their great acting. I believe no other actors could have made the film as heart stopping as they did.I've asked my friends about this film and was surprised to hear that not many have seen it. Is this because more action-packed or fast-paced/ comedy movies are more popular? Who knows.All I can say is, this film is quite special because without having action-packed scenes and surprises round every corner, it still keeps me glued to the seat.The last thing I just HAVE to mention is that this movie introduced me to Ron Eldard who is a sensational actor.All in all.... truly heartbreaking film, might almost even make you cry. Nothing shows friendship lasts forever, more than the events the characters have to endure in this film.I definitely recommend for older kids. If you're always watching the same kind of films, this one is sure to open your eyes to a whole new side of film making.Woooo Woooooo!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepers (1996) Starring Kevin Bacon, Jason Patric, Robert DeNiro, Brad Pitt, Brad Renfro, Billy Crudup, Dustin Hoffman. ****/****.Sleepers describes Lorenzo "Shakes" Carcaterra's life as an early boy and a young man.John, Michael, Shakes, and Tommy grew up in Hell's Kitchen. Hell's Kitchen was a breeding ground for criminals. So one day, the boys decide to rob a hot dog vendor. When the prank goes horribly wrong, the boys are sent to a boy's home for punishment for 6 months to a year. While there, they are brutalized and raped by guards, the leader being Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). Comforted by Father Robert Carillo (Robert DeNiro), Shakes and his friends grow up, trying to eliminate the horrific memories.Now grown up, John and Tommy find Sean in a diner one night. The night ends with bullet holes. Michael (Brad Pitt), now an Assistant DA, calls Shakes. He plans to "throw" the trial. He calls on Danny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman), a drunken lawyer, to be the defense. Michael is the prosecutor.While talking to Shakes, Michael talks about his favorite book, "The Count of Monte Cristo." He says he reads a bit of it every night, hearing words like "revenge." That's exactly what Michael wants.Sleepers is sure not to disappoint fans of the genre.4 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that i liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A superior hollywood film. But...No one mentioned this so far (at least in the latest 20 comments), when it came to the courtroom scenes and Brat Pitt´s character followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, i felt cheated. This movie insulted my intelligence. Warning spoilers!!Why did anyone accept their false alibi, witnessed by the priest? If these two guys had been with him, why shouldn´t they tell this during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were the judge or member of the jury, would you believe it? Is it wise to give the motif of the murderers away?I am sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this angers me. This movie had great potential. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made sentimental drivel that's rotten at its core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers poses a hell of a problem. It is extremely well made, calls on the services of great actors such as Brad Pitt, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Vittorio Gassman, Jason Patric, plus many more who are not as well-known, beautifully shot and extremely evocative. Yet at its heart it is rotten, quite rotten. It is that nastiest of all nasties, evil masquerading as good. Forget the sentimental drivel about how four friends hold together through thick and thin, about loyalty, about the how love and friendship are the highest value: this film seriously suggests that there are some circumstances under which is it fine to murder in cold blood, fine to perjure yourself and fine to lie, cheat, blackmail, bribe, threaten and intimidate. Those of you who have already seen this film, think back. Ignore, for a moment, the sentimental floss and ask yourself what was portrayed here: two out and out ruthless killers get away with murder with the connivance of what is to all intents and purposes a bent DA and it is all shown to be OK. Really? The film suggests it is OK because the main victim as well as another were homosexual paedophiles. Really? So there is a pecking order in nasty, vicious crimes? The main and most controversial pivot of the plot is that a Roman Catholic priest is prepared to swear to tell the truth on the Bible and then tell an enormous lie for the sake of the two killers. There have been many RC priests, I'm sure, who have done just that and given the sexual abuse scandals of these past twenty years, and the despicable cover-up by the church authorities, there are many homosexual paedophiles who happen to be RC priests. But in the real world no one is pretending that they are anything but despicable themselves. That is the evil core of this film. Of course, at the end of the day Sleepers is nothing but another Saturday night movie, a throwaway piece to pass a few hours. Yet there will undoubtedly be many young people who watch this who will come away with the impression that, yes, under some circumstances it it OK to murder in cold blood (or, more pertinently, OK to torture in cold blood as happened at Guantanamo and elsewhere at the behest of the CIA). Do we really want that? Do we really want to have our young thinking that evil is good under some circumstances? Apart from the ethical angle to criticisms of this film, there are several plot holes which make it rather less good a film than it might at first appear. Surely the police would have ascertained the two accused possible alibi before the case was brought to court? Surely there would have been many questions as to why the priest comes forward with such a crucial alibi so late in the day? Surely the DA previous friendship and past with the two accused would have come to light quite quickly and would most certainly have come to light after the case ends? The story behind Sleepers raises some interesting questions but as all too often Hollywood goes for the schmoozefest as typified by the final reunion and celebration scene rather than get its hands dirty and make an intelligent, challenging film. This version, the sentimental drivel version, undoubtedly made more money than a hypothetical intelligent versions would have done. But I know which I would have preferred. Don't waste a minute watching Sleepers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw SLEEPERS a couple of years ago and didn`t believe for a moment there was any truth in this " True story " and recently watching it again I cannot believe anyone could have been taken in by its fraudulent claims . How can anyone fail to notice massive gaps in logic and factual errors!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!Let`s see now , two men who were sexually abused by a guard at a reform school along with two of their friends , and who are now working for the mafia , somehow manage to bump into him at a bar . They then execute the guard in public and are arrested for the murder , but the screenplay told us these weren`t the first killings the men have committed , one murder was carried out at a cinema . Wouldn`t the police test the suspects weapons for ballistics ? Wouldn`t the ballistic tests link them to more murders ?As their case goes to court it turns out the prosecuting DA just happens to be one of their former childhood friends who was sexually abused by the guard in question . Two things leapt into my mind , one is what are the odds of this happy coincidence happening ( The coincidence being that the DA is someone who wants to get the two murderers off ) ? and more importantly wouldn`t a DA be vetted to see if he has any type of criminal record ? Oh and just to make sure the two wiseguys get off on the rap the mob hire a hopeless alcholic pill popping lawyer for the defence . I`m sorry if I`m slow on the uptake but wouldn`t the mob be better hiring a good lawyer to get the accussed off a murder rap ? Oh hold on there`d be a lot less drama if the defence lawyer and the district attorney were both doing their best to let the killers get away with murderIt gets worse though , no seriously it does , because the defence lawyer seems to be getting the upper hand so the DA calls a former guard into the witness box and - in a scene that defies logic because the former guard is under no pressure whatsoever - he confesses that both himself , the murder victim and other guards working at the reform school at that time were paedophiles who sexually abused boys in their care . Remember when you went to school and the teacher`s pet would grass you up for swearing ? What did you do when confronted by the teacher ? That`s right , you`d deny it so what`s the chances of someone admitting to child sex criimes in public , especially when they`re under no pressure to do so ? Again a totally unlikely plot twistThe final witness is a priest who says he was with the two killers at a ball game at the time of the murder . Can he prove it ? Yes he can by producing a couple of ticket stubs . Sorry but how does that prove anything ? and it`s not an alibi at all . Strange that the DA didn`t rule this as inadmissable incourt seeing as the priest never mentioned this to the police at the time , ah but the DA is throwing the case you see so why the hell didn` the judge rule this evidence as inadmissable ? Maybe because this is a work of complete fictionThe killers get off and we`re told that the DA has now retired from the legal profession and now works as a carpenter in England . Well that`s possible I guess , after all Petrocelli built his own house and Petrocelli - Just like all the ones seen here - was a fictional character</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fact Is Stranger Than Fiction ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.... Just a pity that SLEEPERS only exists in the realms of fiction . I remember watching a British documentary series call THE BIG STORY when the film version of Lorenzo Carcaterra`s novel ( And it is a novel - not a book. Look up the definition of " novel " in a dictionary )was released in 1996. THE BIG STORY featured 3 books claiming to be true stories . OPERATION JB was about a supposed true account of how the author and a team of crack commandos rescued Martin Bormann from the ruins of Berlin in the last hours of the war , THE NEMESIS FILE , a so called true account of the SAS executing IRA men in cold blood and dumping their bodies in unmarked graves in 1972 , and SLEEPERS by Lorenzo Caraterra. Strangely the authors of OPERATION JB and THE NEMESIS FILE were interviewed on camara while Lorenzo Carcaterra was absent. Indeed it wasn`t just THE BIG STORY that couldn`t get hold of him , no one from the different media outlets seemed to be able to contact him for interview. I wonder why not ?SLEEPERS itself is very overblown . De Niro , Hoffman and Pitt seem to be cast in order to give the movie some box office appeal. None of the trio give outstanding performances , but that`s nothing new where Brad Pitt is concerned . Strangely it`s the unknown actors like Brad Renfro and Geoffrey Wigdop who do the best acting performances along with Kevin Bacon who plays the main villain and Bacon is probably the best thing about the film along with Barry Levinson`s direction . It`d be very easy for Levinson to be sensationalist and exploitive ( Let`s not forget he would later go on to be executive producer of OZ ) but here he keeps a disciplined role as director and the scenes of child sex abuse are rightfully understated and all the more shocking for it . But we have to get back to the story`s alleged truth and that`s what ruins it ***** SPOILERS AS TO THE PLOT ****** What are the chances of four children being sent to reform school where they are sexually abused , doing their sentence , loosing touch for the most part with each other for many years , two of them coming across one of their abusers , killing him in a crowded bar in front of many witnesses - and then finding out the district attorney who is going to prosecute them is one of their friends and fellow victim from the reform school - and who then decides to bungle the case even though it`s open and shut !!!!!!! ? I don`t believe for one moment this is a true story after seeing all the evidence from THE BIG STORY etc and I feel completely insulted when people still claim it is true .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well-adapted, epic story of the childhood innocence of four boys brutally snatched away, and the subsequent revenge that took place so many years later. Perfectly paced, it is a long film whose length is never an issue; exciting courtroom drama, realistic sense of time and place, gritty yet sleek cinematography, and convincing performances from a cast that is actually to die for: Jason Patrick, Billy Crudup ("Big Fish") Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Minnie Driver and Brad Pitt in the same movie; it is a rare lineup. This is not to mention the young leads, who are completely convincing in heavyweight roles. Leading the pack was Brad Renfro, whose passing in the same month as Heath Ledger was unfortunately nowhere near as noteworthy, and sadly is still a shock, for some, to learn of! If one is to go back and watch not only this film, but "The Client", "Apt Pupil" and the indie hit "Ghost World", one can see another talent that was perhaps not as widely recognised as that of Ledger, but just as unfairly snubbed short, and just as worthy of our recognition.Barry Levinson puts together a film here that could easily be mistaken for a Scorsese work, and that may be the only criticism, if it is even that! Well drawn characters, electrifying, often emotional drama, the story never in a rush but never feeling laborious, this is an overlooked work of perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fact or fiction, I believe such abuse actually happens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The author of the book, Lorenzo Carcaterra, claimed that this is a true story.On one autumn evening in 1981, two big-time criminals walk into a bar, order their meals and soon afterwards, they shoot dead a customer who was having his dinner. The men are arrested and charged for murder.Back in 1967, four boys from Hell's Kitchen, New York City, are good friends who hang out with one another all the time. They are Tommy Marcano, John Reilly, Michael Sullivan and Lorenzo Carcaterra (affectionately known as Shakes). One day they decide to rob a hot dog wagon so they can have free lunch. It turns out to be the most gigantic mistake they are about to make in their entire lives: the wagon falls down the stairs of the underground and the boys almost kill an older man. They are sentenced to less than a year in Wilkinson Home for Boys, where they are repeatedly insulted, beaten, and gang raped by the guards.The two murderers who are arrested are John Reilly (Ron Eldard) and Tommy Marcano (Billy Crudup). The victim was Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon), one of the Wilkinson paedophiles. Michael Sullivan (Brad Pitt) is now an assisting New York district attorney and he volunteers to be the prosecution, while he is actually cooperating with Shakes (Jason Patric), now a newspaper journalist, for 'losing' his case and uncovering the abuse from which they suffer back in those days. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro), who has been tremendously caring, who has always been there since the four were boys, now must face a tough decision- remaining a good priest or saving the boys.The tale is gripping, dark, dramatic and yet rather surreal. I like the tragic ending. The young actors as the four boys did a grand job. Dustin Hoffman, as the defence lawyer Danny Snyder, once again manifests his uncanny humour and I must say HE IS GOD (I'm a hard-cored fan). In the final analysis, it doesn't matter whether this is fact or fiction. The point is, the film is poignant and astounding. You won't regret spending two hours watching this flick, as long as you don't really care it's a 'true' story or not. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legedndary Filmmaker Barry Levinson's 'Sleepers' is An Interesting Film to watch. Based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's 1995 novel of the same name, this legal drama comes in-tact with skilled direction &amp; proficient performances to lead it's narrative.After a prank goes disastrously wrong, a group of boys are sent to a detention center where they are brutalized, physically &amp; mentally. Over 10 years later, they get their chance for revenge.Barry Levinson's Adpated Screenplay is Convincing. The film has interesting &amp; absorbing moments in the first hour as well as in the second hour. However, the film gets too intense at times, and the faint-hearted are sure to shy away from those portions. Also, the film is very long. It definitely could've been trimmed. Levinson's direction is skilled. Michael Ballhaus's Cinematography is good. Editing is okay. Music by John Williams is impressive.Performance-Wise: Kevin Bacon is effective as the bad guy. Dustin Hoffman is first-rate, while Bobby De Niro delivers a subdued performance. Brad Pitt is extremely natural. Jason Patric does well. Minnie Driver leaves a mark. Brad Renfro is passable. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Sleepers' is worth a watch, as it succeeds by holding your attention almost throughout. Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting drama but provides no moral discussion or ethical complexity, never questioning the right or wrongs of the actions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As boys growing up in Hell's kitchen Tommy, John, Lorenzo and Michael, were raised in a harsh world despite the moral guidance of the streetwise Father Bobby. Carefree but always in trouble, one prank goes too far and sees a passer-by killed and the boys sent away for 18 months to a young offenders home. Once there they are subjected to cruel and persistent sexual abuse and beatings from the guards, led by Sean Noakes. Years go by and the friends drift apart ? with Tommy and John becoming gangsters. When the pair spot Noakes in a bar they kill him and walk out, but are picked up later by the police and charged with murder. With revenge on their minds, DA Michael takes the case with the aim of making getting his friends off while also exposing Noakes for who he was; meanwhile Lorenzo sets out to help him with the set-up, while also taking revenge on the rest of the guards.Sold on the back of the heavy star cast, I went to see this film at time of release and must admit that I wasn't that impressed by it that much. Rewatching it recently I had no reason to change my mind with a film that lives on the surface and, although providing some powerful moments to get the audience on its side, has much a simplistic moral outlook that it significantly damages the telling of the story. The use of narration makes the film drag and this is particularly evident in the first stage where the boys are free. The second stage is more interesting and disturbing as it documents the abuse suffered by the boys ? although in my opinion is far too safe and sanitised with the cop-out that the memories are buried too deep in our narrator's mind to recall clearly. The final third brings matters to a close and is easily the most engaging as many viewers will find the flow of the story enough to hold their interest.However for me what I couldn't shake off was the lack of questioning in the film; other than a thoughtful Father Bobby silently wrestling with his conscience (in just one scene!) the film never even hints that what the men might be doing is morally wrong. Now it may well be that the circumstances means that they were fully justified but the fact that the film never even broaches the subject and just expects us to get behind the cold revenge of Michael et al was a problem for me. Wouldn't the moral complexity of their actions be worth looking at, even if the outcome was the same wouldn't it have been more interesting if the audience were being pushed to ask questions of themselves? Very likely the answer is yes, but with Levinson driving we are not to know; for him this is a straight drama with right defeating wrong in a manner that makes for a nice courtroom drama.The simplicity of the writing and delivery leaves the cast with very little to do in the main group of roles. Patric is flat and dull ? qualities that could easily describe his narration which is delivered to the general detriment of the film. Pitt is equally as poor, with little to get his teeth into. Eldard and Crudup just seem to enjoy their minor roles alongside such a starry ensemble. With such weak turns from the main players, Bacon easily dominates the film with a monstrous character that he makes larger that life. Not comparable to his much better turn as a child abuser in a much different film recently, but he still dominates the middle section of the film. De Niro sleep walks a character that is so simplistic that it looks like Father Bobby had been developed using Microsoft Paint; he is a welcome presence but adds little. Hoffman is OK but again is just a nice addition to the cast. Minnie Driver is present for some reason I didn't get but the only performance that gets close to being interesting is that of an older Kinney; despite everything else he gets the closest to producing genuine interest in me (sadly the film has no interest beyond him doing this as part of moving the story forward).Overall then a star-heavy film that wears it's worthy credentials on its sleeve and refuses any debate or examination in favour of a straight drama. The cast find themselves with little to do with such a simplistic approach from Levinson and nobody can lift the material even if some of them stick in the mind much longer than others. I'm sure that the story has enough to engage the casual viewer but those looking for depth or shades of grey in the morally complex tale will be found wanting ? to Levinson there is none of that here ? just wrongs that can be righted by any means necessary. As a result though, it is a lesser film and one that made little impression on me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an automatic knockout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True story about four young boys whose childhood is robbed of them in a home for delinquents after a foolish prank lands them in court. Lorenzo Carcaterra's autobiographical novel is brought to the screen by writer/director Barry Levinson and one of the most star-studded casts we've seen in a while.Names like Brad Pitt, Jason Patric and Kevin Bacon are quite impressive, but throw in Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro and you've got a role call not to be missed. Rounding of the adult cast are Vittorio Gassman, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Terry Kinney and Bruno Kirby. Disappointingly, many of these big manes don't deliver what we've come to expect from them, with Patric, Pitt and De Niro really not having enough to do. De Niro in particular has a role well below his capabilities, as Father Bobby. The hardest thing he has to do is look concerned, which he does for most of the show. It's a shame we don't see more of Dustin Hoffman, who is humorous as the inept lawyer shafted for the job of defending John ( Eldard ) and Tommy ( Crudup ). Kevin Bacon is most disturbing as Nokes, the evil boys home warden, while his close friend Ferguson ( Kinney ) impresses during his short turn on the witness stand. As the four young boys growing up in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, Joseph Perrino, Brad Renfro, Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor are all strong and give some of the film's better performances.Sadly, Levinson is never able to convey the horror of the novel on screen, and what is a shocking true story never shocks as it should. Therefore "Sleepers" doesn't pack the punch it could have, perhaps because no one bothered to deliver it, or maybe everybody thought it would be automatically built in.John Williams provides a serviceable score.Tuesday, January 7, 1997 - Hoyts George Street Sydney</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers WithinThis movie seems to be a favorite with a certain age group of young men. There are hardly any comments here from women.As a film, the first part is much more convincing than the last. The story of the children and the performances of the actors is very good and very believable. The film goes downhill fast when the so called "stars" make their appearance. There is nothing remarkable about the performances of Pitt, Hoffman, and DeNiro. The film would have been much better off (and a lot cheaper to produce) if they had stayed with unknowns. Kevin Bacon, on the other hand, gives an excellent performance.I would have enjoyed this film a lot more if the "revenge" factor had shown a little more originality that just two thugs blowing away Bacon in a pub. Not only was this a hideous crime that involved Bacon but it also wreaked havoc on the lives of those who witnessed it not to mention the cost of cleaning up the mess for the owner of the establishment. There was no sympathy in the mind of this viewer for the characters who carried out this act.The fact that the prosecutor was the boyhood friend and detention hall mate was a little hard to believe. It was also very hard to believe that a priest would lie to save these two murderers. Whatever happened to the moral of "two wrongs don't make a right"? And, would the jury believe the priest since the defendants had never claimed that they had been to the basketball game on the night of the shooting? If they had an alibi, they would never have been charged. The conclusion is not very believable.It's too bad the last third of the film could not equal the quality of the first two-thirds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All star cast does not disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the only films that I can watch time after time and still be highly entertained. The film has many layers and a great cast of fantastic actors. It also has a wealth of superbly drawn minor characters. Bruno Krby is excellent as always as Shakes' dad. A man apparently typical of the community in Hells Kitchen. Proud but ruling his wife in particular with a iron fist. He is portrayed far more favourably than in the book where it is clear he is a lousy father and husband. But it is the ever excellent Kevin Bacon who threatens to steal the show as the deeply disturbing Sean Nokes. He is pivotal to the 4 boys descent in to hell and his evil in the bar scene where he meets his demise sets the wheels in motion for the revenge in the 3rd part of the movie. De Niro is superb as always but has great support in Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver and Dustin Hoffman. A Must see if you like films of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Complex not Delivered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Levinson's talent is fragile. Actors love him because he works for the scene and he often does produce memorable scenes. Some films can be composed of memorable scenes: `Rain Man,' `Tin Men,' even the parts of `Wag the Dog' that work. One would assume that he knows this, and that is why he is drawn to episodic work.But this story is different. It requires a vision greater than an actor's. It requires a framing greater than that of a scene. He doesn't have that greater vision and so this very promising material collapses. I'm sure it made matters worse, not better, to have some very talented, serious actors on board. Working with them would have reinforced his tendency to invest in the characters, the role, the dialog, the scene, and ignore the drama; the undercurrent that is carried from one scene to the next; the projection of emotion the audience can carry; the rare but effective moments when the audience becomes co-conspirator; the evocation of memory without showing that memory.So I consider this to be an interesting, illustrative failure, especially considering what happened next. Levinson, DeNiro and Hoffman seriously believe that the actor is the core of all film effectiveness. (This film proves they are wrong, but set that aside.) They hate it when a writer, `art' director, even a producer lobbies for a higher vision. They hate it -- here (they believe) they are at the beginning of the food chain in terms of creativity but the bottom in terms of power.So they collaboratively put together the project `Wag the Dog,' which revolves around the power of the presenter to create the truth, the real truth. There, they put the artist in charge of the whole country.Making a film is a balance of power. The director must control that power, sometimes submerging the actors to higher forms of communication and interaction with the audience. Levinson doesn't want that power; the actors should be good enough. Not for this material. No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Story Of Child Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers is a legal drama written, produced, and directed by Barry Levinson, and based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's controversial novel of the same title.It has an ensemble all-star cast in Kevin Bacon,Robert De Niro,Dustin Hoffman,Jason Patric,Brad Pitt,Brad Renfro and Minnie Driver.Based on a true story,Sleepers stirred controversy when the veracity of the book was challenged by reporters who could find no documentation of the events described. Lorenzo "Shakes" Carcaterra,Thomas "Tommy" Marcano, Michael Sullivan , and John Reilly are four childhood friends who grew up in Hell's Kitchen, New York City in the mid-1960s. During this time, the local priest, Father Bobby, plays a very important part in their lives and keeps an eye on them. However, early on they start running small errands for a local gangster, King Benny.On a summer day in 1967, their lives take a sharp turn when they almost kill a man after pulling a prank on a hot dog vendor. As punishment, they are all sentenced to serve time at the Wilkinson Home for Boys in upstate New York. There, the boys are systematically beaten, abused, and raped by guards Sean Nokes, Henry Addison, Adam Styler, and Ralph Ferguson. These traumatic events change the boys and their friendship forever.Fourteen years later, John and Tommy, now gangsters, find Sean Nokes in a Hell's Kitchen pub. After reintroducing themselves to Nokes, they both shoot him dead in front of several witnesses. Mike, now an assistant District Attorney, arranges to be assigned to the case, secretly intending to botch the prosecution to use it as a means of getting revenge. Moreover, he and Shakes begin forging a plan to get their revenge on all the guards who abused them. Together with many of their lifelong friends, especially Carol, a social worker, and King Benny, they manage to carry out their revenge using information on all the Wilkinson guards compiled by Mike previously. They hire Danny Snyder, a washed-up, alcoholic lawyer, to defend John and Tommy to make it seem as if the case is hopeless, allowing them to carry out their plan without being watched.However, to clinch the case they need a key witness who can give John and Tommy an alibi. Shakes has a long talk with Father Bobby, and tells him about the abuse they suffered at Wilkinson. After a few days of soul-searching, Father Bobby agrees to lie on the stand about where John and Tommy were on the night of the shooting; the priest swears under oath that they were with him at Madison Square Garden at a New York Knicks basketball game. As a result, they are acquitted, and another one of the guards, Ralph Ferguson, exposes himself and Nokes as abusers when called as a character witness in court. The remaining guards are also punished for their crimes: one, Henry Addison, is killed by the drug gang run by the older brother of Rizzo, a boy killed years before in the Wilkinson Home; the other, Adam Styler, a corrupt policeman accused of extorting and killing a drug dealer, is exposed and arrested. After the case is over, Mike quits his job as an attorney and moves to the English countryside where he becomes a carpenter; John drinks himself to death and Tommy is eventually murdered, both within a few years of the acquittal.It is a powerful story of child abuse.Boasting a glorious multi- generational cast, Levinson's tale of sexual abuse and revenge is just a compelling picture despite the fact that there is a lack of dramatic energy as it relies too much on voice-over narration and conventional courtroom procedures.It was skillfully crafted by Levinson which makes it eminently watchable,absorbing and deeply emotional.Although there are questions about the plausibility of the story,the film nevertheless remains entertaining and satisfying.</fullReview>

The film offers a good cast with all the trimmings but falls apart in story. It has plenty of 1970-80's pop songs for those who can get nostalgic over them. It has a tease at front and back ends for conspiracy theorists claiming its preposterous story in true. However, it runs too long, gets too convoluted, and is sorely lacking in credibility raising more questions than it answers. For those who find the subject interesting and can tough out a long film with brain disengaged a good watch awaits.

		<fullReview>We're looking for a film with good acting, with true and powerful feelings, and a good directing. Here's The film. This film is based on the book by Lorenzo Carcaterra, the film opening with a too long with a (too) long intro in a classic black background. But then we just let us enter in the story with a narrative (voice-over) construction during all the film.Anyway, so the story is about four kids in "The hell's kitchen" hood, four little kids who often work for the local King Benny's (Vittorio Gassman R.I.P) mob. They also go at the church (surprising huh?) with their Godfather of all four, The Father Bobby (the great Robert DeNiro).One day, a traditionally trick goes wrong, in this time It's gonna be the living-hell for our friends, the're sending in a detention center where they gonna be abuse and brutalized by Nokes (Kevin "bake"on) and the other guardians of the center. Few years later they decided that revenge can be their Redemption.Saying enough, now go watch this incredible drama with this terrible story of four friends destroying by what happened in their child-hood. For resuming, strong acting, powerful story, and a classic excellent directing by Levinson.</fullReview>

There is not a shred of credibility in the plot, nor any artistry in the execution to rescue that fact, and you will be reeling from one "that would never happen" moment to another. The boys do not talk like boys talk, the hoods do not talk like hoods talk, and the decent adults may talk OK but do not behave like decent adult people behave. The movie is entirely contrived to make the preconceived scenario work out. On top of that, there is a gratuitous love interest, which doesn't even amount to that, introduced simply to keep the cast from being all-male. A melodramatic monster of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was dreadful. I was optimistic due to a strong cast being involved. However, as is typical nowadays, get a Hoffman or De Niro, and in most other films Hackman to bail the film out.Who said Brad Pitt could act? The film didn't establish the necessary sympathy required for the characters and their dilemma. Too much nowadays it is considered quaint and romantic, and in this case, for the young to bully the local immigrant hot-dog seller and nearly kill an innocent man in the ensuing frivolity. Ending up in 'borstal' quite deservedly just made me accept their time in there was going to be awful to say the least. Why would it be anything else? Unlike the 'Shawshank Redemption' where you cared for all the characters, I didn't give a hoot to what happened to these boys, and I am sorry to say that. I felt more sorry for the character Kevin Bacon played. What in hell's name was he doing in a film like this? And poor Dustin Hoffman doesn't need work of this poor standard. Minnie Driver playing a social worker making remarks about her siblings like,'aren't you two shooting someone tonight' just about sums it all up for me. There was no humanity or sensitivity in this at all in my opinion. A poor copy off the likes of Casino and Good Fellas but without real and believable characters and a silly courtroom scenario to complicate the film unnecessarily. I came away wishing I'd never spent my money purchasing this DVD and will willingly pass it on to anyone who wants it.</fullReview>

I was kept on my seat for the entire 2+ hour duration.However, the movie's biggest flaw is character development - I had trouble even telling the four main characters apart for a lot of the movie, and I wish they had been given more fleshed out personalities to go with the intricately woven storyline.This is still a great film, though, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone with time on their hands and an insatiable lust for a full-throttle thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well made film. But many parts and the final ending with Robert De Niro on the stand was predictable and weak. I wished the writer-director Barry Levinson had rewritten the script one last time.But this is a decent film with a cool plot and characters. One thing though, NARRATION SUCKS! Jason Patric's narration isn't decent but it kind of ruins the film. Film is a visual art form, show don't tell. And this movie too often tells and doesn't show. A filmmaker has to be very careful about narration or it can weaken or even ruin their film.But I think this film falls into the category of failed near masterpieces. Or maybe not. I just like watching my DVD copy. Despite the fact the friggin' idiots who made the DVD put the movie on a TWO SIDED DVD. So you have to flip the DVD over to see the second half. Morons! This is the same crap we had to get with the extended DVD version of the Lord of the Rings films. Put the movie on ONE DVD!!!But check out Sleepers. The film coulda been a lot better. But what's here works fairly dang well. The film needed a bit more characterization. They should have just made a three hour film and filled the flick out a bit more. Adios.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepers didnt work for me, although I must concede that the premise surrounding the plot was admirable and the story bold. The issue being tackled is a very dark one within modern society, largely because such instances of abuse and their effects are largely over-looked by Hollywood, with very good reasons from an industry standpoint, it has to be said. As such, the film handled such scenes with a level of maturity, leaving the link-ins, particularly involving Robert De Niro's priest character, to convey the brutality, rather than elongate the abuses themselves. The disturbing side to the film was a key aspect of the plot and would have worked well except for the later stages, when it became gradually evident that the film bore little or no resemblance to reality. Personally I have a problem with films that portray legal proceedings, or the process and outcomes of the law in an unrealistic manner, often blatantly to facilitate an outlandish plot. This was the case with Sleepers. Another key criticism was the setting of the film and more particularly, its portayal. It was set in New Yorks notorious Hells Kitchen district and I didnt feel this often came across as it should have done. Everyone was far too nice and I felt De Niro in particular was woefully mis-cast. Kevin Bacon was superb in a role that he must feel he is being type-cast into, while Hoffman had no presence or place in the film to speak of, Pitt gave a simplistic, if steady performance while Patric didnt look like he wanted to be there. The idea was superb and could have worked really well to produce a dynamic and thought-provoking thriller to the full. What the audience received instead was a mere glimpse of these two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Levinson's Sleepers is a conventional but well-structured thriller, with the confidence to tell its story in three separate chapters, letting each element stand unhysterically on its own: it works as a story, not just as a plot. It even attempts a subtle ending, but somehow there's no real kick at the end. The problem here is the dignified integrity with which the film invests its heroes, something often seen in cinema but rarely in the messiness of real life. The accused in trial are both victims and murderers; but the film plays down the second element, and thereby squanders the inherent ambiguity of the scenario. As the darkness of the "good guys" is allowed to pass unnoticed, they fail to accumulate sufficient weight of character to make the ending count. Highly watchable, but it doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a remarkable film at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have honestly no idea why people keep praising this film. There's hardly anything unique or original about it, except to say that Kevin Bacon is one of the more underrated actors working in the business today. Besides that, I was just BORED. It's funny because I admire Barry Levison a lot in his directing but a film that could have taken chances just becomes a routine film and doesn't surprise you much at all. You know how the film is going to end, you know how the characters are going to react, that why should you care? Of course, the story really matters but "Sleepers" makes me think as if the story is just not original or interesting. The actors are just wasted here, especially Dustin Hoffman, a long time friend and actor of Levinson films. He does a mildly amusing performance as the would-be lawyer but really, if he had a much larger role, he'd have made "Sleepers" more strong, even if he was the primary reason to see the film. He's that great of an actor. However, there's just not enough payoff in "Sleepers." It's directed in just pure Hollywood form: no surprises, no interesting characters, nothing new to watch, lots of cliches. This is exactly how Levinson screwed up when he made his adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel "Sphere," which again has no surprises and nothing unique about it. Where's M. Night Shyamalan when you need him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Studded Cast outclassed by a bunch of kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this film I had heard of Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, Minnie Driver, Jason Patric, Kevin Bacon and Robert DeNiro so having seen the posters I was expecting to see these six on screen for the vast bulk of the film. Instead what I got was over one and a half hours of incredible child performances with only Bacon and DeNiro involved in the first half. When the heavyweights of Pitt and Hoffman appear the film spirals downhill as it had been the awesome performances from Joseph Perrino and Brad Renfro which had held ther veiwers attention. In 1986 Stand By Me unleashed a huge amount of young talent onto the film world. 10 years later Sleepers could have done the same thing but due to the producers deciding to ignore the kids in favour of the $15 million a movie men the incredible performances by the youngsters have gone mostly unnoticed. Whilst overall Sleepers is not that great a film you have to watch Sleepers just because it is the film where a star studded cast of DeNiro, Hoffman, Bacon and Pitt were outclassed by a bnch of kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great drama, but the book is ten times better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a good thing I saw this movie before I read the book because I'm sure that if I read the book first and then saw the movie, I would've hated the film. Sleepers is a great film talking about four boys living in Hell's Kitchen, New York during the 1960's. As usual, boys like to joke around and pull pranks but one prank involving a man and a hot dog stand goes completely wrong. Almost killing a man, the four boys are sent to a juvenile facility called the Wilkinson Home for Boys for about a year. At first, it seemed like it was nothing. They'll do some time and then it would be over with. However, the boys are beaten, tormented, and raped by four guards who are supposed to watch and protect them. Soon after when they are released, their lives are changed. As adults, two of them, John(Ron Eldard) and Tommy(Billy Crudup)are killers, another one, Michael(Brad Pitt), is an attorney, and the main character Lorenzo "Shakes"(Jason Patric)is a journalist(I think) and soon, all four men seek their revenge against the same guards who robbed their childhood. I was completely touched and I actually cried a bit while reading the book. The movie had great actors also including Kevin Bacon, Robert DeNiro, Minnie Driver, and Brad Renfro. I give the movie a 9/10 because there were some things I didn't understand. For example, wouldn't anyone suspect something that John and Tommy didn't say they were with Father Bobby(DeNiro) on that night? I'm not sure. I basically like the first half of the movie(when they were children) but the second I wasn't too thrilled about. The only parts I liked was watching the guards suffer. The movie gets 9/10 but the book gets 10/10. Try both of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable, Yet Could Be Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an unforgettable film, due to good performances and a disturbing plot involving horrible injustices to basically good kids sentenced to reform school after a prank goes horribly wrong. However, I can't help thinking it could have been even better-- Oscar quality, in fact, with some more tweaking. I realize this is supposedly a true story, so I can't really question the events that occurred in the film, but some things seemed so utterly unplausable that I wished that the film would take a bit more poetic license to better explain and dramatize such events. Also, Dustin Hoffman was terribly underused. He gave a great performance of a bad lawyer addicted to drugs and alcohol, but I was just yearning to learn more about this interesting character and what caused him to somehow overcome his problems long enough to shine on the stand. Finally, I must say that I find Brad Pitt to be a pretty one-dimensional actor whose presence does no justice to this film. I suppose he was there for star appeal (as if you need that with DeNiro and Hoffman), but his limitations really showed. Overall: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunch of crap, but a good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Presented as a true story that depicts the revenge of 4 boys who were brutalized by sicko guards while in a state correctional facility.I don't understand why you cant just say you made something up. Why the need to say its a true story? Nobody believes the movies anyway I hope. This is a good movie, exceptional acting and it had better be I guess with the bill they put up. Barry Levinson is forever walking the tightrope between genius and garbage, here he keeps it on the side of the former. But the warped morality so commonplace in film is once again dredged up as Hollywood tells us, murder is ok, perjury is ok, as long as it used to correct an injustice. Who decides what is just in this world of ours? Why the director does silly, who else? The law of course be damned. So if you are debased enough to commit a violent crime and are lucky enough to have some of these Hollywood type clowns as judge or as members of the jury, or both, you should be aquitted with relative ease. Its a double edged sword though isn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very well-paced, but a great cast rescues it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie hadn't the cast it has, its second half wouldn't have any of the appeal it still has. Truth is, the movie has charm but doesn't quite handle it, and when the second half kicks in, what saves it from making the audience fall asleep is actually the all-star cast, that makes this all worth it. The story starts like some kind of Martin Scorsese's abandoned project, on the tradition of "Once Upon A Time in America": showing the life of four boys, with the traditional voice-over. The story keeps evolving until one point, when the movie shifts into a courtroom drama, that has not the qualities a traditional trial should have, and dramatically changes pace from the fast lives of the Hell's Kitchen boys. As I said, the real thing that keeps our viewing interested is Robert deNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Minnie Driver, Brad Pitt, and Jason Patrick, and that ethereal John Williams' score that triumphs again with a unique work. It is worth watching, but don't expect a life-changing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A teen-targeting revenge tale masquerading as an exposee.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Here-in.This thing starts off realistic, stays at that same level for the kids part of the movie then following the richly, classical hollywoodly hateable Kevin Bacons demise it hits the floor. Four boys did time together and were raped and abused by the guards that were assigned to protect them. Somehow a tried, convicted and sentenced juvenile manslaughterer (one of the kids) becomes a lawyer and another a journalist. The other two kids become career murderers, discover one of the guards, blow him away and are arrested for it.The lawyer, the journalist and a laughable crime boss who thinks if he keeps a straight face and an accent he can be scary start working together to get the two murderers aquitted of the charges. Appropriately enough the witness that is called had 3 glasses of wine and two martini's before seeing the murder so naturally they bring that to light as imparing her testimimony. Both the prosecution (a mate of one of the murderers that did time with them{Brad Pitt}) and the defense (Dustin Hoffman) are working together to get the kids off. Pitt is trying to throw the case and make the job easier for Hoffman.The next glitch is that the court allows a man completely un-related to this specific murder to testify as a character witness, he is actually one of the guards who raped the kids but due to juvenile penitentiary files having been destroyed (wheeeew) the two kids can not be connected with the guy. Then he gives over to emotions and tells all about Bacons past times on the Job and despite an evident exchange of familiarity between the man and the two boys in the court room and the implications of how the two boys enterred crime in the first place considering it's a never-too-young-to-start buisness neither the Jury nor Judge start to see a motive forming for the two young men.Strike Three. De Niro's character, a priest, is approached by the Journalist who tells the never-before-told story of what went on in the prison to butter him up to go and testify that the two men were not even there at the time, in other words to swear by the divine overseer and his savior that he has pledged his life to and then lie his heiney off (in an extremely convincing and perhaps even familiar manor) purely in the cause of freeing two career murderers, the screenwriters even have the gall to call it recalling two stray sheep. The priest goes through with it, and that is when Justice, Righteousness and any other redeeming quality this movie had disappear. Naturally it all goes through the two murderers go back to business and Pitt seeks a career change. I dare you to look beyond what the boys experienced in the prison and judge whether or not it is equally just to let them off for ending the life of a human being.This movie is the most uniquely insulting and crass your ever likely to come come across, if theres any way to avoid it do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes revenge is the only answerStarring Robert De Nero, Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt and Dustin HoffmanBased on a book by Lorenzo CarcaterraDirected by and Screenplay by Barry LevinsonThis is another example of something that could have been so much better.I was sat watching this thinking to myself, ' I bet the book is better than this.'There are so many big names in this film and it even has a soundtrack by John Williams, it should have worked but it didn't. There is something that just doesn't work. It felt like the whole movie was crammed together and didn't have room to breathe. We don't get time to get our heads around the story or the individual characters, I spent most of the movie trying to work out which character was which. And just when I was starting to get a grip, we are shoved thirteen years into the future and have to try and work it all out again.Considering the star studded line up, for me it was Dustin Hoffman that came out on top even though he only played a small role. He played to alcohol lawyer with perfection, it's a pity we didn't see any stand out performances by any of the others. I don't know what went wrong. Maybe this movie would have been better served with a different production team or a different director.As for the story itself, it's allegedly based on a true story but that is another story.Watchable but frustratingly disappointing.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepers is a Sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers is such a sleeper hit. It was released in '96, it was great, and everybody slept on it. I think I know why. It's a respectable sleeper mainly due to its personally private non-loud nature. The subject matter is saddening and stirring, and even outright sensitive, not very lively. While everyone you may talk to that's seen Sleepers loves and praises it, no one ever much talks about it. Just like Mystic River. Everyone you talk to that hasn't seen it, doesn't really know what it's about, just knows that Sleepers has a bunch of good actors in it. It coming out in 1996 also contributes. Sleepers plays in three distinct parts - the first introductory part showing the kids before the terrible incident is carefree and in a faster pace, the second story setting part taking place at the delinquent center is dismal, dragging and disturbing, and the third longest lasting part when the kids are adults is immersive, compelling, and the best part. The Sleepers' cast is great, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman great, not even to mention Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver or Billy Crudup. Robert De Niro is at the top of his game and I'd be damned to critique him, there's nothing to critique. Hoffman's great as he nearly steals the whole show with his portrayal of drunken attorney Danny Snyder. Bacon is impressive in one of his most dominant roles. Brad Pitt really went for it with his character and he does a really good job. Jason Patric is strong and steady in his lead role. Minnie Driver is a sleeper actress as she is very well for Sleepers. Crudup is noticeably nice in his smaller role. The rest of the cast is completely rounded. Sleepers feels a little long but there's nothing close to being bad about it. While Sleepers may be somewhat slow, and put a few people to sleep, the collectiveness of the story is so agreeable it leaves a lasting impression on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepers is one of the best revenge movies ever made. Kevin Bacon pulls off one of the most convincing portrayals of evil ever filmed, and Robert DeNiro's Father Bobby will stay with you forever. The priest is forced to make a choice at the end which had me holding my breath. Four pre-teen boys, Lorenzo, Tommy, Michael, and John are friends, growing up in Hell's Kitchen, when they nearly kill a hot dog vendor during a prank. They are sent to a reform school where they are sexually abused by sadistic guards. Sean(Kevin Bacon), Henry, Adam, and Ralph. It takes fourteen years for payback. Tommy and John have become real criminals and when they encounter Sean at a bar, they shoot him dead in front of several patrons. Their old buddy Mike gets himself assigned the case, as he is now a district attorney. He intends to screw up the case to free his old friends. Once the four reunite, they decide to kill the remaining three abusers. Barry Levinson gets the most out of a great cast, and a small complaint is the almost two and a half hour running time. Sleepers will knock you out.</fullReview>

The narration of the movie, the acting by everyone, is crafted perfectly to make the audience picture the events unfold before them, like the are not watching a movie, but are instead hearing the story from a person sitting next to you.The movie is not a masterpiece, I admit, but its an admirable, almost inspiring depiction of never letting yourself be consumed by your past, but instead to take control and correct what has been wronged.Definitely a watch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not rain man but not envy either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched the star studded film from 1996 called "Sleepers", and directed by academy award winning dude Barry Levinson. Mr. Levinson has given us some really great flicks over the years like "rain man" and "diner", as well as some real stinkers like "Sphere", "envy", and of course "Toys". So which camp does this one fall into well it was good, not great but good. So this movie could have been great I mean what a cast which includes Deniro, Patric, Pitt, and Hoffman. And the list keeps going. This movie is supposedly a real life fictionalized version of events that happened to the author of both the screenplay and the novel this film was based on, writer Lorenzo Carcaterra. The only problem there are zero records to back up this statement something the film disclaims at the end. Well what about the plot, well this is one of those flicks you should just watch, I think I was better for not knowing most of the plot going in and anyone else should be as well. There are some moments in this film that are not for children so just be aware of that before you sit little Billy or Betty down beside you to watch this. Also there is one plot point I will mention, half of this film takes place when the characters are young while the second half takes place when they have all grown up. So what did I not like about this film, well there were flashbacks which were useful, but just were a little too much and just complicated an already complicated story. There was also the narrative, normally I am a fan of narrative but here it didn't work for me. Besides from that this is a highly watchable film, and one that was filmed in the 1990's and takes place between the late 60's and early 80's, and holds up now some 15 years later. So finally is this film for everyone, well it's not very chicky and not lighthearted, its a guys film, but not like say "insert generic action flick or crime flick here", it is slightly cerebral. I recommend it, but it is not in my top Levinson film picks by a long shot. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really amazing. It's a bit of a "coming of age" story. The storyline has a way to justify the killing of a "bad" individual. I guess it gives us all a chance to think on if/how we would take revenge on someone. Should we? Is it worth it? Personally I think an eye for an eye is appropriate in this case. The acting is really good, Robert De Niro is solid as always. Dustin Hoffman, although a small part, is his usual rock. Brad Pitt and Jason Patric also put in a great work here. This movie should have been nominated for a lot more than it was. But I guess it is not the typical Hollywood style. I've seen it a few times now, and it is equally touching every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father Bobby would have made a good "hit-man." It's a shame we lost him to the other side.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A journalist and a lawyer conspire together to get two brutal assassins acquitted of their most recent murder. What the world does not know is that their latest victim, Sean Nokes, tortured and raped these four men as boys. When Nokes was killed, these men were exacting their revenge for years of torment. When this movie was first released, there was a lot of controversy over whether it was a true story or not. No one really knows how much of the story is true, if any of it. I tend to step back from this argument, as I believe that it doesn't really matter. If it is true, it's a great story; and if it isn't, it still is a terrific marketing device and a great story. Sleepers is an excellent film. The plot is beautifully knitted together by a clever narrative. The events depicted on screen are, at times, hard to watch, but are brilliantly woven into a fascinating and complicated plot. The dialogue in this movie is tremendous, and the men and women of Hell's Kitchen come gloriously to life through witty turns of phrase and poignant drama. The performances are sublime. Robert De Niro makes one of the "coolest" priests I have ever seen on screen, and Brad Pitt portrays a greatly disheartened and troubled lawyer. (This proves once again my own personal theory that Pitt is fantastic when he is not the lead.) Sleepers is a movie full of anguish, remorse, and bloody, cleverly-plotted revenge. Sleepers will make you shed a tear; it will make you wince at its brutality; and, it will make you cheer on the most violent and brutal of assassins, as they are acquitted of a murder they did commit.</fullReview>

Why would the prosecution (okay, they were going to throw the case) not cross-examine the defendants? I'm a big De Niro fan and wasn't too impressed. The directing was slipshod, and not enough emotional compassion was developed for the characters. Okay, boyhood, inseparable friends they may have been, but the film omits the formative years after they're released from Wilkinson Home for Boys. Cold-blooded killers? Assistant district attorney? Alright, but why and how? If this is some kind of buddy movie, I've seem it done much better, with lower budgets and supposedly 'weaker' casts. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two different perspectives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this film... until I read the book and discovered a whole other dimension to it.The movie is about the revenge they gain after their torment in the correctional facility, and allows Kevin Bacon and Brad Pitt maximum air-time. In contrast, most of the book is devoted to the struggles of the young teens relationship with one another, and their relationship with the harsh surround of Hell's Kitchen. In fact over two-thirds of the book is dedicated to this growing relationship outside and in the correctional facility, but the movie allows roughly half, maybe even less. I found that the whole point of the book was to connect with the characters in their childhood and then see them changed as adults, but with such big names as Robert DeNiro, Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon, they reduced the teens story (with the true actors being those of the tormented and struggling teenagers) and hurried on the courtroom scenes. Whilst it is still a magnificent film, it had completely changed the dynamic of the book, and the connection one gains with the children is lost when put to film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a kind of disappointment for me. Although the actors do a good job (I especially liked the Fat Mancho type), the story is not very realistic and both the cinematography and directing aren't breathtaking, to say the least. The shots are far from original, and the continuity in the poses of the actors between different cuts isn't flawless either. Normally I don't really pay too much attention to those things, but the story just couldn't captivate me at times, and then I automatically start to notice such little errors. I got the feeling that the movie was rushed in some places; especially the first part about Hell's Kitchen and the childhood of the four friends was too shallow and edited way too fast. The most interesting moment was the one with the older John Reilly and Tommy Marcano, who I thought were also the most interesting characters, but they unfortunately didn't get much screen time. The talents of Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Minnie Driver and Dustin Hoffman weren't exploited like they could have, they just did their job, nothing more.All in all, there really are better (more independent) films with the same uplifting theme. I'm not saying there aren't good moments in this film, but overall it didn't do it for me. But hey, Minnie Driver never looked so good in a movie! 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb performance by De Niro. The scene when Jason Patric tells all (no dialogue, just music and De Niro's face) is among the best work he's ever done. Dustin Hoffman just enjoys himself, and Pitt, Patric etc are vastly inferior to the youngsters playing the same roles. Kevin Bacon, although as good as usual, seems to be having far too much fun playing an evil child abuser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was powerful because it shows that no extreme act of cruelty should go unpunished. The child abuse scenes are strong, but they are meant to show the viewers just how bad the children in the home had to suffer, in other words, the abuse was depicted to make a point. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 16 because of its disturbing violence, but everyone over 16 should see this movie to learn that no matter what you do, no one deserves to be treated in the way the boys at the detention center were. It also shows what years of abuse can turn a person into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it disturbing that so many people seem to think that this is a great movie, as this is the most shamelessly immoral movie I have ever seen. This movie celebrates murder and perjury as being great, the right thing to do, the example we must cheer. It is: so they were criminals, then it is okay if we are even worse criminals. And to the intrinsic immorality of the story, there is the added immorality of attempting to pass off this story as true.I feel sorry for those who swallowed this absurd plot hook and sinker, but what about those who admit that the story is a fake, but then, so what? What, do you just love to be lied at? To be fooled by those who invent facts because truth is not sexy enough? It is obvious what they did here: as fiction this is a pretty pedestrian thriller, but disguised as reality it becomes much more compelling. Now, even if I bought the story, the vengeance plot would still be unacceptable. In fact, I would say: these people, the alleged abuse victims, are obviously thugs, liars and murderers. Why on earth should I believe their abuse tales are true?But then, of course, nothing of this can be true. It is true that more preposterous things have actually happened in real life, but in this case some corroboration of the story should exist. To begin with, because of the way case law functions there are records of every trial that ever took place at a court of law. Even if the names were all changed there should still be records of the trial, and there aren't. I suppose that the movie is all wrong because the book is not right, but nobody forced them to make a movie out of such preposterous book. Everything about this movie ranges from indifferent to downright bad, with the exception of the kids, who are quite good and deserved otherwise. The adult cast, on the other hand, is a disaster zone. What were De Niro and Hoffman thinking?! De Niro looks plainly embarrassed and Hoffman looks drunk... OK, so he played a drunk, but he looks as if he wasn't acting, see? Brad Pitt is as bad actor as usual, but Jason Patric manages to be even worse, and that is no mean feat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Jason Patric playing LORENZO CARCATERRA! The kid actors in this movie were brilliant, but their grownup counterparts were cast so poorly. First of all, the kids have good ol' Hell's Kitchen accents and little Lorenzo is very clearly Italian... and then we get Jason Patric with his clear speaking voice and no trace of New York in him at all!Besides that, this is a good movie about four kids who pay dearly for a childhood prank gone wrong, undergoing severe physical and emotional abuse in the juvenile corrections facility that they serve time in. The fact that this account was written by Mr. Carcaterra, one of the survivors strengthens the impact of the film.Besides the outstanding child actors whom I have mentioned, Brad Pitt does a fantastic job as an embittered attorney and Robert DeNiro is great as a wiseass priest. Few people can do pure evil quite like Kevin Bacon, who plays the prison guard who terrorizes the youngsters.Very watchable, this film has a few slow parts, but it moves along smoothly, with only a few interruptions in the plot. Levinson does a terrific directing job, and overall is a very decent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the need to pose fiction as fact?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has merit but cannot possibly be based on a true story. The author wanted a modern day Count Of Monte Cristo and wrote this story. The patently false presentation of this as non-fiction in order to sell the work is really a turn off. The other reviewers are so fast to forgive this that they miss the point. Child molestation, has gained great political correctness as one of the last "true" evils that we are all allowed to openly and freely hate. How often are we told that its occurence is "widespread". That's a tell word that informs the astute reader that the claims are probably exaggerated. Consider. Maybe Carceterra went to juvenile prison. Maybe there was a guard that tormented and even tortured the boys with physical punishment. Maybe. Certainly possible. If the evil guard only does that, if there's no forced sex with the boys, does then the author surrender the "moral force" that permits and justifies the murder. Eliminate the forced sex, which I believe the writer concocted to make the story sell better, and the question of justification of the murder becomes so much harder to decide. But would then be better. Why am I fairly certain the author is lying about the sex? He's lying about the book being real. He's lying about the trial. He's lying about the priest's very presence at the trial let alone his perjury. The neat Monte Cristo four corners justice being delivered has to be a lie because life don't work that way. Only fiction does. The Count of Monte Cristo is a classic. It was never sold as fact. This is and it ain't ever gonna be a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of Sleepers is gut-wrenching, disturbing, and brilliantly acted by the young stars. Watching their mistake and the exorbitant price they pay for it, you feel their guilt and their subsequent victimization to the point of physical discomfort. You can't wait for the second act when the villains will be brought to justice and you'll feel just great about the whole thing. . .right?Then you get the second act. It turns into a showcase for hot young over-actors who could learn a thing or two from their younger counterparts. DeNiro's character is the most compelling and the movie would have done better to involve him more, but because of the cursory examinations Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup (and the screenplay) provide their characters, you never fully believe DeNiro would do what he does. Brad Pitt and Dustin Hoffman try like heck to make their plotline ring true, while Jason Patric and Minnie Driver just sit there and whine as if the story itself provides the tension they lack.Plotwise, the second half provides only one real moment wherein the wounds begin to heal, with the testimony of one of the villains. The rest of the act, the movie and Hoffman double plead their own case. They're innocent, but if they're guilty it's still OK. The nonsensical mafia subplot seems a weak device to tie up loose ends, and where does DeNiro come up with his ace in the hole anyway? Sloppy writing that leaves the viewer still licking the wounds of the first half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry Levinson directs this film based on the book by Lorenza Carcattera about four friends growing up in Hell's Kitchen, New York... and how one mistake ruins their whole lives. An excellent cast including Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric and Brad Pitt make this film an absolute must for any film fanatic. Yes, the film does include scenes of sexual and physical abuse suffered by the boys when they are sent to a reform school but that is not what this film is about. Its really a tale of revenge and friendship - both of which are tightly bound together in this film. Levinson is not heavy handed in his direction and allows the actors free range to explore their individual characters with great effect. Although two Hollywood greats are present in this film (Hoffman and De Niro), the parts they play are such, that you don't really notice them and that's a good thing. No one actor should be greater than the story being told and there is no greater evidence of this than in this movie.This film is really quite superb. It is very emotional and very moving. Especially as we know it is a true story. The thought of this is disturbing. The story is a bout 4 boys who go to a young offenders home, here they are abused in any kind of way you can imagine, sexually, verbally, physically and mentally. Years after the boys are released, they are displayed with the opportunity of revenge, and they take it. The film shows true friendship, and is one of the best films you will see.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow, methodical burn. Great stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Levinson's Sleepers is a deliberately paced, downbeat look at revenge, and is one of the most brilliant yet seemingly overlooked dramas of the 90's. Part of it could have been marketing; The cover suggests blistering violence, confrontation and courtroom intrigue. While there are such moments within the narrative, they live to serve the story, which Levinson and his dream cast are doggedly intent on telling. It's a sombre affair to be sure, slow and methodical as well, but never to be confused with boring. It's just such a great story, one that unfolds exactly as it needs to. It starts in the 1950's, where four young rapscallions run wild on the streets of Manhatten. It kicks the story off with a sort of urban Stand By Me vibe, and if you thought that film went to some heavy placed, stick around through Sleepers. When an innocent prank ends in tragedy, the four are sent to an austere children's correctional facility, where they run afoul of some sadistic and abusive guards, led by Kevin Bacon, who is scummier than scum itself. They endure months of ritual abuse at the hands of these sickos, until their eventual release. Life goes on, as it must, the four boys grow up and follow very different paths from one another. Michael (Brad Pitt) becomes an esteemed lawyer. Shakes (Jason Patric) lives a quiet life, while Tommy (Billy Crudup, wonderfully cast against type) and John (Ron Eldard) take a darker road to drugs and crime. Eventually their past rears it's head, and they are presented with an opportunity for much delayed revenge. It doesn't all play out the way you may think though, and half the fun of this one is being surprised by geniunly lifelike plot turns and characters who behave as real humans would. Pitt is the highlight in a performance of quiet torment. Dustin Hoffman is fun as a washed up lawyer who gets involved, Minnie Driver shows up as a tough NYC gal who gets involved with Patric, Robert De Niro has a nice bit as a kindly priest who counsels the boys even until adulthood, and there's further supporting work from Jonathan Tucker, Bruno Kirby, Frank Medrano, Brad Renfro, Terry Kinney and more. Levinson usually takes on bright, chipper comedies and razor sharp political satire. With Sleepers he deviates into tragic dramatic material, and shows his versatility excellently. This one gets grim, no doubt about it. However, it's a story not only worth the telling, but worth the watching for us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SleepersWhen falling asleep around the male species it is best to do so with a bear trap between your legs.Unfortunately, the boys in this thriller could not access any anti-rape weaponry.When an innocent street prank goes wrong, Hell's Kitchen troublemakers Shakes (Jason Patric), Michael (Brad Pitt) and Tommy (Billy Crudup) are sentenced to serve in an upstate boys home. Interned, they are repeatedly raped by the lead guard (Kevin Bacon) and his squad.Years later, the friends exploit their positions in the media and justice department to takedown their former abusers with false testimony from their neighborhood priest (Robert De Niro).An unsettling account of juvenile detention supplemented by an even more controversial form of retribution, this dark and dubious adaption of the semi-nonfictional novel is an intense and unforgettable experience.Incidentally, if the predatory guards had been female the courts would've sentenced them to life on probation.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant first part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack).The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity.As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One hell of a brutal look at true justice served beyond a flawed system (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched Barry Levinson's Sleepers, it traumatized me, as the horror of these young boys felt very real. The performances in this film are marvellous: Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best.All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.</fullReview>

Our heroes are subjected to the sadistic and truly twisted Head Guard Sean Nokes (Bacon), who abuses them sexually and mentally. None of the boys leave as the same person, and as grown men they use the Justice System to exact revenge.Truly an incredible movie. Every performance is brilliant, wonderfully acted by a cast for the ages and masterfully directed by Barry Levinson.

		<shortDescription>Revenge?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I see the movie, it touches me again due to the fact that abuse on children (or on the weaker in the certain situation, like women and animals) happen all the time, everyday.This movie goes through with us quite plainly and close, what happens, in all the pictures, cries and torture, that we should get close to the feeling, how it is to be in such a lost situation, because of a youth stupidity, because of bad luck, being on the wrong place at a wrong time etc. Everyone had some stupid things going on as a child, but if you're lucky, it turns out well, you didn't get caught or someone had a heart and understood you as a child. In this case it didn't, it was the beginning of a nightmare. But similar things do happen. You come to a location where someone else has power over you, someone who rips the situation and uses his power to hurt you in any way. I asked myself several times through the movie, what would I do, later, when I'm grown up, if I would be in such a situation as a child? I would desperately feel the need for some justice too, logically.Sleepers showed me from the beginning to the end, as an example and replacement to all similar stories, how the live of abused victims could turn out, and if you take revenge, crucify and kill the offender, it only eases your pain for a certain moment, but the wounds will never really heal. This is with all bad experiences in life. This is a truth where you have to face, and try to live somehow with it, and do your best for you, and your next ones. I admire people you went through a horrible time in their lives, where kidnapped, tortured etc. but somehow they could get free themselves as the time passed, and they live with this experience, it made them stronger in a way. They say, that this experience should not lead their lives. I have huge respect for these people.Lorenzo Carcaterra, the author of the book, where the movie is based on, states that his book is based on facts. The New York legal community stating that no such cases resembling the events of his book could be found in any court records. This is hard to believe, honestly, very hard to believe. I can imagine that his story is based on true happenings with some changes, it's not hard to find similar cases everywhere around the world. Just now, the church abuses has entered a new international phase for example. The victims speak up now! I personally have a strong feeling for justice, maybe that's way I like the movie so much, next to the fact that the actors are convincing in their roles and the story lives without unnecessary action-overloaded scenes, it's never lame nor boring, you will like it, if you can be touched with serious subjects in live.</fullReview>

Kevin Bacon was chilling as always and did a marvelous job as Nokes. Jason Patric, Brad Pitt, Billy Crudup, and Ron Eldard were good, but did not come to par with the performance of the actors playing their younger selves. DeNiro was fantastic, playing Father Bobby as only he can. My favorite scene was when the boys were sitting around the table and were talking about what they wanted when the left Wilkonsin.

		<fullReview>The script explains "Sleepers" as, "the street name for anyone who spent time in a juvenile facility." This portends young children are physically abused in "reform schools", leading to permanent psychological problems throughout life. So, "Sleepers" are physically and sexually abused young children. Those afflicted, herein at the "Wilkinson Home for Boys", are four childhood friends, from New York's "Hell's Kitchen": Joe Perrino and Jason Patric (as Lorenzo "Shakes" Carcaterra), Brad Renfro and Brad Pitt (as Michael Sullivan), Jonathan Tucker and Billy Crudup (as Thomas Marcano), and Geoffrey Wigdor and Ron Eldard (as John Reilly). The eight actors are well-cast; and, their work is extraordinary. Mr. Perrino essays, arguably, the octet's greatest performance; the film is centered around his stinging, sensitive characterization.Unfortunately, the story unravels, during the second half of the film. A serious topic is bowdlerized by an increasingly implausible set of circumstances. Without giving anything away (after all, this is still a great film), note that social worker Minnie Driver (as Carol Martinez) sums up the film's ideological shortcomings with the line, "What is this, a gay bar?" The line, and the actors' lack of traumatized reaction, helps separate being "gay" from the sadistic homosexual pedophile portrayed by Kevin Bacon (as Sean Nokes). For the clearest delineation of the "Sean Nokes" character, note Mr. Bacon's eyes as he watches Perrino undress. The subtle "homophobia", and "immoral" act committed by the killers' Priest (and "friend") Robert De Niro (as Father Bobby), will unsettle many viewers. Still, director Barry Levinson, and novelist Lorenzo Carcaterra, should be commended for shining light on topics too often regulated to the dark. The single "Academy Award" nomination, for John Williams' always excellent music, is shocking. The film contains at least five performances worthy of a "Best Supporting Actor" Oscar; perhaps, with so many in contention, it was easier to simply move on. In addition to those mentioned above, you have alcoholic lawyer Dustin Hoffman (as Danny Snyder), kindly mobster Vittorio Gassman (as King Benny), and Terry Kinney (as Ralph Ferguson). Mr. Kinney's witness stand meltdown is most amazing. Stu Linder's editing, Timothy Galvin's art direction, and Beth Rubino's set direction are also award worthy. It's hard to believe five films topped the Gavin/Rubino work on "Sleepers".Set in the late 1960s, the first part of "Sleepers" (forgiving the fact that the lads would not have been listening to Donovan's "Hurdy Gurdy Man" in 1967) is a fantastic film: ********** Sleepers (1996) Barry Levinson ~ Joseph Perrino, Brad Renfro, Jonathan Tucker, Geoffrey Wigdor Set in the early 1980s, the second part falters in storyline; but, it's still an excellent movie: ******** Sleepers (1996) Barry Levinson ~ Jason Patric, Brad Pitt, Robert De Niro, Dustin HoffmanAveraging out to a still well above average: ********* Sleepers (1996) Barry Levinson ~ Joseph Perrino, Jason Patric, Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh Idea And Great Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Sleepers and wished I had seen this movie when it first came out. It has an all-star cast and the plot is a fresh and moving story. The film is beautifully directed.My only gripe with this film is that it is a bit far-fetched. The scheme that Brad Pitt's character puts together is so complex that you would think there would be more problems along the way. It is also as if he had this scheme devised before his two thug friends off Bacon's character. I would have preferred that the murder of Bacon be planned rather than presented as a random encounter. The randomness of this event makes the film less realistic.Otherwise a great film, one that I would enjoy watching over and over again, even with the long running time. Rating 8 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent but uninspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proficient work from a gaggle of big star names - Hoffman is on fine form and Vittorio Gassman gives a chillingly convincing performance. But these are bit-parts. Indeed therein lies the problem, because there are no really big meaty roles in this movie, for any of the hugely talented cast to get stuck into. I was left wanting more - more courtroom drama (Snyder was just warming up wasn't he?) more evilness from Bacon - and for him, definitely a more painful, prolonged death! This could have been an epic, but it spent too much time in less significant areas and not enough on the important bits like the detention centre guards, and the consequences of the brutality. DeNiro's character appears to have been thrown in without a lot of thought as to where he came from or why he's like he is. Right across the board there are missed opportunities.I get the feeling the telling of the story and procurement of some really big name actors, overshadowed the creative and artistic processes of film-making. Whether it's true is not for me to judge but if it's deemed important or interesting enough to make into a movie then make it a movie, instead of what is basically just sentimental reminiscence punctuated with pretty actors and everyday, if brutal, exploitation and dodgy ethics. Good, but could be much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Adaption to a Graphic novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>sleepers is a great adaption to Lorenzo Caracaterra's novel. I first saw the movie years ago and i have always liked it then i bought it and watched it again and it became one of my favorites.The way Lorenzo, John, Tommy and Michael get along together as best friends in Hells Kitchen in the 60s is what i loved about it and why i liked movies such as "stand by me," and "stephen King's IT."I just read the novel "Sleepers," and how the movie took all the neccassary scenes from the book. Though the book was more graphic.Kevin Bacon played the character "Nokes," who abused the four best friends at the wilkinson home for boys and while i read the novel i realized how well Bacon played the violent and angry man.There is three parts to this book: 1. the friendship between boys 2.the Wilkinson home for boys 3. life years after the terrible incidents at the wilkinson home for boys.The scenes are set up the same way as the novels are. Sleepers is a excellent movie and i recommend the movie and the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepers follows four young boys from Hell's kitchen in the mid-late sixties, care-free and cheeky until one of their minor scams ends up nearly killing a man.sentenced to no less than a year Wilkinson juvenile detention centre, the kids witness and receive horrific acts from the guards- random beatings, humiliation, sexual abuse etc, particularly by one guard- Nokes (kevin bacon). In the place where they were meant to rehabilitate the system let them down and pushed them further into a life of crime and hatred.The boys shut the experiences from their minds, and by chance, 13 years later, two of the men, who had become hit men spot Nokes eating in a diner and murder him. The two stand trial but the other two friends, Michael (Pitt) is now a lawyer and "shakes" (patric) works at a newspaper, stand up to help them, intent on not only finding their 2 friends innocent but also bringing down Wilkinson and its abusive guards, by both lawful means and by way of the street.Sleepers is a slow-starter, but the scenes in Wilkinson are particularly moving, and the older actors of these characters play very well tough characters hiding serious psychological scarring, as Patrick shows very well in his scene praying at church.The film shows well the bonds that exist within a community, even if it is a troubled one, and how strong bonds can be torn apart as well as strengthened when experiencing horrific acts.The only problem i see is that it started to lose my attention at the end-the film dragged on a little too long;there were a few unnecessary scenes, but is still a worthy film in my book, and i won't forget it for a while.</fullReview>

Years later, when the boys are men, two of them (Billy Crudup and Ron Eldard) who have become murderers with many other problems, see one of the guards (Kevin Bacon) at a bar. They kill him on the spot.When the two are put on trial, the two other friends (Brad Pitt and Joseph Purrino), one (Pitt) being a lawyer, decide to "rig" the trial so that they may get revenge on all that had happened.The first half was difficult to watch, but so worth it. I was on the verge of tears. The second half didn't flow so well but the first part of the movie makes up for any of the flaws. I'd recommend this movie anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepers is a movie with many sides. It starts with the lives of four boys in Hell's Kitchen, an Irish/Italian part of NY. Their lives are beautifully described, with its ups and downs. But then a prank goes horribly wrong, a man nearly dies, and they are sent to a youth prison. The horrible guards, especially Sean Nokes(Kevin Bacon) mistreat them, to say the least. They are left with deep scars from their time there. The movie then jumps again, and I think it makes you loose track. This time, its about a trial against two of the now grown boys, who has taken revenge on one of their old tormentors. These three parts are great alone, but get a bit muddled as one movie. The connection between the boys and the grown men is a bit weak, and it's hard to tell which is which. But all of this is patched up by great acting, (Robert Deniro does a wonderful priest, Brad Pitt is one of the boys, and Dustin Hoffman is a drunk lawyer) good camera-work and a solid script. The movie doesn't try to tell you anything in special, and you are allowed to form an own opinion. Is revenge right or wrong? Can you live through horrible things? I liked the movie and it touched me, and apart from the connection issues, its a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hugely talented film crew and a very effective first half runs into problems in the later parts of the film. *** out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Barry Levinson. Running time: 147 minutes. Rated R (for language, graphic violence, and some sexual content).(The following review of "Sleepers" contains a descriptive plot description that may or may not be of a spoiling nature.)If Barry Levinson's "Sleepers" continued its winning streak throughout a 147 minute running time, we would have one of the year's best films. It does not do so. About half way into the production, the story turns from dramatic thriller to dishonest courtroom drama. I enjoyed the earlier segments more than the later and felt somewhat cheated out of a great movie's promising second half.The film details the lives of four friends growing up in Hell's Kitchen as well as the mistakes they make. The young teens, Shakes (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), Tommy (Jonathan Tucker), and John (Geoff Wigdor), are carefree growing in the close-knit, although crime ridden, community. The boy's closest guardians are Father Bobby (Robert De Niro), a caring priest, and the urban crime lord King Benny (Vittorio Gassman). Shakes, John, Michael and Tommy spend most of their days playing tricks on local pedestrians.One day, after the four teens attempt to steal a hot dog from a cart, they endeavor an escape plan after the salesman does not give in to their scheme. The plan is to place the hot dog cart over a public staircase and balance it so the salesman must retrieve instead of chasing them. However, the kids lose control of the cart and it tumbles down the staircase crushing a man at the bottom. They are charged with reckless endangerment and sent to one year at the Wilkinson Home for boys."Sleepers" contains a perfect setup, one that develops the time period, characters, setting, and intentions in a clear and effective manor. The film also carries a strong, focused narrative point of view through the Shakes character; we witness all the key events through his eyes. Each featured scene propels the story forward. If the continuing movie sustained the momentum built in the first act it would have been superior.At the Wilkinson Home for boys, Tommy, John, Shakes, and Michael must endure sadism and cruelty through torturous and pedophilic guards, who subject the kids to beatings and homosexual raping. Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon), is the most notorious and serves as a plot point later that propels us in a completely new series of events.The movie skips twenty years into the lives of the teens. Characters and situations drift in and out of focus depending where Shakes stands in his life. The teens are grownup, and their personalities have greatly changed. John (Ron Eldard), and Tommy (Billy Crudup), are two murderous thugs who come upon Nokes one day, and I will not reveal what happens. Michael (Brad Pitt), is a local prosecutor who faces the weak attorney Danny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman)in a court case. Shakes (Jason Patric) is a reporter who continues to share an interest in one of his childhood friends, Carol Martinez (Minnie Driver), who was abandoned when Wilkinson came into the picture.The film's scenes are descriptive, but not exploiting. Take a rape scene for instance. In Wilkinson, Nokes sexually assaults the four boys. During the scene, however, we witness no mechanical sex, but the creation of horrific memories and truthful hate. Such sequences assemble a challenging motion picture, containing brutal moods but careful writing structure. Scenes build momentum through sharp, smart and engaging dialogue. Such screen writing draws the audience in, structuring narrative drive for upcoming occurrences.The cast and filmmaking crew consist of so many well known and enormously talented individuals, screening the production is almost intimidating. Such individuals are Jason Patric, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon, Minnie Driver and Barry Levinson. The performances are absolutely riveting, taut, and powerful. Each cast member contributes a tantalizing, dramatic performance defining the outward appeal of "Sleepers."Also first rate is the style, constructed in a mesmerizing fashion. This atmosphere brought to life here kept me intrigued until the very last scene. The soundtrack defines the film's culture in itself. Inspirational tones and favorably known numbers successfully help develop the mood to "Sleepers."Writer and directed Barry Levinson takes a long time to develop a firm objective for the characters to meet. When there is finally a motive behind the great filmmaking, the achievements are understandable but are not necessarily empathetic. Of course, a movie such as "Sleepers" can not travel through a controversial subject without resisting the temptation to take a hit at organized religion. The Robert DeNiro character is a priest, who is willing to lie under oath for human garbage. What is that saying about Catholics?Overall, the dramatic purpose and conflict are not nearly clear enough. Is this a childhood thriller, a prison cruelty production, a film about friendships, murder, or lying? I think it is a movie about all of those things. "Sleepers" is a well-constructed picture with too many characters, situations, and different stories to succeed beyond anything but satisfactory. Barry Levinson has created a haunting, powerful piece cinema-haunting us because of its great start, but also because the potential greatness it deprives us from."Sleepers" is a production brought to you by Warner Bros.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers was one of the best movies I have ever seen.The strongest scenes which were very moving were when the four boys were at the Wilkinson school.This exposes us to the kinds of possibility that can happen at reform schools, although I doubt it ever occurs.To me the abuser got back what he needed, and he got it good.It was not the best way for revenge, I agree. But if we were one of the four boys, if we were one of them who got beaten up, lashed at, tortured and molested, we would have done the same thing. We would, believe me, we would.Look at the scene of the football game which the boys won. The next thing we know, four of them are locked in cells bleeding to death, and another boy is dead.Do kids like them deserve to be treated like that, like dirt? Do they deserve to eat food from the floor, to be tormented to their very souls?No.The Ralph guy was a good one. He deserved not to be killed. He swore at the stand, he remembered what he had did and he told the truth.Sleepers is the kind of movie that makes you think. Really think about what you do and what's going to happen after you do it.I rate this movie a high 10. The best for the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monstrous Crimes, Revenge &amp; Street Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Individuals who physically and sexually abuse children in their care are so vile, callous and cruel that they deserve to be punished harshly for their monstrous crimes. In "Sleepers" however this punishment is delivered in a way that falls outside the provisions of the criminal justice system for reasons that are perfectly understandable (though morally questionable) because the actions taken reflect the values of the victims who were brought up in a tight-knit neighbourhood where lessons about the importance of revenge and street justice were learnt at an early age.Four boys who live in New York City's Hell's Kitchen in the 1960s are close friends and recognise that the two most important people in their neighbourhood are local mob boss King Benny (Vittorio Gassman) and Father Bobby Carillo (Robert De Niro) the Catholic priest. The boys run errands for King Benny who some years earlier had taken revenge on a man who knocked out some of his teeth by shooting him in the legs whilst he was taking a bath. The boys also learn that crimes against the neighbourhood are not tolerated and see an example of this when a drug dealer from another neighbourhood who'd been selling heroin to kids, is hung from a local street lamp for his crime. Father Carillo is a man with a chequered past who tries to steer the boys away from trouble and teaches them good values.The boys are high-spirited and have great fun sunbathing and playing basketball but all this changes suddenly when they take a hot dog vendor's cart and accidentally let it roll down some subway steps. A man at the bottom of the steps is seriously injured and the boys are found guilty of reckless endangerment and sentenced to serve time at a reform school where they're repeatedly tortured, beaten and sexually abused by a group of sadistic guards led by Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon).Many years later (in the early 1980s), two of the boys, Tommy (Billy Crudup) and John (Ron Eldard) who have grown up to be hardened criminals, are in a bar when they see Nokes in an adjoining restaurant and shoot him in front of four witnesses. They're later arrested and charged with their abuser's murder. Their other two boyhood friends "Shakes" (Jason Patric), who's now a newspaper reporter and Michael (Brad Pitt), an assistant District Attorney, then conspire to get Tommy and John found "not guilty" of the murder and the methods that they use involve Michael, who prosecutes the case, deliberately trying to lose it, Father Carillo being asked to perjure himself under oath and the whole process being manipulated to ensure that details of the abuse that went on at the reform school are fully exposed.Despite its rather lengthy running time and its distressing subject matter, "Sleepers" never drags because it's particularly well paced and very effective in showing how the four originally happy and carefree boys transform into the haunted men that they eventually become. The nightmare that they go through in the reform school is especially harrowing and very well conveyed and the behaviour that they display after their ordeal is also extremely convincing and tragic."Sleepers" is a character-heavy drama and the acting by its top class cast is excellent throughout. The outstanding performances, however, come from Robert De Niro who makes his character very believable as he copes with his crisis of conscience, Dustin Hoffman who acts as the alcoholic, drug addicted defence lawyer who's hired by King Benny and Kevin Bacon who's very threatening as the despicable Sean Nokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously a worthwhile story enacted by a fantastic cast...but still not an easy film to like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Barry Levinson also adapted Lorenzo Carcaterra's allegedly factual memoir about four rambunctious boys from Hell's Kitchen on the west-end of Manhattan in the late 1950s. The youngsters are incarcerated into a boys' detention home for 18 months after a prank on a hot dog vendor goes horribly wrong; there, they are molested regularly by a group of guards, and twenty years later two of the kids--now hell-raising adults--get their revenge by shooting the most vicious guard to death in a restaurant. The way the plot plays out, with a genuinely original take on the whole courtroom procedure, is rather brilliant...yet, on the other hand, the details of this story make the film difficult to wade through, and Levinson's style (flashing back to the attacks in blue-tinted staccato takes) is off-putting. Worse, Levinson's dialogue is occasionally thick with writer's ink--no actor could make it sound convincing--while short-cut tricks such as the use of narration over important footage falls flat. Imagine this story as told by a stronger filmmaker, say Martin Scorsese. "Sleepers" is too locked-in as being a 'prestigious epic'; somehow, the sweep of the narrative never catches fire, and it's never as moving as it is meant to be. There are still several very good sequences here nevertheless, and many of the actors (particularly Dustin Hoffman as an untried defense lawyer and Robert De Niro as a buddy priest) are excellent. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a prank with a hot dog vendors cart goes horribly wrong, four young friends from New York's Hell's Kitchen district are sentenced to serve time at the Wilkinson Home For Boys. There, the boys will be part of, and witness, some of the most dreadful things that man can do to a minor. These traumatic events change the boys and their friendship forever, notably in 1981 when the four of them are pulled back together as the sleeping ghosts from their past are awakened.Sleepers is directed by Barry Levinson and boasts an all star cast to tell its three tiered story. In the adult section are Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Ron Eldard, Robert DeNiro, Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman &amp; Jeffrey Donovan. For the children read Joseph Perrino, Brad Renfro, Jonathan Tucker, Geoffrey Wigdor &amp; Monica Polito. John Williams scores the music and Michael Ballhaus photographs it. Based on the novel written by Lorenzo Carcaterra (here played by Perrino &amp; Patric), who unremittingly states that the story is based on true incidents, Sleepers has however been renounced by both the New York correctional authorities and the Manhattan District Attorney's office as being a work of fiction. The film does show pre end credits title cards stating both parties stance on the matter.Lets take it at face value, and hey lets face it we all hope the events featured in the film are not fact, and judge the film as a piece of cinema. If perhaps a touch too long at almost two and a half hours, Sleepers remains an emotionally uncomfortable, compelling, yet absorbing, piece of cinema. One that's given a top quality production by Levinson and his cast. The film plays out over three parts, the first is the boys being boys in and around Hell's Kitchen, their friendship solidifying by the day as they swim in the local drink, bask in the sun together and generally prank around. The second follows their dreadful time at the Wilkinson Facility. The third then switches to court room drama where the film reaches its most controversial point. It's wonderfully structured by Levinson and in spite of the lengthy running time, there's no filler scenes, no waste. We could have done with more flesh on Minnie Driver's character, she's a link to the boys and men, but really the film could have survived without her given the writing of her just makes it seem like a token offering. But that aside, all is relevant as the film steadily walks towards its moral dilemma heart.Since moral dilemma's always prove divisive, it's a bit like stating the obvious that Sleepers, with its plot, will be just that. However, what ever side of the fence you sit on, and if you even believe Carcaterra's fanciful/fantastical/fateful (delete where applicable) tale in the first place, there's no denying that the director has weaved together a fine movie that carries real narrative depth. With rich layers that are aided by Ballhaus' photography, it's painted evocative at first, then dimly bleak in the middle and finally oak panelled neutrality takes over for the final reel. While Levinson should be applauded for how he handles the abuse scenes at Wilkinson's, very discreet whilst firmly putting in our minds the horrors unfolding. To fully appreciate the movie one feels you may have to not let the troubling sub-text gnaw away at you.As this is an ensemble piece it's no surprise to find that the acting varies. With the two big hitters being DeNiro &amp; Hoffman it may disappoint fans to know that they really are support roles only. However, DeNiro as the smoking, basketball playing, father figure priest impacts greatly and turns out to be the crucial character. Hoffman's performance as a washed up lawyer hired by the mob to just say his lines, has come in for some criticism, notably for the audible quality as he mumbles thru his sequences. I think it should be put into context that he is playing an alcoholic forced to be dry during the trial! Pitt, Patric, Crudup and Eldard are OK, nothing ground shaking, just playing it safe with the right amount of emotional pathos. While Driver makes the most of what little she is given. The standout adult turn comes from Kevin Bacon as sadistic guard Sean Nokes. Weasle like and devoid of human compassion, it's a monster for all the ages courtesy of Bacon at his best. The male child actors all come up trumps, especially Renfro and Perrino, as they build the emotional connection in that first hour where playfulness gives way to horror and their youth is destroyed.With touchy subjects throughout and an improbable legal based last third, Sleepers is not going to be for everyone. But it deserves to be seen at least, and just maybe you will become one of the film's fans come the end credits? 9/10</fullReview>

Evidently, the first half of the film may prove to be more interesting than the second half because that is where the main plot of the story lies. The scenes leave little to the imagination, and this I respect. The film has me crying each time I watch it! Even the second half of the film that people are seeming to dismiss so much. The second half of the film sees justice being served the way it should. Along with the actors involved giving the film the justice it deserves.

		<shortDescription>Sleepers: A good movie overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie, Sleepers, the other day, and although I kind of expected a gangster action film I was gladly surprised that it was a drama movie. the movie tells the story of four childhood friends who did a bad thing that landed them in trouble.... not knowing that that bad action will change all of their life forever.... I like this movie because it has many morales and themes underlying it. A few examples just to name a few are friendship: what one is willing to do for their friends, revenge, and another one is that saying what goes around comes around. Also I have to say the actors make the movie shine: especially dusty Hoffman, Robert De Niro, and Brad Pitt, the movie is just a good movie overall. Its a must watch for any drama movies fan and anyone that actually likes to learn a little lessons of life now and then from their movies. I am one of those and thats why I appreciate that movies like this are made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fact or fiction, it is a profoundly beautiful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLEEPERS remains one of my favorite movies. It is one of the rare movies that has an all star cast made up of the better actors in Hollywood, Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman among the many. SPOILERS POSSIBLE...SLEEPERS is based on the 1995 book by Lorenzo Carcaterra, and claims to be a true story about Carcaterra's boyhood in Hell's Kitchen, NYC. I've read the book and this movie, while nowhere near as thorough as the book, is pretty faithful an adaptation. After all, the limit anyone wants to sit in a theatre or in front of the TV is about 3 hours max.When the book and the film begin, you believe it's just a slice-of-life portrait about youth in Hell's Kitchen. Four boys, toughing it together, being as happy as they know how to be in the rough but close-knit and fiercely loyal neighborhood, in which ruthless mobsters who kill for a living are as good to them (or better sometimes) as their own parents are. The neighborhood is run by King Benny (the charming Italian actor Vittorio Gassman), a mobster as ruthless as any you will meet on film, yet as kind and generous to the kids as the most gently bred...well, gentleman. The four boys, Shakes (Joe Perrino), Tommy (Jonathan Tucker), Michael (Brad Renfro) and John (Geoff Wigdor), work for King Benny, leading lives that are at once innocent and not so innocent, laundering his money in the streets. The boys' favorite role model, the priest Father Bobby (DeNiro) disapproves of their path in life and tries every chance he gets to steer them straight. To his relief, John wants to be a priest and Shakes (the nickname for Lorenzo Carcaterra) likes to help out as an alter boy. Michael is distant and hard to touch; Tommy is lost and Father Bobby is the only person in their lives who can make a difference.The semi-uneventful lives of these four street kids are changed forever when a prank involving a hot dog cart results in a man being seriously injured. The boys are arrested and convicted of theft, and sent to a reform school for boys in upstate New York. To make a long story short, the boys live there for a year, and endure physical, emotional and sexual abuse in the hands of four sadistic guards (one played to the hilt by Kevin Bacon). Here, the story really sucks you in. You've already come to know the four boys, and you care about them. Now you know that criminals are often born, but they are often made too. The four young actors who play the childhood friends are superb, so that it is difficult to watch some of the scenes of violence. (The book is much more graphic, and thankfully, we don't have to see the gory details in the movie.) However, one cannot escape the ghastly sights of bruises, welts, lacerations, eyes swollen shut, etc. This film is not for anyone who has a problem with films dealing with child abuse.The older actors are great too, not any better or worse than the younger ones. I think everyone who was in this film did an excellent acting job. There were a lot of "showcase" scenes for each actor, which brought to light each young man's feelings and reactions to the memories that remained with them all their lives. I thought it was terrific how Ron Eldard looks a lot like Geoff Wigdor. Billy Crudup as Tommy was great. Eldard and Crudup were wonderful in the confrontation scene with Bacon in the pub. Brad Pitt was pretty impressive as Michael. His scene with Minnie Driver in the subway was very poignant. Jason Patric, who I usually think does boring films, was surprisingly effective as the older Shakes, the narrator who brings to life the perspectives of four friends who have suffered and survived the worst ordeals that children face. I really thought his scene praying in the church while remembering being assaulted with a guard's baton was powerfully played out.The revenge plot is pretty complex if you don't follow it carefully. Whether this part of Caraterra's story is fact or fiction (sometimes I think he might have created this to give himself a sense of retribution because of what DID happen), it is an unforgettable and unexpected plot that worked like a charm.A very dark, unrelentingly bleak portrait of lost innocence, SLEEPERS is really an excellent film with a cast that shines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What really happens in a reformatory?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is allegedly based on an actual event, although the state of New York denies it. So be it. I've watched it two or three times. The realism of the story makes it believable. That youths can be brutalized, sodomized, and tortured when in the care of adults, reference the recent catholic church debacle with its sexual deviates, is a fact without argument. The actors all played their parts extremely well making it easy to follow the action and understand what was going on. The youths did wrong, no doubt, with a prank that got out of hand. If you don't get angry at the criminal justice system where the handling of mischievous young boys are concerned, then you most likely don't understand what the tale is about. None deserved what they were subjected to. It was of some comfort that there was a degree of retribution in the end and that those who perpetrated the vileness on them was revealed. Definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful and disturbing drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Discounting the rather dubious claim to be a true story (what with potential perjury and perverting the course of justice charges to be aimed at the protaganists) this drama gets your attention with a strong plot, a good cast and evocative visuals. Most of the big stars only appear in short scenes, so it isn't a vehicle for any particular ego, although DeNiro dominates the film with his portrayal of the priest. In some respect the plot does suffer from dilution of characters - the choice of "Shakes" as the pivitol character certainly marginalised the others - and this stops it from being a "great" movie. However it's a "good" movie, and in a Hollywood dominated by ridiculous plots and special effects that's no bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most devastating movie I have ever seen. It was beautiful and all the boys were beautiful in their anguish. You could see the pain in their eyes even when they were grown. They suffered for so long but they came out of it stronger than before and made the guards pay for what they did. What they took away. They never got back what was taken away but they got a little bit of closure. The ending is so sad but that just makes the movie more tragic and beautiful. Its not one of those movies that you wish was different in any way. The casting was impeccable and Robert De Niro was wonderful - as always. I cried first when Sean Nokes says "I want a blow job." They were just little boys. How could he do something like that? I want to be a director and I idolize movies like this. I just hope that someday I can impact people the same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardly convincing tale of revenge that was based on the book by Lorenzo Carcaterra of how two childhood friends, one is a district attorney (Brad Pitt) and the other (Jason Patric) who works at the New York Post when they decide help two others childhood pals of theirs (Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup), now hoodlums who are accused of savagely shooting a former guard (Kevin Bacon), who had tortured the trio several years ago at a boys' home.I had the misfortune of watching this movie as a sophomore in high school and how it irritated (and absolutely offended) me hasn't left my mind. The scenes at the boys' home weren't only difficult to watch, but pain-staking especially what happened at night.If there's one bright spot that manages to rise above the mess of a badly organized movie, it's the performances given by Patric, Robert De Niro, Minnie Driver, and the late Vittorio Gassman that make the film somewhat watch-able.What "Sleepers" resembles here isn't only a waste of great cast and director Barry Levinson, but simply a terrible waste of time.For anyone who was insulted by this movie's weak attempt as a revenge part dramatic thriller, try "In the Name of the Father", "The Shawshank Redemption", or "Escape from Alcatraz".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And so long? This movie had a lot of potential. In fact, rarely have I seen a film with as much potential, and as good a cast and director, miss the mark by so much. This movie is long, drawn out, full of plot holes (too many to mention), and uneven in both content and pacing. I've seen sci-fi flicks that bend the laws of the universe less than Sleepers. (At least they picked the right name -- it could easily be used in place of sleeping pills for life-long insomniacs.) What were Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Robert De Niro, and Barry Levinson thinking? Heck...it didn't even have the usual formulaic feel good moral triumph at the end -- you know, just before the credits roll, when the words appear on the screen to frame and solidify the moral victory we're supposed to feel, leaving the viewer with the satisfaction of knowing that what we just witnessed actually made a difference somehow. Quite the opposite, in fact. After sitting through almost 2 1/2 hours one is greeted by official statements indicating that this entire presentation might very well be nothing but the ramblings of a troubled mind. This movie doesn't just deal with the subject of torture; it IS torture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controversial Film Remains Somewhat Powerful Despite Credibility Issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a strong memory of first viewing Barry Levinson's film of Lorenzo Carcaterra's controversial novel, which the author insisted was autobiographical, despite detractors who have challenged his claim. Regardless, the story of four childhood friends who pull a foolish stunt that changes their lives forever, remains emotionally powerful for the most part, and certainly there's no denying that situations like have happened and will likely continue to happen. The film loses credibility in the second half, but the impression it leaves will stay with you.The story opens in the 1960s in New York's Hell's Kitchen, which is masterfully re-created. Neighborhood pals Shakes (Joe Perrino), Michael (the tragic Brad Renfro), John (Geoffrey Wigdor) and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) grow up together in a world that is an odd mix of childhood innocence, religion and organized crime. Their ally is Father Robert "Bobby" Carillo (Robert De Niro, who else?) who tries to guide them and encourage them to see beyond Hell's Kitchen. An enjoyable oldies soundtrack adds to the spirit of the story until things change for the worse for the young protagonists. A prank goes terribly wrong, critically injuring an innocent bystander and the boys find themselves sentenced to do time at the Wilkinson's Home For Boys, a juvenile institution where dangerous offenders are housed. Shakes, Michael, John and Tommy find the grimness of the institution difficult, but that does little to prepare them for the nightmare they end up enduring at the hands of sadistic guards, lead by Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon, in another villainous turn), and it's easy to despise him and the other guards (played by Terry Kinney, Jeffrey Donovan and Lenny Loftkin respectively) for their brutality towards these vulnerable adolescents. Sexual abuse is implied but not shown graphically, but the disturbing sounds of screaming and the broken looks on the faces of the boys more than gets the point across. I'm always somewhat surprised that many reviews overlook just how effective the child actors are, and how they essentially carry the first half of the film. They are all extremely natural, their rapport is believable, and they convey much more with facial expressions than any dialogue. Brad Renfro's performance is especially poignant in retrospect, not only due to his tragically early death but the strong likelihood that he was victimized himself in real life. It adds a more disturbing and touching aspect to the viewing experience.Fast forward to 1981, and John (now played by Ron Eldard) and Tommy (now portrayed by Billy Crudup, in his film debut) have become hardened criminals and one night they come across Sean Nokes by chance in a pub. They take this opportunity to exact revenge, and both Eldard and Crudup give powerhouse performances. Unfortunately, after that, they take a backseat until the film's conclusion. The same can be said for Minnie Driver, who plays the adult Carol Martinez, who was a companion to the young men in the past and still cares deeply for them. Michael (Brad Pitt in the adult role) and Shakes (Jason Patric, who also provides voice-over narration) are both portrayed by competent actors, but their performances are uneven; at times they seem emotionally invested and other times they just seem to be going through the motions. Michael is now a prosecutor and he uses the case as a way to get revenge in his own way, and to do his best to make sure that his friends are acquitted. But will he be able to pull it off? Robert De Niro remains the constant throughout as the priest who will do anything for his boys, while Dustin Hoffman as defense attorney Danny Snyder has little more than a cameo. Bruno Kirby and Vittorio Gassman give respectable supporting turns, but the film belongs to the child actors, De Niro and to a lesser extent Eldard and Crudup. In some ways, "Sleepers" suffers the same fate as similarly flashback-driven movies such as "Stephen King's It" (1990) and "Now And Then" (1995), where the adult actors aren't nearly as compelling as their child counterparts, despite the talent involved.The questions raised here are valid and worth examining. Surely the trauma of abuse, particularly sexual abuse is extremely damaging and soul-destroying, but is it ever acceptable to take the law into one's own hands? Is vigilante justice the answer or does violence simply beget more violence and bloodshed?True story or not, this is an issue that needs to be addressed on both counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful psychological drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought by reading the summary on IMDb that it would have been another De Niro Hit like and his character would be like Max Cady or Johnny Boy. But he was not the central character in this flick by Barry Levinson nor the film was anything like Cape fear or Mean Streets but It is, indeed, a powerful drama which happens to be a true story. The Sleepers starts as a coming-of-age film and then take over from there. 4 kids/friends pull off a prank which goes wrong and they end up in juvie. Which among them would have expected the horrors to come which would change their lives. A crooked child-molesting guard Nokes, played by Bacon, abuses them along with his associates. As a result, when they get out, Tommy and John who have became street thugs kill Nokes years after they accidentally see him in a pub situated in their home town Hell's Kitchen. Michael (Brad Pitt) who is now a lawyer takes the prosecution in order to lose and reveal what the guards did to them back in Wilkinson Home the juvie, Which they succeed in by getting father-like Father Bobby (De Niro) to testify/lie for John and Tommy, After Shakes tells him the whole story which they had never told anybody.Hoffman, who played the defendants lawyer, acted in an outstanding way. You can see that when you watch him asking questions. De Niro, too, is as excellent as always. Every kid actor also play his character beautifully. This film by Levinson is even more thoughtful than Rainman. It's a blend of Comedy, Crime, Drama, Thriller and tragedy as well. Which certainly makes it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepers (1996): Dir: Barry Levinson / Cast: Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Dustin Hoffman: What the title represents is beyond me but the story regards four boys who are sentenced to the Wilkinson Home for Boys after a prank goes seriously wrong. They undergo years of brutal and sexual abuse by the head guard. They have one friend, a Priest who visits them. When released they encounter the guard again and take a murderous revenge. Catchy setup results in an ending that is wrong regardless of the arguments. Director Barry Levinson creates realism and insight just as he achieved with Rain Man and Diner. Robert De Niro is superb as a Priest placed in a difficult position but that is what opens for a corrupt ending. Kevin Bacon is excellent as the abusive guard who discovers karma in his future. Brad Pitt and Jason Patric portray the victims who pulled the wrong prank and suffer to extremes. Dustin Hoffman steals scenes as the opposing lawyer who may have an issue with his eyes. Viewers can definitely sympathize with both individuals but the film's willingness to take its eye for an eye justice as it does, just doesn't present much faith in any justice system. It addresses sins and the consequences that drive us to commit certain decisions. It is a dark and unpleasant film based on dark and unpleasant circumstances. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SleepersThe 1996 film was based on a novel written by Lorenzo Carcaterra and inspired by a true story. It was a picture that had a frequent amount of love and passion. I loved the nature in the characters even though some were shown for a brief moment. It was because you could acknowledge them already. The picture had a beautiful composed sinister, heart-warming soundtrack by John Williams. The Barry Levinson picture had a lot of themes, for an example; friendship, Italian/Irish catholic culture, childhood and the elements of the mind. The friendship that the four main characters had was deep. They were like brothers because of the love they had for each other. Kevin Bacon played his role brilliantly. I had forgotten that he was acting in the movie. He played as a prison guard who was a hard-core child molester. His performance was full of passion. The plot is basically about four friends who are like brothers who are sent to a juvenile detention centre in the 1960s for felony. But when the boys are in prison they get molested by guards. 13 years later they group together like a family and plot revenge on those who abused them and rotten away their childhood innocence. I loved the Manhattan landscape. It was a great substance to the film. There were times when I had sympathy for the main characters because of the abuse they had experience. I can understand that some of them are corrupted. Two of the friends are members of a mafia, 1 is a journalist and the other is a lawyer who keeps on defending his mob friends in cought. I thought the costume and production/costume designing was quite modern. the cinematography mostly had a cold temperature colour so that it could expose a gloomy tone. I give the a 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you don't forget. At least I didn't. When I sat down to re-watch it in 2013, I remembered how powerful it was when I saw it at the theater nearly 20 years earlier.You begin with a remarkable story, claimed by the author to be based on true events in his own life. Four childhood friends pull a prank that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. They are sent to reform school where there are repeatedly sexually and emotionally abused by several guards. We then fast-forward to when the boys are adults. One has become a lawyer, another has a low-level job at a newspaper, and the other two have become thugs. The thugs run into one of the guards at a bar and shoot him to death. Then the lawyer plots to get revenge against the other guards in the courtroom trial of the two thugs.And then you have a stellar cast. The child actors who portray the boys are flawless. Other key actors in key roles include Jason Patric (as one of the boys grown up), Minnie Driver as a friend of the boys since they were kids, Robert De Niro as the priest, Kevin Bacon as the main abusive guard, Jeffrey Donovan as another of the abusive guards, Terry Kinney as another of the abusive guards, Vittorio Gassman as a sort of godfather-like figure, and Dustin Hoffman as a broken down defense attorney.Ironically, the weakest performance in the film is by one of my favorite actors -- Brad Pitt. He's not at all convincing as a prosecuting attorney. And was he trying to talk like Marlon Brando??? And this was in the midst of what I consider to be Brad's finest period of acting. I can't explain it...but for me, his performance here just doesn't work. But we can still savor his other films from this time period, several of which are brilliant.Again, this is a powerful film with an absorbing story and generally fine acting. You'll note at the end that the "real" story is assessed from the point of view of the author and the authorities. Very interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie, I don't even know where to start. This movie is so touching and intriguing I could watch it every day and it would never get old. The movie has a great display of what it was like to live in hell's kitchen as a child. Then it shows horrible abuse and torture. The sad truth is that stuff happens all over the country in reform schools and not in them. It was a very tough place for the boys to live. Even thought they did commit a serious crime that punishment was not deserved at all. Then the great climax of the bar scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in all of movies. Then a courtroom drama that will want to make you cry making one of the boy's torturers admit the horrible truth. Then the touching scene which I won't go in to too much detail but the testimony of father Robert Carrillo. The whole movie is unbelievable and everybody played there roles great. Kevin Bacon was very convincing of the pedophile reform school guard. Robert De Niro played a big role and played it well. Although Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Patric didn't play in the movie long it was long enough to show the great acting they all can perform. This movie was an excellent drama and more than worth giving it a try. With this all star cast, great plot, and great acting I am shocked this does not get more credit.

		<shortDescription>Overall, an incredible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the biggest reason this movie is so underrated is because it was claimed to have been based on a true story. Whether or not it was (and I personally have my doubts, especially after reading the book), don't let that distract you from the movie. Most of the movies we watch aren't based on a true story; even if they are, most embellish, or outright lie anyways. So put the 'based on a true story' part out of your mind before watching this.Overall, this was a gritty, emotional type movie. My first thought upon seeing some of the big names in this was, 'another movie with the names, but no meat'. I was so, so wrong. All of the actors did amazing in this, including the younger actors. I read a lot of reviews saying how great Robert De Niro did, but I personally thought the best actor was Ron Eldard, who plays the adult John Reilly. The scene where -as an adult- he meets his childhood abuser was so real it was almost painful. You can almost physically see him go from tough street punk to a scared little boy again, almost instantly. Also, Billy Crudup did an exceptional job as an adult Tommy. Brad Pitt's acting was... credible, but I wouldn't say it was anything other than passing grade. Jason Patric's was by far the worst of the film.The abuse scenes were (for the most part) tastefully done, to where we know whats happening, but it's not turned into a porno, as are many of your modern movies about childhood sexual abuse. The end scene of them laughing around the table, interspersed with the horrific photos, and sad endings, was very moving, to the point where I was almost in tears.While I'll admit, it all did play out a little to neatly (with everyone of the guards getting their just desserts), over all, this was yet another amazing movie to come out of the nineties, that somehow got brushed under the rug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accomplished and thoroughly worthwhile character piece looking at the confronting of past tragedies and the moral shredding search for justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers is a covering of four characters from their childhoods into their adolescent years and then into adulthood, but not in the way director Barry Levinson would initially have us believe. Six years after the weighty gangster flick Goodfellas arrived came Sleepers, a film deceptive in its beginning with an adult's reflective voice-over, nostalgically looking back on he and his friends' childhood years in New York around about the setting of Goodfellas' opening act. Like said film, the boys here are of an Italian-American ilk and the presence of actor Robert De Niro is additionally apparent. For the early part, Sleepers covers these young kids out and about doing what they do: they spend most of their days aged eleven or so in 1960s New York, we observe them living a life in which playing basketball; thieving their way through mealtimes and just lazing around on roofs of buildings in the sweltering sun is the norm. The sense of them being on the precipice of something big, something important coming to resonate as they get involved and mingle with those in and around their locale. One kid runs the odd job for a local gangster, and with the presence of Goodfellas looming over everything, the film loosely pertains to head off into that direction as De Niro's priest character offers a more theological route. Most of it is smoke and mirrors, with where it eventually heads off to a far darker; far bleaker place than we might've first imagined.By the time it's been there and come back, Sleepers has come to resemble a really intimate, really rather engaging character drama covering various incarnations of the item of revenge as well as how hate and wrong doing can lead only to further hate and wrong doing unto others. The systematically forcing of people not entirely linked to the initial event to operate outside of a moral comfort zone is additionally explored. The film's story is told to us by Lorenzo Carcaterra, nicknamed "Shakes", and played separately by both Joseph Perrino and Jason Patric, respectively, in a younger and older guise. The film's opening act sees he and his three friends in Tommy Marcano (Tucker/Crudup) Michael Sullivan (Renfro/Pitt) and John Reilly (Wigdor/Eldard) play and mingle in and around the Hell's Kitchen many moons ago until a tragic accident involving the stealing of a hot dog stand leads to the near-death of a bystander. The children are tried and acquitted for what they did before being banished to a home for juvenile offenders, of which a stretch of time inside will come to affect the lives of several people; predominantly down to the fact those that run the place are what they are.Lorenzo appears to mature a little purely upon arrival to the jail, delivering to his dear friend De Niro the priest requests in a manner that is far more eloquent than anything said up to this point; those being to "watch over his parents" as they're "on the brink of killing each other" and that, whatever happens, inform them that "everything is always going well". The foolhardy approach so as to prematurely bury whatever truths might arise and to keep everything under a constant wrap is one of several realities Lorenzo comes to realise; a number of prison guards at this establishment coming to form a collection of men with a sexual appetite for young boys, the ringleader of whom is Kevin Bacon's frighteningly smarmy and disturbingly seedy chief guard Sean Nokes. As Vietnam rages abroad, corruption and sleaze rages domestically within the system designed to place people on the straight and narrow.Sleepers comes to cover the item of a person's coming of age in the harshest possible manner, a really effective and well observed film additionally looking at death and the coming to terms with it when one is responsible for it; a well constructed film merging from one thing to another and then onto something else. The film will mutate into a case study of characters identifying a problem or a previously buried tragedy within one's life as well as the unearthing of it before coming to deal with it. As each of the kids' sentences comes to run out, and they grow up into adults, the horrors they went through as children manoeuvre them down various routes in life; the confronting of such events from days of old rearing its head when certain chance encounters leads to an act of vengeance. But simplistic revenge fantasies are not on Levinson's agenda. We do indeed believe the man in charge is capable of constructing an effective enough sequence in which the finding and cold-blooded killing of particular people is played out; the use of lens filters, shot composition, diegetic music and general atmosphere are combined flawlessly for an intense sequence inside the restaurant area of a New York bar, thrusting the film into its final act, although it isn't all that the text is capable of. As both Michael the elder and exactly what it is his profession entails make themselves known, a plan for a more justifiable means of revenge with its own moral flaws makes itself known.The film is peppered with a string of fine performances, De Niro's priest Father Bobby a presence lingering over proceedings like the aforementioned Goodfellas presence does, deceptively, for the early part. Away from all the acting De Niro provides us here, one of the more extraordinary scenes has his face fill the screen as truths are laid out to him and he just sits there and reacts through his facial expression to the camera. Dustin Hoffman enters proceedings as a rough and bedraggled lawyer central to the four protagonist's plan; his ability at what he does within the field he operates and what's at stake nestling in effectively with the immense journey of pain and post traumatic stress these four men have gone through. Sleepers is an involving and dramatic piece that's certainly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time of the film's release, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the film. To be more specific, the author of the book that served as the basis for the film, Lorenzo Carcaterra, claimed that this is based on a true story. However, there are no court records in New York that support his claims. Whether or not "Sleepers" is a trues story is beside the point. "Sleepers" is a truly gripping film.1960's. Hell's Kitchen, New York City. Four friends, Lorenzo "Shakes" Carcaterra (Joeseph Perrino), Michael Sullivan (the late great Brad Renfro), John Reilly (Geoffrey Wigdor) and Tommy Marcano (Jonathan Tucker) are normal teenagers on the brink of adolescence. Hell's Kitchen is ruled by two forces, the Catholic Church, represented by Father Bobby (Robert DeNiro) and the mob, headed by King Benny (Vittorio Gassman). The four friends have a penchant for pranks, and after one prank goes wrong, they are sent to the Wilkinson's School For Boys. There, they are subjected to a year of unrelenting physical, psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of the guards, especially by a sadistic psychopath named Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). Years later, they finally have a chance for revenge.The cast is first rate. But with a cast that includes actors of such caliber, could we expect anything less? Based off his performance in "Speed 2," I wouldn't have thought that Jason Patric had any acting ability, but I was wrong. Here, he is excellent as Shakes, the man who is guiding us through this labyrinth plot. Brad Pitt is excellent as Michael, the brains behind this complex scheme. He can plan it out all he wants, but it all hangs by a thread that he does not control. Unfortunately, the two biggest players, Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro, let us down. Hoffman is wasted in what is largely a one-note performance, and DeNiro is unable to truly translate his conflicting feelings effectively. That's not entirely his fault (time constraints don't allow much time for this to be dealt with very thoroughly). Minnie Driver is good too, although her part is a little underwritten. The young actors are good as well. Though one may have trouble finding the physical resemblances between the young actors and their adult counterparts, the acting makes up for it.Barry Levinson is a rather big-name director, and he's a good filmmaker. He presents the material effectively, but there are some confusing moments, so the viewer must pay attention. He is good at establishing the setting, which is nice (although not necessarily key), and adds a little flavor to the film. However, there are a few plot holes here and there, and some questions that aren't effectively answered until long after they should be.True or not, this is a tremendously involving film, and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie should be on IMDb top 250</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I don't think that this is a real story because everything went to perfectly to be truth. But still this is a good story. At the beginning this movie reminded me some of Sicilian mafia movies, like Goodfelas or something like that. Then it became a prison drama and after that a court drama. This film was very clever made. I liked the direction and acting but it appeared to me that in some scenes the characters of the film were taking to easily everything whats going on to them (a good example would be that rape scene, it didn't seemed that those kids were trying to resist them). Anyways the movie is great and deserves to be on the IMDb top 250.</fullReview>

The film is perfectly written and directed, always interesting, and entertaining, with amazing performances. I cant tell who was the best, whether it was the creepy Bacon as the antagonist, or Brad Pitt and Billy Crudup who were great as two of the boys after they have grown up, Robert DeNiro who has magnificent as the boys' long time friend and priest or Dustin Hoffman, the lawyer who defends them. Its a very underrated, drama, that i have seen several times and it never gets old.- IMDb Rating: 7.2. MY Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

They get sexually abused by several guards. When they get out, 2 of the 4 boys kill one of the guards(Kevin Bacon).This movie was wonderful yet surprising. The very beginning led me to believe the abuser would be the priest but as the plot got closer, I wasn't surprised it was the guards. This movie had wonderful acting and also a great plot. I would recommend it to anyone. I rate this a 10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is hard to judge as it is like three completely different films in one. The first part (before the prison)introducing the characters is OK - I would say typical for "Goodfellas"-like films. 6/10. The second (in the prison)is violent but quite good and promising. 7/10. The third one is The Spoiler. I suppose in the book (which I have not red) it is much better, but in the film it lacks logic and the performance is completely unconvincing. 4/10The only good points are: the young boys, Robert De Niro and Kevin Bacon.For anyone, except of lovers of Bacon and De Niro, it is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of loyalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The experience of loyalty in life is extremely rare. Perhaps that's why I liked this film so much and have watched it several times. Literature and film give us the loyalty scenarios we seldom experience in life.It's interesting how many films have been made about "brotherhood" and very few about women's loyalty in friendship. At the moment, Thelma and Louise is the only one that comes to mind that has a similar depth and tragedy as does Sleepers.The casting and sense of place and time are great. The pop and rock music made me think of myself and what I was doing at the time these events were supposed to be taking place. BTW, it doesn't matter a fig whether this was based on a true story or it's accuracy, blah, blah. The story is about loss of innocence, growing up in tough times, and child abuse. It's no accident that the two youngest boys grow up to be hardened criminals as a result of their experiences at the Wilkinson Home, while the two oldest having had more personality development do not resort to a life of crime although we can see the extent of damage to their lives.One of the best bits of casting was Vittorio Gassman. Who the heck thought of him after all his years away from "Hollywood"? His character provided some of the few bits of comic relief. So did the Puerto Rican "fat man". I also have to take my hat off to Kevin Bacon who doesn't seem to be afraid to be frequently cast as a heavy/criminal/pervert/psycho.The word revenge is used frequently but I still think this film is about LOYALTY. The sad thing was that the boys felt so shamed by what was done to them. Even though they discussed getting outside help they were still more concerned about people knowing. If they hadn't been, the combination of King Benny and Father Bobby would have proved even more formidable than it actually was. I like to think of those two KNOWINGLY working together to bring down everyone who was responsible for what happened at Wilkinson's. THAT would have been something to see. Maybe then John and Tommy would have turned out differently.I don't agree with those who criticize the narration. I think this is a wonderful device in films that is no longer used as much as it could be. Probably because "contemporary" viewers are too stupid to appreciate it like in Blade Runner where the narration gives us the feel of a 1940's detective film. Pretty soon movies will have no dialogue at all. Just "action" -- like endless episodes of Miami Vice and then I stop going to films altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good story, but slow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although you might think that since Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon and Jason Patrick are all stars of 'Sleepers', that it's going to be a sexy drama, you'd be wrong.If you thought that Kevin Bacon was a little creepy in 'The River Runs Wild', you haven't seen anything, yet.This film would have been so much better, if it hadn't been delivered the exact same way as a book (which is what it was based on). There are times in the film, where scenes and things that were said, didn't need to be shown or mentioned. It made the book, sorry, movie too long.However, that does not go without saying that the film was very well directed and very well casted. Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon in particular. Some of the other characters, in my opinion could have been played by just about anyone.Robert DeNiro, of course was well-suited considering that he hails from New York, and this is where the story takes place. A smoking, ex-con priest, is enough you need to know about his character, to know that he is almost perfect to fit the part.Brad Pitt, is a prosecuting attorney seeking revenge, and is hardly even in the film, to give him over title billing at the beginning of the picture.Dustin Hoffman, portrays a drunken, long-haired, casual defense attorney who has to be given notes to help him cross-examine witnesses. Who better to play this soft-spoken lush, than Hoffman? And finally my favorite, Kevin Bacon. A low-life, juvenile hall prison guard pediafile, who rapes and beats little to pre-teen boys in the late sixties. It's hard to see Bacon in such a role, considering that he usually does roles where he leaves you happy and cheerful because of his character. No, no, not in this movie.The story was unforgettable, but the premise and pace were just too slow, and it's hard to follow something good, when there are parts that just need to be left out.Definitely not something I would recommend to anyone under seventeen, it's hardcore and some of the scenes are a little graphic for those who have a weak stomach, when it comes to child-molestation, but otherwise it's an interesting courtroom drama, and I liked it well enough, that I might watch it again someday. Just, not any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was about four best friends who were there for each other regardless of the paths they each took in life. they were all raised in hell's kitchen in nyc and came from similar family backgrounds. they found solitude in books and each other. when a seemingly harmless prank goes very wrong, they are sentance to do time in a state correctional facility. words alone can not express the pain and humiliation they would each face, but they got through together and vowed to never speak of what happened within the walls of the institution. many years later, the paths of two of the boys and the head of the group of torturous guards from the correctional facility are crossed and it ends in a vengeful murder. now the boys/men are on trial for a murder against one of the men who abused them. another one of the four boys who went on to be a lawyer asked to be assigned to the prosecutors position in this case, against his friends. but it isnt a case of betrayl, because beneath the obvious deceit, there lies the hearts of the four best friends and their life long conquest to bring justice to the people who violated them and so many others and the institution that housed them. all in all, i loved the movie. i read the book first, as the movie is based on the book also titled sleepers. it is a true story, which i dont think that many people realize, and that only adds to the horror. i believe, that the movie stays as true to the book as you possibly can, it was practically the script already. the setting and supporting cast are all wonderful additions to the movie, which i rank near to the shawshank redemption. i highly recommend this movie to anyone, and i recommend the book even more.</fullReview>

I watched this movie for the first time in 8th grade and i bacame basicly obssessed with the plot of the story. Not the rapes and molesting ( im not a pervert). I loved how close of friends these guys were and how only one thing ruined there lives. It makes me cry everytime at the end when they flash back through there lives, and there walkign down the hall, and the author of this book ( true or not true) is a very good writer with very emotional words. It's a growing up story, showing how horrible thing can change these four boys forever. It just comes to show think before you act. I love this movie and to this day ive watched it a million times. Great acting, great actors, great plot, i love the court scenes-i give it 5 out of 5 stars.Side note. If you read the book, you might find out those boys had a lot more horrible things happen to them in Wilkerson Home for Boys. Alot worse. Some parts of the book might have been good for the movie though, pulled it a little more together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really harrowing movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers is a movie about a group of children who end up one day in borstal making up for accidentally injuring someone.While in borstal, they are brutally raped and tortured and they are powerless to say anything to anyone. The story soon moves on when two of them (now gangsters) murder one of the guards one night.All the friends are reunited and come with a plot to help them get away with it.Then they have to face the consequences.Sleepers is a harrowing movie which made me tremble and almost cry.The scenes were so horrific that I looked away.The movie uses so much impact that it is hard to watch.In the end it is a fact of life and happens everywhere and this is one way of expressing it.I rate 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most thoughtful films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all time number one film. Apart from a couple of scenes, the film stays to the dialogue and settings of the original book by Lorenzo Carcaterra. The cast is one of the best ever and the four boys who played the 4 main characters when they were children are excellent. Also, the support characters such as King Benny, Fat Mancho and Father Robert Carillo (played by De Niro) are first class. Those who say it is not true should read the book and those who say it is a bad film need treatment. One of the best things is the way Hells Kitchen is portrayed by both the book and film. The relatively unknown Jason Patric is superb and you will have to look a long way to find better performances from Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon. 10 out of 10 without a doubt!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far too much focus was put on the validity of Lorenzo Carcaterra's "non-fiction" claims, and far too little was put on the amazing story &amp; equally amazing performances by the actors in this movie. The story of "Sleepers" may or may not have happened to Carcaterra, but the fact remains that it has probably happened to someone. The themes of loyalty, revenge, and lost innocence run deep throughout the film, and the young boys, Brad Renfro &amp; Geoffrey Wigdor in particular, are all outstanding in their roles. Robert DeNiro and Kevin Bacon also shine, as usual.A few problems I found with the movie, was that certain events of the story were not throughly explained, as in the book. The second half of the movie doesn't have the same absorbing quality as the first, but it is substantial nonetheless. The climactic question of Father Bobby's assistance in the murder trial has a somewhat predictable answer, but it still manages to hold your interest.Bottom line, Sleepers is an intensely emotional story that leaves you speechless. The flashback/epilogue-like scene at the end of the movie left me in tears. You come out feeling the pain of Shakes, Michael, John, and Tommy, and you realize the hopelessly poignant message the story conveys: Some experiences alter your life forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepers is one film that I can watch over and over again. Although it tackles a difficult, and often ignored subject, the film is produced with complete good taste, and the acting is of a very high standard.The leading boys are brilliant and seem to be perfect for their intended roles. The horrific experiences that they encounter are supurbly acted, and their terror is expressed in such a realistic way. The prison guards are harsh and incredibly violent and abusive towards the boys, but nevertheless play their characters to a very high standard.This film can be seen as disturbing, whether it is based on real life or not, but that is no reason as to why it shouldn't be viewed.</fullReview>

That's it. Five years later, nothing else to be found.So you slander the Courts, the Church, and one poor slob blown away by the Westies, and what happens next?Well well well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no question that this film starts out superbly. It is moving, shocking and memorable. It makes excellent use of the camera and really gives a huge amount of emotional emphasis to what is an unquestionably horrific subject. And indeed the manner in which this subject is portrayed is both moving and looks extremely professional.However I felt that when the films continuity moved swiftly into the eighties, the dramatic element that was so beautifully built up by the first half of the film was lost. I myself lost quite a bit of interest in the middle of the film, perhaps this was due to the film going off in too much of a tangent from the fundamental narrative - I feel that the newly developing `revenge` plot didn't hold together too well. Nevertheless I carried on watching, and was rewarded by an excitingly rubbish finale.The superb beginning, and the daft but enjoyable end of the film certainly do weigh out the disappointing middle section, so overall this film is definitely worth having a look. The acting is superb throughout and the heavyweight cast are all put in perfect roles, creating an excellent ensemble performance.This is a very interesting film, and an enjoyable one at that. If you're not too worried about plot holding together, and you like the look of the excellent cast then this is the film for you. But don't be too na?ve about this film, as it is very hard-hitting in places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making a movie of such a controversial account that is told in the book of SLEEPERS, must have been a daunting task, especially when you fill it with A-list movie stars, some of which are not known for their sentimental sides.However, Levinson has created a masterpiece, and a film that everyone should watch. All the actors give mindblowing performances, without one weak link. This includes the four child actors, who dominate half of the movie, but obviously don't receive as much press as their older counterparts. These four kids were outstanding in roles that must have been truly harrowing to play.Add to this a great score from John Williams, and you will come back to this film time and time again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie and thought it was done extremely well. I have read the book and it was one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. There were not a lot of changes from the book to the movie, which made it almost as engaging to watch as it was to read. The only problem I had with the movie was the casting of Tommy and John. John was little, with health problems, and was continually described as the "skinny man" in Carcaterra's novel. Tommy was nicknamed "Butter" because he loved to eat and was described as "hefty". Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup were well-cast, but in the wrong roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find that often in movies, there's either absolute realism (in art movies) or none at all (Disney). Whatever balances the two are usually good. Sleepers might've not been the most eloquent courtroom drama, and the tactics used might be unrefined, but I absolutely loved it! It showed the consequences of the guards' sadism, which affected the boys for the rest of their lives. Kevin Bacon was great in the movie because he knew how to make you hate him. It's always easy to have to like someone, but to get the opposite is marginally harder, In the beginning, you don't really know how everything fits together until the vengence. I don't think it's the boys (grown up) who've revenged themselves; the guards' old crimes caught up with them. It's a latter-day Count of Monte Cristo, but in a rough-spoken world with its innocence lost.They way it was filmed didn't idealise or moralise, which was good, and showed things merely as they were, and they as they are. None of them were perfect, and they all had their angles. So whether or not it really happened or it's just a book Cracaterra decided to write to get even with someone, it's a really enjoyable movie.It was so sad, but not boo-hoo sad. Rather, it's a bad car accident, the kind that's all torn up, but you can't look away. So it's not for everyone, that much is true. The irony was devastating, and I didn't expect the ending. Also, you don't exactly SEE what they described in their flashbacks, but it's deftly blended to see the past and present pain. Like even when they're grown up, they don't escape the pain, but live in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film confuses justice with vengeance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It concerns me that so many viewers consider this film a celebration of revenge...and that the director apparently intended it just that way. One of the greatest tragedies in American society is that so many people don't know the difference between justice and vengeance -- and this film, by glorifying thugs, supports the idea that revenge is a worthy motive.It is NOT. Even when it's emotionally understandable, it's wrong.But to speak of "Sleepers" strictly as a film: Overall, it has the visual coherence, the pacing, the dialog, and the characterizations that go into a great film -- but it loses its moral compass, and ultimately, its nerve. Worth seeing, but far from a great movie, in my opinion.I didn't catch who did the music, but the ultra-sweet orchestral swells that underlie the final scenes of this otherwise dark, gritty film were intrusive and over the top. That section wasn't a musical score -- it was a heavy-handed director trying to tell the viewers how they should be feeling.The children in the cast were all wonderful, as children tend to be...Brad Pitt was as bland and characterless as ever, and miscast as well...I don't understand Minnie Driver's appeal at all...But Dustin Hoffman was a gem...as always.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew from the beginning that this movie was going to be intense, and usually I can't handle intense movies, like "The Green Mile" or "End of Days". Graphical scenes, especially dealing with child abuse or sexual abuse. But I held in and watched this movie. It turned out to be one of my favorite movies. Wonderful acting and an excellent plot. Revenge. It can be sweet.  The first half of the movie is based from 1966 to 1968. Four best friends living in Hell's Kitchen, the west side streets of Manhatten. Shakes, Michael, John, and Tommy. They all live in safe streets but live in domestic violence. One hot summer day in 1967 the four boys pull what started as a harmless prank to almost killing a man. John, Michael, and Tommy were sentenced to no more than a year and a half, no less than a year, Shakes is sentenced from 6 months to a year. They are sent to Wilkinson's Home for Boys, a correction center that looks like a university. While in there the four guards, one of whom is played by Kevin Bacon, mentally, physically, and sexually abuse the four boys, completely alternating there life. It's like 10 or 12 years later, John and Tommy are now gangsters and murderers, Michael is now a washed up lawyer fresh out of law school, and Shakes is a journalist for a paper. In a chance meeting, John and Tommy run into Knowles (Bacon) in a bar. They shoot him 7 times and leave the bar. Now there on trial, they murdered for a right reason. Revenge. I give Sleepers 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this film was a great achievement for Barry Levinson... I haven't read the book so I don't really know if I would expect something better, but everything was so well done in the movie I watched... The performances, especially by Robert De Niro and Kevin Bacon, the direction, the flash backs, the long takes... It's one of these movies that capture you and to some extent you feel that you live in the movie, you get angry with the "bad" people... You sympathize with the kids and their grownups...I've read some other comments that criticized it by saying that it dragged too long... I don't understand this... For me, it was this "dragging" that made it work, among other things... Others said that it can't be great because it can't be real... Again I don't see such a connection... I don't really know if it's a true story and to be honest I don't really think it is the issue here... What I do know and is important, is that it CAN happen, that child molesting occurs (does it matter if it is inside correction facilities or not?), and it can scar in the worst possible way the life of the person who endures it... The mere fact that the movie handles such a subject, and in such taken-care-of and humane way, makes it really great...To those who haven't seen it, I'm suggesting that it is a great film, one you shouldn't miss...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abuse to children in movies has never been an easy subject to talk about, Barry Levinson implies more about abuse than he shows in Sleepers, and the film is very strong in that regard. A movie about four friends who can't shake the demons that consume them, Sleepers is one of Levinson's better films. The cast is amazing in this picture, mostly younger Hollywood types. Sleepers also has Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro in smaller roles,but they are equally effective. This film has a very New York feel and great atmosphere. The performance from Kevin Bacon is very disturbing and very powerful. Bacon usually plays the happy go lucky type, but here he stretches his acting wings a little and you will never forget his character. The only drawback of this film for me is that I believe it goes on too long. Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does someone who abuses children deserve to die?Do the victims of such abuses have the right to torment their abusers?Sleepers claims to be a true story. It may or may not be, I doubt it is complete truth, but that really isn't relevant.The performances are all around great, the weak links being Jason Patric and Kevin Bacon's one-dimensional guard, but they are very good.Levinson at one point uses the camera to let us inside Michael (Brad Pitt)'s head. He uses the camera to zoom down a subway tunnel. In this sequence he shows us that Michael can never feel romantic love because of what happened at Wilkinsons. If that isn't great filmmaking, nothing is.Back to the questions at the first. I have no experience with child abuse, thankfully, so I wouldn't really know what I would do given the opportunity to get revenge, but right now, being the person that I am would tend to say "Let it rest. They'll get theirs" But I haven't been faced with the situation. Some criticized Sleepers for trying to force these views on people, but if you see that Father Bobby isn't present in the final sequences, you'll understand that this movie isn't trying to decide anything for you. It is just telling you that you need to be thinking about these things. And after seeing Sleepers, trust me, you will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Well-Acted Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing for sure, this film and it's large cast does not disappoint. With a large cast filled with amazing actors, one can assume to be disappointed but that's not the case here. It's such a gripping story and everyone plays their part well, even if they are hardly used. This is a revenge story and I like the unique perspective this film gave to revenge. It's not about the violence, but it's about using the court system to exact their revenge. This film has the main theme of brotherhood and it shows what these friends would do to help each other out, no matter the cost.Barry Levinson's film is about a group of four friends who decide to play a prank, but when the prank goes wrong these kids are sentenced to a juvenile hall where they are abused by some sadistic guards. Many years later, fate unite these friends as one of the guards, Nokes is shot down by two of these abused boys and the others do what they can to prove these guards weren't so innocent after all.As mentioned at the beginning, this film boasts an incredible pedigree of talent. Kevin Bacon shines in his role of the sadistic Sean Nokes. Robert De Niro, as always, has an incredible on-screen presence and we see that when he is facing a moral dilemma. Dustin Hoffman is good in his role as he brings a tense nervousness to his character. Jason Patric is a good actor and too bad he is not in more movies since he was pretty good here. Finally, Brad Pitt does a wonderful job as usual.Overall, Sleepers is a tense, well-acted drama that is also pretty realistic. There are always cases out there involving sexual harassment of younger children, and this film brings that issue into the spotlight. It's a very emotional film to watch and sometimes hard to watch. Revenge may be a good thing after all especially when done right. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

The boys seem quite accepting of their fathers beating up their Mothers. The Mothers are, like the boys, part of system where they're trapped. Women had to suffer this abuse as divorce was not an option as pay inequality, lack of opportunities and the binding sanctity of marriage prevented this.It is interesting that the abuse of the women in this film is a backdrop to the abuse of the boys; symbolising the secondary nature of womens' suffering at the hands of brutal, cruel and sadistic men. Accordingly the film's director, Barry Levison is actually confronting the audience with a set of moral dilemmas. Child abuse is abhorrent yet the abuse of women by their husbands is acceptable! Likewise the director confronts the audience with the ideas of torture and whether in certain moral systems and situations it's permissible as in the reform school guard's opinion when he asks the lawyer to define torture. To the reform school guard it was an acceptable way of discipline as it was a part of his own childhood. This was the remnants of Victorian society whereby cruel forms of discipline over children and women were viewed as a positively good method of keeping them them in line! This is commented on in David Copperfield by the great British Victorian novelist Charles Dickens.Other moral dilemmas the film looks at includes the question of American values of personal revenge over societies' collective legal responsibility. This utilitarian perspective of ' the greater good' is further put to the audience by the director of the film via the Catholic priest's willingness to lie on oath for personal justice of his charges. The priest is left to question whether telling lies can be justified and thereby bursting asunder all his Catholic beliefs and values.Therefore the film's director is very clever the way he juxtaposes violence against women with boys and ideas of discipline and abuse whilst confronting us with the cliché 'two wrongs don't make a right' moral dilemma in American cultural ideas of revenge and justice.Acting Kudos goes without doubt to Kevin Bacon as the sadistic guard, Vittorio Gassman as Mafia boss King Benny played by him in a none stereotypical way as seen in The Godfather trilogy of films. Acting kudos also goes to Dustan Hoffman's restrained performance as the broken, yet clever lawyer, and his ability to illustrate the tenuous ambiguity of law, and, of course, to Robert De Nero as the Catholic Priest. There is almost a tangible mutual admiration of their respective acting talents from both Hoffman and De Nero which is obvious when they act together in a the scene where De Nero as the Catholic priest takes the stand in court.Finally kudos goes to director Barry Levison for his excellent multi-layered film direction in three acts. This director makes it not merely a film for a passive audience, but a one for them to confront themselves with morals, value systems, duty and responsibility to their fellow human beings and citizens of their country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four friends in 1960's Hell's Kitchen get bored and hungry one lazy summer afternoon and take it upon themselves to steal a hot dog cart. The stunt ends badly, landing the boys in a reform school where they are subjected to a year of sexual abuse and torment at the hands of a ruthless guard (Kevin Bacon) and his cronies. Years after their release, two of the boys ? grown up and damaged ? take their revenge, and it is up to their friends and a trusted priest (Robert DeNiro) to rig a trial in their favor. Blind justice? Where's Daredevil when you need him? Based on a controversial book whose real-life truth has come into question, "Sleepers" is a solid, if slightly flawed film that features a well-rounded ensemble cast in an engaging and dramatic revenge tale. Director Barry Levinson ("Rain Man") shows restraint when needed, but the film is dealing with a dark subject, which means it rarely steps out of the darkness it forces itself into. Take the ending, for example, which begs the question of whether or not our characters have bettered themselves any. The answer is simply: "No." If movies have taught us anything, revenge is ultimately hollow and doesn't change anything. Justice is served half-way through the film, and the second half really just features our characters cleaning up their mess. Ultimately, it's a dark and sometimes depressing film and while that could be a turn-off to some viewers, it works in the film's favor, serving it's gritty narrative perfectly.You'll spot bits of "Stand By Me" and even "The Shawshank Redemption" and combined with its stellar cast that spans everyone from Dustin Hoffman to Brad Renfro, "Sleepers" makes for a movie-buff's dream come true. The story is engaging enough and the direction is appropriately mature. Plus, you just can't beat the out-of-character performances by Kevin Bacon and Robert DeNiro. Humorless but heavy on character, "Sleepers" overcomes a few mis-steps to become an under-rated and over-looked gem of the late 90's. A sleeper, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I need to say - that their are some real morons on this site- in the Hated it category, the first reviewer their talks of how he does not believe justice is killing someone. Maybe you would like to spend sometime in prison or in a pervert's bedroom before you pass that kind of judgement on someone like that- whether you like it or not it shouldn't matter whether or not Lorenzo Carcaterra made it up (which i most certainly do not believe to be true) because I'm sure he had been through something to that effect and even if he didn't we know he went to jail- so stop being so ignorant to reality and go live a life with some pain in it before you go saying something as offencive as your review.Right, now I have that off my chest- this movie is phenomenal. It is not a fun movie by any means and I truly believe in this man, others might not which might change your opinion on the movie but the acting is amazing- Bobby DeNiro is incredible particularly the famous scene when Shakes tells him about the time spent at Wilconsins and all you see is his face transform.The direction to this movie is more subtle and more artistically developed then any Scorcese movie has ever accomplished (and thats saying something because I love Scorcese) For some reason, this movie didn't get any credit which to me, just seems crazy because its a truly fantastic story.The book is exactly like the movie. It has three parts which consist of the childhood, the time in Wilonsins and the time after. This is not a courtroom drama. This is not a sentimental tear jerker, this movie is about real people, and real life. It shows true human struggle, raw without any of Hollywood's honey glazed idea of what life is really like.I loved this movie, its one of my favourite movies of all time and I really think it is worth seeing- if not for the story, for the brilliant acting of Hoffman, DeNiro, Patric, Pitt (yes even the poster boy is fantastic) and the kids are spell bindingly convincing especially the kid who plays Shakes.Go see it, and love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How in the world did this movie manage to slip by me all these years? Seriously, with such a great cast and plot, you'd think I would've heard SOMETHING about it, but no. Anyway, I've seen it now, and that's all that matters. Though, it makes me question even more, having seen it, why I never see it mentioned around here, because it was great! The acting was superb, on part of the child actors, as well as the adults (I even liked De Niro here!), the writing was great, the directing...and overall, it packed a real emotional punch. I only wish they'd spent more time covering the boys and what happened to them, and each boy individually, not just our main guy, later played by Jason Patric, so that we could better understand the paths their lives took...as the movie did drop a little during the second half. Still, excellent...I'd say an 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry Levinson directs this powerful and gripping crime drama. A youthful prank goes very wrong for four young boys growing up in New York's Hell's Kitchen. The childhood bud's are sent to a brutal reform school where they find out it is not how tough you act...its the stamina to sustain your very life. Many years later their torture and rape is still not spoken of. Two of the childhood friends come across the head guard(Kevin Bacon)and they execute their revenge. When charged with murder, 'Shakes'(Jason Patric)and Mike(Brad Pitt)unite to exact revenge for the brutal rapes and tortures they survived.Very strong sexual content with graphic violence. Riveting and suspenseful. This strong cast includes: Robert de Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Vittorio Gassman, Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Bruno Kirby, Terry Kinney, and Ron Eldard. Some very dramatic performances and a story that is hard to forget. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Tale of Getting Revenge on the System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sleepers" is an underrated tale of loyalty, friendship and ultimate revenge on the American Justice System. Despite having an all-star cast which includes stars Brad Pitt, Robert DeNiro, Kevin Bacon, and Dustin Hoffman plus future stars in Minnie Drive and Billy Crudup, the movie never became a major box office hit and has become almost forgotten many years after its theatrical release.The story starts out following the lives of four children growing up in the Hells Kitchen section of New York. The kids decide to pull a prank which goes horribly wrong and lands them in a juvenile detention facility. While at the facility, the boys are verbally and sexually abused by the guards. Once they get released, they make a pact never to talk about what went on at the facility. Fast forward to adulthood where two of the kids turn out to be criminals. They have a chance encounter with one of the guards (Kevin Bacon) at a restaurant and decide to take out years of frustration on him. With the other two boys being a defense attorney and a newspaper reporter, respectively, they decided to rig the murder trial while getting revenge on all people who were associated with the juvenile detention facility while they were there.Thought slow moving at time, "Sleepers" does a great job in showing how loyalty and friendship can triumph over the Justice System which was supposed to protect them but ultimately failed them. It shows how one incident can change several people's life, for both the better and the worse. I liked how they made Brad Pitt's district attorney character come across as an effective prosecutor without making it obvious that he was trying to purposely lose the case. Robert DeNiro does an excellent job as a priest who mentors the main characters as kids and faces a moral crisis of remaining loyal to them when they are on trial.Though the movie seems to come across as a true story, there are many plot holes. First, no judge in any court would sentence all four boys who are obvious close friends to the same detention facility. Secondly, the detention facility would never get away with killing Rizzo like they did in this movie. Anytime someone dies at a prison or juvenile facility, there is a thorough investigation. Thirdly, I find it hard to believe that no one would find a connection between the four boys, the juvenile detention center, and Sean Nokes. It was only 13 years ago and I'm sure that the murder would be all over the newspapers and someone would put two and two together. Lastly, what are the odds that Brad Pitt's character would actually get the case. There are probably thousands of other district attorneys in New York who would have a shot at prosecuting the case.Despite these plot holes and an overly long running time (2 1/2 hours), I still recommend this movie and give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

I am sure this movie was hard to make because of how graphic it was with the brutalizing scenes with the guards. It makes me sad to watch it but, it was a really good movie. I think Kevin Bacon did a wonderful job playing a bad guy. I think all of the actors did a beautiful job with this film. Plus, Brad Pitt and Jason Patric are HOT!! I also loved Robert De Niro's character. I thought it was pretty cool how he lied under oath to protect the kids and to keep them from going to prison.

I never thought it was going to be a really good movie actually, but it definitely was. All the actors had excellent performances and were perfectly casted. Kevin Bacon especially, had the best performance in the movie as the strict Wilkinson for Boys guard. His performance made Sleepers a great one. The direction by Barry Levinson is very well done and the script is superb. The only negative to this film, is that even thought the first part of the film was excellent, some of the scenes in the second part were a little to slow. Overall, Sleepers is a good movie with fantastic performances that drew you in to the movie. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+</fullReview>

Ever since I read the book I always remember this one thing John said which is 'its a devils deal', its always stuck with me for some reason.

		<shortDescription>When the system fails (spoiler alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers is an account told by one of it's characters, the talented and wise Lorenzo Carcaterra. This movie sticks with the book, and makes wide use of simple narrative to convey the story without over extending the viewing time of the movie. The director was careful to avoid actually showing abuse and the horrible things that happened to the boys in this movie, choosing instead to allow what you don't see to fully impact the horror of the scenario.The setting is Hell's Kitchen (present day Clinton, NY) and the backdrop is the uneasy and violent mix of races living in this neighborhood. Four friends find their lives irrevocably altered one hot summer day when a prank goes horribly wrong. The Judge sentences them in an exemplary fashion to an upstate Juvenile Detention center with apparent notoriety of harshness. The punishment did not fit the crime. The boys were too young to have been sent there in the first place, this made them easy targets for the events that unfold there after. Half a lifetime later, the movie shows you what that type of young start can bring to the lives of these boys. Two of them have made something of themselves, the other two sought out a life of crime and shake downs. There is an old saying that you reap what you sow, and the opportunity to harvest presents itself when a chance encounter opens the door to one of the best and most justified revenge plots that I have ever read. In short, not only did the system fail these individuals as boys, but it failed to note there is no point in stopping inevitability. Using the same system that closed the door on them, two of the Sleepers gleaned revenge on four guards who deserve much more in the here after.This is not a movie for children, or for young and impressionable minds. If you have been a victim of the system you identify strongly with the themes here. If you have never seen justice fail, then you may be skeptical or aghast at the story, but take my advice; it's better that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The coming of age of four friends is interrupted in a most grueling manner when a childhood prank against a hot dog vendor goes horribly wrong. The friends - Shakes, Mikey, John and Tommy, respectively - are sent to a detention center where they are continually abused, tortured, tormented, humiliated, and, finally sexually abused/molested/raped by the guards, who are led by Kevin Bacon in smug, smarmy super-jerk mode. Shortly before their release, they vow never to speak of it again. Years later, John and Tommy, who have grown up to be killer thugs, encounter Kevin Bacon in a bar one night and, still understandably pulsing with hate, they mutilate the bastard. Their case is taken by Mikey, who has become a prosecutor, but he has no intention of putting his old friends behind bars, no. Mikey plots instead to lose to the case and ruin the lives of the other surviving guards in the process. To do this, Mikey seeks the help of childhood lover Carol Martinez (Minnie Driver), the adult Shakes - who now works for a newspaper - and Father Robert "Bobby" Carillo (Robert DeNiro), the Hell Kitchen preacher who was always there for them. He is also aided by the dark underbelly of corruption that populates Hell's Kitchen and a drunk lawyer played by Dustin Hoffman. Unpleasant to be sure, not to mention chilling, grossly compelling and well acted. DeNiro and Jason Patrick (the adult Shakes) give fine performances, and Pitt (the adult Mikey) gives one of his better performances. Not for all tastes. Keep out of reach of children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up until near the end of the harrowing institute section of the film, Sleepers can do no wrong. The child actors are pretty good and Robert De Niro is on fine form as the friendly priest. Then, after the evocatively sleazy 1981 shooting scene, it goes downhill. Firstly, Jason Patric, as one of the men who was abused at the institute as a child, is infectiously boring, the film dragging whenever he's on screen, and secondly, he's doesn't look sufficiently Italian-American to pass muster, a fatal flaw as for the most part, as Sleepers' ethnic casting is spot on. Not even a brilliant performance from Dustin Hoffman as an alcoholic can save the movie from being hideously dull. The ending is also a washout.

		<fullReview>There is so much emphasis, expressed or implied, on justice and revenge here. Justice for the boys, justice for the guards, and justice for some of the boys again. Justice in the sense that they 'deserved' what they got, depending on whose viewpoints they're from.The guards deserved what they got for what they did to the boys, not just the main leads, but the other boys who were in the home as well. And justice was served, though not in the conventional manner. Each of the guards finally had something happen to them which served to appease the boys and their audience. And then what happened to some of the now grownup boys might be seen be some as justice for what they did to the guards as well.All in all, this is a movie which, even with a priest in it who never seemed to put a foot wrong, hinges on revenge, in its many forms. Few in the audience will feel that justice has been perverted after the movie ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can draw a straight line between Sleepers and such films as The Mayor from Hell, Crime School, Knock on Any Door right up to the Nineties when Sleepers was released. All of those films from the bygone studio era were in whole or in part about the abuses in juvenile reform schools. Mix a small amount of Going My Way in there and you got Sleepers.Going My Way, I'm sure a few laughs are being had with that one, but what is Robert DeNiro, but a very up to date Father O'Malley. Granted he isn't musical and he's not about to tame the tough kids of the neighborhood by making them a choir as Bing Crosby did, but in fact Bing and Barry Fitzgerald's parish was indeed in the Hell's Kitchen setting that Sleepers is. Bing and Frank McHugh tell a couple of lies as well for a good cause and he's as protective of his charges as DeNiro is of his. He's also an athlete like DeNiro and probably could get physical as DeNiro was ready to do after one of his kids is assaulted by his mom's boyfriend. Sleepers is about four youths growing up in Hell's Kitchen in the sixties and what happened to them when a juvenile prank goes dramatically wrong. The four get sent to a youth facility where they are beaten and sexually abused by sadistic guards, chiefly Kevin Bacon. Two of them grow up to be stone cold killers and on a chance meeting with Bacon, pump several bullets in him and kill him.The other two grow up to be Jason Patric, journalist, and Brad Pitt Assistant District Attorney. Of course they know what the real story in the killing is and set in motion a plan for revenge after a fictional hero they learned about in The Count of Monte Cristo.The flaw with Sleepers is the fact it is based on the premise that because of juvenile records are sealed, no one will get the connection between Pitt and Patric, the defendants, and the victim in the case. That would have fallen apart by dint of the fact that any District Attorney's Office would do a deep background check on Pitt if he applied to work there. Those seals aren't completely inviolate, I doubt Pitt would have ever been hired in the first place. This is the same criticism I had with another powerful drama about the justice system, 12 Angry Men. A deeply flawed premise is in the creation of that film as well. Doesn't prevent it from being a well done film and the same is the case with Sleepers.DeNiro and Bacon come off best as the two influences on the kid's lives for good and evil respectively. I think you will also enjoy Dustin Hoffman as the alcoholic defense attorney and Vittorio Gassman as the neighborhood boss.Even a flawed drama can be an enjoyable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepers, one amazing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers is one of my favorite movies ever, the story is just amazing. Four kids from Hell's Kitchen are sent to a juvinal detention center for nearly killing a man (on accedent), and their lives change due to Sean Nokes (Bacon). Nokes and the other gaurds are horrible to the kids, they beat them, and sexually abuse them, for about a year. When the kids get out, the film shows them as adults, two are crooked, drug addict gangsters (Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup , one is a lawyer (Brad Pitt), and the other a reporter (Jason Patric). All are amazing in their roles. One night Tommy see's Nokes and in a really amazing sceen, Tommy and John kill Nokes in a resturant. They are put on trial, and their buddy from childhood Micheal (Pitt) takes the case defended Nokes. And Dustin Hoffman is put as John and Tommy's attorney, he is an alcoholic and a drug addict, he is put there to lose. The plot of Micheal's scheme is to get John and Tommy off free, by losing his case on purpose. But its hard to do this because people actually saw the killing, so there are several hurdles. But all come down when Father Bobby (De Niro) who was a childhood guide and friend of the children throught the movie, lied and said he was with them on the night of the murders. This movie is so good, you really need to buy it or rent it. I don't know what the academy was thinking, Bacon should have won best supporting actor and this should have been nominated for several other awards, but anyway I rated this movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1960's Hell's Kitchen. 4 boys, Lorenzo, Tommy, John and Micheal are enjoying the summer heat. Though as the narrator's voiceintroduces the opening scene, we find that this seemingly normal day will be 'the day that changed their lives forever' A harmlessprank goes wrong when the 4 boys accidentally drop a hotdogstand down a subway, killing an old man. My heart strings pulledwhen i realised the boys lives were ruined. What followed? 18months in a correctional facility called the Wilkensons Home forBoys. The scenes that follow are pure torture as we see the boysbeing subjected to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. KevinBacon puts in a chilling performance as Sean Nokes, the guardwho's supposed to be looking after the boys, while really he istorturing and humiliating them. The young actors in this part of thefilm put in excellent performance and truly outshined the olderactors such as Jason Patric and Billy crudup who played theboys grown up.The boys swear to never talk of the pain they wentthrough, until one day two of the boys cross paths with Nokes(Bacon) in a Hell's Kitchen bar and they shoot him. Personally i didnot enjoy the courtroom scenes in the last section but i thought thefirst half was excellent. My favourite actor De Niro is touching asthe boys neighbourhood priest who sticks by them and supportsthem, even though he does not find out the torture they wentthrough until the end. A great film based on the novel by LorenzoCarcaterra. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have probably seen eleven of Mr. Levinson's films and this is my favorite. I buy almost everything in this picture. I love the part when they are adults. It makes perfect sense to me that Tommy and John would kill Nokes with very little thought of potential witnesses or consequences. Afterall, they are ruthless killers plying their trade in early 1980s Hell's Kitchen. I think too many years of booze and drugs have obfuscated their brains and judgment. I don't think they thought much past the next sunrise. Did anyone notice the U2 flavored peyote chant in the song just before the killing? The song is from a late 60s rock group called Everything is Everything. Deniro and Hoffman have less flashy roles than normal and excel. The character parts are filled out by Bruno Kirby, the broad from The Sopranos and "King Benny," played by Vittorio Gassman, an actor from old Hollywood. And kudos to the fat guy from the handball court. I enjoyed his street wisdom. The first third of this film--when they are kids and before the crime--is a lot of fun. The part of the film I didn't like was the reform school section. I know it is essential to the plot, but I've seen it before--from the "Dead End Kids" to Bad Boys, the movie with Sean Penn. But the rest of the film is perfect. Sweet. Brutal. And moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The question about this film is not whether it is well acted, which on the whole it is, but the subject matter and they message it gives. Firstly I have to question why someone would enjoy watching a film about the hideous abuse of a group of young boys...call that entertainment? Believe me it's not.And secondly, the overriding message is that revenge, and vigiliante justice is excusable, even acceptable in certain circumstances. It is not. Many people have been abused in their lives but that does not mean they have a warrant to, or indeed feel the need to, exact punishment on their abusers.Hollywood should not mess with such important issues. Stick to the popcorn munching entertainment it does so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't see this one coming, but when it does, it lands with a boom! After that, you are wanting the butterflies in your stomach to take a much needed break. From that moment, a movie watching glue kicks in between the viewer and the movie and entertainment is born but of a special kind. To some, the subject matter may be to strong to their liking. To others, they want the truth be known regardless of the pain involved. Interesting at how the players in the movie win you over and you do form a opinion and accept as well as reject some of the roles being played in the movie. That's what good acting and story telling under decent directing does. It makes your emotions come alive sort of borrowing them for bit so it can shake them up and give them back so you can calm them. Take heart, while you go up and down through out the movie, it does end on a satisfying but sober note of some sort. I will leave that experience to you.

		<fullReview>I am giving this a 10. First thing first- I watched it in 2016. 20 years after it came out.And as i checked some facts about its origin, I found out that people questioned its "truthfulness" and cared far less of its content. That's sickening!The author of the book reveals of the personal sexual abuse he received at Boys Juvenile center.. would you do that if that REALLY didn't happen?Would any of us will say "I was raped even if I wasn't?" I think its more of a reverse...If someone is sexually assaulted, then there are chances that he might hide it out of shame or horror of reliving it... Thing is I don't question its truthfulness.And even it was faked, content is one that should be cared about.Kids are supposed to be "kept in line" at a Juvenile Center rather than forced upon or raped. It wet my eyes when I see kids being treated like that.About the performances, I think everybody performs superb especially Brad Pitt who is outstanding in the court(in order to lose the case).I also like the character of "Shakes" played by Jason Patric.And the character who draws me to watch any movie he is in-Robert DE Great Niro... superb as a gentleman as always. (I always wonder how many "flop" movies this legend has played in?-- - 1,2 or none... I don't think there is any).I recommend this movie. It asked me to write a First ever IMDb review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a prank goes disastrously wrong, a group of boys are sent to a detention centre where they are brutalized; over 10 years later, they get their chance for revenge. Roger Ebert wrote: "I liked the way the film evoked Hell's Kitchen; there is a whiff of Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets." Some of the supporting performances--especially Gassman's-- were colourful. The courtroom scene works, as most courtroom scenes do. As entertainment, the movie functions successfully. But I don't believe the story is true--not true to the facts, and not true to the morality it pretends to be about." Robert De Niro gives a convincing performance as the Catholic priest who is a father-figure to a bunch of disillusioned Brooklyn youth. Sleeper is a powerful gritty and underrated film that more people should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an incredible movie with a very strong and powerful story. 4 Boys grow up together in Hell's Kitchen, all of them religious and are good friends with father Bobby (Robert De Niro). The first half of the story is set in the 60's, when the boys end up in a disciplinary school. The guards does unspeakable things to the boys and scars them for life. The second part of the movie is set in the 80's. The boys are now grown- ups and are looking for revenge.I would recommend Sleepers at the strongest. This movie has powerful scenes, and you almost get the feeling of how it would be to be one of the boys. Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon and Robert De Niro makes this movie excellent, and Dustin Hoffman (as an old, alcoholic lawyer) completes it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Films in One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sleepers" (plural) has no connection with Woody Allen's "Sleeper" (singular). As others have noted, it is essentially three films in one. Film One is a nostalgic coming-of-age drama similar to director Barry Levinson's earlier "Diner" but with rather younger characters and set in New York instead of Baltimore. Lorenzo, Tommy, Michael and John are four boys in their early teens, growing up in the Manhattan neighbourhood of Hell's Kitchen in the mid-1960s. The nostalgia is not completely rose- tinted- we never lose sight of the fact that this is a fairly poor area with a high crime rate- but the four friends, portrayed as mischievous, high-spirited young lads, seem to be having a pretty enjoyable childhood, until one of their pranks goes badly wrong and a man is seriously injured. Which leads us into Film Two, a prison exposé in the tradition dating back at least as far as "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" in the thirties and including more recent examples such as "Cool Hand Luke", "Brubaker" and "The Shawshank Redemption". By way of punishment, the boys are sent to the Wilkinson Home for Boys in upstate New York. The name makes it sound like a benevolent, philanthropic institution, but in fact it is a tough juvenile prison along the lines of a British Borstal. In the "Home" the boys are subjected to physical and sexual abuse by a group of guards led by the sadistic Sean Nokes. After their release, Lorenzo (a newspaper reporter) and Michael (a lawyer) manage to turn their lives around and find responsible jobs, but John and Tommy drift into crime and become gangsters. Fourteen years later they meet Nokes by chance in a bar and take their revenge by shooting him dead. Which leads us into Film Three, a courtroom drama. Michael, an assistant district attorney, arranges to be assigned to prosecute John and Tommy. To the people of Hell's Kitchen this seems like the worst sort of disloyalty to his former friends, but Michael is secretly part of a conspiracy to secure their acquittal. Other parties the plot include Lorenzo, including Carol, a social worker, King Benny a local gangster, and the defence lawyer Danny Snyder. The conspirators also have their plans for getting revenge on the other guards who abused the boys. "Sleepers" is certainly a powerful drama; the scenes set in the "Home" are almost unbearable to watch. It is generally well-acted, with three performances in particular standing out. One comes from Kevin Bacon as Nokes, a man whose softly-spoken exterior belies his vicious true nature. It is said that absolute power corrupts absolutely, but Nokes has been absolutely corrupted by even the limited amount of power he wields. Another comes from Dustin Hoffman as the shambling Snyder, an unsuccessful lawyer and broken-down alcoholic who cannot believe that he is now acting for the defence in a high-profile murder case. The third comes from Robert De Niro as Father Bobby Carillo, the kindly but streetwise local Catholic priest, who befriends the boys during their childhoods and plays an important part as a key defence witness during the trial. This is in many ways a fine film, but there are two reasons why I cannot give it a higher mark. The first is a lack of plausibility, especially in Film Three. (Unfortunately, the events related in Film Two are all too plausible). Would, for example, Michael really have been permitted to prosecute a case involving two childhood friends who served time with him in the same penal institution? And wouldn't somebody in the DA's office have noticed that John and Tommy had a motive for killing Nokes and started to suspect something when Michael failed to bring evidence of this motive at trial? Lorenzo Carcaterra, the author of the book on which the film was based, claimed that his was a true story, but this claim has been disputed, and there are certainly elements in the movie which do not ring true. The second reason is that the film never really explores the many moral issues which it raises. Does sexual abuse, horrible crime though it may be, really deserve to be punished by extra-judicial killing? Is friendship really so important that it would justify a lawyer, who has sworn to uphold the rule of law, in perverting the course of justice by engineering the wrongful acquittal of two friends, however morally worthless their victim? Can a journalist, whose function is to expose the truth, justify conspiring to suppress it? Can anything justify a priest lying on oath for the benefit of two men who killed out of desire for revenge, contrary to Christian teaching on forgiveness? These questions would be pertinent enough if John and Tommy had been otherwise law-abiding citizens who had killed Nokes in a fit of anger, but they become far more so when one considers that John and Tommy are hardened criminals whose hands are stained with several men's blood, not just Nokes's. By securing their release, Michael, Lorenzo, Father Bobby and the others have simply freed them to commit further crimes, yet the film tends to take the rather simplistic position that the charade they acted out in court was entirely justifiable. There is a certain sentimentality about old-style mobsters like King Benny who (it is implied) never killed or injured anyone who didn't have it coming to them. I would have liked to see the film take a harder-edged line on issues like these. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been unbelievably good, instead, it's both good and unbelievable ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it's tempting to paraphrase "Platoon" powerful tag-line by saying that 'the first casualty of Prison is innocence', any sensible mind would instantly argue that a person coming to prison would have already lost it, partially, if not permanently. True. But "Sleepers" is about four boys, they might be hoodlums from honest taxpayers' perspective, but for real hardened criminals, they're harmless babies. Yet these boys are sentenced to 12 to 18 months in Wilkinson Juvenile Home after a prank with a hot dog vendor that turned into disaster. The four friends will quickly understand that they took their toughness too much for granted.Barry Levinson's "Sleepers" takes place in "Hell's Kitchen", a familiar neighborhood for gangster movies' lovers, ruled by two hands, one that belongs to the charismatic mobster, King Benny (Vittorio Gassman) and a second to Father Bobby, the priest with a caring eye on his sheep, played by Robert De Niro. The presence of De Niro, in an honest role, instantly connects "Sleepers" with his first-directed film "A Bronx Tale". The main message was to never waste one's talent, a lesson sadly transfigured by the fate of the main actor Lillo Brancato. "Sleepers" works like a follow-up to "A Bronx Tale" illustrating the consequences of such wastes. These boys weren't born bad and could have turned well if it wasn't for that stupid mistake.The second act confronts them to Noxes, Kevin Bacon as one of the most sadistic guards ever portrayed in a film - why he picked precisely the four protagonists we never know. Then, the director seems like in a rush to skip the prison part by rapidly getting to the point: kids are raped and many times, by Noxes and three other guards. The treatment of the Juvenile Delinquency Home is only made of disturbing fast-forwarded flashbacks, the point is to make us hate Noxes and wish him a quick and severe come-uppance. Thankfully, we don't have to wait much. Two of the four boys, now adults, meet Noxes in their regular restaurant. They savor the taste of revenge by shooting different spots of his body before finally 'ending' him.I guess one of the film's merits is to raise many thought-provoking interrogations. One of them being that: is rape worse than murder? I understand that rape and the way it was committed was like a murder of these kids' souls, maybe their lives would have taken a totally different path, but still, do you kill a life that didn't kill one? Or, let's take it the opposite way, if you consider that murder was justice indeed, then why would you hide from it, why would all the four friends agree to acquit them when it was much easier to show who Noxes was. These are moral questions worth asking, but "Sleepers" insisted so much on portraying the guards as male-raping scumbags that nothing could ever redeem them, and the fact that they beat a black inmate to death after a football game is the deathblow.The problem with "Sleepers" is that the football game is one of these many plot devices that undermine the film's credibility. How could they think they could get away with that? How could they lure a black prisoner when they knew he'd get a worse treatment? And how could the two friends who turned well, Jason Patric, a journalist, and Brad Pitt, the prosecutor, be sure they could botch the case that easily? So, Pitt compromises his own chances to win an open-and-shut case, King Benny hires a lousy lawyer to make sure he'd be able to read the lines, the lawyer is none else but Dustin Hoffman. And everything works too conveniently, the prosecutor never tries to find the motive, he wants to clear Noxes' reputation and calls for a friend guard who'll end up revealing the sexual abuses, too convenient.Indeed, why the prosecutor doesn't find a possible motive from that testimony? How come the guard doesn't even recognize the prosecutor or any of the accused? How come the judge doesn't point these issues out? I'm not trying to diminish the film's merit, it's still watchable and entertaining, but there was some great potential for greatness it didn't really achieve, unfortunately. The film was supposed to culminate in the testimony of Father Bobby who gives his 'two sheep' the perfect alibi, the point is that he has to lie after swearing on the Bible. I kept thinking of Father Pat O'Brien who for the protection of the Dead End Kids in "Angels With Dirty Faces" asked his friend to pretend to die as a coward in the electric chair, stealing a man's honor to a better repentance, that's in "Angels with Dirty faces".But in the film, we knew that James Cagney's character was a tough criminal and asking to cry like a baby would be a huge turnover for him. But we never knew how truly reluctant Bobby was before deciding to help them. I don't even believe he really hesitated, as a priest who grew up in a mob-governed neighborhood, he probably acknowledged that some things are worth lying about, a sort of reverse Omerta. And who knows? this is maybe why Nokes was killed, torture is one thing, but maybe homosexual rape is perhaps even worse in these standards, some disturbing questions indeed ?.In a decade full of gangster movies and a year with great trial films, "Sleepers" hangs on the whole revenge scheme to be that memorable, De Niro's testimony was supposed to be emotional pay-off, it didn't work for me.I wish the prison part could last longer ? maybe that's because I felt the child actors were better, I have nothing against Jason Patric but for some reason, I wished Matt Dillon took the role, Brad Pitt was okay, but not transcended, obviously, the all-star cast was one of the film's commercial assets, while it doesn't hurt "Sleepers", it doesn't elevate it either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding But Unsavory Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adjectives such as compelling, suspenseful, mesmerizing, and haunting all apply with equal relevance to director Barry Levinson's serious-minded, tour de force tale of vengeance "Sleepers," starring Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt. The title comes from the street name for boys who have done time in juvenile lock-ups. Exploitative and depressing as the subject matter remains, "Sleepers" never stoops to vile instincts. Serving as his own scenarist, Levinson has woven an intricately designed yarn that unfurls like a Biblical epic."Sleepers" charts the dire course of events when a winsome quartet of boys leaves the innocence of adolescence behind and plunges headlong into the fully blown evils of adulthood. Mind you, nothing lurid occurs on-screen. Compared with the Burt Reynolds &amp; Jon Voight wilderness thriller "Deliverance," "Sleepers" seems almost tame in its depiction of evil. What takes place off-screen in this polished, downbeat film is what may disturb you. Adapted from Lorenzo Carcanterra's bestseller, "Sleepers' opens with a quaint bit of nostalgia. Audiences meet Lorenzo (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), John (Geoff Wigdor) and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) and observe their lives in the tightly-knit sanctuary of New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Unspeakable horror derails the nostalgia and shatters their lives forever.Initially, Levinson appears to imitate Martin Scorsese. The film spans the late 1960s up the early 1970s as we follow the mischievous deeds of the four boys roaming those urban mean streets. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro of "Taxi Driver") is the sympathetic Catholic priest who befriends the boys and becomes their live-long confidant. One hot summer day, these reckless teens dream up a prank that nearly kills an innocent bystander. The court sentences them to a year in the Wilkinson Home of Boys reformatory. Before they've been locked up an hour, our protagonists realize the tragic mistake that they have made. They are beyond the protective confines of Hell's Kitchen and have fallen into a different kind of Hell. Sadistic guards led by smiling Sean Noyes (Kevin Bacon of "Footloose") prey on these defenseless minors. They rape and sodomize them on a regular basis in the dark cellars beneath the reformatory. Two of the four emerge the worse for their experiences. John Reilly (Ron Eldard of "Drop Dead Fred") and Tommy Marcano (Billy Crudup of "Watchmen") turn into armed and deadly street hoodlums who deal narcotics and act as assassins. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) and Michael (Brad Pitt) take the high road. One winds up at a newspaper while the other lands a post in the district attorney's office.The years elapse. One night John and Tommy spot Noyes in a neighborhood restaurant. After they refresh Noyes' memory, they gun him down in cold blood. When they are arrested for murder, childhood pal Michael volunteers to prosecute them. Witnesses can place them at the scene of the homicide, but the attorney decides to tip the scales of justice. Lorenzo and he contrive an elaborate scheme not only to win freedom for their friends but also pay back the despicable guard. Some critics have complained that Kevin Bacon's demise half-way through the story qualifies as anti-climactic. Nonsense! "Sleepers" concerns friendship and how these friends with an entire community conspire to save John and Tommy. "Sleepers" invokes the vigilante justice formula of the recent John Grisham movie "A Time to Kill" in condoning the clear-cut murder of a repugnant individual.Director Barry Levinson has helmed several impressive films, but none compare with the hard-edged, clinical fatalism of this epic. "Sleepers" amounts to a stroll on the seamy side for the director of movies such as "Tin Men," "Rain Man," "Diner," "The Natural," "Bugsy," and "Disclosure." Meanwhile, "Sleepers' wallows in the ironic half-light of an amoral universe. Nevertheless, "Sleepers" is pure Levinson, from its 1960s era setting to the camaraderie of its leads. Levinson has fashioned a literate screenplay. During the first hour, he sets up his characters and explores the insular community of Hell's Kitchen. Everything here foreshadows the events which follows Noyes' murder. Levinson's tragedy is not so much about exorcising demons from their past as it is about heading off another catastrophe.Wisely, Levinson tones down the charisma that distinguishes his stellar cast of heartthrobs. As the shrewd assistant district attorney who orchestrates the cover-up in court, Pitt appears commendably taciturn though frayed in his shady effort to win justice for his childhood friends. Jason Patric is just guarded in his attitude but just as vindictive. Michael and Lorenzo both live out a vengeful fantasy as much a part of their Hell's Kitchen heritage as it is the Alexander Dumas novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" that he learned to savor at Wilkinson. Kevin Bacon endows his abusive prison guard with a cheerful decadence. You'll despise Bacon's depraved sentinel who is determined to teach his juvenile charges about rules and discipline. As Noyes' closet-cohort Ferguson, Terry Kinny has a devastating scene in court when he confesses his part in molesting these young men. Despite his short-time on screen, Dustin Hoffman dominates the action as an alcoholic, skid-row attorney who doubts his ability to acquit his guilty-as-sin clients.As stunning as "Sleepers" is, you may shy away from the experiencing its gritty realism more than once.

		<shortDescription>Hollywood emotion, but a lot of talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supreme Hollywood starpower doesn't always guarantee a masterpiece, but it assures something at least half way decent. This is the case with Sleepers, a film about four boys living in Hell's Kitchen. These four boys are the best of friends, pulling all kinds of antics on the streets. However, one day a prank of theirs goes horribly wrong and they land themselves in a brutal correctional facility for boys. In this facility they are subjected to torture and rape by the guards, forever changing their lives and draining them of their youth. Years later two of the boys get revenge, leading to their trial in which the lead prosecutor is one of the victims. He devises a clever scheme to fulfill their revenge against the scum that abused them so terribly. It's a heartfelt and emotional film, albeit a tad bit Hollywood.I mentioned starpower earlier and I was serious. This film rounds together an incredibly talented collection of male actors including Robert DeNiro, Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patrick, and others. All of these fine actors give it their all for this film, and their dedication to acting really shines. Barry Levinson directs his film with the utmost care and respect towards a powerful story and he also gives it a screenplay that certainly packs a punch. Sleepers has all the right elements for a truly incredible film.Yet, here is a film that tries its absolute hardest to be the best it can be, at times trying a little too hard. It's emotional, it's moving, it's touching, and it's sincere. However, it is pretty easy to place the emotions elicited by this film. It's not a particularly challenging film and we know what to expect and what to feel. The film doesn't necessarily insult our intelligence with its melodrama or cliché. Instead, it uses these things as a device to make us remember this film and to allow us to enjoy it during its two and a half hour duration. Yet after the film a little reflection reveals the way this film works in fairly simplistic ways, telling us what to feel and when to feel it, not letting the audience make their own conclusions about the morals presented in the film. Had the film lacked the talent behind it I would have had a much bigger problem with this, but because I was treated to a fine script, fantastic acting, and skilled directing I had an easier time letting it slide.Don't go into Sleepers looking for a particularly challenging film. Don't expect a masterpiece and just take the movie as it comes. As far as the validity of the film's story goes, I can't speak to that. All I do know is that the events depicted in the movie, whether they be true or false, make for a fine film that had the potential to delve much deeper into themes like the loss of innocence and the fading of youth. But with Sleepers we are given something a little less intellectual and much more emotional. Ultimately, this is what the film strives for, and it succeeds in making its audience feel, even if it doesn't try to disguise anything and instead gives us a decent drama picture to be taken at face value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepers is a good movie. It gives you an unsavory but quite interesting story about memories and friendship. I disliked that the movie was a bit too long for me. I got tired in the end. There was maybe too predictable ending and it was very lingering. Having said that, I'm still happy that I took time to see that.Cast is the strongest part of this movie. Robert De Niro is in his element which is playing a guy who has an utter respect and confidence. Never seen him playing a Father before but he manages it very well. Brad Pitt is a young gun here. A good showing by him. Others like Jason Patric and Kevin Bacon are solid too.My advice to you would be this - if you feel a bit tired and you still start to see Sleepers, then take into consideration that by the end of the film, you certainly are a sleeper too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film. So good than it is not only a movie. It is not a game or a piece of loisir, it is not art or product of extraordinary cast. It is the story of deep abysses who grows -up in us. And not the story is important. But the force to define the war against the expectations of ordinary people who belief that a film is beginning of nice evening. De Niro is the Master. But his art is the science to create the waves of small gesture, silence and look. A murder and its traces. The past as skin of present. And the justice. Whith precious memory of Greek tragedy. In fact, "Sleepers" is only a collection of questions. Extraordinary, fantastic, masterpiece are only autumn leafs. The heart is the courage to discover in it a personal experience. The tension is, in this case, only small ingredient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking through hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother was raised in a deeply Catholic household. Although she abandoned the faith several years after my own baptism, her upbringing left a solid respect for both secular and religious authority, something she took great care to confer to me. Consequently, when I first saw this film at age eighteen, I was appalled at its approbatory depiction not only of personal revenge but manipulation of the legal system. Equally scandalous was depiction of a Christian priest lying under oath to further this end.I rediscovered my religion around age twenty, and perhaps not coincidently, about that time began refining and deepening my understanding of humanity (largely though studying the humanities), of legitimate authority and of justice. Now, at twenty-three, I have left the United States. To some extent the lying cleric remains a bit unnerving in my mind, but strangely, the moral tone overall no longer shocks me.The setting may be somewhat familiar, even ubiquitous, to other Catholic Americans: a close-knit band of kids in an urban (in this case, New York--where else?) working-class Irish and Italian enclave, growing up "straight" but getting into occasional mischief, as all boys do (I was a boy once, a good boy, even a "sissy" at times, but I certainly committed my share of nastiness). Life can be rough, but they exploit the loopholes and like all children, find creative ways to turn adversity into fun (for example, sunbathing on the roof of a brownstone building).One day, they take their fun just a mite too far, directing their excess energy against an unsuspecting Greek immigrant and watching it unravel perhaps beyond even what they had expected. But then, children are cruel, and a good beating here and there will put them in their place. (If they act like children into adulthood, they will likewise continue to be beaten and at that age if they go so far as to murder, rape or kidnap, perhaps they must be hanged.) After all, with strong families and a powerful Church to keep them in check, they surely won't stray too badly. That was the way of thinking for many centuries, at least.But not in post-Quaker America, and not in the rest of the West after we were done with it. No, according to modern logic, true "justice" means "rehabilitation"--which in practice means incarceration, even for extremely young, na?ve (and even perhaps penitent!) children such as these. Incarceration, of course, means confinement to a rank cell and, too often, becoming the object of severe sexual molestation--precisely what is shown to happen to our young protagonists.I have always believed--and I still believe--that legitimate authority retains its legitimacy in the face of error, but I am not a legal positivist. St. Augustine tells us "lex injusta non est lex," and the disgustingly tragic prison farce is not an aberration--it is the very foundation of the American system of "justice." How can this be justice at all? How can it be truly legal? Does this government have any legitimacy at all?Thinking about "Sleepers" five years down the road, these are the questions on my mind. And there is one more, and this is perhaps the critical one for the moral tone of "Sleepers": was the premeditated shooting of Sean Nokes morally an act of murder or lynching--in other words, a mortal sin? I thank Christ I am not a priest and I do not have to answer that question in a confessional, because try as I might, I am, with my renewed faith, even less able to give that question the same straight answer I gave in the wayward days of my youth! In the past I writhed at their manipulation and undercutting of the legal system's integrity. Today, after all that I have read of entrapment, MADD, sex abuse hysteria, prison guards turning a blind eye to DUI-offenders being raped, and much, much more, I have to conclude that there simply was no integrity in the system these boys breached.I pray I am not wrong, lest I commit the grievous sin of adulating a work of art that glorifies murder. But, God help me, I know it is not the killing itself that is glorious--how could the taking of a life, except as the willing sacrifice of one's own for one's friend, ever be?--nor the perjury. "Sleepers" glorifies the exposure of a system that is thoroughly rotten and intrinsically damned--simply by virtue of what it is. It further glorifies the organic community: the kids grew up in a real community, they were real friends and they came together, years later--their organic bond had not changed. If Father Bobby breached his duties as a moral authority figure then indeed he damned himself, yet either way he fulfilled his duty as their communal guardian.There are holes in the plot. There are aspects of the moral tone that are objectively questionable. But questions should also be asked about the system that is violated on this screen--and whether it is not itself in dire straits. I would say, and not to endorse Howard Zinn or any leftist revolutionary, that we may well be damaged beyond repair. "Sleepers" claims to be a true story and its moral indignation may well be exaggerated, but that need not discredit its brutally realistic depiction of true injustice.Injustice is not poverty in the Third World. Injustice is what happens to ordinary folk of all races, social classes, and yes, as "Sleepers" depicts and as disgusting as it is, ages in the courts and prisons of my home country. "Sleepers" is criticised, perhaps rightly so, for trumpeting vigilantism and dishonesty, but above all it is the story of an organic order submerged against its will into modern, routine and mechanical "rehabilitation." Forget the fictional controversy. If it can make us long for a more ancient, primordial, and yes, civilised mentality, perhaps it is a positive addition to the canon of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Without Faults: The Best Movie Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Directer Barry Levinson (Rain Man, Toys) gives the best and most emotional film ever made. With the outstanding cast and flawless directing, this movie is perfect. The story is based on four of the closest friends in all of Hell's Kitchen. It shows how close they are as they work together, steal together and sunbathe on roofs together. The story starts to get more interesting when they make one mistake that makes a huge change in their lives forever. The movie shows how they and what they go through when their growing up, what it causes for them when their grown up and how hard they battle to stay out of getting into severe trouble.Kevin Bacon gives what is in my opinion as the best performance in his life, a different but still brilliant performance by Dustin Hoffman, Bruno Kirby's best film I've seen, my favourite of all Robert De Niro and Brad Pitt's character acting performances, one of the few Jason Patrick films I've seen but no disappointment and without a doubt a perfectly delivered performance by Minnie Driver.If I could, I would give this movie eleven out of ten stars, recommend for it to be viewed by everyone and put it in the top ten of the IMDb's top 250. A truly perfect film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this on DVD (I had borrowed it from a friend) I had never heard of it before. Not once. But after crying for like two hours, I realized that this was by far one of the greatest film I've ever seen. The story is superb. I mean really touching, sad and just really well made. The fact that it's about rape and abuse is a little scary, but the way the story, camera work and the cinematography was made it just a little bit easier to understand the horrible truth about rape and abuse. It's kinda hard to explain, but all I can say is that you really don't want to miss this film. The acting was good by the way, but don't let your kids see this, and if you are a "crier" then be prepared. You'll be needing a lot of handkerchiefs during this film. Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Street Warriors: Sleepers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often compared to the Jimmy Cagney classic Angels with Dirty Faces, Sleepers the movie based on the allegedly non-fictional, semi-autobiographical account of coming of age among murder mayhem and the underworld in New York's Hells Kitchen in the 1960s may have been intended to tell a neo-film noire of life from the mean streets through the reformatory and onto the asphalt jungle of adulthood but the genius of Lorenzo Carcaterra managed to present perhaps unintentionally an Irish story in the process. One line in film version sums up the urban Irish of the period Sleepers speaks to: "by the time they figure it out, a(n} {Hispanic} will be sleeping in the White House." Coming of age in the urban village of Hells' Kitchen a neighborhood where the only check on poverty and abuse is the local clergy or the local mobster, four boys, two Irish (John and Michael), one half Irish (Tommy) and an Italian (Lorrenzo nicknamed Shakes)occasionally with their girl pal (Carol), half-Irish and half Puerto Rican cavort around the neighborhood. Hells Kitchen is no garden spot. But here is the Irish working class of the 1960s, 120 years after the great migration, watching later comers the Italians and even more recently the Puerto Ricans pass them by. Yet for all the ill that can be said of these impoverished urban villages, in the neighborhood code of yesteryear in the 1960s, children are not a fair target and both bad guys and good guys are on hand to remind offenders of the law of the street. On the good guy side there is Father Bobby (Robert DeNiro) who is more than the Hoodlum Priest more practical than a passing psalm singer going through the motions along the way. A tower of strength, Father Bobby encourages the boys to cultivate their talents to escape the trap of the neighborhood: the grim choice between accomplished marginality or a life of crime. Only angels or demons walk the streets of Hells Kitchen and there are plenty of temptations for angels down the murky streets. One afternoon temptation overrides good sense. An attempt to steal a hot dog escalates into an unforgivable act. The boys dump the hot dog vendor's cart down a subway entrance onto an unsuspecting passenger. Remanded to the Wilkinson Home for Boys, they are beaten, brutalized, and raped by sadistic guards. After release two, Lorrenzo and Michael turn to semi-legitimate pursuits, the press and law respectively; the other two John and Tommy organize the infamous Westies Gang. Carol not implicated in the offence becomes a social worker in the Bronx. Revenge is not far off. Flash ahead to the 1980s. Reagan is President and even Hells Kitchen is gentrifying to the disgust of the Westies. One of the ex-guards from the Wilkinson Home takes a chance supper in a bar frequented by the Westies and is shot dead by John and Tommy as a knee slapping foot stomping Gaelic folk song masks the war cry in the backdrop. Ron Eldard plays the adult John Reilly with the fearsome look and fu manchu styled mustache of the fabled ancient warrior Vercingetorix. John and Tom face life for that very careless public murder. Now it's up to the good guys, Lorrenzo, Michael and Carol to work the system on both sides of the street to get them off. Can they do it? Officialdom denies that any part of Lorenzo Carcaterra's story is true in any respect. I might have had my doubts but for the unintended the dark message in the ending. Carol will give birth out of wedlock to John Reilly's son who will carry the Hell's Kitchen culture on unto a new generation. Will any wrong ever be righted true or will it be re-doubled and revisited again?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a solid, entertaining movie that was overlooked at the box office.It's a story about a group of boys just being boys, that is until they make a fatal mistake that changes their lives forever.Everyone did an excellent job of acting. DeNiro, as usual, puts in a great performance as a caring priest. And what a stroke of genius not to cast him in the role of the mobster. Hoffman does a great job as the defense attorney. His low key manner adds to his effectiveness in the court.Brad Pitt does a very good job as the assistant DA who ends up playing a game of legal ping pong against himself in the courtroom.Vittorio Gassman was my favorite as the godfather.Bacon does a good job as the low life prison guard. He seems to have made a career out of playing weirdos, psychos, and people on the fringe.But, like I said, everyone did a great job. The child actors also were very convincing and believable. There was none of the overacting usually present with kids.The story, whether true to life or not, was very good and riveting. Even if it isn't true, it did a good job of depicting what probably happens in detention centers all across the country, sadly.There was only one quibble I have with the plot. Instead of Bacon's character being shot in the restaurant, I think it would've been better if they'd waited until he left, and then ambushed him outside, and perhaps give him some of the punishment he gave them.I think this would've added to the realism...and it was strange that no one called up the bartender as a witness, since he probably saw the whole thing.Anyway, minor quibble to an otherwise good story.</fullReview>

Each seems to learn from the other and relationship between them is so tight that the viewer immediately perceives they make contact with one another. Differences and limit between wrong and right, evil and good are not definite here; a prank becomes tragic and four guys who weren't so bad turn into four criminals, but revenge, central element to the film, is here almost justified. After being beaten, sexually molested and tortured, even killing could not be considered so improper, according to the message given. This masterpiece has some scenes, like the ones showing sexual abuses, very strong, maybe too strong, but everything is perfectly real, on the whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kenandraf", to write a mediocre review of this film when it is based in Hell's Kitchen on the west side of midtown Manhattan, and you're in Hawaii takes some guts! (Nevertheless, I thought a review from a real New Yorker might be more pertinent.) This film's all-star cast is enough of a reason to see it, but if that's not good enough for you, Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman, and Robert De Nero are excellent in each of their roles. (Even though I am not much of a Brad Pitt fan, it is one of his better performances as well.) The film also explores the Hell's Kitchen culture from the late 60's-80's showcasing the pre- Giuliani slime that thrived there. 2 thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a weak spot in the movie. Good plot, better dialogue and really good acting. Though it allegedly took place in the '60's and '70's the movie audience in this country wouldn't have been as accepting of it then. Spoiler: Shakes asks Father Bobby to tell his parents that he's doing o.k. regardless of what he hears, "Come on Father, you can do it. Its only a little lie." Without Father Bobby's response we go to the next scene but later when Shakes asks Father Bobby to "save two of your boys" it harks back to this scene ending moment without detracting from the drama by letting the viewers know the outcome of the "little lie." The movie doesn't tell us where "Shakes" gets his nickname but the book tells us that it's from his many library visits and that it is short for Shakespeare. The movie follows the book but doesn't include various minor details.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Theo Robertson needs to watch this movie again because many, many key elements of this movie went right over his head. Most of the questions he asked to show how bad the logic was behind this movie are and were CLEARLY answered in the film. SPOILER ALERT:For example, why didn't the mob hire the best lawyer possible? Because a legitimate lawyer wouldn't go for the illegal trial that was taking place. Did you not get the entire plot that the DA was TRYING to lose the case?As far as matching up the ballistics, do you think that murderers use the same weapon all the time? Not unless they are idiots.I can even very easily answer why the other guard confessed in the trial. For one thing, he was under oath. And it was pretty clear to everyone that the defense lawyer KNEW what had happened. So, to avoid adding perjury to the charge, he confessed. But that isn't even why. People confess things all the time, even when not under oath. Because some people have an attack of conscience. This guard felt guilty about what he had participated in. You are right about one thing however. Three ticket stubs is hardly proof that they were at the basketball game. However, I don't know how things are in Scotland, but in the US, the burden of proof is on the PROSECUTION. The defendant just needs to show reasonable doubt. And a PRIEST testifying under oath that he went to a basketball game with the defendants on the night of the murder, and producing ticket stubs to the game would go a LONG way toward creating reasonable doubt.Seriously, watch the movie again. This time, don't look for mistakes. You ruined the whole movie for yourself and totally missed the ENTIRE plot in doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful but good nontheless...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was incredibly painful to watch. However, given the subject matter, it really was supposed to be. I had a very difficult time during many scenes of this movie, but I have to say the director did a fantastic job of implying, rather than getting too graphic. In movies such as these, suggestion can be just as, if not more, powerful. Even given the difficult moments, Sleepers is a really good movie. You can't help but feel for the young boys...even as they grow into young men; and although two of the boys (now grown) have murdered someone, you can't help but to "root" for them...knowing all that they suffered, and given the person they killed.I've read some reviews regarding the controversy over whether or not this movie was based on actual events. To me, that is irrelevant. The events which take place in this movie are not implausible or unbelievable...right down to the trial. It stands to reason that suffering so greatly as a child can seriously wreak havoc on your psyche...thus causing you to do something you ordinarily probably would not do (Referring more to Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's characters).The young actors playing the part of the four boys did an overwhelmingly fantastic job in their roles. For their performances alone, this movie is worth watching. Their abilities exceeded those of the "top actors" of this film: Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patrick, etc. Robert DeNiro and Kevin Bacon, however, gave stunning performances with Kevin Bacon being downright scary. He did almost *too* good of a job playing a low-life creep.This is definitely not a movie for children, nor is it for those looking for a "light movie". Overall, Sleepers earns an 8 out of 10. My only complaint is that nothing was shown to fill in the gap between growing from boys to men...leaving a bit of a hole. Otherwise, a very good movie.</fullReview>

I said no when I heard that the cast contained Brad Pitt - I wasn't fond of him at that time. About two hours later my brother said to me: "You just HAVE to see this movie - it will blow you away." And I said O.K. since Kevin Bacon (whom I knew from "Footloose") was also in the film.My brother was right - I was totally amazed by the movie. I lost any sense of time and all through the film I was dying to know what would happen next. That movie touched me so deeply - it reached far into me and touched something special like nothing else has ever done. Knowing that it was a true story only made the experience stronger. A fantastic story about three boys who have to suffer so bad at the hands of evil adults and still manage to muster up their strength to fight back.It is a perfect movie - one of the best movies ever made. Unfortunately it didn't get the credit it deserved back in the mid-90's. Everything in this movie is perfect, there is NOTHING bad about it. Nothing!There is only one thing to say: if you still haven't seen this movie - SEE IT!! You won't regret it - it's an absolute masterpiece.</fullReview>

The movie was great but the book is even better. I'm glad to finally see a movie that lives up to the book's potential.The movie is basically about 4 boys who grow up in Hell's Kitchen New York. One hot summer day they decide to try to get some free lunch. So Shakes distracts the hot dog cart man, and the boys pig out. But then they decide to try to lean the cart down the subway stairs. That was the mistake that would change their lives.They are sent to the Wilkinson Home For Boys. There, the guards beat them, rape them, molest them, and emotionally abuse them. The physical and emotional scars from that never healed.So John and Tommy see the leader of the guards, Sean Nokes, in a restaurant and decide to pump his body full of lead. It turns out that Michael has become a lawyer and with his help, and the help of Hell's Kitchen, they expose the truth behind Wilkinsons and get John and Tommy off the hook.Everything about this movie was perfect. From the score, to the acting, to the screen play. All of the characters were perfectly cast. Even Brad Pitt showed that he could be more than just a pretty face. My all time favorites in this movie were Brad Renfro and the little boy who played John. They are very powerful actors and I hope they go to the top.There has been much controversy over whether the book and movie are fact or fiction. I believe that it could well be fact. And even if it's not, it's a wonderful story and it could happen. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Some of the scenes may be a little graphic, but it's all for the better of the movie. 10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the movie of DeNiro!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie had me in three things only. 1)the scene of rape while the child was praying, 2) the directing style of Barry Levinson, using the dark rooms of walls and doors in each rape scene, just Waw!, and 3) The one and only Robert DeNiro, God da..m it isn't he the God of acting or what! There is this one specific scene when Jason Patrick is telling DeNiro what happened with them and how they were raped. In that scene, you don't hear but sad beautiful music and the Camera is focused on DeNiro's face and eyes. So you don't actually hear what Jason is saying because there is only music and DeNiro with his startling acting capabilities tells you the story, which you already know, in his eyes. He is, and you can say I'm exaggerating but I'm not , by every single law of chemistry, logic, drama, and all what the film industry entails, the one single most capable and by far best actor. I don't believe that there might exist people who dare to criticize DeNiro's acting or works in general. He has done marvelous jobs with Scorsese and brilliant in Awakenings, Heat, and others.If you truly seek the best in terms of acting and directing, then you have DeNiro and Barry Levinson in here, you don't need to think twice before watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But, how can I rate a fictional story that is trying to pass itself off as a "true story" when everyone knows Hollywood wouldn't be faithful to a story if they swore on their mother's grave to do so!I have to give this more words than it deserves in order for it to qualify for a review.Why? Because I despise a story that is passed off as truth, when I've been around long enough to know that NOBODY in the movie industry cares one whit for the "truth." This industry is about money and power and that's it.I've seen too many times (AS IN EVERY TIME), when there really is a true story, and the author INSISTS that the movie stick to it faithfully, THEY NEVER DO! (Do your homework. It's a fact.)Let's do what the author and the screenwriter DID NOT do, and admit the motive for the book and the screenplay and the movie was first, MONEY! and secondly LOTS OF MONEY! Of course, after that, everyone wants a name for himself so he'll get paid better the next time around.Face reality. In Hollywood, the only time "truth" is really involved is when it's being hidden.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're going to make a movie that cries out against the raping and general mistreatment of children, then why make it appeal to child molesters? Not to say that if you enjoyed it, you're automatically a child molester, but the scenes depicting all the sexual torture and horribleness...the way everything was handled, I just wanted it all to be over, and you don't want people to feel that way about your movie, no matter what it's about.On another unpleasant note, I used to work at a video store and a rather shady character who made a lot of interesting pornography choices kept asking if we had this movie in stock. I was relieved to inform him that we did not. It was the one day I was actually glad that we had such a meager selection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Hell's Kitchen in the summer 1966. Lorenzo 'Shakes' Carcaterra, Tommy Marcano, Michael Sullivan and John Reilly are prankster best friends watched over by Father Bobby Carillo (Robert De Niro). The next year, they play a prank on a hot dog vendor that almost kills a man. They are all sentenced to Wilkenson Home for Boys in upstate New York where they are abused and beaten by the guards led by Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon) and the other hardened inmates. In 1981, Tommy (Billy Crudup) and John Reilly (Ron Eldard) kill Sean Nokes. In prison, they tell Shakes (Jason Patric) that it's one down. Michael Sullivan (Brad Pitt) is now an assistant D.A. He decides to use the court case to bring the abuse out in the open unbeknownst to Tommy, Reilly and their alcoholic washed-up lawyer Danny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman) with a "slight drug problem". Carol (Minnie Driver) is a childhood friend who is now a social worker. Sleepers are anybody who spent time in juvy.This is too long. The length is probably a problem without a good solution. It demands a ruthlessness from Barry Levinson that may be a little beyond. Every scene needs to be trimmed.I don't like the narration. I don't usually like narration with some exceptions. This is not one of those exceptions. The adult narration also cause additional problems for the kids. The kids had problems to maintain screen presence but they keep getting interrupted by an adult version. The transition between the kids and the adults is a bit abrupt. It's hard to keep the 4 kids straight already. It's even harder to keep the 4 adults straight while maintaining the connection to their kid self.The sexual abuse is a bit awkward. It has to be careful not to turn it into a melodrama. It goes overboard a few times for me. As for the courtroom, the movie struggles to maintain the tension. It's also a struggle to keep track of the plan. Overall, this is an ambitious movie with a few noticeable problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear all, Just wanted to say that "This movie is a movie that I cannot watch again but I can't stop myself". People those who are not into the genre of Crime, Truth, Thriller then I guess this movie Ain't for you.A story revolves around 4 true friend (Brad Pitt and Pals) that starts right from their childhood days and how one incident Changes their entire life forever and something which they cannot forget!!!. Nice way to present the movie and I must say that all the actors really worked hard to get the best out of'em specially brad Pitt, Kavin Bacon and Robert Di Niro. Kavin Bacon has acted so well that you would really start hating him for the role that he played , you couldn't find anyone perfect for this role, just the touch of perfection from him. Robert Di Niro played the role of Priest and knew all four(Brad and Pals) since childhood and how he supported them during bad days, something different from the Great Di Niro this time.Nice way for everyone to learn that there is a right time to seek redemption, Just wait for it. I would have rated this movie more than 10 but I guess It's not in the check!!.Hope you will like it.</fullReview>

Every actor from the new bunch of kids and the big names De Niro, Hoffman, Bacon, Pitt and co. played their respective characters superbly.When I watched the film I could feel the emotions the characters were going through.The story was great, it wasn't slow or very fast paced, it was just right. This way I was able to digest what was happening and why it was happening.The courtroom drama wasn't as intense as other films such as "Time to Kill" or "A Few Good Men" to name a few, however it was different. I don't want to give the story away for those who haven't seen it yet, therefore won't go much into detail.I was shocked to see that approximately 3000 people rated this film 5 or below. I think people do that on purpose so the films which they think should be at the top will stay there.I'm not saying this film should be in the top 250, however I fail to see why any one would rate this film with 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lorenzo Carcaterra is one of the great underrated authors of our time. I LOVE his work. Sleepers is a masterpiece. I'm normally not much of Barry Levinson fan, but he hit this one out of the park. Genius casting, De Niro should have gotten an Oscar nod for this one, the scene where Shakes is revealing what happened to the boys at Wilkinson's is a master class in acting, you can barely hear the dialog, the Oscar Nominated score by John Williams crescendos and all you focus on is the look in Father Bobby's (De Niro) eyes as his heart breaks...you can freaking watch it happen...genius, pure freaking genius...I also really enjoy Kevin Bacon in this movie...he plays a total scum bag who gets his just desserts. The four young actors in the first half were gems. I especially took note of a young Jonathan Tucker ( young Tommy Marcano) watch him, he'll make a mark someday.The adult actors through out, De Niro, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Billy Crudup, Dustin Hoffman, Ron Eldard, Kevin Bacon, Bruno Kirby as Lorenzo's father,Minnie Driver, and the late Vittorio Gassman as King Benny...all gave tremendous performances making Sleepers one of my personal favorite movies. Not a happy movie, but thought provoking, stirring, and a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Dramatic Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepers is a great and memorable movie, a star-studded, Scorsesian drama with grit, intensity, and a fast pace. I'm curious, though, how volatile of a mixture it is, the mixture being a fun, hot, New York gangster movie and a harrowing drama about child rape and abuse in prison. As a whole, the film is very powerful, as it ends up with many great things to see, like an elaborate revenge plot, tense scenes of dialogue, a broad, atmospheric, insular setting in Hell's Kitchen, and a story that spans over a lifetime.Robert De Niro is of course the tough guy of the movie, almost a caricature of himself, playing the unsuspecting role of a priest...who was once a gangster and knows all the gang bosses and dealings in the neighborhood. He is very entertaining as always, though he is the dead giveaway that the film is purely a Hollywood product. Dustin Hoffman, the other veteran in the cast, plays a different sort of role for the swaggering old-timers of cinema. He plays the sort of burnt-out, alcoholic lawyer and plays him with impressively tempered cockiness. These roles may be created with less creativity and more assurance that the presence of the characters and the globally loved actors playing them will work, but it's always incredibly enjoyable when more than one veteran actor from the De Niro/Pacino/Hoffman/Nicholson/Hackman/etc. generation is in the same film thirty years later.Bacon projects a much much different, almost interfering contrast with the super-cool older characters' side of the movie. He is a frighteningly sadistic prison guard whose actions are intensely disturbing beyond that of a great violent gangster picture. His character is more of a demon of feared realism, the sort of character we hate to recognize as the kind of person who exists in reality and that the things that he does are real. Bacon plays him with a devastatingly effective evil.Jason Patric, Brad Pitt, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, and Ron Eldard share both drastic sides of the subject matter spectrum. They turn in great performances, and fortunately with a certainty and stability in their roles that doesn't put the film's general feel at more of a risk that it already is.From a perspective, Sleepers is not uneven and perhaps it doesn't even take hairpin turns in mood by taking two very seemingly incompatable types of films and putting them together as one. What it is, because it sends you on such a roller coaster of a story, making you feel so many different emotions, is epic dramatic entertainment. It's a long journey through gangster violence, brilliant revenge, and very sad stakes and occurrences for the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of film making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read other commentators harp and whine about what was wrong with this film and the answer is nothing! It is a seamless whole with driven performances by all of the fantastic ensemble cast. Of course this is just my opinion, but films like this, that disturb, that challenge the emotions, are the stuff of great drama.Is it true? Who knows? Who cares? It could be? Certainly court cases have turned on far slimmer circumstances than these. Remember the O.J. Simpson case. There are still too many unanswered questions there. So to be considered cheated by the outcome of the story here would be a big mistake. As several others have pointed out Robert De Niro gave what I feel to be one of his best performances. ANd he was matched by the rest of the cast. I especially enjoyed Vittorio Gassman as King Benny. He makes you almost love the mobster, if he were on your side. And this Brad Pitt was a great deal more understated as Michael than he has turned out to be in later films. I for one also had no problems with the voice over narrations, otherwise the film might have taken four hours. And did anyone notice the subtle undertones of the sound score by the master film composer John Williams. How does he do it. I own well over a thousand films and I think he has written the score for about half of them. This is a film not to miss though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Sleepers" in a very fragmented way-it was quite awhile ago and I was alternately running in and out of the room while it was playing. Finnaly, though, I sat down to watch...As many have mentioned, this isn't an easy film to sit through. It is, however extremely moving and well done. The court scenes are riveting. Throughout this bitter tale,You WANT this to end well. The story may not suck you in from the beginning but eventually it is difficult to avoid becoming involved.More then anything, what surprises me about this film is how few people know it exists. The movie is so finely made and has such a superior cast, you'd figure more people would have heard of it. That probebly has to do with the subject matter and the bitterness of the story in general. One thing this isn't is commercial.SPOILERS: I was rather depressed at the end. It really doesn't, ultimately end the way we'd all want but that does add more depth and realism to the story. One thing I've always been confused about is if this is really a true story-I've heard conflicting reports on that. At any rate, this movie is very well done and bitterly sad, extremely difficult to watch, expertly narrated and features strong intense performances. If that sounds like your type of film, go rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some accidents are so grave that you almost don't want to believe that they really happened. "Sleepers" tells of how one such incident set four friends on an incredible path.One day, Lorenzo Carcaterra, Michael Sullivan, John Reilly and Tommy Marcano, all of New York's Hell's Kitchen, steal a hot dog stand. When the owner tries to retake it, they hold it at the top of a subway entrance, hoping to make him grab it. But it's too heavy for them and they accidentally let it go. It falls on a man at the bottom, and the boys are sent to the Wilkinson School for Boys. Most of the boys in this reform school are there for violent crimes, and frequently beat up the four friends. Meanwhile, the guards rape the four friends.Several years later, John and Tommy (Billy Crudup and Ron Eldard) are in a bar and see head guard Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon), who was always raping them. After exchanging a few words, they shoot him. When Lorenzo and Michael (Jason Patric and Brad Pitt) learn of this, they devise a plan to not only try to get their friends acquitted, but to also expose the corruption in the reform school. Dustin Hoffman plays Danny Snyder, the alcoholic lawyer representing John and Tommy, and Robert DeNiro plays Father Bobby, a priest who comes to their defense.A truly remarkable movie. It may disturb you (or rather, it should disturb you). But remember, "Sleepers" is about a long fight for justice. You shouldn't miss it.</fullReview>

Spoilers: Why explain what is coming in the next part of the movie and not come up with a single surprise. It unfolds exactly according to the set plan as explained by Pitt. This lengthy part fails to build a solid foundation around the key part of the case; the alibi explained by De Niro. The confession of the guard during the trail also comes out very easily, worse it seriously endangers the plan by providing a perfect motif. 147 minutes is too long, the movie could have easily done with 20 minutes less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film needs a couple strong warnings before you watch it or show it to someone else. First, it is an incredibly adult film filled with horrific violence--much of it directed towards children. It is NOT a film to show children or someone who hates violent films. Second, if you have been a victim of sexual and/or physical abuse, watching the film might bring up a lot of unwanted feelings and memories. Don't say I didn't warn you.Despite these warnings, I am NOT saying to skip this movie. "Sleepers" is a brilliant and extremely well-constructed film that will keep you riveted on the screen. It is a film you simply can't ignore or feel ambivalent about, as it has so much to say and does it all so well--with wonderful performances, writing and direction.The film begins with a horrific murder. Why these two men would see someone and then decide on the spot to brutally murder the guy is unknown--and you learn through the course of the film why this happened. Sure, the pair WERE career criminals and violent men, but there was far more to it than this...and it all stems from their troubled childhoods in a reform school from hell! And, you learn that the murder victim was no victim after all--the guy was a monster and truly deserved so much worse! What makes all this so interesting, however, is that the prosecutor happens to know EXACTLY why the man was killed, as he, too, had been sent to the reform school and knew about he horrors that occurred there. And so, despite his pledge to do his job and honor the law, he decides to deliberately do a horrible job in prosecuting--as he, too, is thrilled that they murdered the scoundrel.What makes the film even better is that although this murder was justified, the film does NOT have a pat ending. In fact, the way it ends and the wonderfully realistic epilogue make the film. Terrific and honest in how it tells the tale--being truthful to the characters and story from start to finish. See this film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The irony is, I did doze off somewhere in the middle of this film, which doesn't surprise me to be honest, I did try this film twice before giving up after ten or fifteen minutes, but I did still try it again (in full), from director Barry Levinson (Rain Man). Basically four boys (played by Joseph Perrino, Jonathan Tucker, Brad Renfro and Geoffrey Wigdor) play a big prank while growing up in the neighbourhood of Hell's Kitchen, New York, and it ends up with all four of them being sent to the Wilkenson Center. While there they suffer beatings, humiliation and sexual abuse by the guards, including Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). Thirteen years later, the four boys: Tommy Marcano (introducing Big Fish's Billy Crudup), John Reilly (Ron Eldard), Michael Sullivan (Brad Pitt) and Lorenzo 'Shakes' Carcaterra (Jason Patric), have all grown up, and by chance they are all brought back together. They plan to get their revenge against the guards of Wilkenson Center. I sort of lost my way and missed most of this, but I was quite interested in seeing the court case with a man murdered, Michael defending the man accused, Danny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman) on prosecution, and the boys' friend Father Bobby (Robert De Niro) as a key witness. Also starring Minnie Driver as Carol Martinez, Vittorio Gassman as King Benny, Terry Kinney as Ralph Ferguson, Bruno Kirby as Shakes' Father and Frank Medrano as Fat Mancho. The cast and acting talent might be good, but the story could have done with a bit more primping, and it's nothing special, even being based on an autobiography, but it's certainly not bad. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for John Williams. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homophobic Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin, let me state that in no way do I condone child abuse nor do I excuse adults who sexually victimize children. But neither do I condone vigilante-style justice. This author of the book and the makers of this film seem to be of the opinion that sexual predators deserve to die a violent death, and that their killers should be allowed to get away with it. The picture disturbed me greatly for its lack of a sense of true justice, as well as the cheap exploitation and ignorance that the script espoused. I couldn't have been more shocked if this film had condoned mob lynching, genocide, serial killing ? or child abuse, for that matter. Morally wrong is morally wrong, and the defense of vigilantism is morally wrong.Some people continue to insist that this film is based on a "true story" even though the author has never presented credible evidence that it's based on fact. Some have suggested that this was a matter of publicity seeking, but I believe that his insistence that it's based on truth is merely a way of lending its unbelievable plot line more credibility. In this film, Kevin Bacon plays a low-life security guard in a Catholic reform school. He and two other guards routinely victimize and intimidate their young charges, forcing themselves on teenage boys in horrendous acts of sexual abuse. Years later, one of their victims spots the Kevin Bacon character in a restaurant and shoots him dead in cold blood. Unfortunately, there's nothing unbelievable about the plot up to this point. Child abusers do exist, and people do kill for revenge. It's what follows next that is so incredible.The murder is followed by a cover-up at all levels to protect the murderer. We are asked to believe that, in order to exonerate a killer ? a GUILTY killer - a Catholic priest would lie under oath and a prosecutor would throw a capitol murder case, all on the basis of the idea that the "fag" child molester got what was coming to him. Of course, most well-read and enlightened people know that sexual predators who victimize children are almost always heterosexual. And although there is no indication in the film that the Kevin Bacon character is homosexual, many people (probably a majority of people in the US) still wrongly believe that most gay men are child abusers and most child abusers are gay. I believe that this homophobic reasoning underlies the author's conviction that the murderer is justified in his actions; this opinion is further underscored by the fact that the mood of the film when the killer is acquitted is nothing less than celebratory. I also believe that it's one reason why so many people think that a movie in which someone literally gets away with murder is a "great" film.For me, this picture was bad in a dozen different ways that I found offensive ? the storyline reflects bad logic, bad judgment, bad justice, bad morals, bad lessons and bad drama. All combined, this film annoyed me from the first scene forward. The conclusion that murder can be justified struck me as absolutely barbarian, and I was flabbergasted at the fact that such a distinguished group of fine actors would lend their skills to this bigoted, puerile garbage. The more I watched, the more I got the impression that this film, and the book it was based on, was created only to please homophobic adolescents. If you are the sort of ignorant Neanderthal who would think it's OK to commit murder as long as you're blowing away a "sexual deviate", then this film is for you. If you further believe that murder in the name of revenge is not only defensible but perfectly just, then you will find this film rewarding.With all the talk in the news these days about sex abuse victims coming forward to accuse their tormentors, I would have liked this film much more if the boys had simply banded together and accused Bacon and the other guards of the abuse, bringing charges in adulthood for what they suffered as adolescents. Surely if real life victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests can find relief though genuine legal means and have their accusations believed (as so many have done) why not the teens depicted here? A far more satisfying ending would have been for Kevin Bacon (and his cohorts, who escaped any retribution at all, including the vigilante killing) to receive exposure and proper legal punishment.</fullReview>
