		<shortDescription>Sincere and enjoyable feel good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a man puts a classified ad in the newspaper asking for a companion to time travel with him, a magazine writer and two interns go find him to find out his story. Aubrey Plaza plays Darius, one of the interns who at first seems pretty disinterested in the whole situation, ends up being the one who has to pretend like she wants to time travel. She expects to be working with a total nutjob, completely off his rocker, but instead she finds that Kenneth, the man who put the ad in the paper, is actually an incredible insightful, sweet, and softhearted person and that time traveling is more a facade for finding yourself and it's more of a metaphor for fixing old mistakes. It's a surprisingly touching film that has a lot more to offer than one might have expected.Great dramadies are few and far between these days. They are usually too unfocused, can't find that perfect balance between comedy and drama, and try too hard to be profound when it comes to taking a look at the human condition. Safety Not Guaranteed finds a way past all these things. It has a clear and poignant focus that drives a heartfelt and oddly moving story. It's a great blend of comedy and drama as it tells a great story on a very human level, but also delivers its own pleasant brand of comedy. It's more clever comedy than laugh out loud comedy, but it fits just right for what this movie is trying to accomplish.Safety Not Guaranteed could have easily been a sham and it could have gone too far overboard on its profundities. Instead, the excellent script keeps itself at bay and manages to tell a story that is more sincere than one would expect and feels more real than a dramady that is trying to be the most realistic of human stories. There's nothing here that will floor you or blow you out of the water, but it truly is a lovely and heartwarming story.Normally feel good movies aren't my thing, but Safety Not Guaranteed is sincere enough and of a quality that makes it an absolute joy to watch. That being said, I don't know that I'd watch it again, and I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it's great for one viewing and it's an hour and a half well spent. I would certainly recommend it to anyone with a heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful film. The story is science fiction, fantasy and real-life relationships. The plot is unique (I know some reviewers have likened it to the back to the future series which was for fun and was fun). It is not only funny, (laugh out loud funny) but mysterious as to what is really going on and stir in some fantasy and science fiction-- but underneath is the inspection of all human beings and their lives and relationships. The casting was superb and the scenic northwest photography was great, I didn't know any of the actors but suffice to say they were chosen by a director of amazing talent. His idea his plot and his script were really really fine. I saw it in LA in Burbank and the audience was mostly the internet set and they loved it. All of their generations electronic things were a big part of the film, but this masterful director reached me, a senior--explaining the kids and yet reaching me with the love stories and those of friendship. Thus the director brought the old universal story of love among all of us. I can only say he is in for a tough career because with this film he has set the bar for himself and his crew very very high. Based on this work he will be great!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safety Not Guaranteed...3 out of 4 Skittles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOGLINE: Mark Duplass (Puffy Chair &amp; Humpday) plays Kenneth, the local small town weirdo who bags groceries and places a classified ad seeking a companion for time travel. Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation &amp; Funny People) plays Darius, an intern sent in on assignment with her co-workers (Jake M. Johnson &amp; Karan Soni) to secretly pose as potential time travel candidates and get the scoop for the entertainment magazine.Obviously the guy is an insane wack-job?or is he? As Darius gets in closer with Kenneth and slowly finds out more and more about him, she isn't so sure anymore. Can this guy actually do what he claims, or is he so far off his rocker that he has lost all sight of reality? Writer Derek Connolly weaves in and out the possibilities of what is true and keeps the audience guessing until the film's final second payoff.Actors Duplass and Plaza are so great radiating weirdness off of each other. The two form an unusual friendship that rings true in every detail. Jake M. Johnson (New Girl) and Karan Soni add several laughs to the bizarre?yet hilarious story. The film had many chances to lose sight of believability, but finds a way to stay on course.The film's ending left me torn. No matter if you are the kind of person rooting for Kenneth to be vindicated, or believe he is crazy all along?the story keeps you hooked until the credits roll. Safety Not Guaranteed was a breakout hit from the Sundance Film Festival, and contains the spirit of what independent films strive to be. It's authentic, creative, unusual, and a breath of fresh air. It's fun to see what independent filmmakers come up with when they aren't restrained by the annoyance of making every viewer happy. If you are up for something different?do yourself a favor and see this one.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film I've Seen All Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a budget of perhaps 10 box tops from some Cocoa Puffs, this film managed to be the most entertaining thing I've seen all year. The entire cast fits together and play off each other in a delightful way and the ending is great without being sappy sweet or maudlin.I don't want to get into the plot, but Aubrey Plaza's debut as a lead actress is right on target and I see much success for her in the future in a lot more movies. Mark Duplass and Jake Johnson are excellent, and that new kid Karan Soni...well, you'll be seeing more of him in the future is my guess.This is a film I would see again and again, each time it appears in the future. I would take a date to it, I would take kids to it, I would go by myself.I would see it in a box, I would see it with a fox, I would see it at your house, I would see it with a mouse, I would see it here or there, I would see it anywhere! You'll like Safety Not Guaranteed, go see it now, be safe, Godspeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does a film get a standing ovation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often I stumble across the kind of film that captures both heart and soul, the kind of film that makes me laugh and cry, makes me scoot forward on the edge of my seat, not because of the thrill of the chase or the climax of dramatic tension, but simply because I am cheering for the characters to make it! Because somehow my hope has found a way to attach to the hope of the characters, because I have felt strangely welcomed into their journey, because I am longing to believe that this world is more than a cold, cynical place, and that something beyond the natural may just be possible. There are lots of "feel-good" movies about relationships and love, but not quite as many that touch a chord deep within all of us that is usually reserved for the realm of religion or spiritual experience. Sometimes, a movie is made that feels transcendent. For me, that is how I left the theater after watching Safety Not Guaranteed at Sundance. It helped that the packed theater erupted in a cathartic cheer at the movie's final moment, which tells me that something else was going on for my fellow film-goers as well. In short, I think that this funny, engaging, interesting, character-driven, heart-warming independent film shot on a shoestring budget on location in Oregon touched that part in all of us that longs to believe in the unbelievable, that wonders if the "impossible" might, just might possibly be true after all.Safety Not Guaranteed is about Kenneth (Mark Duplass), a man who is creating a time machine and places an ad in a local classifieds looking for a partner to time travel with him. The ad tells readers: "This is not a joke. Bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed." Intrigued, a local magazine decides to send a staff-writer (who has his own time-travel agenda of revisiting a 20 year old high-school first love) and two interns to find the author and see how crazy he really is. The film weaves the boy-meets-girl main storyline with two sub-plots of self-discovery: the thirty-something writer's encounter with his old high school fling, and the classic-nerd intern encouraged to make his own youthful fling. Initially playing the part, Darius the intern (Aubrey Plaza) starts to fall for a man driven by his passion, with whom she finds a connection in her own past pain and regret. Not your Back To the Future time travel story, we never see the machine until the end, and the director leaves us wondering if it even exists. And yet, we are led masterfully throughout the narrative to long for, maybe even start to believe that Kenneth is "for real" and that he has stumbled onto the kind of adventure that transcends the pain of the ordinary present. Without this hope for the impossible, this longing for "another world," Safety Not Guaranteed would be just like any other romantic comedy where the misfit get the girl, and the cynical girl forgives herself and opens her heart to love.The beauty of the film is in its hope-filled longing, its call to believe. We stand at the lake beside the time machine with Darius, watching Kenneth stretch his hand out and ask us to take a step of faith, to put into action what we have been secretly hoping was possible. For the first time Darius has to take a real step to truly believe, which is a great conclusion to the film. Isn't that the heart of faith in God? There are many who say they believe and hope very much that it is all true. But in the end, are we willing to step out onto the boat and commit, when the outstretched hand beckons us to put our trust in Another and when the whole thing looks rather silly or (worse), rather crazy? Such is the story we are all asked to live, and a movie like Safety Guaranteed gets an audience standing ovation because we know Darius' step of faith is ours as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a joy it was to watch "Safety Not Guaranteed"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Every character was memorable and superbly portrayed. It was sweet and at the same time had a cutting edge especially if you read between the lines.The story was incredibly well crafted and will stand the test of time because it left just the right amount to the imagination. It was a fairy tale, but a beautifully told and very human one.This was a movie crafted with care from both the mind and the heart. I also saw Prometheus this summer and found it sterile, empty and pointless, everything this movie isn't.But in the end it was the characters and writing that made this movie so enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical Little Gem That Makes You Believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Grocery clerk Kenneth (Mark Duplass) places an ad in a local paper asking for someone to go with him as he time travels. He says they'll be paid once they return but safety isn't guaranteed as he's only done this once before. A magazine writer (Jake Johnson) hears about the story and takes a long a couple interns, one named Darius (Aubrey Plaza), quickly gets caught up with the time traveler as she applies for the job without him knowing that she's actually on a job. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is a pretty strange film to classify because it's part comedy and there are certainly some very light moments but the film also has a tremendous heart, which lets the characters actually be characters and this leads to some pretty dramatic moments. I guess the best way to classify this film is just by calling it life because it pretty much has a little bit of everything in it. What I found so good about the picture is simply how cute and charming it actually is. The reporters go into this story expecting to find a crazy man because we all know that time travel can't happen. What works so well with the film is the fact that you makes you believe that these type of things are possible and you really get caught up with all the characters and their situations. By the time the movie is over, and I won't spoil the ending, you're leaving the theater with a smile on your face no matter what your brain might tell you afterwards. Duplass and Plaza are simply perfect together as both of them bring the weirdness and loneliness out of their characters but they also have such a warm and wonderful chemistry that you can't help but fall for both of them. I also thought Johnson was extremely good in his supporting role as is Karan Soni as the other intern. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is really a magical little gem that is a breath of fresh air if you're wanting to get away from the loud blockbusters of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>witty, touching, sweet, memorable--Standing O at the end at Sundance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the get go I expected this movie to be my favorite at Sundance. It was. It was charming, witty, quirky and totally kicked ass chuck norris style. You get to know several characters and each has their moment in the sun, though Aubrey gets the bulk of the great lines. There could have been even more of her deadpan delivers. That would have suited me fine. The writer did do a good job of balancing the story lines and showed intimate aspects of each character. I'm not sure how believable the relationship was between the main characters, but that didn't bother me too much (i was probably just jealous i wasn't building my own time machine to pick up chicks). While the movie seems to survive mostly on simple ideas and witty remarks, I wanted to go on that adventure too. He lived in a world that was about as normal as you can get in hick-sticks, USA. Like most of us as we get a little older, adventure passes us and is replaced by juice boxes and diaper changes. This move appeals to all kinds and touches us in memorable ways. Even if you don't have a time machine, you can always add a little adventure in your life and you can appreciate it even more when you have a partner you can trust with your life--safety not guaranteed though. ;o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but quite interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Travel in time is definitely my favorite sub-genus of science fiction, and even though I equally adore the creativity of the Back to the Future trilogy, the historical humor of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and the apocalyptic solemnity of The Terminator, I also appreciate the independent films which deal the subject with more sobriety and philosophy. Films like Primer and Suspension have compensated their low budget and visual simplicity with provocative ideas which leave the mechanics of travel aside in order to focus on the melodrama created by the characters, proving that there's no need of flying cars or phone booths when there's an ingenious narrative inhabited by realistic and interesting human beings. Even though I didn't like it as much as Primer or Suspension, the film Safety Not Guaranteed fits into that group, even though it doesn't necessarily include too much time travel. Or maybe it does. I'm not sure...but that uncertainty is one of the best elements from this film.Safety Not Guaranteed isn't a traditional sci-fi film. There may be time travel, there may be not...but the point of the screenplay isn't finding temporal paradoxes nor playing with historical chronology, but gradually discovering the nature and interaction between interesting characters, each one of them focused into their own "adventure". Screenwriter Derek Connolly built a complex but accessible narrative tapestry, free of unnecessary filler and with ingenious parallels which aren't always apparent, but eventually lead us to a satisfactory ending.Connolly shows an efficient control over the multiple sub-plots, and they all share subjects in common. And then, we have the perfect performances from the whole cast. Mark Duplass brings a simultaneously likable and mysterious personality to his character, something which is very appropriate. Jake Johnson is very funny in his role; his performance is similar to the one he brings in the sitcom New Girl, even though it feels more emotive and sincere in here. Karan Soni is credible in his character, and supports the other actors very well. However, the revelation of Safety Not Guaranteed is definitely Aubrey Plaza, who is able to express multiple emotional levels with the grim face and cynical attitude of her character.On the negative side of Safety Not Guaranteed, I can't deny that there are a few pretentious and auto-indulgent scenes. And even though Ryan Miller's score generally complements the scenes well, it occasionally feels a bit affected. Nevertheless, I think Safety Not Guaranteed is a very good movie, and I can recommend it mainly because of its screenplay and its performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Summer Sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like smart dialogue, an imaginative narrative, and well developed character, SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is your film. The premise is well articulated with believable relationships portrayed by a talented cast. Audrey Plaza's star turn took the dopey outsider and added her own understated charm that illuminated every frame, especially the campfire scene with Mark Duplass. His performance was perhaps the riskiest.....playing a lonely but driven crusader whose character took a little from FISHER KING, a little from HEROS, a little more from BEAUTIFUL MIND and added a touch of STARMAN.The ending might have seemed contrived without the sincerity of director Colin Trevorrow. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED was certainly the best film I've seen so far this summer especially after my disappointment with Wes Anderson's most recent effort. It was its last night in Tallahasee attended by perhaps only a dozen people.....surprisingly many stag guys who weren't afraid to laugh out loud. I wonder how many of them were time travelers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Synthetic Mumblecore RomCom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the poster touts "From the Producer of "Little Miss Sunshine." It's actually only one of the Producers. The true genius behind the terrific "...Sunshine" is sadly lacking here. This film is the venue of the Duplass brothers of mumblecore fame. (Brother Mark took the lead role.) And mumblecore "Safety Not Guaranteed" is. (One wonders if the Duplass boys will ever move forward.) One expecting more SciFi adventure finds disappointment in "Safety Not Guaranteed." This is simply an Indie RomCom with a smidge of quirk and a little SF. As a RomCom it's a fairly standard damaged goods story: alienated girl loses her Mother; iconic, self-conscious guy who is either a genius or completely nuts. By end credit's roll we find he may be both. Her motivation for returning to 2001 is to save her Mother. His, we find, is to save a love killed in an auto accident. The revelation his lost love was not killed and lives not too far away (Kristen Bell in a cameo) is a tossed in deceit that's right out of the RomCom play book. But it cheapens the character and story, particularly in the lame way he reacts to being called on it.These two souls find each other when a lazy journalist undertakes writing a magazine story based on an ad seeking a time travel partner. He takes along, and abuses, two interns: our heroine and a geeky, game-obsessed Indian. The journalist's ulterior motive is to look up a high school flame he's never forgotten. This parallel love story leads nowhere and simply provides balance and further proof safety is not guaranteed in love's arena. Then there's the virgin Indian the Journalist leads to getting laid.The Indian is a stereotype, and that goes down a little hard. It's certain the character was written with the best comedic intentions but the portrayal veers over the line. And the big de-virginizing is a yawn as seen in every teen comedy featuring a male who must be rescued from his virginity by a more experienced male. Ms. Plaza does fine, but her snarky edge is off putting. That leaves little empathy for her. She's written to be hollow following her Mother's death, but Ms. Plaza fails to plumb the void she carries within. Mr. Duplass is sufficient. Nothing more, nothing less.The destination, 2001, is tantalizing. Within that date is a small kernel of a great addition to this lame tale; live in the present. Unfortunately it's unpopped. Conversely, using 2001 is macabre.The technical execution is muddy, dark, desaturated cinematography and lackadaisical editing. Mumblecore exemplified.The little charm and few laughs contained in "Safety Not Guaranteed" are greatly overshadowed in a hackneyed plot the filmmakers try to hide under a synthetic blanket of something greater. The film also tries too hard to be hip and only partially succeeds. The result is barely watchable. Queue up if an exercise in Mumblecore 2.0, RomCom is your thing. Otherwise protection of your film viewing sensibilities is not guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With witty lines and well written characters we're entertained through to the original ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Safety Not Guaranteed" is based on an actual classified ad placed in a magazine, looking for someone to go back in time with. The real ad was just a joke for last-minute content. The movie, though, wonders what if it wasn't a joke. One young writer and two young interns are assigned to the story to figure out who is behind the ad, and how crazy he is.Darius (Aubrey Plaza) is a sarcastic, defensive lost soul and appears to have at least some kind of genuine interest in the story. Jeff (Jake M. Johnson) is the staff-writer taking the lead but his only interest in the story is that he gets to go to the town where his high school crush lives. Arnau (Karan Soni) is tagging along because he does whatever will look good on his resume. The guy they are hunting down is Kenneth (Mark Duplass) and he truly believes that he is building a time machine. Darius forms an immediate connection with the guy and wants to help him with his adventure. Jeff immediately pegs him as a lunatic, so that just means he has more time to go skirt-chasing.These are good characters, better written than what you would expect to find in a simple comedy. Each have their reasons for being there; each have a time they want to get back to; and each have something they want to experience. They also appear to be responsible in determining how much you will enjoy this movie. The rave reviews and the standing ovation reports coming out of Sundance all mention how much the characters echo their own lives. As if the writer has found the true essence of being a human being. However, there are people, me included, who don't actually connect to any of the characters but still found their plights and misadventures amusing.This is a well written film, as most successful indies are. It thrives on witty lines and its ability to fully explore each of the characters. The first point makes it a comedy but the second point, the main one, makes it a drama so be prepared for a more thoughtful journey than just a laugh riot.It is fairly original, especially with the much talked about ending, but I personally found that the low-budget indie "Juko's Time Machine" (2011) handled a similar concept in a much more ingenious way. "Safety Not Guaranteed" added fresh spins to basic concepts and was funny and entertaining throughout, just be careful with some of the comparisons it's getting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That which stole my heart at Sundance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a delightful farce with a huge heart. Spurred on by a mysterious Craigslist ad one lackadaisical reporter (Jake M. Johnson) and two (less than) eager interns (Aubrey Plaza and Karan Soni) set out to find the man promising time travel to a suitable partner. One of the interns, Darius, is a girl with a dark past and her own reasons for wanting to travel back in time. As it becomes clear that only she can reach out to Kenneth (Mark Duplass), the reclusive inventor of the elusive time machine, she moves deeper into a world that she cannot fathom and may lead only to heartache. For Kenneth's mystery is magnetic and she finds herself falling for him despite herself and regardless of whether or not he actually has a time machine. As government agents close in and her boss applies pressure to get the story, Darius has to make a choice. Either opt for the incredible or dismiss Kenneth as the nut job most people believe him to be. The film hinges on her choice and it's unclear until the last frame of the film as to whether or not it pays off. The weak link of the film is probably the story of the reporter, Jeff and the other intern, Arnau, whose drunken exploits do little to add to the whole of the film. The film is a story that teeters between hope and devastation. Toeing the line between insanity and faith, the film weaves together three (at times stumbling story lines) as the characters discover what it is they truly need to survive in a world gone mad. In an age of Facebook, Twitter and endless, unrelenting loneliness the film explores the push and pull of the need for community and the trust it takes to reach out to something larger than one's self. Ultimately, Safety Not Guaranteed is a story of belief, hope, relationship and the importance of the trust we place in others. Its few flat notes are more than made for by its plucky heart and wry humor, which leaves the audience smirking until the very end.</fullReview>

The story line was very interesting and gripping at times.However, not sharing spoilers here, the film sort of ended on a high note - but no real closure. I feel there was more room to develop in some areas. For example what has happened to the main charterers after the ending, or maybe some more of the relationship between Jeff and his former (high-school?) girlfriend.. I needed 40 more minutes to tie in this feature nicely.Maybe there will be a director cut of the film? maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED - SF lite, Quirky heavy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another entry in the recent lite Sci-Fi sweepstakes: Films such as ANOTHER WORLD, MELANCHOLIA, SOUND OF MY VOICE which use a slight SF tinge in what would otherwise be 'straight' non-genre movies. The film that SF fans will probably most closely associate it with is HAPPY ACCIDENTS. Both are Rom-Coms with a woman entering into a relationship with an oddball man who claims to be a time-traveler.SAFETY is based on a real (if planted) classified ad that ran in Backwoods Home Magazine several years ago: "Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed." The ad has been adapted by screenwriter Derek Connolly into a story about Darius (Aubrey Plaza), a magazine intern, who tracks down the Ad's author Kenneth (Mark Duplass, who also Co-produced with his brother Jay). Of course, a deeper relationship ensues.SAFETY's problem isn't so much its Sundance quirkiness quotient as much as its structure. If the film had stayed with the central relationship with Darius and Kenneth (as in 'What's the Frequency, Kenneth'?) it may have worked. The actors work well together and Plaza is particularly engaging. Unfortunately, the film has Darius working with a lead reporter (Jake Johnson) and another intern (Karan Soni). The intern is a nerdy horned-rim glasses wearing Indian science student who's only function seems to be as a convenient "comedic" foil for the reporter. Every time the main relationship seems to be building momentum, Director Colin Treverrow cuts away to a subplot involving the Reporter and an old flame. It's not so much that the subplot is poorly played, nor somewhat story driven (Darius has to report to somebody 'neutral', I suppose), but, it seriously undercuts what should be the main thrust of the story - Darius &amp; Kenneth. So, by the time we get to the climax, it feels rushed and unsatisfying.The throwaway ending is even more frustrating for those hooked by the film's initial premise. Even worse, hints are laid of something consequential as the reason that the protagonists want to time-travel, but they are left unfulfilled as well. Of all the films mentioned in this sub-genre, SAFETY has the least edifying conclusion of them all, appealing stars and all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The script had no depth, lame characters, and predictable scenes. I will use the scene where the so called weirdo was hanging around the fire with the over the top clingy desperate girl (sorry for lack of names but I will take no effort in remembering them for they as characters were forgotten at the beginning of the credits). She asks him about the guitar, he says he dose not play well, she encourages him, he then proceeds to rock out like he's been performing live at gigs for the past 5 years, she says it was amazing, he tries to decline the comment, then the 'moment', and then finally the make-out. Sorry for the spoiler but seriously, if you haven't seen a film with a scene like that you have obviously been under a rock. I called it before it all happened, and don't think I'm tooting my horn as my movies watching experience is on the minimal. Boring and non likable people, and the weirdo wasn't even a believable one, he seemed like he was forcing his weirdness and really trying to separate himself from the norm. The supporting cast was just as bad, as they too had no substance and very cliché. The dick's love life with his past romance was terrible in that is was going no where, had no beginning, no middle, and for some reason the dick acted like it was something, and that was a forced end. The Indian was corny, and his development reached the climax where he gets laid by a minor... Lame and no personal accomplishment. They only achievement is from the girl who finally gets laid and has some one love her, for she had that tragic event that is suppose to separate her from society because of the death of her mother. She is weak and uses that setback as the main reason for her relationship. Seriously, I don't think she is listening to half of what the weirdo is saying because she literally seems shocked at the fact that he lied to her. We watched this movie on the sole reason of its initial rating, and I could only think that this movies marketing team must of played a part in it. From a previous rating, mentioning the weirdo as the most hated character of all time, I agree, as I was wanting to punch the dude in the head near the end. If your going to be weird and genius like, the get it right. Lame lines, scenes that didn't make sense to the context, and horrible presence. For anybody wanting a unique film, this is not. The ending saved it from being a complete waste as this was the only thing that didn't make me walk out. But being a movie, and reaching for a climax, it has to keep its viewer stationary. Even the ending was the ultimate Lame. She goes in to his arms after the a small duration of actually knowing this idiot, and only being in his actual home once, and the common it was love that was meant to be because we are both 'different'. Something this movies tries way to hard to be but comes off as any other mainstream movie and forces out predictable lines on lame characters with yawn filled scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising Beginning, Pointless and Boring Development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Seattle, the editor of a magazine, Bridget (Mary Lynn Rajskub), assigns the cynical reporter Jeff (Jake Johnson) and the interns Darius (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni) to find and interview the author of an advertisement inviting a companion for a time travel.They travel to a coastal town in Washington and Jeff leaves Darius and Arnau watching the PO Box. Darius finds that the man is Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass), who works in a supermarket. Meanwhile Jeff's only interest is to find his former sweetheart that lives in town and Arnau wants to have sexual experience. Now Darius has to find whether Kenneth is a lunatic or has really invented a time machine."Safety Not Guaranteed" is a comedy with a promising beginning, with funny and witty dialogs and situations. Unfortunately, in a moment the story becomes pointless and boring romance that goes nowhere. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Sem Segurança Nenhuma" ("Without any Safety")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I did just not like this movie at all. Not at all.Partly because I expected, or hoped, it would be pretty different than it turned out to be. This movie is just one big tease. I did not like either of the two male leads, don't quite know why. Did not like Mark Duplass' character, because he looks kind of stupid, and acts it. And I did not care much for Jake Johnsons character, because he's a douche. They sort of grew on me a little, but not nearly enough. The girl I liked. Well, at least didn't dislike.I did like, very much so, seeing Jeff Garlin (from The Goldbergs) in his tiny little role. I hoped to see more of him. Wah-wah.Had I been prepared for what kind of movie this was before watching it, I might have liked it better, but had I known that I would never have bothered seeing it.Kooky character, that might not be quite what he/she first seems, befriends cooler character that slowly starts 'getting' kooky character.. with a lot of guitar and pling-plong music.. yuck, I'm freaking sick of it. I hate romance, haha. Also I did not laugh one single time, and did not find the story interesting. Honestly I just waited for something that never came, because my lacking research of this movie beforehand.The movie itself is not directly bad, I'm sure a lot of people like it, but my cup of tea and biscuits it is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And unlikely and touching romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea what to expect from this film, but within about 5 minutes I was hooked. Aubrey Plaza plays Darius, a dry-witted and cynical magazine intern desperate to move up the ranks and write her own articles. When an opportunity arises to assist on an assignment to investigate a man who claims he can time travel, she jumps at the chance. She befriends the man, Kenneth, and plays along with his eccentricities in order to win his trust and be accepted as his time travelling partner.The characters are excellent - quirky yet humane, with snappy and witty dialogue that reminded me of 'Juno' - which is important with a story as character led as this. Mark Duplass as Kenneth is superb, and somehow manages imbue the character with enough eccentricity for us to question Darius's trust in him, whilst being endearing enough for us to buy her attraction to him. If it wasn't for my investment in the characters, I think I would have felt the pace lag. There is a lot of repetition as Kenneth trains Darius in preparation for their mission - but I was kept guessing right until the end as to whether Kenneth's time travelling claims would be revealed as a product of a wild imagination or brilliant scientific mind. At the end of the day it didn't really matter. This is the story of two damaged souls who form an unlikely bond and make each other whole, and that in itself was utterly touching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Time Warp'ed Guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Safety Not Guaranteed was made 5 years ago, no doubt the character played by the hilarious Aubrey Plaza, would've been played by Ellen Page and Mark Ruffalo would have replaced Jake Johnson as Jeff.Now, as mentioned, Plaza is very funny, but sadly, she, almost note-by-note, reprised her Parks and Recreation TV role. That said, if you liked her there, she'll continue to crack you up here. (Thankfully, both Mary Lynn Rajskub from TV's 24 and The League's Mark Duplass, did not follow suit by mimicking their TV characters. Not in the least.)Safety Not Guaranteed follows the typical set pattern for independent filmmaking, leading up to and including the ending. And even with that, this was highly enjoyable. It's funny, touching, inventive and keeps you guessing until the end.Magazine interns Darius and Arnau are forced into joining Jeff in investigating a possible wacko in the form of a "Time Traveler," Kenneth, outside of Seattle, WA. (Oh, and nice to see my favorite city again.)Kenneth's building what he thinks is a time machine and is seeking a friend for the journey. Darius "volunteers" and you know where this is going, but they keep a few little surprises along the way. Incidentally, the other characters grow in often hilarious and deep ways.The movie also has a great song, Big Machine, played surprisingly beautiful by Duplass and very decent cinematography. Despite the independent feel, these people knew what they were doing.It's also short, and it runs exactly how long it needed to run. The characters were developed, the humor and "lie-part" of the story was adequate and the heart was definitely present in more than a few shots.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty placed in time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often, a film comes along that gives you silent pause as the credits roll up at the end. This is one of those films. Darius (played by Aubrey Plaza) is a young woman who feels out of place in the world. She enjoyed a happy childhood, marveling at the natural wonders of the world, but the death of her mother at the age of 14 created a bubble of indifference which has surrounded her ever since. She's interning at Seattle Magazine, a publication ran by the career driven Bridget (Mary Lynn Rajskub).On the morning Brainstorming session for new editorial pieces, Bridget asks for ideas. Jeff (Jake Johnson), one of the full-time journalists, suggests a story on a quirky new ad he had recently become aware of;"Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed."Jeff's motivations for the story are far from sincere. He hopes to reignite a romance with an old flame, a woman who has never left his mind, and one who haunts him more as he feels his identity being corrupted in the world of Bridget. Bridget agrees to the story, and so Jeff takes two interns with him on his 'vacation' - Darias, who's imagination was stirred by the ad, and Arnau, a naive young Indian graduate whose intellect rules his instincts.And so the journey begins to find out whether Kenneth (played by Mark Duplass) - the enigmatic ad-writer - is a delusional maniac or genius-time-machine-inventor. A man who works in a supermarket. Who believes he is getting followed by the government. This is a film about time, regret, and the natural human yearning to be more than we are. But, it's also a film about hope, determination, and believing the beautiful moments await us should we be wise enough to let go. Very few films still have me wondering how it will end with just 15 minutes left.Kenneths (Duplass) character is fascinating to watch. Riddled with insecurities, it's easy to write him off as a kook. But a poignant few moments with nothing more than a camp fire and a zither suddenly have you re-evaluate the substance of the man. As Darias wrestles with the wonders that Kenneth brings to her world, an unconventional romance blossoms. Watch the movie, drop all expectations before you do. It will be different to anything you watched before. Enjoyably so.</fullReview>

Seriously?Safety Not Guaranteed is a poorly written, acted, directed, and edited romantic comedy with an obnoxiously predictable ending. This is what independent film has to offer us these days? Where's the risk? It's so sad that indie filmmakers just crank out the same Kate &amp; Leopold crap. At least Hugh Jackman looked good in tight pants. Stop pretending that inserting a time machine somehow makes your film quirky. It doesn't. Your ideas are mediocre at best. This movie had so much potential. I don't dislike Aubrey Plaza or Mark Duplass, but there's absolutely no chemistry here. Two weirdos don't always make a right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond overrated, makes you wonder about the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately this movie makes me seriously wonder how influenced the critics are by the players, producer or some other element that appeals to the "artsy." Someone else described a film school script and I'd have to agree. It's a formulaic romcom you've seen 1,000 times before, is predictable with a want to be witty script that doesn't feel natural at all with a lot of mediocre acting.The problems are multiple. You know that the movie is going to be dud when you can see what the time travel ruse is virtually from the start. I groaned and thought... oh boy... seen this 1,000 times before. "Make characters change from the "bad" to being really "good" or what we want them to be." But none of it is credible and the script is truly laughable. It's a coming of age script with virtually no likable characters except for the innocent, sweet (stereotyped) Indian who Jeff (Jake Johnson) is trying to corrupt. His character is a scripted, wildman jerk that is drawn so far over the top so as to be ridiculous.Aubrey Plaza tries her hardest to play a bratty but "hip" young woman who also comes of age, like the stereotyped Indian, shes's the the stereotypical "self-involved with a quirky oddity" girl. Girl meets a little crazy boy and then the magic starts to happen. But there is no magic. Mark Duplass isn't a convincing Kenneth, mutters his lines quickly as if from a memorized script, gets a very staged and plastic scene to show off his ability to play the zither and is never likable. He's also not convincing as all and the romance element is so awkward, forced and icy that it's not believable. Oh... and then comes the twist which comes in a flash as if the script called for it as per the formula. Worst of all is that the after the reveal, the script doesn't make any sense whatsoever. The "problem" to be solved has already been solved. The "explanation" as to why it's still happening is like a 5 year old child babbling excuses after having his hand caught in the cookie jar. When each card begin to be overturned, the film gets more ridiculous with each stupid turn it takes. And when it hits the preposterous ending, you will completely regret seeing the movie and realize what an amateurish bit of nonsense this is that passes for a passable film. Wow... how absurd will this movie get?And the shaky camera. Good heavens, did they not know what a tripod was before they filmed? If this bit of hipster nonsense is what passes as great independent film these days then I might want to jump into a time machine to get away from the dismal future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed is the sort of attempt to be cute and whimsical that makes me want to go on tirades in IMDb reviews, but I simply won't. I'll just point out that this sort of faux-whimsical hipsterish trash may only appeal to a select group of people. It may however make everyone else want to tear their hair out. Specifics? Chiefly, I found there to be a dearth of likable characters. I found Aubrey Plaza to be horribly miscast. She comes off like a shallow brat with no redeeming qualities, and the male journalist (played by Jake Johnson from New Girl) is obnoxious. All the acting is average, but I'm singling out Mark Duplass. He has a pivotal role here, and he's absolutely soulless. His eyes are dead.

I enjoyed every minute of this movie. very pure, hopeful, fun, loving and fascinating. this little film was crafted with wonderful storyline, dialog, plot and best of all, nice casting. The film brilliantly handles very complex themes involving the past and regret. But the film isn't just about going back and changing something in your past. It is mostly about the power of love to heal emotional wounds.g is full of sense of humor and wit. The story is of a alone girl is named Darius, who works as an intern at a vain magazine. Her mom died when she was little, and she has been anti- social as long as she can remember. One day, her boss decides to take her and another intern on a trip to write a story about a man who placed an add in the paper: Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed. So Jeff, the shallow, self absorbed writer, takes Darius and the other intern to the small seaside town to find out about this guy. The man's name is Kenneth, and when Darius talks to him, she finds herself falling for him, and even believes he may be able to go back in time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Safety Not GuaranteedWhat a fabulous, inventive, light hearted, fun, well constructed, well written independent movie. Yes, all of that. Is it a bit creaky? Yeah, sure, like "Detour" or "Sex, Lies, and Videotape," sure. Maybe that inflates this a bit (is this a new classic, I don't know), but it makes you think it might manage a following might grow on this one. The basic premise kicks in fast--someone has an ad in the paper asking for a someone to go time travelling with them. "Bring your own weapons." And the title to the movie.A group of three quirky and likable reporters working for an independent newspaper set out to find the sender of the message and find out what kind of a nut he is. (Their point of view, naturally, is that time travel doesn't exist.) And he really is a nut. But a likable nut, so the four of them cross paths and interact and the unlikely becomes more unlikely except that relationships and maybe even love manages to blossom.And the parallel needs of relationship--trust, communication, apology--appear in the need to understand this man's time machine idea, which seems ludicrous. But the time machine might not matter after all as the personalities develop. In all, it surprised and enchants you, this plot and this movie both. This is director Colin Terverrow's first full fledged movie for the theater, and it feels like it is bursting at the seams and it could have been something brighter and shinier with more money. But I'm glad it was limited, and the few special effects required are primitive, and the whole shooting and acting is in real places without glitz. It's a wonderful example of how an indie movie is partly successful because of its indie qualities.</fullReview>

A boss that manipulates the expense account and system for his own purposes? That abuses interns? A cynical hipster girl ? This is all original stuff. In 1948 maybe. The dialogue &amp; humor (if we can call it that) is banal. The acting (or possibly the directing) made me notice they were acting. The ending was "so what". And anyway, what was the safety concern?

As I mentioned above, it came to the conclusion with their successfully achieved time-traveling. Given that it is basically human drama, it is spectacular that the story suddenly switches the contents to the scientific fiction. It is well enough to attract the attentions of audience.However, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered: how does he invents the time-machine, when are they exactly heading for and what about the story of sub-characters. Considering it keeps these matters vague, you can say the story is poorly finished. To sum up, you can enjoy yourself with the movie except the very last part of the story, which slightly let me down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not understand what the film is about, because it includes romance, comedy, human relationship, and SF. However, I can see that the lead character recovers vigor, since she makes friendship with the man. This is because the man has a kind of darkness, and she also has something like that. They feel sympathy for such gloomy feeling, and they recover vigor together because of each other's existence. On the other hand, there are complex relationships between the journalist and two students. It is difficult for me to understand their relationship, because they cooperate as journalists, but sometimes they have argument. There is unclear connection between them. By the way, this film seems to be made with low costs. However, the chap-look plays an important role that makes the film more real. And there are no extremely handsome or beautiful actors. This also makes the film more real, because we can feel familiar with it.</fullReview>

The scene that Jeff and Arnau have fun with women is nonsense and boring. I think this film is lackadaisical as the love story, as the science fiction and as the comedy.

Moreover, I think the film would have been just as emotionally satisfying if the two arrived at a point where Darius understood Kenneth as that would have been a long journey as is.It could also be argued that Jake Johnson's character of Jeff isn't particularly well hashed out. Is her a jerk with a heart of gold we're supposed to root for? He's still kind of obnoxious even when he's helping his intern get laid and he never really respects him.Also, why do all independent films have to use the same score and strive so hard to feel like they're hip? Despite that, the film was punctuated with an effectively pleasant aura, the movie was interesting and there's a lot to say about building a story around a "red herring" that undoubtedly works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a prime example of an original film. We always hear about people complaining with the lack of originality in Hollywood, well Safety Not Guaranteed is about as fresh as a film can get. It tells the story of a group of journalists who investigate and attempt to write a story on a man who put out on ad for a companion on his time travel mission. It already sounds like a strange kooky film, but throw in Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass and you have a smart off beat comedy.I ultimately decided to watch the film because Colin Trevorrow, the director, is helming the upcoming Jurassic World. And even though this film isn't the best test to see how he can handle a huge blockbuster, I think it shows that he will bring something fresh to the franchise. I don't the last time I saw a film as original as Safety Not Guaranteed. It has many flaws, including Jake Johnson's subplot, but I always felt like this film was setting out to make a story about finding the right pair or romance. Each character's story is about finding the companion. So in reality, each character goes on their own time travel mission throughout the film. Aubrey Plaza was perfect for the role of a strange, semi-antisocial woman who finds certain things mysterious and interesting that other people wouldn't care about. Duplass was equally as good at creating a peculiar guy who is trying to build a time machine in a non sci-fi film.There were times the film veered off into uninteresting story lines, such as Johnson's subplot and even the third writers hope to lose his virginity. The characters were more intriguing as a group rather than individually. But the music is great and the story is completely original, so Safety Not Guaranteed is a fun small film that can definitely be enjoyed by anyone.+Lead quirky performances +Originality +Writing -Lack of focus at times7.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie up until the end. **SPOILERS AHEAD**So near the end she finds out that everything he told her was a lie (for example Belinda is alive, they never dated and he was the one that smashed into her house...) Then Jeff reveals that he's working with Darius, so Kenneth flips out. Then he runs away and she chases after, and all is forgiven because his time machine works? And when she's about to get on the boat he says "I'm not going back for Belinda anymore, I'm going back for you." But wouldn't she be like a 14 year old girl at the time? Not really sure how the ending worked out, the sci-fi fantasy element with the time machine was only added at the end so it seemed strange and out of the blue. **SPOILERS OVER**I like the actors/actresses cast but was not happy with how the movie ended. A lot of the messages in the movie are good though, so I think it's worth watching. Just beware you may not be happy with the end like I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've all seen that want ad ("Someone to go back in time with me ... must bring your own weapons" yadda yadda), but "Safety Not Guaranteed" does something really cool, takes a lame Internet meme and makes a pretty great movie out of it. I came to this for the ever lovely Aubrey Plaza, but was drawn in by the overall performances (Plaza, Duplass and Johnson, in particular). The lingering doubt of the sanity behind hat want ad actually becomes a heartfelt love story. And the burning question of whether the time travel promise is genuine brings about a really memorable finale.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three journalists travel to interview the author of time travel ad. Except the interview never happens, because the man is un-cooperative and suspicious. So, they infiltrate the girl (Darius) to get more information about this man's (Kenneth) project. Darius' geekiness is a good match with Kenneth's secludedness. Overlooking the possible delusion concerning time travel, Darius gets to like Kenneth's kindness and honesty. During this time the characters of the other two journalists get their own development and life's lessons. Inbetweens are filled with witty and sarcastic humor, which mostly are takes on the character's awkwardness.The story unfolds linearly, uphill, towards a climax. We get to know Kenneth's personal drama, and we can sympathize with it. The very ending is fairy-tale-like, and, considering the quality of the humor, seems a bit of rushed escape, dropping the need to explain anything.This is not a movie about a shiny steel technological construction, nor it is a movie about time hopping back and forth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept of Time Travel is one of those collective, universal fascinations that never wanes. The idea seems to constantly be orbiting pop-culture from Orson Welles to countless TV series and movies. For most of us, The Back to the Future trilogy comes to mind when thinking going back in time. And more recently, Midnight in Paris was highly touted for it's imaginative premise of a present day writer meeting literary heroes of the past. I actually liked Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana in The Time Travelers Wife. The story is well written, with its high moments, and very light - I thought the acting solid, and having a relatively low budget and not using special effects or action scenes, being made the traditional way. Definitely worth the watch... Don't expect a 100mph car chasing, shooting Hollywood thriller, Respect the film for what it is. A tremendous low budget film that satisfies the viewer at a nice pace and nicely revealing more to the characters bit by bit..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic casting, great acting, wonderful writing, excellent music, and camera work that perfectly suits the story.I like this movie a lot, it is something quite different from the usual comedy, drama, love story. The story is science fiction, fantasy and real-life relationships.This is a film I would see again and again, each time it appears in the future. Safety Not Guaranteed has a definitive quirky streak that runs through every aspect of the film I enjoyed every minute of this movie. The writer did do a good job of balancing the story lines and showed intimate aspects of each character.The characters are real and sad. Their view on life is not a distorted one, they are sane and rational while talking and thinking of their time travel journey. If you like smart dialogs, an imaginative narrative, and well developed character, this is your film. It's one of those movies that you walk away from feeling good. This film ends up being another example of an independent movie, which shows that not every good movie needs to have high budget, famous actors and edge effects to ensure quality and fun.I really loved this film and recommend it if you have a chance to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing Spin on the Rom-Com Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Safety Not Guaranteed" stars Aubrey Plaza as Darius, a young magazine employee who has had a rough life so far. She and two other employees set out to write a story about a man who placed a classified ad that reads, "WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed." Darius tracks down the man, Kenneth, and becomes his partner. He doesn't know that she works for a magazine. While the two other magazine workers drift away from the story, Darius grows closer to Kenneth and starts to wonder if he isn't crazy after all.'Safety Not Guaranteed' contains possibly the most likable character of the year, Kenneth played by Mark Duplass. Immediately we are drawn to him. He seems like a person who is extremely kind, but still doesn't have any friends. He is misunderstood. Mark Duplass perfectly conveys all of the emotions that his character is feeling.Darius, played by Aubrey Plaza, is also a very likable character. By being provided with a little back story of her character, we can begin to understand why she is the way she is. In one touching scene, Darius opens up to Kenneth, telling him something that she hasn't even told her partners on the story. This shows us that she looks at Kenneth as friend and as someone she can trust rather than just the subject of an article.The other two magazine writers who are "working" on the story, Arnau (Karan Soni) and Jeff (Jake Johnson), are very different people. Arnau is a friendly young man who is very awkward with women. Jeff on the other hand is presented as a jerk who only wants to hook up with his high school sweetheart. The sub-plot of these two characters doesn't distract from the main plot, but rather promotes the main idea that all people are different, and we should accept that. In one scene, Arnau explains to Jeff that "he is not him". It is just as interesting to watch these two characters evolve and in a way come-of-age, as it is to watch the main story of Darius and Kenneth.The movie is written brilliantly and is full of deep and often humorous dialogue. This is screenwriter Derek Connolly's first full-length feature film, and he has already created such memorable characters and scenes that I am very excited to see what else will come from him.This is also the first film of director Colin Trevorrow. He seamlessly weaves from sci-fi to comedy to drama almost scene by scene. The movie is also beautifully shot, especially the spectacular finale. "Safety Not Guaranteed" is very similar to another movie that I absolutely loved, "Another Earth". If you enjoyed that, I am 100% positive that you will enjoy this."Safety Not Guaranteed" is not your typical romantic comedy and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a feel-good movie that doesn't through feel-good material in your face. I can't think of anything that I didn't like about this movie. It is one of my favorites of 2012 so far.bobbysmoviereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most satisfying indie flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing that needs to be said about this film is that it's entirely NOT about time travel. Or is it? This is actually a matter, which becomes decisive only in the last few minutes of the picture. Safety Not Guaranteed doesn't deem it necessary to explain whether traveling through time is really possible. More so, it diverges from this debatable topic in a truly convincing manner, creating a more comedic aura around its smart and ambitious storyline. When a group of three cynical journalists from a Seattle-based newspaper ? an egoistic and laid- back reporter Jeff and his two interns: intense, witty Darius and nerdy, socially awkward Arnau ? discover a strange advertisement placed in a paper in a small town in Washington called Ocean View, they quickly decide to investigate. As the ad clearly states, an unknown man is seeking a companion for a time travel. Following the mysterious trail the trio very soon arrives in the village, and after a short period of time they discover the person behind all this mystic farce. His name is Mark, and he works as a grocery clerk in a nearby shop. When Jeff spooks him out with his provocative attitude, it's time for Darius to go into action. After a while the girl is able to convince Mark that she's as trustworthy as she's prepared for the dangerous journey. In the meantime, Jeff reveals why he really wanted to ride to Ocean View in the first place. Namely, his old-time girlfriend lives her. Surprisingly so, this seemingly rom-com subplot follows an unconventional path and doesn't look forced. What's more, even the shy and withdrawn Arnau learns a bit about life and about himself in the process. The relationship between Mark and Darius grows to a level of a heartfelt romance. They share their motivation for traveling back in time, and ? through so many hours spend together ? they realize that they're actually on the same wavelength. Avoiding many clichés, the film presents a story, where emotions seem real and the characters that depict them are convincing enough to be recognized genuine human beings. Those characters really have some dimension, and through many engaging dialogues they exhibit their most intimate sides. While Safety Not Guaranteed might be recognized as a thought-provoking sci-fi flick, it's more of a really imaginative and touching indie comedy with some fantastical aspirations. It digs deep and uncovers a perfectly satisfying storyline, in a film that will probably guide Colin Treverrow towards a successful career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely Examination of Everyday Life Through the Extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a truly 'lovely' film that amounts to an examination of everyday life through an extraordinary sequence of events that could equally be meaningless and still be what amounts to a meaningful film.I'm not going to spoil this for anyone...just go and watch it! I will say that the slight idiosyncrasies of the main four characters are perfectly brought to screen without any pronounced judgment or overt Hollywood-need to over develop things for a complacent audience. It boldly announces that life IS what it IS and if YOU miss it it's your fault! In a sense this explains exactly what the film came to mean for me. We spend so much time pronouncing commonable opinions that we are in serious danger of missing the beauty of normality. In all honesty even normality is anything but normal when it happens as everything has uniqueness and genuine worth...what is ugly to 'A' is beautiful to 'B' and so on and so forth. To miss it due to a dalliance on analysis is almost sinful.Living life does not come with any guarantee of safety but our tendencies to analyze and develop safety strategies mean that we live life less. The reporters are ready to laugh at the seemingly idiotic premise that motivates the film because it makes them uncomfortable. They want to rationalise it within their common knowledge and strands of security. Fortunately for us and the film that same safety is beautifully motivated to ignore the known security and move forward. There is a lesson there for us all. The world is no less or more harmful than it always was but all of us would concede that our children have lived a more guarded existence than we did...and so the security cycle of the overly analytical moves forward to oblivion missing all the beauty and uniqueness along the way.Safety Not Guaranteed was a metaphor to me for how life SHOULD be lived. It emerged from the wonderful pen of Derek Connolly and was beautifully portrayed by Director Colin Trevorrow. The ENTIRE cast are so wonderfully natural that the film and story moved easily. This is not a perfect film but that only adds to my personal experience of it as a reflection on life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very slow, but its worth it. Great ending, but the last words of the ending could have been better. These two things helped bring the film down a couple notches. Plus it also didn't stay true to the ad in the paper, which had inspired this story-line. Add in a small plot hole near the end, and a 9 of 10 movie becomes a 7 of 10. But they can be forgiven for these small sins. You've got to give credit to the producers who made this on a 4 thousand dollar budget, and made 4 million out of it. Who am I to nit-pick that kind of success? It's these kind of shoestring budget movies, few as they are in this quality, that makes Hollywood look like an idiots playground. Even with its problems, its well worth the watch, based upon the total package of being a sci-fi love story that works. This came out in 2012, near the same time as "The Adjustment Bureau" film. Sadly, these two didn't start a trend. Like all good films, it makes you think, after the final credits roll. I myself have always said, that regrets are for people with time machines. After all, we were who we were back then. But I'm also a sucker for a good film, or even just a good love story, that tries to answer those regrets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this film different from other films of time-travel, is that emphasis is put on the process to time-travel. In other words, while other time-travel movies begin with getting on time machines, the film starts at a different point and ends with getting on the machine. It is interesting that while the SF element is an important pillar of the movie, non-SF scenes take much longer time than it. The title 'Safety Not Guaranteed' doesn't give off SF color, but in terms of impression of titles, the Japanese title 'Kanojo-ha (She is) part-time-traveler' is different from the English one. Anyway, the story goes on and extends without mentioning the SF element. It may be said that the main part of the story is interaction between characters. What the film describes is not thrilling SF story but thrilling and warm human story. On the other hand, in the final part of the movie, the SF element comes out and it heightens audiences' feeling. Watch it and make sure whether the time-travel is done or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it was very good movie. I'm thinking to watch several more times. it has got the successful fiction. Due to the fact that this movie's main topic is time travel, there is not possible to understand whole movie. Safety Not Guaranteed is the quirky title of an endearing romance about an ad for time travel answered by three journalists who want to write about this eccentric man. The characters are real and sad. There's and emptiness to them that only going back can fill, and you emphasize with them naturally. Their view on life is not a distorted one, they are sane and rational while talking and thinking of their time travel journey. Aubrey Plaza is this young girl who is lost in life (as so many are) and finds someone she can relate to and open up to in Mark Duplass, the man making the time machine. And at first she is just there to get a story, but she embraces his thoughts and beliefs and truly becomes the partner that he was looking for to go back with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title "Safety Not Guaranteed" is certain to grab anyone's attention, and it did mine. I went into watching it on DVD without any prior knowledge of the story.Aubrey Plaza as Darius and Jake Johnson as Jeff work for a Seattle publication, and in a brainstorming meeting for a story, Jeff mentions the newspaper classified ad he found, someone was looking for a partner to travel back in time, including the phrase "safety not guaranteed." Their suggestion is approved and along with another intern, Karan Soni as the geeky Indian Arnau, head out to find the guy.The ad has a PO box number, so they stake out the boxes, figure out his name, wait for him, then follow him home. First Jeff attempts to engage him but doesn't come across as serious, and is dismissed. So Darius gives it a try, and gains the confidence of the man.The man is New Orleans born filmmaker Mark Duplass as Kenneth . He comes across as incredibly serious about his mission, and his ability to travel back in time. So Darius goes along, and the others feed progress reports back to the publication's office.I like this movie a lot, it is something quite different from the usual comedy, drama, love story. The characters, especially Darius and Kenneth, come across very well.SPOILERS: As part of the plan Kenneth and Darius pull off a bold heist, for some lasers and other fancy stuff. Darius is getting worried, and some federal agents begin to follow them. Eventually Kenneth and Darius make it to a boat in a pond in the forest, they start up some exotic machinery, and soon they just disappear in front of the on-lookers. Kenneth really did build a time-travel machine, and he and Darius were going back to 2001.</fullReview>

Darius and Kenneth prepare for time-travel.Though one of the theme is time-travel, they don't or can't travels through a time warp easily. This film focuses on rather process of trying time -travel than actual time-travel, which is interesting. There are thrilling scenes and lovely scenes, so I enjoyed each character's story and feeling. It's wonderful. My favorite scene is where Darius and Kenneth stand around a bonfire and talk.

The main character is a young woman, but there are some stories of each character in this movie, not only her life story. Those stories are related to each other, and make a one whole story. Viewers can watch some stories in one time, and it is one of points which make viewers enjoy watching this movie. In addition, each story is not SF completely. Its genre is human story, but it changes dramatically at the last scene. Only at the last scene, SF elements appear stronger than any other elements, and the last scene make viewers imagine what will happen after the ending.

Another movie that shows why we love movies and that small budgets do not mean small movies.This movie brings 2 lonely souls together and uncovers the hurt that has caused each to seek refuge in their solitude. But as the title suggest, life has no guarantees and sometimes risks are worth taking.SPOILER-ALERT - My only negative criticism would be the forced "romantic" encounter between the young nerdy male and an anonymous female. The pressure applied by the older male to "go ahead with it" seemed counter to the delicate stories otherwise being told.I do not mean to discourage anyone from watching by including the Sci-Fi label, it is only a small part of the movie.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie expecting something a little different than what I got. It started off as a nice and interesting film with three characters who definitely needed some kind of emotional development. That is what I assumed the story would be: the characters developing together on a journey to discover their true selves (or whatever) with time travel as a fairly minor sub plot. What I got was vastly different: a story about a girl who goes too deep undercover and falls in love with a man who thinks he can time travel, whilst two men (fairly unconnected to the actual plot) almost fall in love or possibly loose their virginity. The subplots don't really tie in, the plot holes don't get resolved and the ending seems kind of an only-thing-that-really-works-as-an-ending-sort-of situation. I think this film is a fantastic concept and the style of it really appeals to me but I think the plot and story got lost in favour of typecasting (from what I know the role was written for Plaza which rarely makes for a good character) and trying too hard to force some kind of message into us. However, the bits that did make sense (the majority of the beginning and some of the middle) were enjoyable, it just depends on how good you are with unresolved issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Safety Not Guaranteed' is about three journalists who set out to investigate a man who's seeking a partner to accompany him back in time with. What follows is a slow-burning love story between the female journalist and the man who claims to have the ability to go back to the past.It's all very understated. There are no fancy special effects or major A-list actors who could elevate this film to a big hit. However, it plays to its strengths. It's never so outrageous that it's an out and out comedy. And it's never so futuristic that it's an out and out science fiction piece.It's about human nature in slightly odd circumstances. And it works, just. So don't expect anything too funny, or too out there. Just sit back and watch something pretty gentle and sweet really.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

When we love someone, we don't need to listen to others' evaluations, that's OK if only I can trust my lover. I learned these things through this movie. And of course, we can't know what'll happen in the future, and that can be sometimes happy but sometimes bad. As long as we live, we must go through those things.

However, I had an other opportunity to watch this movie and I regretted that I did not watch it at that time. It is a great movie like that. I like kind of movie because I think about a story not only halfway of watching but also after I watched it. Then I would like to ask me after I watched it, is it just an SF movie? The answer is, it is a more impressive and interesting movie. One of the favorite points of the movie is the ending. We are usually satisfied after finish watching a movie because there is a complete ending. However, at this movie, I think it is not adapted. Why I said like that, the answer is in the movie. I very recommended you watching the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three magazine employees (including Aubrey Plaza) head out on an assignment to interview a guy who placed a classified ad seeking a companion for time travel.The source material for this film is a well-known newspaper advertisement (which, as it turns out, was not serious). And they could have just run with that, making it about a guy who wants to time travel and his life and regrets. But they did not stop there.There is a message about past loves, new loves, and employment. Although never stated explicitly, the lead writer is attempting to "travel through time" himself, with various results, not all positive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day, an ad is put in a newspaper saying that the writer of the ad is looking for someone who could accompany them to travel back to the past. One of the journalists at a magazine publisher suggests they investigate who exactly has put up the ad and interview them. An intern at the publisher, Darius, does not want anything to do with it or the psycho who believes they could really time travel, however, after meeting Kenneth,the man who has posted the ad, and actually spending time with him, she is gradually attracted to him and struggles between the mission as a journalist and her feelings for him.I found this science fiction, comedy and romance film very entertaining, even though it looks like, in my opinion, it was made under a low budget. It is the screen writing that is doing the magic; the awesome characters and how the whole story is carried out cleverly. The idea of the whole story is obviously not new. It was probably done a hundred times, but it's all about how you do it. The characters and their lines are especially amazing and hilarious, and you can easily find yourself feeling sympathized with every one of them. Especially near the ending, you don't want Kenneth to find out that Darius has been doing the whole thing as her job as a journalist (though she develops feelings for him after a while) because you don't want to him to get hurt, and when the truth is revealed, you just want things to go well for the two and root for their happiness. One of the factors that is making the film entertaining is, I think, this sympathetic emotional attachment to do the characters throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The genera of this film is a science fiction and also a love comedy. The main character Darius, who cannot get along with people around her well, interns at Seattle Magazine. One day, her boss proposes to investigate a suspicious newspaper classified ad placed by a middle-aged guy Kenneth. He is seeking a companion who he can travel in time with, because he thinks he can build a time machine. At the beginning of the story, it is very difficult to think that the man can build a time machine and even go back in time. However, gradually you may be able to believe he can build it as the story goes on, although Kenneth is a little unreliable. At first glance, this film seems to focus on hidden past of people, but I felt a strong message about how to live and deal with regrets in the present time. Most people regret something that they did in the past, and sometimes are struggling with them because they cannot forget it. People in this film also have regrets about their life, but they learn how to get over the regrets and step ahead in life. Additionally, I really like the song and its lyrics sang by Kenneth. The song makes me feel at ease so much. Watch it and you should check if Kenneth really succeeds in building a time machine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Time Travel Movie That's Not About Time Travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something to say for films that give messages without beating you over the head with their mission. Safety Not Guaranteed was a great quirky film that captured the essence of the crazies and undesirables of society today and showed their beauty to viewers. All the characters have multiple levels and stories that don't get discussed, but are definitely acknowledged. No one is just a player, or just a writer looking for experience; everyone is a full person with multiple defects and issues that make them accessible to the audience. Warning- this film doesn't resolve all the issues and questions that come up in the story. If you're looking for a complete story with a happily ever after ending where everyone gets married and rides off into the sunset, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a "hey they learned something and now have the chance to be happy" kind of film, then consider this one. It's well done with a fairly strong cast and deserves your attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My sole purpose of watching this movie? Director, Colin Trevorrow, aka the man in the director's chair for the next chapter in the Jurassic Park film series. To go from directing a small indie movie to directing a long awaited next installment of a beloved, blockbuster movie series demands attention. I fell in love with this movie. Everything from the adorable Aubrey Plaza's very sweet performance, to the beautiful scenery and cinematography, and of course the awesome story. This is a movie that has greatness, but is very humble in the way it presents itself. The previews, while lightly funny, never hints at the on point drama and heart that this movie has. This is a really touching movie, the writing goes perfectly with all the performances, and with great performances you get a movie I won't be forgetting anytime soon. The film is set in the beautiful state of Washington, never thought I'd be saying that. Gorgeous sun lit beaches, the thick yellows and greens of the woods, if you own this on Blu-ray, get ready to be impressed. The acting is good all around, but the stars are Aubrey Plaza and a pleasant surprise from Mr. Mark Duplass, I thought his performance was the best in the movie. You really believe him as a character and just route for him throughout. The best compliment I can give this movie is that, while only under an hour an half long run time, told it's story perfectly. By the time I saw I was nearing the conclusion, I was hooked. The ending, magical... no seriously, the ending for Safety Not Guaranteed is possibly the most satisfying movie ending I've seen. I completely loved this movie and couldn't recommend it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love among the outcasts is the perfect subject for indie comedy, and this one doesn't disappoint. The storyline can get a little thin at times, and the subplot about Jake Johnson's character, Jeff, reconnecting with his teenage crush starts to seem like filler?though the idea of Facebook as an ad hoc time machine is kind of interesting. Otherwise, it's all good; nice to get a glimpse of Aubrey Plaza's more vulnerable side, and Mark Duplass's command of the time traveler's bullshit special-ops jargon is exemplary. Montages of the two of them toughening up for their journey into the unknown are especially charming, for some reason. Ingenious script keeps you guessing; the performances are uniformly excellent, and the ending really connects emotionally. Available on streaming Netflix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>low budget, pleasing intriguing comedy - but awkward in places</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two big names in sitcoms at present star in this indie-low-budget sci-fi about a man who may or may not be a time traveller. Jake Johnson (New Girl) and Mark Duplass (The League) are a Journalist and an odd-ball scientist respectively, but I think it might have been better and more comedic if it was the other way around, although their characters mirror each other anyway. Both want to "go back" to get a girl. The story is very witty, fairly gripping and you have NO idea who it's going to turn out, which is good. However, I'm not sure whether it was tongue in cheek or supposed to be serious - albeit a comedy. And whilst it was comedy it had quite a serious message about the difference between genius or mad man being quite a fine line and how we really don't know someone. I felt it was acted too seriously to be taken as a comedy so came across hammy and silly rather than funny. It tries to be a lot of things, but doesn't really achieve any of them and it's all a bit odd. Aubrey Plaza as Darius, the main female protagonist and Journalistic intern didn't really convince me and the other intern Arnau (Karan Soni) was seemingly just the object of ridicule and social/race stereotyping as if a low budget Kumar or one of the many "oh you're a virgin that's really stupid" films and he seemed more or less superfluous. However, as the intelligent one it was a shame he wasn't utilised more - fixing something or working something out or at least knowing what the schematics represented. That said, the premise must have looked amazing on paper, the idea that someone may have actually found time travel is possible and advertises someone to go with him, but the filming really does let it down and it ends up rather shallow and unfulfilled. There are lots of bits where you aren't sure whether its something to laugh at or hide behind a cushion as it's sort of awkward to watch. However, that said, I enjoyed it enough, it was easy watching, was pleased that it had me curious and intrigued to see how it panned out and I thought the end was as it should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colin Trevorrow's "Safety Not Guaranteed" watches as a group of writers travel to small town America in the hopes of finding the author of a bizarre newspaper advertisement. This author claims to be seeking a companion for a time travel adventure. Trevorrow then uses the conceit of time travel as a means of delving into issues of regret and loss."Guaranteed" stars comedienne Aubrey Plaza as a wounded girl caught out of time. She turns herself into a funny action heroine in order to seduce Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass), the author of the ad. Appropriately, given the film's obsession with arrested development, Calloway, with his bizarre mannerisms, deadpan dialogue and goofy mullet, seems torn from a 1980s action movie. 7.9/10 ? See Mamoru Hosoda's "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time" and Taika Waititi's "Eagle vs Shark".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the film Darius and Jeff are forced to confront their lifestyles and conceptions about people/relationships when they meet Kenneth and Liz respectively. Darius discovers a love of adventure and a sense of compassion through getting to know Kenneth while helping him with a time travel mission. Jeff rethinks his concepts of love and relationships when he rekindles a romance with his old girlfriend Liz. Both Darius and Jeff learn to give humanity another chance by having more faith in people. What makes this movie especially interesting is the way it works to make the viewer confront the same issues that Darius and Jeff face. As a viewer, I was skeptical as to whether Kenneth was a delusional madman using the idea of time travel to escape an fulfilling present, or if he was actually building a time machine. Even when I saw Kenneth's sketches of the time machine I didn't actually believe he was building one. The conclusion of the film reveals that there is an actual time machine. This honestly surprised me, and caused me to reflect on exactly why I didn't believe in the time machine the whole time. When Darius and Kenneth board the time machine, they disappear along with the machine. It was left up to me to decide whether or not they actually made it the past, but this ending was ultimately more satisfying than a shot of them either succeeding or failing would have been. The themes of this movie can be compared to some themes in the Enlightenment. Emphasizing the importance of thinking for oneself and questioning previous beliefs are ideas parallel to those of philosopher Immanuel Kant, who wrote about shedding one's 'nonage,' (beliefs brought on by the instructions and ideologies of others). Darius is an 'angsty' young woman who through the tragic loss of her mother grows to believe that the world is ultimately dreary, and that people can't be trusted. Her beliefs are challenged by Kenneth, who shows her adventure and compassion. Jeff goes from a superficial, sex-driven person who doesn't believe in having a serious relationship to a more empathetic individual. Both characters lose their nonage, and as the viewer I was forced to confront mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made light hearted movie about believing in your dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Safety not Guaranteed ReviewSafety Not Guaranteed is a mixture of different and unique genres including Drama, Comedy, Romance and even a touch of Sci-Fi thrown into the later portion of the movie. The movie tells a story about, love, regret and believing in your dreams to achieve what you want. This movie does something new to each of the genres and as a whole provides a good mixture for them all. When I first started to watch this movie it had me hooked from the get go with an interesting and engaging story. The story follows a young woman at an internship who decides to look into a story about a man who believes he can travel through time. The story gets interesting and rather original in parts. A small thing I liked about this movie is the way the title of the film is used within the story, as a line on a white-board and as a spoken piece of dialogue. I was expecting something with more danger aspects considering the title of the movie being Safety not Guaranteed, however it's a nice surprise to find out that this movie is indeed worth a watch. This movie has a bunch of interesting characters such as the main two protagonists in this film such as, the smart, young and ambitious Darius as well as the slightly mad, lonely and unpredictable Kenneth. The side characters do a good job of advancing the sub plots, such as the senior member of the team sent with Darius as he goes to this town to find a long lost partner and try to get reconnected with her. There are a few stereotyped characters in this movie such as the stuck up boss type and the geeky young journalist, these characters are most likely in this movie to engage the audience easier. Another sub plot is that Kenneth is under watch and being followed by two government officials, another sub plot which adds more realistic depth the overall story making it more meaty and enjoyable as a whole. The story is progressed naturally in a linear context, from a point A to point B type of movement. A narration from the two main characters pushes the story forward in parts, Darius voices the intro whereas Kenneth has these home video segments to push the story forward and advance it. This movie has a standard Drama, Rom-Com soundtrack with upbeat and cheerful music throughout and some slightly darker and more morbid music to when the characters feel their lowest low. This is something in the story that has become generic in most comedy movies, the characters are all happy and then at about that half way point they hit a serious tone then pick up again towards the climax. The lighting and camera work are good except in a few of the first scenes where the camera does seem to shake around as if it's not steady, however this was only noticeable once and never takes you out of the movie as a whole. The movie is well lit as it is a light-hearted more or less happy movie, not some dark, gritty Drama. The film creators wanted the audience to react by showing you something that may make you want to follow your dreams or fix some things you messed up in your past. This is a good way of telling who the intended target audience is as the movie has the young attractive teenage girl and has the many conventions to which a teenager or young adult would enjoy considering that Rom-Com is a very popular genre for this kind of audience. The response is very well in my opinion and really made me want to sort out problems in my life. The movie as a whole had an even number of strengths and weaknesses, some good points being the comedy. The comedy is so well done in this movie, like in every few scenes a funny one is put in to keep the audience feeling happy and prevent boredom. The character who pulls this off most is the senior journalist Jeff, who is my favourite character in this movie by far. A few weaknesses being, this film is highly predictable, at least it was for me at times. Without spoiling the story I knew how it was going to end, I knew certain lines of dialogue were going to be spoken by a certain character, for example I knew Kenneth would say to Darius "Come with me" toward the end. This problem really takes me out of what could of been a masterpiece of film, however it doesn't detract too much but just brings the movie down a notch in my opinion. Another strength would be that you really do connect with characters and feel what they feel, loneliness, the need to sort out problems in your life. This movie got me thinking about mistakes I've made in my own life and think about things I should of done differently. My personal opinion and my final verdict for Safety Not Guaranteed is that it is a light hearted, fun, enjoyable Comedy/Drama type film with a hint of Sci-Fi thrown in for good measure. It's not entirely original but has its moments to feel new. If I had to score this movie I'd give it a 7/10 and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story about someone trying to follow their ambitions and sort out their life mistakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very relaxing enjoyable movie in the sense it didn't let parts of the sub plots to take away too much from the main plot as i've seen many Hollywood movies do. It's written mainly as a comedy and stays fairly true which is one in about 200 movies these days.Very refreshing for a movie to rely on mostly acting and not too many special affects to convey the story line. Reminds me of some great 70's movies and some 60's.Note: The story line isn't original by any means; but the movie moves along smoothly and has fun characters that the non-original plot can be easily overlooked.Highly recommend for someone looking for a feel good comedy without being whacked out or being too serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite an unusual romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rather unusual films, sort of more like a romantic comedy than some science-fiction film, despite there being time travel involved. However, I would tend to move away from the romantic comedy aspect of it because the film deals with some rather strange people than what you would expect from your typical romantic comedy. Normally you are dealing with wealthy and beautiful people (though sometimes you have the grot, but the grot in most Hollywood films tends not to actually come away with a love at the end of the film).While the title of the film suggests that it is about time travel, and yes there is some time travel involved, the movie is more focused on the relationships, and I must say that only one of them ends up well in the end. The three main characters in the film all work for a magazine in Seattle, one of them a journalist and two interns. They discover a rather strange add in a paper and decide to travel down to a nearby beach front town (though why anybody would bother going to the beach in Washington State). The writer has some ulterior motives though, and that is to hook up with an old girlfriend, and one of the interns is only doing it because he needs to study something outside of his bio-medical degree. When the hook up with the old girlfriend happens, he then decides to go on a quest to get the guy laid.This is all in the background though because the main focus is on the other intern, Darius, who is basically unhappy. It is unclear why she came along, but maybe it has something to do with her dad telling her to get away for a while. However, as it turns out, she is the one that ends up getting most of the information on this guy, and also getting close to him and earning his trust. It seems, and in a sense we are left guessing through the whole movie, that he is simply some crackpot, but Darius does seem to like him (as it becomes apparent).The question that is raised though, and I have seen some discussion on this on some of the boards, is the statement in the add that he has done it before. This is never really raised in the film, and I sort of wonder why Darius never broached the subject. However, it is clear that he is not the most trusting of people, and Darius finds it hard to get information out of him anyway. However, I will not go further down this path because I think the discussion boards explore this facet quite well.I really enjoyed this film, and I guess this is the type of film that a sci-fi geek and his girlfriend could go an see together, though as I have suggested before, it is not your average romantic comedy. Yes, there is romance in it, and yes it is quite humorous at times, but it is different enough that enabled me to quite enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A modestly entertaining movie about time travel.Three people working for a magazine decide to answer an ad placed by a man (Mark Duplass) looking for a time travel partner. Their idea is to do a story about this whacked out dude. The young female intern poses as someone seriously replying to the ad, and then begins to fall for the guy once she realizes that he's one of the only people she's ever met who she can relate to. Complications arise when government agents start investigating the guy as a possible threat to security.Even a casual viewer will figure out pretty quickly that the time travel conceit is not the point of the movie. What the movie is really about is the uncertainty involved in making human connections, and the danger -- the danger of being rejected, of being emotionally hurt, you name it -- that comes with opening yourself up to a relationship with another person."Safety Not Guaranteed" is a cute little film with modest ambitions that succeeds in its agenda.Grade: B+</fullReview>

Their view in life is not a distorted one, they are same and rational while talking and thinking of their time travel journey. If you like smart dialogs, an imaginative narrative, and well developed character, this is your film. It's one of those movies that you walk away from feeling good. This film ends up being another example of an independent movie, which shows that not every good movie needs to have high budget, famous actors and edge effects to ensure quality and fun.I really loved this film and recommend it if you have a chance to see it.</fullReview>

When I watch it, I enjoyed it. But, I expected to turn of events. The subject of the film developed in expected directions. Anything which is very surprising for me did not become while I was watching the film. I was expecting so amazing events at any time in film. I think, I waited for so many different things about the content of the film.It is a moderately interesting film, but it is not very very interesting. This film which is more in the style of romantic comedy film is an amusing film. There are funny parts in the film. Roles of characters are quite realistic and in a friendly manner. Also, this film' cast is good. They fulfill their roles quite well. I think, when you have a free time, It is a film which you should watch. But, do not expect very interesting things! If you want to enjoy in a day which you are free, you can watch this film. You will pass a good time while you are watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed was an interesting movie, from start to finish. You think it would be ridiculous that someone can time travel but as the story progresses, it starts to get more interesting and really makes this movie what it is. Aubrey Plaza did great the way she played her role and from coming from the point of view of a Parks and Rec fan, she still reminds me of April (in a good way). The part about him having a fake ear was strange but the whole movie was quirky in a sense. In general, I really liked this movie. The amount of humor and romance involved was just right and it was definitely worth taking a look at.</fullReview>

It's a story about finding hope and love in the most different places.Funny and interesting.All of us have a past, a past full of both happy and sad moments.All of us have regrets in the form of mistakes we committed in the past, acts or deeds that led us to misery and pain.The movie is about the determination and the desire to go back in time to make things right, to relive those moments of joy and happiness and to experience the warmth, the love that existed back then once again.A wish to travel back in time and an unbelievable adventure to discover true love, a partner for a remarkable journey through time.Ultimately to go back in time for the right one, the true partner.Great story, and a very well done movie. It makes you think about our life, what could we have done different in the past and also how to look forward without letting things get in the way of what we want out of life. There are some real great life lessons in this movie, and a very compelling story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies related with going back to the past are fictional in general. But this one is also romantic comedy. In the movie, the characters can be unfamiliar but this is the beauty of it. Lots of us are watching a movie because of being a fun of movie stars. The movie is about research of the man who works in a company of magazine and two intern's research which is about a man who believes that he can travel in time. In first, the main character, Jeff Garlin seems to crazy in terms of other three people. Then, they decide that one of them must enter the Garlin's life and make news about it if it is true. Aurbey Plaza who is a intern in company, decides to go and enter his life by knowing this title in the advertisement "safety not guaranteed". After a while, Jeff Garlin, who is not well known actor, trusts him and share the plans of time traveling. Is he really crazy or genius? All in all,you can run away with this movie due to traveling in time. So just sit back and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, enjoyable and impressive film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performances in Safety Not Guaranteed are great across the board and the development of main characters is equally admirable.However,Derek Connolly's script is impressive for a debut film, but not perfect. There's a side plot featuring Jeff that is completely unnecessary to the story and distracting every time we are forced to revisit it. Also, there are elements thrown into the film that are there for the sake of just being, like an odd bit about Kenneth's ear. Nevertheless, Connolly's script makes for a humorous romantic story embedded in reality but stylized with science fiction.To sum up,if you ever looking for something funny, entertaining, genuine, and mysterious, or just one of those things, you're missing out majority if you don't pick up this movie.This looks like a fun movie, and I love the actors!I love Inception and all those. But this is my favorite&#xfeff; movie.</fullReview>

In addition actors and actresses are not popular besides Kristen Bell. She preconditioned as a guest actress in only one stage. For this reason not having a popular actors and actresses did not bring this film into the forefront. Although films' issue remarkable, narrating style is a little monotonous. Of course, it can be originated that this film does not have big budget. It might not say that this film kept audiences in suspense by scenario and fiction. There are limited number of scene which is on the horns of a dilemma. But then these dilemmas caused to lose this films' attraction. But this film was successful in final stage. Its issue is extraordinary. On the other hand there are many surprises to audience. Finally this film can be watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Safety not Guaranteed is a funny sweet indie that really demonstrates that going into a film not knowing the entire story can be sheer cinematic bliss. Darius is an intern for a crappy magazine made up of lazy-ass writers. When she gets the opportunity to cover a story alongside a veteran journalist on a man seeking a companion for time-travel, she will be inadvertently forced to reconcile her emotions with what she's willing to believe about the universe, her would-be time traveler friend, and herself. I will refrain from going into the plot any further because...that would pretty much murder the whole thesis of my review.Of course you assume this is going to be just a quirky, offbeat love story, (which independent filmmakers apparently really really like. But while it is that, there's a lot more going on here that belies the expected or even the ordinary. There're emotional layers to this film and its very real characters that will ever so gradually and impeccably be peeled back, and I love that kind of story-telling. We don't need the whole upshot smacking us in the face in the first 20 minutes, or even the trailer!! A lot of credit has to go to the ensemble, who do an excellent job. Deserving of recognition in particular is Aubrey Plaza, as well as Jake Johnson and Mark Duplass. All fantastic performances that lend charm, believability, and straight up sadness to a film with an already very special script. Speaking of! ...Safety not Guaranteed has a nimble, witty screenplay that's also very insightful and touching. That alone is a feat worth getting a little excited over. But one of the things I found most remarkable about the film is its refusal to tip its hand on what kind of movie it's ultimately going to be. If you watch it, (like you should), you'll know what I'm talking about. To sum up, a really special, quality film. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

As this film does not belong to sci-fi genre but more of character study.This film is low budget alright but that does not detracts from the intelligence, smart, and accessible characters and short film length that never overstay their welcome.Story is about an publication intern discovering a what seems to be a nut case wanting help in building a time travel machine. But the story is more about the changes in both the intern and this secretive person. While at this, the story goes sideways on the intern's boss and another one of their nerdy co-workers. Albeit these latter two are a bit caricature, nevertheless they provide not just a single 'adventure'.The plot is fairly to the point and the lead does a good job in conveying their path in life. And without the big stars the overall affect is more personable and even more believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Safety Not Guaranteed" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Safety Not Guaranteed" is a fairly quiet and genuine film about taking chances. That life should be taken advantage to its full potential, whether it be with an idea or loved one. There is also an underlying message about regret and how we should cope with it. We could either live with it, forget it or try to fix it.Writing in the film is fairly strong as it tries to juggle three different stories?well more like two and a half into one fully realized experience. The lines of dialogue are genuine and usually pretty funny. However, the film has a layer of heart. It makes you feel for the characters as you learn more and more about them. The main story about a girl who meets a wacky guy is sweet, but the most compelling story of the film is about one of the side characters who tries to rekindle a old romance. That story works in so many ways where we see the pain and joy of the characters and it doesn't feel tacked on.Characters are generally pretty great as they are relateable and the actors do a fine job of bringing them to life. Darius, Aubrey Plaza, is awkward at first, but slowly turns into a more lovable character. Her dead pan humor is hilarious and she says most of the best lines. Plus, Aubrey Plaza manages to bring a lot of emotion to the character. Jeff, Jake Johnson, begins as a sex obsessed jerk, but turns into a very sympathizing character. Jake bring the right amount of cockiness and and emotional depth to the character. He even becomes helpful and really helps develop another character in the film. Mark Duplass does a good job as the on edge Kenneth. The rest of the cast is fairly good as well.Overall, "Safety Not Guaranteed" is a really enjoyable film that is not only entertaining, but brisks by. The characters are compelling and offer up more than what they initially promise. However, it doesn't reach a level of greatness, but it still is one heck of a film. It had me laughing, feeling, and drawn into the story. I give it 4/5, funny, genuine, and filled with great performances and characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arcing time travel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot upon the outside would have almost any science fiction fan overly excited, but what this is - is more of a romantic comedy at times than a sci-fi. Perhaps its not surprising in a sense that the acting is thoughtful, scenes panned in a smooth manner, and the humour often subtle and yet heartfelt. But what is surprising is the manner in which this is all blended together, creating a warm and glowing tale of characters all with their own issues to correct - and moreso discover. What it perhaps lacks in 'real' time travel, in fact is surpassed by the travel made by the characters progress. Brilliant casting, combined with a really smooth narrative that flows from one scene to the other, add in a bit of spice, occasional tension and light humour, and what you have is not only a light hearted romantic-at-its-core film, but in fact one that is enjoyed by that sci fi fan who won't actually be disappointed as they'll be able to relate the the nerdy protagonist and find themselves forgiving the premise of the film after an hour of watching. Nevertheless, this film does have certain drawbacks, often the clichés to which the characters are constrained - but that is overlooked by the way that the egos (or lack of) often clash and co-exist and help each other throughout. Heartwarming and appealing to all genders (a rarity in the romantic comedy department, but it would be bold to class this in that genre- more of a mutli levelled drama in fact) All in all, there are many worse ways you can spend an hour and a half, and not much better. And, as for the ending, although I could not say too much, the sci fi fans won't be disappointed :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is why we love independent films. Three journalists travel to the back woods to research a man (Kenneth) who is advertising for a partner to time travel with him. It is obvious this guy is way off kilter, but in a sweet way that makes him attractive to the female lead, Darius (Aubrey Plaza). The presence of G-Men (government men for you younger readers) following Kenneth gives this guy some credibility and, as the movie moves on, you almost begin to think he might just pull this off.You guessed it - the female lead, Darius falls for him. Even though you know nothing can come of this, the characters are all likable - even the roguish reporter, Jeff who is supposed to be the lead on the story.There are a number of funny lines, especially from Arnau, an Indian intern who makes up the third member of the journalistic team. The lead reporter, Jeff, continually turns to him for technical questions and when he starts referring to Kenneth (the ersatz time traveler) as a storm trooper - Arnua corrects Jeff by saying "storm troopers do not know anything about lasers or time travelers, they are just blue collar workers!"This light, quickly moving flick is worth the time - every now and then it is good to get away from zombies and serial killers and see a "feel good" movie.

		<fullReview>SNG was a nice little surprise. No easy task making a good movie with such a funky (and tired, as in: "time travel, again?") premise. Perfect movie? No. But great story, great acting ,great characters, great music, and great script. Anyone who's got a heart and soul and a little dream still tucked away in his back pocket will enjoy this movie.The movie's premise, that of a guy who wants company for a "second attempt at time travel", opens up some simple yet timeless human stories of longing, redemption, love and faith. Any which way that the movie had ended, whether in failure or success for the time traveler, would have been fine. Why? Well, precisely because it's what happens in between that's important, and cool. For "Darius", for "Jeff", for "Kenneth" and a few others, the journey through time is well, that which all of us take: no need for a machine for that.A movie truly succeeds when you actually start thinking about what's going on inside the characters' heads. Yep, this one did that for me. Genuine humor, genuine acting, balanced storytelling, hell, just see it. Unless you left your heart and your dreams up on a shelf long ago, you won't be disappointed.Never mind those few, sad and bitter negative reviews, all of you who are not "Jeff", will get an immense kick out of this flik. Yay!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a great blend of comedy, romance and sci-fi all in one film! I was really impressed by how Safety Not Guaranteed manages to be consistently funny throughout a good portion of the movie (I laughed out loud several times), showing the eccentric relationship between a young intern of a magazine company (Portrayed by the gorgeous Aubrey Plaza) and the man who plans to go back in time (Mark Duplass who is not only a talented director, but also proves to be a solid actor). I was just very into the basic premise, which keeps you intrigued by how his mission will turn out in the end, making the film quite engaging at all times. Safety Not Guaranteed also works well as a romance because it's about taking risks and relying on your partner. It was surprising to see that even the stereotypical womanizer and douchebag character, who is usually disposable, had a lot of depth in it. Finally, it's a remarkable work as a science fiction since the whole plot surrounds the idea of time traveling. Without spoiling anything about the climatic ending, I have to say that it was very memorable for me as it makes you ponder about what really happened. There can be many scenarios and different perspectives of the ending and that's the beauty of it. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

A great indy movie is usually discovered with the watcher knowing little to nothing about the movie going into it. I'll say that if you enjoy movies like, Garden State, Little Miss Sunshine, Napoleon Dynamite, Wristcutters, Dan in Real Life, Eagle vs Shark, Perks of Being a Wallflower, Sunshine Cleaning then you'll probably enjoy Safety Not Guaranteed. In my opinion quality movies like this should get a wider theatrical release over horribly done blockbuster budget movies like G.I.

		<fullReview>This film would be in the obscured classified section of a newspaper, if it had one. This is a hard film to put into one or two categories. If i had to put it somewhere, then it would be romantic sci-fi comedy, but not necessarily in that order. Aubrey Plaza from Parks and Rec branches out from her character April Ludgate, which is good because i usually i do not like April, but i like her as Darius. Plaza retains her usual dead-pan deliver, but stretches her acting abilities here to pull us into her world and we can sympathize with her character, which is lacking in Parks and Recreation's April. So what is the story about? What is the message? i think the great message is love and to a lesser extent (not much lesser) it is about not looking back. It is about putting yourself out there and being vulnerable to love. And with love there are no guarantees that you will be safe. The acting is good, but i think it is the story that rises above the acting. And one last thought, do not look for a picture perfect ending because life is not like that at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You get a movie like Safety Not Guaranteed. This movie is without a doubt odd, weird, strange, beguiling, but in the best way possible.Time travel is a touchy subject for any film, and this subtle style of filming this movie really helps you to connect with it, think about it and long for it more than any other movie based on time travel could do. The characters are real and sad. There's and emptiness to them that only going back can fill, and you emphasize with them naturally. Their view on life is not a distorted one, they are sane and rational while talking and thinking of their time travel journey. Aubrey Plaza is this young girl who is lost in life (as so many are) and finds someone she can relate to and open up to in Mark Duplass, the man making the time machine. And at first she is just there to get a story, but she embraces his thoughts and beliefs and truly becomes the partner that he was looking for to go back with.This movie is witty and funny with its dry humor. The life these characters lead are real and by the end of the movie you are happy when the characters are happy and you wish them all the best. 7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Darius (Aubrey Plaza) is an intern in the journalism business. But, sometimes she is upset with every aspect of her life and has been for a long, long time. Thus, when she goes on a job interview away from her chosen field, the recruiting officer can tell she is ambivalent and refuses to hire her. So, its back to the Seattle rag. One day, as the upper writers are searching for potential topics for articles, journalist Jake (Jeff Johnson) suggests an interesting idea. It seems someone wrote a want ad in a magazine advertising for someone to travel back in time with him. Is he a nut or what gives? The editor likes the idea and sends Jake, Darius and fellow intern Arnau (Karan Sovi) to the Washington coast to investigate. All too soon they discover that the P.O. box is owned by Kenneth (Mark Duplass) who works at a grocery store. Although Jake presents himself as a candidate for time travel, his breezy and arrogant demeanor puts off Kenneth. Therefore, Darius is given the assignment to try to get closer to Ken. She does. But, even after days of "togetherness", Darius is still unsure whether Kenneth is delusional or if he really does have the capacity to build a time machine. Also, where is the apparatus? In the meantime, Jake chases a former flame who lives in the same area and dispenses advice to shy Arnau on the pursuit of women. How will it all come out in the wash? Anyone who admires indie films will savor this one. Its funny, charming, and unusual. Plaza does a terrific job as the main character while Duplass, Johnson and the others offer great support. As one might expect, the setting is likewise beautiful while photography, script and direction all have stellar qualities, too. Be warned, those who care, that the movie has an R rating for more than one reason. But, as the title suggests, while safety might not be guaranteed, most viewers will find laughs and surprises are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The core of the film is good, but too much not so good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right, I saw the trailer for this film and thought, 'Hey! That's kinda weird and is popular at film festivals!' - I would normally have ran a mile. Although I am kind of glad I didn't, the film is about an advert in the paper asking someone to go back in time with the advertiser. Safety on the trip is not guaranteed, now to jump past the beginning, because god knows the film does (Oh snap). A dude from a magazine wants to write about him and takes with him a watered down Emo girl and an Indian intern. They travel to see the guy who took out the ad and eventually the Emo girl becomes his apprentice as they prepare to travel back in time. Now Aubrey Plaza is the lead in this film, and is really quite good. I would like to see her in more, though I do worry if she will be able to bring that kind of acting to a different type of character. Her character in this is Darius, a young girl trapped in a rut since the untimely death of her mother during her childhood. It kind of glosses over her home life, you are treated to only glimpses of the kind of rut she is in living with her overweight and emotionally numb father. Overall though I really liked her in the film and her interaction with Kenneth, played by Mark Duplass really does make the film. There were times during this film when I kind of felt that it was a really good CV, like both actors saying, look what I can do, all the while the Director saying the same thing. The script, over the course of the film is really rather weak. The scene's with Tiffany and Kenneth are good and you look forward to the next one. But the little misadventure that the other two characters go on is a real side step. It brings the quality of the film down and while it doesn't ruin the show, it certainly makes it takes slow walk between the sprints of the central characters. The film has a really weird segment about the regrets of the Magazine writer and the woman he chases down from his youth. I mean, I get that the film is about second chances and the whole trying to go back in time thing, but I just don't care about that character enough. As well as that, Kenneth is seriously unstable, too old for her and could be mistaken for a domestic terrorist. However, he sings a nice song and all that stuff can go out the window...but, but, but, but, this is much better than some of the drivel that gets released at the pictures. The idea of going back in time to change the past is cool, but then the film kind of gets flipped on it's head, and pretends it didn't happen. So while the film was fun it does let itself down with some easily fixed story issues. For example there is this thing with a tin, that they can communicate with and it is just glossed over/forgotten about, or the point of going back in time not adding up anymore.I suppose the point of the story was the love and the relationship the central characters have, for me the film wasn't strong enough round the edges, but the core was very good. Regardless, I watched this film and had that festival felling about it, yeah its good, but it isn't that good. Overall, the central characters are fun but the supporting cast is poor and their stories match, I would recommend, but I wouldn't watch again.6/10By @KenMcGuinness - http://addocogito.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed is a very unique film. It's an indie, sci-fi, comedy &amp; romance film all bundled into one tidy little package and it works remarkably well.Taking its inspiration from an advert published in 1997 in a copy of Backwoods Home Magazine, which read: Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.The original ad was placed in the back of the magazine as filler, never realising what a stir it may cause.Three of the four main characters work for Seattle Magazine. Darius, Jeff &amp; Arnau, all completely different and all with different reasons for being there. It is however, Aubrey Plaza as Darius who I tended to feel the most sympathetic toward, being completely down to earth yet feeling completely dissociated from everyone around her until she meets Kenneth played by Mark Duplass.Kenneth is the author of the ad and it's up to Darius to determine whether he is mad or an exceptional genius who has actually found a way to travel back in time. Thinking he is being tracked by government agents &amp; telling a story of wanting to go back in time to 2001 to save his then girlfriend from being killed, which may or may not be true. Is he paranoid &amp; delusional or has he actually managed to defy everything and build a time machine?Of course Jeff &amp; Arnau have their moments to shine. Given their fairly brief amount of screen time compared to Darius and Kenneth, they do very well with the moments handed to them.As I said at the start of my review, Safety Not Guaranteed is a truly unique film. Blending many elements into one satisfying whole. It really shouldn't work, yet it does. As for the ending, you'll have to see for yourself whether Kenneth succeeds in his plan. I won't ruin it for you by saying what happens, but I will say it's just a perfect ending.</fullReview>

Its missing a killer soundtrack such as Garden State and the subplots are weak with a very unlikeable yuppie Jake Johnson staying unlikeable and the geek Karan Soni "I've never been laid" very clichéd.So they just happen to run across some randoms outside the supermarket who are ready to have anonymous sex with the out of town geek stranger. Please. The movie is saved by Aubrey Plaza whose radiant and nuanced performance stands out. The issue OK Kenneths sanity or otherwise is well drawn out and the relationship between him and Darius is the soul of the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true gem of 2012</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed is the most thought provoking, charming, funny, heartfelt and surprising little gem of 2012. I was enamored with it! This film stood out more to me than most star studded vehicles of last year, because it tried something different without being so flashy. It's one of those films that surprise you with every frame and like a good book; you don't want it to end and leaves you craving more! The ending is the highlight, surprise movie scene of last year!Thanks to a sharp script everyone in this film was enormously enjoyable to watch and gave subtle, raw, charming and witty performances. There was something very sexy and mystique about newcomer Aubrey Plaza, maybe it's her bedroom eyes or Scarlet Johansson lips, but she and the performance she gave mesmerized me. You'll want to travel back in time with her too! At least I did. The other standout was Mark Duplass, who plays Kenneth, a guy who placed a classified ad seeking a companion for time travel. He gave an heartfelt, intellect, memorable performance and pulls you into his world, makes you believe, dream of the possibilities of time travel, that may be true or some crazy person's bogus ideas. You may recognize Jake Johnson from TV's The New Girl, whose dry sense of humor and deadpan performances are always fun to watch, you can't help but like him.Director, Colin Trevorrow and writer Derek Connolly, impressed me immensely with this being their first major film and collaboration! They should definitely collaborate again, because they show true brilliance and restraint on a modest budget, imagine what they can do with a much larger one. The possibilities are overflowing! I'm keeping my eye out for them!Overall, Safety Not Guaranteed is the biggest surprise film of 2012 to me! I believed it, felt it, charmed by it and was completely entertained throughout and didn't want it to end! I know this might be crazy, but I would mind a continuation of this story. I loved it! Satisfaction guaranteed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky, funny &amp; the kind of clever Seven Psychopaths desperately wanted to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed was a rare treat where I entered the screening virtually blind and with no expectations, having deliberately avoided the trailer and read only a couple of lines detailing the essential premise. I know no-one else who has seen it and suspect very few of those I encourage to will actually bother.Their loss was my joy in a surprising and welcome fashion as with the undervalued Lars and the Real Girl. While the subject matter is entirely different, the humour and quirkiness have much in common.Inspired by a real advert, Safety Not Guaranteed is an engaging film about four people with their own issues and agendas. Jeff (Jake Johnson) is a bored staff writer on a magazine who persuades his editor to let him abscond with two interns to investigate a classified ad by someone seeking a time travelling companion. Jeff, who is more interested in tracing an old girlfriend, takes Darius (Aubrey Plaza), a miserable girl hiding a personal tragedy, and Arnau (Karan Soni), a virginal biology major dressed up as a dweeb, to find out just what kind of nutjob placed the advert. That kind of nutjob turns out to be Kenneth (Mark Duplass), a shelf stacker whose colleagues speak about in hushed, colluding tones.If you want a film about time travel, turn to Looper, because Safety Not Guaranteed is about relationships and understanding oneself in order to comprehend the world others inhabit. Time travel itself is almost irrelevant here. Almost.Purported to be 'hilarious', it took a while to get there and director Colin Trevorrow seemed unable to find his stride. Even when it settled into being funny, it was rarely the kind of funny that hurts the sides but instead prompts broad smiles and gentle chuckles with the occasional explosion of laughter. The humour rarely comes from set pieces that are outright funny but from the dialogue that is the kind of clever Seven Psychopaths desperately wanted to be. To wit, Darius: You're dangling my vagina out there like bait. What if this guy's a murderer? What if he cuts me up into little pieces and eats me? Jeff: Then the story is even better.My initial impression with Safety Not Guaranteed was that scriptwriter Derek Connolly had opted for obvious, contrasting freaks who would rub each other up the wrong way for comedic effect but, though that is what happens at first, Connolly has blessed each of them with angles and facets and it is actually as they develop relationships that the story becomes so much more enjoyable.As Jeff fails to be accepted by Kenneth, by design so he can concentrate on his main agenda, and Darius succeeds, the film sidesteps into a development where the question of which of them is most screwed up becomes moot and both actors are allowed to shine. Plaza emerges from the sulky girl we don't care about to a young woman whose eyes have opened up to new truths about her world and the people who fill it, while Duplass keeps us guessing as to quite how bonkers Kenneth is and delivers a performance of complete sincerity where others would play up to the camera to ensure the extra laugh.Johnson is a Jeff not so far removed from that of Community and is annoyingly funny at the right times. He's the kind of office scuzz you can't help but like despite being chauvinistic and wholly inappropriate ("Give me the lesbian and the Indian and I got a story.") and there's enough of an arc to make his character engaging. It is Arnau who is left out in the cold with little journey written for him to experience other than the entirely predictable occurrence in the final act. Perhaps as compensation he is awarded some of the finest lines, or maybe he just knows how to drive them home with maximum impact: "Stormtroopers don't know anything about lasers or time travel. They're blue collar workers." You'll sit down to Safety Not Guaranteed wanting to know 'Does Kenneth or doesn't Kenneth?' but somewhere along the line you'll realize you don't care, or rather it doesn't matter. But Trevorrow has the balls to deal with it instead of leaving it up to us to decide. It doesn't matter either way, but it's a holy f*** moment when we finally understand the true level of Kenneth's sanity or lack of.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Duplass brothers score. I was intrigued and entertained from beginning to end. This is a love story about two awkward misunderstood people finding each other and learning to trust each other while at the same time learning to trust in themselves. I enjoyed the sub-plot about Jake Johnson' character who was very selfish and shallow seemingly, but turned out to be a sensitive guy interested in the feelings of others. This is sort of the same role Jake Johnson plays in the New Girl sitcom, and I hope he doesn't fall into the rut of being a one act actor. Same with Aubrey Plaza and her deadpan delivery. It is funny, and it is edgy, but being typecast is a great way to make an audience tired of you. All in all though, the actors delivered. Great story, interesting characters, great cast, good character development, and an ending that did not disappoint. I look forward to seeing more of the Duplass brothers' work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Low Budget Movie Movie with a Interesting Plot and Solid Story and Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took this movie by chance without knowing anything about the script or who were the producers - and it was a very good surprise.The film, a mixture of comedy / drama light covers an intern (a introverted and somewhat strange girl) from a magazine who embarks on an investigation with two more colleagues, about a strange newspaper announcement, from a person who wants a companion to travel in time. This person is the eccentric clerk of a chain of stores, and the girl gets involved with him to conduce the investigation.The story is well written, with its high moments, and very light - I thought the acting solid, and having a relatively low budget ($ 750.000US) and not using special effects or action scenes, being made the traditional way.From the initial half hour, you end up trapped by the characters and the unfolding story. The overall mood of the film is light, and discusses aspects of the personality and lives of the characters in a good way.In short: this film ends up being another example of an independent movie, which shows that not every good movie needs to have high budget, famous actors and edge effects to ensure quality and fun. My score: 8.0 / 10.0.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) - A Long Review Will Not Be Guaranteed, Either!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year filled with clever, small-budget independent gems, "Safety Not Guaranteed" takes the cake. Although this movie's subplot talks about the topic of time travel, there is nothing in this movie that comes close to science fiction. But instead, this is a smart real-life drama that has really sharp idea, even if it tries to be a lot better than it could have been, sadly. Aubrey Plaza, Jake M. Johnson, and Karan Soni play three magazine employees who are headed to interview the man who was rumored to post a suspicious ad on the newspaper, asking someone to become a companion in his latest time-travel assignment. But, do you think he's able to travel in time, or is it a joke. I think it's worth watching to find out, because the film is worth anyone's time. Starting with the cast, Aubrey Plaza actually delivered a pretty decent performance, even when she does pull a "Kristen Stewart" move at times. But, although I got a few chuckles from Jake M. Johnson, I honestly felt like he was over-acting a little bit as a newspaper writer who focuses less on the story, and more on a past lover of his. This storyline felt very unnecessary to the plot of this 86-minute movie, and it would have been way better off without it. But the "tour De force" performance of the film is brought by Mark Duplass as the suspected time traveler, who nails the role in every scene he's in. The film starts off on an interesting note, but the second act does drag and it gets a little weary, while the movie lingers on with one unnecessary plot-hole after the next. But, that's when the third act picks up, and it shows the true emotion within the film. I think it's better for everyone to view this as a human drama, rather than a sci-fi about time travel. Although it could have been a lot better film, this is truly an entertaining gem. "Safety Not Guaranteed", in my review, "expertly developed, but nothing close to greatness".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's not about time traveling, it's about human feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I can say about this movie, trying to not reveal much about the story, is that time traveling, sci fi side is just the wrapping of the main thing. Instead of time traveling, the same scenario could have been applied for a travel to Antarctica or the preparation of a year end exam, the essence of this movie would have been the same.So, if you look for an action of sci fi movie, a straight to the point plot, it's maybe better to try to watch something else.If you look for movies with a sense, talking about human being, real ones like us, talking about their fear, joy, dis-functionality and magic. If you pay more attention to simple sentences said here and there than the feeling of being glued in your seat by the drama or visual effect, then, this movie is probably more for you, and could give you a lot to think about.The more I watched it, the more I putted the time travel plot on the side and the more I felt interested to have the chance to look at the encounter of two peoples, two real peoples. I usually like comedies, sci fi and action movies but this one is a gem to my opinion. I didn't get this feeling since little miss sunshine, and safety not guaranteed in fact gave me even deeper thoughts.Cannot give 7.5 so I rate 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Safety Not Guaranteed" is a sweet, whimsical and often funny little movie with science fiction elements that remain a mystery until the very end. A synopsis of the film leaves you expecting a fantasy, but the film is much more human than that. This is a film about people more than it is about science. That may make the film sound talky and dull, but rest assured it is not.The synopsis is intriguing. A trio of writers for a Seattle magazine are given an assignment to travel to the small town of Ocean View to investigate a classified ad that reads: "Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed." This seems like the ravings a nut desperately seeking attention, but the trio head out to Ocean View to investigate him anyway. The three include: Jeff (Jake Johnson), who would appear to be one of those standard movie Appetite Hounds, whose whole existence is given over to booze, whores and cynicism. With him are two interns. One is Darius (Aubrey Plaza), an insecure loner who can't muster up enough energy to get five minutes through a job interview without the interviewer telling her that she's not qualified. The other is Arnau (Karan Soni) a quiet, introverted computer geek who hardly speaks.Arriving in Ocean View, Aubrey is sent undercover to get to know the man who placed the ad. He is Kenneth, a sad sack with a disheveled appearance that immediately leads us to believe that he is just a seeking attention. He claims that is not only traveling in time but that he is also being followed by sinister agents who want to stop him. Aubrey wants to believe his claims and even helps him when he breaks into a medical supply office to steal some much needed items for his time travel device.Is Kenneth telling the truth? That question surrounds the entirety of the film, and we do eventually arrive at the answer to that question, but what is refreshing is that the journey getting there is filled with a lot of humanity dealing with characters. Kenneth and Aubrey find a strange, but very tender bond as they realize that they have different, but very reasonable, reasons for wanting to travel in time. Arnau, is a guy who is satisfied to spend his life behind his computer until Jeff opens his mind to more laid back lifestyle. And Jeff, who starts out as a cynical booze-hound, soon reveals personal reasons for accepting the assignment - he has a high school girlfriend living in Ocean View who has never left his heart. That relationship doesn't go the way we might expect.Surrounding all this humanity is the question of whether or not Kenneth is indeed traveling in time. That's what we came for and the movie ends with the answer to that question. I am not going to give it away, suffice to say that whether or not you are satisfied with the answer is up to you. Personally, I would have been happier if the film had run on for a bit longer and truly explored what we see at the end. It ends somewhat short of real satisfaction. On the plot level the movie doesn't completely satisfy. On the character level, it went places that any other film with this plot might not have gone, and for that I appreciated it.</fullReview>

Johnson) and fellow intern Arnau (Karan Soni) on an expedition to the coast to interview a self-proclaimed time traveler.Once there, Darius befriends the man (Mark Duplass) who took out an ad requesting a partner for time travel.Meanwhile, Jeff reconnects with a past love from his summers at the beach, while teaching Arnau to enjoy his youth.A stirring love story angled with sharp performances and comical musings on our skewed view of the past, Safety Not Guaranteed is engaging.Incidentally, traveling back in time is the only way that these journalists are going to find work.

		<fullReview>"Wanted : Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring own weapons. I have only done this once before." When a magazine is looking for articles for the new issue Jeff (Johnson) brings up an idea to interview someone he read a classified ad for. When two eager interns, including Darius (Plaza) decide to help out they think they expect to find a wacko. This is a movie that even after watching the trailer for I wasn't really sure what to expect. I have to say that I enjoyed this quite a bit. The movie is quirky enough for the non-"main stream" crowd to really get into. The acting and plot are enough to carry this movie and little by little you find yourself rooting for the "crazy" guy and really hope he can do what he says. So many movies like this start off so good and become way too cheesy by the end that it ends up ruining the movie. This is the exception to that rule and the ending is perfect and ends in about the only way that I think it could have. When you watch you may have a different opinion but I think it was a perfect ending to this movie. Overall, if you a looking for a fun movie that is different then most of the offerings out there then this is a very good choice. The only bad thing I have to say is that I'm not sure if this is one I can watch over and over. Very much worth seeing once though. I give it a B.</fullReview>

The ending "disappearance" scene was not a shocking one, as previously thought but quite one serene and that's partly because the director's choice of image composition was a beautiful one with trees reflecting in a mountain lake. All characters are driven by this classified ad into a beautiful story. It has it's flaws, but more technical than scene assembly.

		<fullReview>This movie stars Aubrey Plaza from Parks &amp; Rec, and it is like she is playing the same person that she plays in the sitcom. She was perfect in this role, as i believe nobody else could do it like her.The movie is classified as a comedy/sci fi, but to me the movie is more of a drama with a few laughs here and there. Life tends to be a medley of drama and comedy, and this movie is a perfect example of that.Great story, and a very well done movie. It makes you think about our life, what could we have done different in the past and also how to look forward without letting things get in the way of what we want out of life. There are some real great life lessons in this movie, and a very compelling story.In the end you will end up with some answers, but i believe the one question you will have it is up to each individual to answer it as they see fit. So while the moving has only one ending, it will have different meanings to different people, based on your own life experiences.</fullReview>

If you want a sophisticated, romantic, or just a beautiful watch on a rainy day, you will not be disappointed!

		<fullReview>A wonderful film. The story is science fiction, fantasy and real-life relationships. The plot is unique (I know some reviewers have likened it to the back to the future series which was for fun and was fun). It is not only funny, (laugh out loud funny) but mysterious as to what is really going on and stir in some fantasy and science fiction-- but underneath is the inspection of all human beings and their lives and relationships. The casting was superb and the scenic northwest photography was great, I didn't know any of the actors but suffice to say they were chosen by a director of amazing talent. His idea his plot and his script were really really fine. I saw it in LA in Burbank and the audience was mostly the internet set and they loved it. All of their generations electronic things were a big part of the film, but this masterful director reached me, a senior--explaining the kids and yet reaching me with the love stories and those of friendship. Thus the director brought the old universal story of love among all of us. I can only say he is in for a tough career because with this film he has set the bar for himself and his crew very very high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie. The cases and characters are very good. I enjoyed watching it. The story line was very impressive. This movie is very convincing, at the same time very emotive and touching. The main character Mark Duplass is very good. This movie includes three magazine writers encounter an ad. Then Jeff, Darius, and Arnau go on a trip to a coastal town. Kenneth claims that he had solved the secret of time travel. Kenneth believe that he has built a time machine. So Darius asking for someone to accompany him in time travel.To sum up, the acting of all the cast is very good. I like very much the end of movie. If you have missed this film, you should definitely watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment guaranteed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eerily believable, Safety Not Guaranteed is one of those movies that fools you into thinking it's one kind of movie (time travel!) but revealing itself to be, well, many movies packed into one. It's a beautiful look at hope in lieu of utter hopelessness, at romance in lieu of disappointment, and at life instead of, well, not really having one. I truly loved this movie, loved it to pieces, and I think it's one you'll enjoy as well.It all starts with a mysterious ad placed in a Seattle newspaper asking for an assistant to do a little, you know, time traveling. The respondent must bring his or her own weapons. The ad-placer has done this only once before. The title is invoked. The staff at a local magazine are intrigued, mainly because they have no better ideas - is this the work of a nut job, or what? Writer Jeff (Jake Johnson) offers it as a story idea and brings along interns Darius (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni). Jeff figures they'll interview the guy, and it'll make for a nice, kooky feature. Win-win for all.Kenneth (Mark Duplass, who also coproduced), though, immediately sniffs out Jeff as someone who doesn't remotely believe his story and kicks him off his porch. Enter Darius, a loner, perhaps virginal, definitely lacking in self confidence, definitely still mourning the death of her mother. She's in this because she desperately needs a change. She is in a funk. She befriends Kenneth, who is convinced that agents of some sort are out to get him - or are they? You and I would probably think that Kenneth's a wee paranoid. What if he's not? Darius sets out to meet Kenneth's qualifications (no, not sexual), helping him obtain materials for his, uh, machine (which she isn't permitted to see). The two grow a little close. Doubt creeps in about Kennth's sanity.Meanwhile, there are two separate-but-equal story lines afloat. Jeff's real reason for traveling to this coastal town isn't the story - which he assumes Darius and Arnau will write - but to reconnect with an old flame, a flame from more than 20 years ago. It's a story that seems almost random in the overarching theme of the film. Arnau is along for something different, just like Darius, but his is more of a life quest than a career quest. He wants to experience life, not read about it, but he's too deep in his shell to do much about it. Enter Jeff. And like Jeff's story, Arnau's seems like it has little to do with the time- travel plot - and yet both smaller plots connect very deeply with each other and with the larger story.Throughout the movie, one is never really sure what Kenneth's motives are. Even if he's sane, why is he returning? He offers an explanation to Darius, but is it real? Is his machine real? He has put a lot of thought into his plans. There are no clues either way. We even see agents pursuing Kenneth - but are they out to get him because they don't want him to time travel, or is it something more, well, earthly? The mysteries are vortices of unending complexity.But you know what really ties this movie together? It's the acting. Plaza is simply perfect as Darius. She's not a stereotype, not some self-absorbed emo chick with daddy issues. (Her dad, played by Jeff Garlin, is truly the understanding, perceptive type.) She's been emotionally bruised. She wants more but doesn't know how to get it. She's an endearing misfit, sad but defiant, wickedly intelligent, and creative. I spent the movie hoping Darius would get what she wanted, but we never really, really know what Darius wants, only what she says. I don't know how old Plaza is, but she looks like she's in her twenties but with the poise of someone in her forties. A tremendous performance, one that is complemented with equal amounts of grace and crudity by Johnson, Duplass, and Soni.Safety Not Guaranteed is simply a movie that must be seen to be fully appreciated. I mean, I could blather on and on about how awesome it is without giving away actual plot points - that's not easy! - but I'm telling you, this is a movie you should see. It is as intriguing as the classified ad that started it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful and Insightful Human Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using time travel as a backdrop, Safety Not Guaranteed is about regret, about the deeply personal experiences of "love" and the stuff we carry around with us that we make us embarrassed or afraid, ignoring the possibility of acting on the own stuff. This movie offers a fusion of normal and abnormal behavior, everyday life along with the comedic and dramatic surprises, even tragic, that life drops in on people from time to time. Without pretension, this light-hearted, crazy-like world of paranoia and secrets, wrapped up in discovering relationships, unexpectedly exploring one's inner world, and risking exposure of one's own personal locked and sensitive mysteries. What is real, what is crazy? The movie incorporates conspiracy theory, mystery thriller, and romance and comedy (the last two aptly displayed separately). At the same time this movie presents characters that could be genuinely real people all with observable flaws from the "normal," or, in short, they could be you or I. It's about conflict, reactive behavior based on fear or hopes (those current or subsequent impulsive wonderful expansive and those terrible immature feelings and decisions we make) and dreams not accepted and rejected, and resulting regret or resolution and discovery of what we can or could do about it. Safety Not Guaranteed is a look at ourselves sometimes in ways that we've experienced before and in ways that we only imagined or feared and failed to and thus preventing ourselves from life that in turn prompts up to have wanted to make our own time machines. The movie keeps the audience guessing, leaping from one belief about sanity to another belief about insanity, keeping the audience feeling uncomfortableness, entertainment, and being off-balance ? to almost a dizzying sense of a delicious mixture of sweet and sour, hot and cold. It's possible to see elements from the movies Contact (1997) which instead focused on the larger religious, political, and science fiction themes rather than the more intimate everyday personal experience of life, The Fisher King (1991) that entered the world of mental illness in a creative, fantastical but respectful and meaningfully emotive way, and K-Pax (2001) that entered the world of mental illness but also a world of other-worldly reality and sanity. What's special about this movie is that it doesn't explain explicitly and allows the audience to become immersed into the film experience and discovery and speculate in their own time and in their own way. The movie appears to have been produced, directed, and acted with sincerity which permeates out into the film experience itself and thus enhances the belief and trust of what is experienced, connecting the film to the audience in an intimate, close way making the experience more powerful and meaningful. The only distracting element was the sync over musical scene that distanced and partial broke the magical immersion into the movie and instead flipped the audience back into more outside perspective looking into the scene, realizing that the fantasy was create and made up, shot and then remixed with a subsequent singing, albeit quality (perhaps unnecessarily good), recording voice-over. What the audience is allowed to come away with is the mixture of the past and the present and how one's experiences the now that may offer another future. n the end this movie is about going it alone or with a partner, when if one chooses a partner, you have compromises and sacrifices but also someone their to cover your back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little gem I came across. It's proves that if you have the talent and vision you can make a great movie with little budget. Like I said lots of directors from Hollywood can learn from this movies how to make an honest, precious film without the need of bottomless budget and overpriced actors. This movie has a smile yet great script that was seasoned with a remarkable direction and production values and polished with great and talented acting. Great ending with a "kind of "what the heck" twist to it. I'm not going to go into a detail review like many other users that seem to have the need to write a transcript of the whole movie.

		<fullReview>'SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Touching and hilarious little indie film about three magazine employees researching a story about a guy who posted a classified ad looking for someone to go back in time with him. The film stars Aubrey Plaza, Jake Johnson and Mark Duplass (who has written and directed popular indie films himself, with his brother Jay, like 'CYRUS' and 'JEFF, WHO LIVES AT HOME'). The film was directed by Colin Trevorrow and written by Derek Connolly (both have a limited amount of film experience). It was made on a budget of just $750,000, which is really impressive considering what was accomplished. The movie is brilliantly funny, emotionally moving and inspiring. It's one of the best films this year!Plaza plays a recent college grad named Darius who now works as an intern at a Seattle magazine. She lives at home with her father (Jeff Garlin), is cynical and somewhat of a social recluse. When a staff writer named Jeff (Jake Johnson) proposes doing a story on a guy who placed an ad looking for a time travel companion Darius enthusiastically agrees to assist him on the project. The two, along with another intern named Arnau (Karan Soni), take a road trip to the town of Ocean View in order to find the guy responsible for the ad and find out how crazy he is (if he's crazy at all, or pulling a prank). Darius finds out where the man, Kenneth (Duplass), lives and works and pretends to be interested in his proposition. The two hit if off immediately and are fascinated by each other's quirks as they slowly begin falling for each other. At the same time Jeff reveals his real reason for taking on the story; so he can reconnect with his high school fling Liz (Jenica Bergere). The story is pretty simple and the directing subtle but the film is kind of perfect that way. Trevorrow gives just the right touch to the material and stretches that ultra-low budget about as far as it could possibly go. The premise is amusing and Connolly's script is clever, despite it's simplicity. It's also packed with the actors' improvisations (which Duplass and his brother's films are very well known for), which brings me to my favorite part of the film; the performances. The acting is all exceptional! Johnson is hilarious, Duplass is lovable and also hilarious and Plaza is funny but also very sincere (and for the first time has a chance to show off her true acting chops). Plaza and Duplass also have beautiful chemistry together which is the true driving force behind the film. It's just an all around beautiful and whimsically touching film, funny as well as honest and emotionally moving. An indie film masterpiece!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filled with kinetic whimsy and star-making performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed is a potent and quirky picture; a film with such a lasting charm that to explain it to someone who hasn't seen it is a definite challenge. A challenge I'm willing to accept. Being that many of the film's high-points are heavily nuanced, imagine trying to describe this film like one would describe the beautiful engravings of a rare coin over the phone to someone whose knowledge of coins to begin with is very slim.The film is lead by Aubrey Plaza, but a majority of it is stolen by Mark Duplass in a difficult, fearless role. Plaza plays Darius, a directionless magazine intern for a Seattle magazine, who is given a job, along with two others, to investigate a man who put a strange ad in the classifieds section asking people to contact him if they were interested in traveling through time.The ad reads something like this: "WANTED: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed." The two others Darius goes with are smartass Jeff (Jake M. Johnson) and awkward Arnau (Karan Soni), providing effective comic relief to the story. The three of them, not totally excited about working together, slog through this assignment by first tracking down the man, named Kenneth Calloway, to befriend him and make him believe that they will be traveling back in time with him. When Jeff winds up upsetting Kenneth, played by Duplass, Darius assumes the role of approaching the thirty-year-old, who happens to be stocking shelves at a local grocery store. Instantaneously, Kenneth finds something about her, whether it be her stunning bluntness, her unique behavior, or just her impeccable beauty, he finds something and gives her about as much of his trust as he can give to a person he just met. For the remainder of the film, we watch as these two quirky, yet vulnerable human beings (not characters) build up a stable relationship, as Kenneth trains Darius for the event of time traveling.While Kenneth painstakingly puts Darius through endurance tests, Jeff decides to look up a formal flame, who is not chubbier yet still packs a wholesome wallop, while at the same time, harasses poor Arnau, a young college student who is a virgin, taking the job of a journalist because diversity looks good in college. Even in only eighty-one minutes, writer Derek Connolly manages to gives every characters his or her own little dimensions to build off of, never limiting everyone's story in the process.But it's the performances that remain nuanced in this sea of eccentricities. Aubrey Plaza has a wonderful Emily Blunt-like screen persona, playing the straight-shooting girl, equal parts sassy and lovable, while Duplass gives arguably the best role of his short career (which is beginning to pick up in the year 2012, with already two films he co-directed and five films he has starred in). He embodies the awkward stiffness, the bottled energy, the reclusive strangeness, and the plethora of fragile instincts of Kenneth without hesitation. This is a character who is either deeply disturbed or quietly brilliant, and the film is smart enough to fuel arguments for both propositions.Safety Not Guaranteed is a winner in terms of story and performances, but a grand-slam in terms of its modestly nuanced style and its bleeding gums characters, who give us truly compelling substance with their checkered life stories. It also gives us enough information about time travel to effectively label it, among many things, a film about time travel, yet I'm sure many who enjoy those kinds of films wouldn't be too fond of this, mainly because it explores the idea with stunning seriousness and logic rather than contrivance and silliness. Yet another thing it nuances in with its kinetic whimsy and incandescent charm.Starring: Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass, Jake M. Johnson, Karan Soni, Kristen Bell, and Jeff Garlin. Directed by: Colin Trevorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fan-freakin-tastic, fun, unique and downright entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch SOOO many movies. Several a week at least, sometimes a dozen or more. I often get in movie slumps where it feels like everything is drivel and I was beginning to feel like I was in one of those. It had been such a long time since I saw a movie that I really just loved and watched uninterrupted and was smiling when it was over. I certainly didn't expect that from Safety Not Guaranteed. I was just bored and thought I'd try it and an hour and a half later and I was thrilled to absolute pieces! The movie is so much fun, surprisingly complex, really smart writing and directing and just insanely well done. It is truly deeply fun and emotional and genuinely funny at times. The characters feel so real and everyone is so invested at making you feel absolutely everything. There is so much emotion to these characters and while I suspected how it would end, it was still just purely delightful to watch it happen. This is the type of film that you could sit around and discuss and everyone might take something away from it. I am just so blown away by how brilliant I felt it was. You have two very distinct stories. You have a budding romance between an insatiably awkward young woman looking for her place in the world and a seemingly mentally disturbed man obsessing over traveling in time. And then you have a wise cracking middle aged man who is going through his own time travel by re-visiting an old girlfriend from his youth and discovering things about himself while trying to relive his youth through his young Indian companion.My reason for wanting to see this was Jake Johnson because I really like him on New Girl. This was a different role for him because he is sort of unlikable at first and certainly dishes out one liners and is the sort of popular teenager turned lost middle ager that you can relate to. He goes through a significant metamorphosis and you will find him likable when its all over. Aubrey Plaza is nearly a young veteran of Hollywood though I did not recognize her. She was excellent in this movie. She carried the film with such subtlety and raw emotion and basically the dead-pan delivery that is known for but it worked so well here. Mark Duplass is Kenneth, the man obsessed with time travel. He's manic and paranoid but you immediately feel attached to him. He is written so perfectly because you will think that he's got very serious issues but he is so convincing that you will begin to believe everything he does just like Darius does in the film. Relative newcomer Karan Soni is sort of the biggest supporting character in the film. He is still a lot fun and his character is adorable and gets his own mini-arc throughout the film but it doesn't focus on him as much as the others in the movie. Soni and Johnson get some really good scenes together.You can tell instantly that this cast and the film makers worked so well together. I think they pooled their resources and their creative juices and made something really unique and fun. The characters are all so incredibly vulnerable in their own way and you will feel such a wide variety of emotions from one character to the next. Although I understand why, I was very disappointed that Johnson's character never really gets that final closure with his old girlfriend (perhaps a nod to the old "if you don't learn from the past you're doomed to repeat it") This film just blindsided me because I was expecting slow and boring and instead it was absolutely the perfect pace and the exact definition of quirky and unique. It really is a comedy but disguised under some very powerfully dramatic roles. I understand a lot of the scenes, especially key emotion scenes were ad-libbed on the spot by the cast and this was just perfect because they clearly had such incredible chemistry with each other. Please do yourself a favor...drama lovers, comedy lovers tired of dirty nasty stupid comedies, fans of festival flicks or someone just willing to see a really sweet, fun movie...please see this, right now. You won't be disappointed. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this a try despite reservations... and I was pleasantly surprised. The immortal Lester del Rey said "good science fiction is ultimately about people, no matter what the background or technology", and that describes this story very well.The science fiction plot device is almost a background feature for the most part, until the exciting ending, but it forms the matrix on which the human drama takes place.This movie is about many things: loss, uncertainty, ambition, apathy, relationships, faith, trust, social rejection, stepping outside the box the world puts you in, and of course... love.But yes, it is also about time travel, at least sort of. :)It isn't sci-fi in the same sense as Star Trek or Prometheus, but it is good.In the final analysis, I say this: Was I not entertained? Yes I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safety Not Guaranteed is original and builds up to time travel to a great ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Plaza and Duplass give this movie about time travel heart and emotion compared to most time travel movies about the task of traveling" Movies about time travel are always hard to make because when you make them you usually have so many questions to answer. This film however takes the idea of time travel and builds more story around it so when in comes to the actual time travel I did not care much for it because these characters were so enjoyable to watch the whole time. The story is about Darius (Aubrey Plaza) an intern to a Seattle newspaper who is asked to be a part of a team looking into an ad about a man who says he can travel in team. When she meets the man responsible for this ad Kenneth (Mark Duplass) she starts to fall for him and believe that he can actually travel in time.This film may have had time travel in the foreground but mainly it was about the relationship that develops between Daruis and Kenneth as he prepares her for traveling back in time. I really thought that the actors played this relationship very well because it seemed that he was less involved in the couple because he was concentrating on the time travel. Other stories that happen in this film include Jeff (Jake Johnson) who came up with the idea to go through with this story so he can return to an old love of his Liz. The third member of the little crew is a 23 year old Arnau (Karan Soni) who just seems to be sitting there not really doing anything which was the one character in the film that brought my liking of it way down because he appears for some time on the screen.The performances feel so natural which is why I cannot rave about them. Aubrey Plaza most known for her TV work as April in NBC's "Parks and Recreation" lets go of that character and actually gives us a different type of character. She plays the role down and unlike April with Darius her eyes actually show some emotion. Mark Duplass seems to popping all over the place this year directing, writing and acting. In this film he does the best he can do with the character because his role is the one in the relationship I cared for least because he was used more as a set up for the other characters in the film. Jake Johnson most known for his TV work as Nick on FOX's "New Girl" does share some of the same qualities with this character because they seem to be the same with this character being less enjoyable and maybe that was because of the love story he was given which started and ended not really well.This film ends with the actual time travel and at one stage I felt we would not see this because the budget may have been too limited to afford the effects needed. Overall I thought the film handled all the ideas it presented very well but most of my problems came through in the screenplay by Derek Connolly who showed a lot of underdeveloped characters maybe because he focused to much on the main character of Darius who was a sweet and sour character.MOVIE GRADE: B (MVP: Aubrey Plaza)</fullReview>

What a refreshing break from comic book inspired 'action films' and other slick nonsense. The relationship between Darius and Jeff is very poignant. One wishes it went on to what hapened next, but this could have damaged the delicate balance. The director knew this and chose not to go that route. The dialog is playful &amp; witty. The music is nice. I think that stringed instrument Jeff plays for Darius's in the fine camp scene is actually called a Dulcimer not a Zither ? James Baesel Lakewood,Ohio USA</fullReview>

You can almost feel the enthusiasm from participants who gave it all to an, essentially, a love story. Yes, it spins around the time travel but that's not the point of this movie. It's just an "excuse" to tell a warm human story about love. If the time travel is what you're looking for, there is another low budget gem: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910554/ Don't miss it, as well as this one. Now, in this movie everything is in place: actors, writing, direction, music, all of it. It's more than worth your time (and money, if necessary).

		<fullReview>Flawed, perhaps, in its script and direction, but it's so utterly likable that its many flaws don't matter much. Aubrey Plaza (of the television series Parks &amp; Recreation) plays a lonely magazine intern. She's taken along with a columnist (Jake Johnson) to investigate a weird ad that was published in the personals. The ad is looking for a companion for time travel. "Must bring own weapons. Safety not guaranteed." They find the guy (Mark Duplass) and Plaza ingratiates herself to him to get the story. Meanwhile, Johnson, kind of a lazy d-bag, goes looking for a former fling. It doesn't go anywhere too surprising, but it's sweet and touching. It helps that I'm head-over-heals in love with Aubrey Plaza. She's basically just playing a toned down April Ludgate, but, whatever, I love her to death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed is an American comedy/romance directed by Colin Trevorrow. The film was inspired by a classified ad that appeared in a 1997 edition of Backwoods Home Magazine wherein John Silveira wrote a joke filler asking for a time travel companion.Darius Britt, played by Aubrey Plaza, is a young intern at a Seattle based magazine, what we quickly learn about her is that she an acerbic and no nonsense lady, though somewhat disillusioned. At a staff writers meeting one of her colleagues, Jeff, proposes a story about a guy who has posted an ad seeking a companion for time travel. Darius' interest is piqued instantly and volunteers herself to join Jeff (portrayed by Jack M. Johnson) on a venture to write a story about the seemingly crazy chap who filled out the ad. And so the pair, along with Arnau (Karan Soni), head off to a seaside community in Washington named Ocean View with virtually no clue about the guy they intend to write about other that he claims to have travelled time once before and that he cannot "guarantee their safety".What follows is one the sweetest, most tender and delicately handled comedies I've ever seen. Firstly, despite being classed a comedy it is also certainly a romance, but under no circumstance could one ever consider this a "RomCom". The comedy is subtle and perhaps of an acquired taste and owes much of its effectiveness to the confluence of Derek Connolly's superb writing and the comedic brilliance of Plaza, for whom he specifically wrote the part. But what really made this picture stand out for me was the absolutely masterful turn by Mark Duplass who provides the role of Kenneth Calloway, the man who turns in the ad seeking a partner to travel time with. Duplass is simply astonishing in this film, managing somehow to take this eccentric loner and portray him as someone with whom the audience can sympathise. It is a testament to Duplass' incredible talents as an actor that he is able to take this absurd character and emote such sincerity and the manner in which he does allows for the humour to flourish.Jake M. Johnson, who plays the cocky and jaded Jeff, is also outstanding. Showing his ability to take what at first appears to be a bit of a clown and develop him into a much more deep and likable character.The film explores the themes of nostalgia, the desire to regress and the sense of melancholy one feels as they feel their youth disappearing. It also looks at how ones preconceptions can be overturned if they are prepared to have an open mind.I am reluctant to divulge much more of the plot as the less you know the better. I knew virtually nothing about this film before seeing it, other than the fact I loved the actors involved, and as such found the whole piece to be deeply rewarding. The performances all round are fantastic and the production value of this low budget flick are second to none. The music throughout the film is also worthy of note, provided by Ryan Miller it serves as a perfect soundtrack managing to accompany the films benign and tender nature.Screened at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, it picked up the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award and rightly so, though I suspect that it won't be the last accolade bestowed upon this utterly brilliant picture. If you're looking for a truly heart warming film with awesome performances and excellent writing then I cannot recommend this enough. One the best films I've seen all year, if not ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People are going to be satisfied by how many big laughs are in this movie, as opposed to its weaker dramatic arc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darius (Aubrey Plaza) is an unsatisfied college graduate, working as an intern for a magazine. At a roundtable session, she and the other journalists are asked for ideas they can use for the magazine. Jeff (Jake Johnson, from the TV show New Girl) is a professional writer at the magazine and reveals an ad he found, written by a man named Kenneth (Mark Duplass), who is asking for someone to travel back in time with him, claiming that he has done it before. Jeff chooses Darius and a shy, geeky student named Arnau (Karan Soni) to travel with him to the seaside community of Ocean View to investigate the story. Yet Jeff has his own personal motives: he is looking to track down Liz (Jenica Bergere), a woman that he is still infatuated with. Meanwhile, Darius finds that Kenneth he is a reclusive worker in a grocery store and that he is also extremely paranoid about people who might be following him. She tells him she is applying for the ad, but not that she is working for the magazine. Once Darius wins his trust, Kenneth takes her through his training procedures for his time travelling mission, which includes using firearms and practicing martial arts on the beach. Darius must decipher whether Kenneth really can time travel or if he is just crazy, while delicately unravelling both of their own reasons for wanting to explore the past. What would you do you if you could time travel? Most people would say that they'd like to reverse something they wished they hadn't done, or to fix or replace something that was lost or broken. When people talk about going back into the past they think about their own lives and mistakes, rather than thinking about larger historical events. They rarely consider whether one has the authority to rewrite events that will affect the time spectrum of other people's lives. Time travel in fiction is therefore intrinsic with personal regret and our obsession with shaping and perfecting the future outcomes of our lives and experiences. Safety Not Guaranteed, a comedy by first time writer- director Colin Trevorrow, is a successfully droll look at these personal motives for time travel, rather than the physical or scientific act of travelling to a bygone era. The film is inspired by a fake classified ad from the American rural publication Backwards Home Magazine, which was jokingly written asking for a companion for time travel. It is loaded with big laughs, aimed squarely at how we perceive both truth and myth, and more seriously the obsessive tendency to dwell on the fleeting ghosts of the past. What's most important is that the movie is funny. The script is loaded with dark, occasionally mean-spirited zingers that Jake Johnson and Audrey Plaza hilariously fire off at each other. I laughed consistently through the film when it sustained this very dry, blunt wit and self- deprecating humour. Yet Trevorrow also uses this comic edge as a guard between the characters and the audience, keeping them at bay until they are ready to reveal themselves as more tender and nostalgic than we initially realised. Both Darius and Kenneth's desire to time travel stems from love and regret, which means that their connection is highly predictable. But Darius's admission about wanting to save her mother is one of the few glimpses where we emotionally respond to her as a character. In keeping with the notion of perception though, the tension in Darius and Kenneth's relationship is sustained by questions of whether he is simply crazy, and whether he will find out that Darius is working for a magazine to discover information about him. Jeff also has to change his perception of truth, particularly when the Liz he once knew is gone and must accept who she is now, rather than lulling on the past. This subplot is well-established and her character has some depth, but it ends on a sour note and feels unresolved because it overlooks the chance for more character development. Also, despite the amount of tension surrounding Kenneth's paranoia, there's an unintended level of irony regarding the predictable framework of the film's screenplay: it's so reminiscent of other films I've seen that some of the broader points in the narrative are foreseeable. The truth or fantasy concept, to me, owes a lot to K-Pax (2001), where Kevin Spacey played a man who was convinced he was from another planet. Or the Australian superhero movie, Griff The Invisible (2010), where an ordinary guy thought he was a crime fighter, as a counter to being bullied at work. I thought Safety was just an extra step above that movie because of how well it aligned my perspective with Darius for a great length about what was real and imaginary. But just as the film is about to reach a darker psychological layer, the tone swirls out of control, and the film ends on a frustratingly convenient note, where magic realism jars awkwardly with the small slice of life mood. For me, that was a large detraction from the rest of the film. However, the film is still extremely funny and I think that a lot of people are going to be satisfied by how many big laughs are in this movie, as opposed to its weaker dramatic arc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) is the type of sweet, low-budget indie comedy with an intelligent heart that's slowly become synonymous with the Sundance Film Festival. Starring Aubrey Plaza, Jake M. Johnson and mumble-core director Mark Duplass, Safety Not Guaranteed is a pitch perfect slice of contemporary American cinema with an intriguing sci-fi twist.Less a &#xfb01;lm about time travel, but rather a moving and witty comedy that just so happens to include time travel, Safety Not Guaranteed is a pitch-perfect example of smart American indie &#xfb01;lmmaking at its best. Using its intriguing science fiction premise to bulk out the &#xfb01;lm's overriding theme of regret, Trevorrow's &#xfb01;lm has far more in common with a life-af&#xfb01;rming road movie or coming of age comedy than it does with special effects laden blockbusters. It's this focus on character development and a natural, smart and often hilarious script which makes Safety not Guaranteed such a immensely enjoyable &#xfb01;lm.Every single member of the &#xfb01;lm's minute cast puts in a tremendous performance, however, Johnson as the roguish man-boy reporter is perhaps the most endearing. The delivery of his lines and ability to allow the audience to warm to his childlike obnoxiousness is superb, stealing the spotlight from Plaza's starring role and even outdoing Duplass' Timothy Treadwell-inspired eccentric, obsessive time traveller.Highly original and incredibly entertaining, Safety Not Guaranteed is just the type of refreshing and intelligent &#xfb01;lm you trawl through &#xfb01;lm festival programs in search of - a real jewel in the crown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film I've Seen All Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a budget of perhaps 10 box tops from some Cocoa Puffs, this film managed to be the most entertaining thing I've seen all year. The entire cast fits together and play off each other in a delightful way and the ending is great without being sappy sweet or maudlin.I don't want to get into the plot, but Aubrey Plaza's debut as a lead actress is right on target and I see much success for her in the future in a lot more movies. Mark Duplass and Jake Johnson are excellent, and that new kid Karan Soni...well, you'll be seeing more of him in the future is my guess. This was a movie crafted with care from both the mind and the heart. I also saw Prometheus this summer and found it sterile, empty and pointless, everything this movie isn't. But in the end it was the characters and writing that made this movie so enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safety is never guaranteed in life, love, and friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED.PLOT: Parks and Recreation's Aubrey Plaza plays Darius, an intern at a Seattle news magazine roped into investigating the cryptic personal ad with lead writer Jeff (Jake Johnson) and fellow intern Arnau (Karan Soni). A trip to the small town of Jake's youth allows him to try to reconnect with an old flame while Darius and Arnau stake out the post office box trying to get a glimpse of the man behind the ad. He is Kenneth (Mark Duplass), a grocery clerk fond of headbands and secrecy, easily one of the most interesting characters portrayed on screen this year. He is building a time machine, and Darius becomes the one he trains as his protégé and then partner. WOUNDED LIKE-MINDED FRIENDS.REVELATIONS: The performances are strong with Plaza and Duplass as stand-outs. The screenplay weaves Jeff's journey back into the past through connecting with an old girlfriend against Darius's burgeoning respect and love for Kenneth as they fire pistols, run through the woods, break into low-level scientific installations searching for crucial pieces of the time machine. Washington state looks great, and the movie's humor moves easily. CONSTANT QUIET SURPRISES.LOVED: I love the open-ended quality of the film including its wonderful ending. Kenneth is a singularly weird, possibly mental ill, possibly genius of a character, and Duplass's face is fresh and his work here is nomination-worthy. Johnson is annoying and crass, and his thread pays off in a rough, raw way. Overall, the plot takes its time, meanders and wanders. BEAUTIFUL AND SAD.MISSES: I don't believe that the plot strand dealing with Arnau (and Jeff's influence over him) is as strongly sketched out, and Arnau's stakes as a character are simply never as strong as those of Jeff or Darius. I wish that the character was given more to do and say. And as much as I like Plaza's performance (her first lead, I believe), there's simply too many shots of her staring at Kenneth in meaningful ways versus speaking. I wanted her character to verbalize more of what she was undergoing, and her transformation lacks the power that I think the director was reaching for with her character. SOME UNREALIZED POTENTIAL.TAKE-AWAYS: There is a simplicity to the premise of this film, to the want-ad's haiku-like poetic brilliance and its eternal relevance. On some level, the conceit of return is present in relationships and friendships as a person risks to find someone who will make them feel at home, safety, peace. Connections are not jokes; payment is never upfront or assured; the wealth of forging a friendship with another is unquantifiable; with everything, we always have to bring our own weapons, armor, issues, and defenses. Experience is overrated and uncertain; safety is never guaranteed in building a friendship, forging a connection, falling in love with someone. Safety is never guaranteed, but I do guarantee that this film will make you think, make you wonder at Mark Duplass's unguarded and sweet performance, make you smile. GUARANTEED YOU'LL THINK. Here's my ad:SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED: Wounded like-minded friends. Constant quiet surprises. Beautiful and sad. Some unrealized potential. Guaranteed you'll think.

		<shortDescription>Time Travelers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always had fascination with people that are outsiders because of how colorful in persona they are, their live life though their own wavelength, their never boring, they have a lot to offer the world, but most of all are truly honest about their feelings; I myself am one of them.This film is one of the most bizarre yet strangely cleaver and beautiful time travel tales and romances I've seen. I love the fact that it takes place in Washington State since that's where I live and they actually shot in parts of the locale, one of them Ocean Shores where I've gone on vacation sometimes. What makes this time travel tale unique is the fact it doesn't take place going on the machine first hand and using it but it takes place before the time travel adventure begins, that is if a machine really exists? What makes this romance unique is that it's about two characters that are actually outsiders in life, there not stereotypical pretty boys and girls that look and act boringly normal. The film is funny if not always ha ha funny, the film is a dramady. Aubrey Plaza is just great, yeah I'm a fan of the show "Parks and Recreation" and her character April is my favorite. Darius is almost the same kind of character but it's a little different because unlike April she's slightly dialed down where she's an outsider but she feels like someone that could exist, like a person you might have passed by or noticed someplace but never gave a second thought. Aubrey plays a bizarre but sad clown type, I always like that because those type get to exercise different emotions. She's a person of sympathy because she gets no respect from anyone, down on her luck, has lost her mom which sort of explains her cynical attitude toward life, and worst of all no luck in love. However despite this sadness she's not bitter she's fun and funny whether she knows it or not. My favorite moment with her was when both Kenneth and Darius talk for the first time in the grocery store, she passes the test he gives her and then she simply puts a soup can on the shelf. I couldn't help but crack up at that because it was just funny because of how strange it was it was mainly from the look she give him when she does that.Mark Duplass (whom physically looks almost like actor Nathan Filion he's got the chin)is just great as Keneeth you could love this guy. Keneeth is fascinating because despite how odd he seems on the outside he's very human. I like how there is this cloud of mystery that revolves around him where it can almost be easy to dismiss him as a loony but strangely from the amount of time we spend with him I found myself actually believing the guy because most of what he says there was real conviction in his voice. He might be a little guilty of anti social behavior because he is a little insecure about giving his trust to others, which is one of the reasons he gives Darius certain meeting spots at certain times, I kinda can emphasize with that cause I don't give my trust fully to people when I first meet them. His lifestyle is a bit solitary but isn't boring he always has something to do likes doing some physical activities which is mainly time travel training. And the guy is sweet, the moment when he plays an instrument and sings a song to Darius was great.I really love the chemistry between the two, I feel this is another of those rare times of romance done the right way because it has two factors, suttle build up but most of all likable and believable characters. Both really are right for one another because they both truly are similar, both have been though a great deal of hurt and loss in their lives which has kept their lives on hold in some sense, they don't have many friends or love, but both are able to talk to one another and relate. We see both have fun with one another. The dialog between them is at times hilarious because of some of how strange it is sometimes but it's also actually sweet when we see both actually open up and grow closer to each other.The real mission isn't to travel to the past but to the future. Rating: 3 and a half stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trusting Your Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Kenneth for real? That's the big question posed and answered by this marvelous movie, a cleverly written tribute to the matters of the heart. "Safety Not Guaranteed" starts as a quirky investigation about what might just be a crazy attempt by a peculiar individual who wants to go back in time to solve a very important problem. When a local Seattle magazine gets a wind of this man's adventure, a discontented intern, an innocent student, and a jaded reporter try to figure out what really lies at the core of this man's project.As expected, relationships are developed, paths are cleared for each of our protagonists to get closer and closer to their individual truths. For some, what they end up realizing gets a bit closer to happiness, for some there's the realization our dreams might never come true if we don't have enough faith and face our true selves.The film itself doesn't travel a straight line to its very satisfying resolution. It keeps the mystery going, and it doesn't feel like it's cheating its audience because it gives enough insight, with genuine emotions to see that our feelings are not as easy to understand because we avoid them for the most part, and sometimes society just teaches us to behave in particular ways.Everyone in this movie is a bit odd, even a surprise appearance by a character long lost feels like there might be more to what she says, and this is supported by Kenneth as he explains her sudden reappearance. Those characteristics are what make us like the film. These people are different but not unlikeable. In fact, there is a silent character who manages to makes his mark by the way he gives us inquisitive and semi-incriminating glances.You must be warned you will probably have a marked reaction to this film's ending. It's one very rare resolution in this day and age because we have traveled a long way to this point, and we feel like we have grown and earned our participation in this magical moment. It's an open ending, one that will leave the audience talking to each other, asking more questions and maybe even demanding a sequel to the story, and I wouldn't have a problem, spending another couple of hours, learning more about everyone involved if they continued to capture the magic of movie-making this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I burst out crying at the end - No Joke!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as I saw the preview, I desperately wanted to see "Safety Not Guaranteed." And I was NOT disappointed!This quirky, low-budget film is an absolute gem. I loved everything about it -- even some of the seemingly-sloppy "loose ends," which, I believe, understatedly emphasize the point, raised implicitly throughout the film, that everyone's life path is weird and unruly. I laughed a lot -- watching it with my mathematician/computer geek husband and three tech-absorbed sons heightened the experience (some of the youngest male character's lines are absolutely priceless) -- and was amazed to find myself bursting into tears during the final clip.Fantastic casting, great acting, wonderful writing, excellent music, and camera work that perfectly suits the story. Like another reviewer before me, I was intrigued that most of the audience in the theatre remained seated all the way through the end of the credits; and I really liked that reviewer's interpretation, that no one wanted this movie to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was curious to see how this movie was going to play out since it is based on a (real) newspaper ad that was very similar to the one that kick-starts this movie. So I was glued to my seat the whole time, just waiting to find out how this story was going to end. I was quite pleasantly surprised with the ending, and you know how almost everyone in the theater gets up and leaves when the credits start crawling up the screen, right? So imagine my surprise when the lights came up at the end of the credits for this movie - and 90% to 95% of the audience was still sitting motionless in their chairs. I'm just guessing, but I think it was because they didn't want this movie to end - even though it obviously had. That's how good this movie is. Check it out. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst movie i have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so boring and really i can say it was a waste of time to watch it.There is not really much to like or dislike in this film as it is not a complete film. Like many in of its type, its lacks any real depth and tries to get by on some teenage or SNL type charm. The result is a movie that has no real story, no resolution, no real characters that you give a damn, and you just leave the theater shaking your head. Why this was a crowd pleaser at Sundance may be because everything else was so lame? I don't know but this is a paper thin attempt at novelty that doesn't work. Safety Not Guaranteed starts out as a humoristic road-trip-esque adventure with the promise of some deep science-fiction but it ends up as some kind of modern romance movie with horrible music and around the 55 minute mark it really starts to drag as the movie slowly works towards tying up loose ends. Then when it finally ends, it ends with such an anti-climax that it seems like the writers just stopped caring and never finished the story. Science-fiction? Time travel? In the very last minute, just before the credits role. Leaving too many questions unanswered and generally undoing the good feeling you get from it in the first 50 or so minutes makes me wish I could go back in time to stop myself from watching this movie. Aubrey Plaza (Darius) looks great and if it wasn't for her good looks, I wouldn't have rated the movie as high as I did. Karan Soni (Darau) plays a very convincing timid intern and should have gotten more screen-time. The rest of the actors were so-so.</fullReview>

Aubrey Plaza does exactly what she does everywhere else, but here, in this context, it works. Take a sci-fi premise and mix it with a gentle love story, add a few metaphysical Charlie Kaufman-like touches...and voil?...the perfect movie for a hot summer's day. My only issue is the the film is sometimes too twee and quirky for its own good. But overall I highly recommend. This is the work of real film- makers.

I think that theme of this movie is not time travel. I guess time travel is metaphor in the movie. Characters of this movie have any regrets or troubles in their past. However, all of them get over those regrets or troubles. I think that Darius and Kenneth also will do so. This movie seems to say "Don't stuck past, we can get over troubles in the past." Also, I think that the end of movie represents that, "we can change the future." I felt that the story deployment passed little fast, but generally it was interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a love story. Dalius is an inter-ship student. She wants to go back to the past. Simularly, Kenneth wants to go to back past in order to help a woman who he loves so that he made time machine. In the beginning, Dalius meets Kenneth in order to report for article, but gradually they like each other. In particular, Kenneth makes several things secret in the beginning but gradually talks about himself to Dalius. on the other hand, I'm interested in Jeff. Jeff is a journalist. In fact, Jeff tries to meet Liz who is relationship between Jeff. Though Jeff meets Liz and together over night, Liz refuse to live together . I think Jeff realize that youth is not long. Jeff takes Arno and pick up three girls and go theme park. Jeff cries. Jeff makes Arno be together overnight with a girl. In the last, I think Dalius feel Kenneth's kind so Dalius becomes feminine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching this movie. The director of this movie minds small things. There are some good points. First, there are three main reporters in the movie. One of them is a permanent employee and two of them are interns. While they instigate a man, each of them fall in love. Although a girl is a main character, there have each romance story and this movie focuses on each story. And also, main character, a girl, becomes more and more beautiful. For example, at the beginning of the movie, a girl wears a T-shirt and a pair of trousers. At the end of the movie, she wears a dress. Her clothes change well. I enjoyed to find it. Furthermore genre of this movie changes, too. At the beginning of the movie, it is like human drama. It focuses on a girl's life. The middle of the movie, it is romance and mystery. And the end of the movie, it is science fiction. This movie is really technical. I think it is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a research trip of three persons, three stories go on simultaneously, and all of them are a kind of romance as if it stresses this film is a romance. There are too many kisses, and I don't need those scenes so much. It is better to show love other ways.I like the ending. Until the end we don't know whether a time machine really exists or not. This is foggy but exciting for audience. But I feel, just before the climax, that the story is compelled to change unnaturally so as to make a surprising end. In that time, story develops rapidly, so we are confused and start thinking about the questions. "who is a good or evil?" "who is telling a lie?" "Is she dead or not?" At last we expect the truth to be cleared, but a lot of why remain after the end. The only one thing we find out is that time the machine is real. It is interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film that describes the emotional growth of people. A woman who becomes disgusted with her depressed life starts to serve as an intern at a publishing company. One day, a senior reporter finds an unbelievable advertisement in a newspaper. The content of the advertisement is seeking a companion for time travel. The woman and the senior reporter start to investigate about it with another intern.The main character is the woman, but the transitions of other leading characters' minds are also described closely, so I think the script is polished well by the producer and scriptwriter. All the leading characters are swayed by their past and cannot go forward. However, they start to confront the past regret and move on gradually. I'm really moved by their growth. What is particularly striking is that the woman accepts her regret and real intention and becomes stronger to get what she wants.I think that everybody has a few regret about his or her past. It's important not to stop at that point but to make the best use of it for their future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy flick falls short of potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot for "Safety Not Guaranteed" was interesting and had potential for a very good film. Instead, a disjointed script that slows down in places comes close to losing a viewer's interest. The cast are OK, but only Mark Duplass as Kenneth gives a very good performance. The movie is billed as a comedy, drama and romance. But one suspects there is more here early on as the story unfolds. There is some mystery, so it's most likely on the shady mysterious side. Toward the end, one begins to suspect there may be some sci-fi here, and the ending turns it into fantasy. The film has a couple of side stories ? a former romance rekindled by Jeff, played by Jake Johnson; a magazine research for a story; government men stalking Kenneth. More focus on the main story, and shelving Jeff's romance would help the main story. But, whoops! That would eliminate the gratuitous sex from the movie. And Hollywood must need that more than a better story and film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing but confusing story, with good acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an independent film, it definitely has the feel of one. The story progresses at its own pace, and is focused more on character progression. I feel like many of the independent shows I watch produce the common reaction of, 'what did I just watch?'The story itself too is very strange, and engages audiences in a game of guesswork as to whether Kenneth is crazy or legit in his mission of time travel. The film switches constantly between portraying him as sane, or insane. As well, the film doesn't give a lot of information into supporting either, and so the audience is constantly reworking their perception of him. The acting is quite natural and fits the tone of the film. Plaza does well as an untraditional protagonist, and carries the film well. She gives a great performance and displays raw emotion. Her chemistry with Duplass shows great progression as the movie continues, and it was great to see this development. Duplass does well in his character, and keeps the audience guessing as to his mental state. Johnson and Soni give an average performance, and provide some comic relief to the film.Though I appreciate that this is an independent film, and therefore stands apart from mainstream movies, it brought me on a roller- coaster of a ride. I was sometimes bored, sometimes intrigued, and sometimes confused. It is definitely an interesting watch, but isn't for everyone. The ending, however, was too much for me. It was pretty unexpected (which I guess can be a good thing), but it felt totally detached from the original genre of the film. While it does keep within the trend of what an independent film might do, I felt like it was too much of a let down. The whole movie slowly built up towards this climax which turned out to be not all that exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and weirdly real in all of its surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, why is the story so interesting? It has that same kind of thing that Birdman has: is he or isn't he? In both cases, "is he delusional or not?" In Birdman it is "Does he really have superpowers?" while in Safety Not Guaranteed it is "Does he really know how to travel in time?" It's so amazing when the writers can play with the viewers mind, make them think it is real, then make them think it isn't, is, isn't... That's really effective. That makes you want to see the whole film, even if just to find out how it really is.The characters are also interesting. Most of them had depth, very interesting depths and different depths, which is important. If every character just has the similar kind of depth, like tragic childhood, it's not really depth of character, it feels more like just a spice to the character.The cinematography is amazing. It kind of reminds me of Wes Anderson's films. To be honest, I didn't pay attention towards the end, because the plot started to interest me more than the techniques, but at the start the cinematography is almost playful. The music is also well chosen. It is mostly light, except when it needs to be something else. It works very well with the scenes. One of my favourite thing was how there are scenes that make you feel so good, and those scenes don't feel forced. The film-makers have really done such authentic, nice scenes, and you just want it to stay that way, you want it to stay lovely and all that. Amazing job.In short, should you watch this movie? Yes, you should. It's light yet deep, it has interesting story and amazing cinematography and music. It might not be perfect, but it doesn't need to be. It has its own warm but weird charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a sci-fi movie ... and I got one, albeit a very different one.This little gem is a sci-fi mystery story that talks about the ones that do not fit in. The characters are all lovable (even the initially annoying journalist that leads the trip to Ocean View) and all, everyone in his/her way, are weirdos or out of their path. The journalist tries to hide his sentimental vacuum acting like a teenager or a fool and thinking obsessively about sex. The two leads, Darius and Kenneth, are self admittedly out of place in this world. The young Indian nerd is stuck to his laptop and lives in a theoretical universe. Event the beautiful Liz, an old date of the journalist, after a failed relationship lives alone in a beautiful but secluded home, feeding her chickens and thinking she is too old to start a new romance. The movie is always interesting and original and will keep you guessing about Kenneth sanity until the last frame. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to watch this movie I wasn't expecting much. I was just hoping that it would be entertaining.The story is fairly simple, but intriguing. The characters quickly become more and more relatable. The characters are, perhaps, the best I've seen in a romantic comedy. Almost Game of Thrones level. The script was great! It is original and when it resembles other movies it avoids falling into clichés. It has a couple story-arcs that don't really intersect but, strangely, it works. The reason is both stories allow the characters to display multiple dimensions. Aubrey was great!!! I expected to see her classic apathetic young adult, but she quickly departed from that and showed great chemistry with Mark Duplass. I REALLY WANT TO TAKE POINTS OFF, but I can't. Even the music was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes me dream-full. The heroine, named Darius, works at the publishing company and she is bored by her day life. One day she accompanies her senior to investigate an advertisement in a newspaper. It says "I recruit a companion who goes to time traveling". Finally, they can find the client, named Kenneth. Darius tries to be the candidate hiding her identity and she can be admitted, so they start to train for time traveling. Spending more times, there are some sympathy between Darius and Kenneth. However, one day Kenneth knows why Darius approach him, so he loses trust in her. The time they spend together is long, so finally, Darius and Kenneth get back their trusts and go to time travel. Recently, I watched one picture in which there is a man who came from a different era. Since then, I am interested in time travel. At first I thought Kenneth is crazy because he tries to do impossible thing (time travel), but finally I was really moved by his effort. At the same time, I thought we should do what we want to do. We can live only once, so we should live without regrets. Maybe Kenneth does not regret about his life, so I need bravery to do something impossible.</fullReview>

The film starts with the main character, a wealthy old lady who is in a hurry to catch the train on time. She is a very suspicious person. There are not many characters and happenings, but we can enjoy watching it, because the old lady's character is very firm. She never changes her personality in the film even though there is an accident due to her mistake. It is very interesting, because many films I have watched changes the character's personality or characteristics in the film through some accidents they overcome or just go through. This film is only ten minutes long, and as I wrote before, there are only few characters and accidents, we can still enjoy watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Safety Not Guaranteed' is a mysterious film. Actually I don't like this film because I don't know what the author wants to say through this film. I think this film is a kind of romance but it is also a suspense. In the beginning, I thought that I had seen this kind of film except for the theme of time travel. Moreover, the main character is common who is dark, negative, pessimistic, and selfish so I don't expect any happy ending or bright future. In addition to that, the former of this film is interesting but the latter is not interesting for me because the genre of it changes in the middle. Initially, the main character struggles with her life and changes gradually. Then, the story changes to a love story. Of course the subplot is a love story, however, all of the story becomes romance, even the main story, so I'm tired of it in the middle. The only thing I'm interested in is the ending. It is revealed at the last scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always wanted to see this movie right from the time I heard about it way before it was released and I believe it was worth a wait. There is a line in the movie that says 'There is no sense in nonsense' and they followed what they said as the movie directly jumps into the story. Felt quite entertained with the writing and performances with a perfectly paced screenplay that starts sober and quite and races to an exhilarating finish. Aubrey Plaza has been quite impressive in her previous works and takes it a step forward when awarded with a lead role.When a magazine is looking for a story, they come across an interesting personal ad titled 'Safety Not Guaranteed' with an invitation to travel back in time and that the subscriber Kenneth (Mark Duplass) has only done it once. Seeing a potential in this a team consisting of Jeff (Jake M. Johnson), Darius (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni) travel to the town where the P.O. box is located. As with the media goes, they do their surveillance, identify Kenneth, follow him and try a little sting operation by sending Darius as bait. After she passes his tests, Kenneth starts to train her where she gets close to him though he is a little weird. With more people following Kenneth, his clumsy daredevilry, a soft heart and a shady past leave Darius with too many decisions to make with too little time.While Aubrey steals the show with the right amount skepticism and charm required for the character, Mark Duplass even betters it with his intentional clumsiness in action sequences, amateurish use of spy jargon and that comic innuendo associated with a delusional person. The script tries to be simple and modest allowing the characters to expand and play the central roles. Jake M. Johnson has a charisma and comic timing which is good but extremely one dimensional that can only suit sitcoms and I guess he is putting his energy in the right places at the moment. Here he is involved in a small detour of a script that starts and ends abruptly. With the hype, pace and excitement built up towards the end, it need not have shown what it shows at the end. Background score is similar to that of the movie which is indie and original.Smart simple story elevated by apt performances and character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak - Watch if you have nothing else to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like time travel movies with a story and a good cast, I wouldn't suggest watching this one. There are no shortages of time travel themed movies from giant budget (Deja Vu) to micro budget (Primer) and everything in-between (Time travellers wife, Happy Accidents, Donnie Darko, Groundhog Day, Source Code, 12 Monkeys, Time Bandits...). The magazine crew are moderately interesting but the main character Kenneth played by Mark Duplass is not a good fit showing only a weak performance. The film lacks atmosphere, re-watch-ability, memorable characters, knowledge of science or science fiction. Most such movies have a gimmick, from classic props (Back to the Future) to tense emotional connections (About Time, Happy Accidents) or just great performances (Primer). This film lacks all of this and the current rating suggests people either don't watch time travel films or only the cast watched and voting on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small, hardy and delicious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films can be compared with those gifts that we don't give much importance - especially when we are children - but which later, proved themselves quite amazing, and fun. First production to be directed by Colin Trevorrow, "Safety Not Guaranteed" is an excellent example of this type of production. A very low-budget science fiction (ridiculous cost $ 750,000, reports Wikipedia), has a premise that can be summed up in one line, and features a cast of unknown wide audience. Nevertheless, the film proves a small jewel of inventiveness, and disengagement. It is also a proof, that even the gigantic, and often massifying Hollywood industry, there is always room for genuine talent (after surprising many, Trevorrow now faces the formidable challenge of the newer sequence of Jurassic Park, which should arrives in theaters on June 2015). "Safety Not Guaranteed" has that tone of boldness, absent in many productions of gender, tied by their own pre-established formulas. It is a delicious playful, light and relaxed exercise, but also a great gift to the value of everything that dares to be different, with fundamental touches of comedy, drama and romance. A handsome package, that well worth unwrapping!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Indie Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little indie flick comes highly recommended. Despite the movie's newbie director (Colin Trevorrow) and first time big-screen writer (Derek Connolly), Safety Not Guaranteed achieves the difficult balance between quirky humor and witty dialogue and a sentimental love story. TV stars Mark Duplass (The League), Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation) and Jake Johnson (New Girl) are exceptionally cast. The plot enables key trademarks of the actors' TV personas to shine in unlikely settings effectively convincing viewers that they are indeed watching new characters.Unhappy (and slightly lost) interns Darius (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni) are apathetically selected to join Jeff (Jake Johnson) on a weekend trip to Ocean View, Washington to investigate the author of an unusual classified ad. The highlighted piece reads, "Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before." We meet oddball Kenneth shortly thereafter. Immediately curious, viewers cannot help but root for him as bits of his tale begin to unfold. An underdog like Kenneth hasn't been this likable since Sean Astin's Rudy. Through a series of amusing meet-ups Jeff, Darius and Arnau explore Kenneth (and Ocean View). Scenarios are cleverly poignant and humorous without giving too much away. One memorable sequence includes a nostalgia-ridden Jeff circling a go-cart track at high speeds while taking swigs from a half-empty bottle of whiskey. Most of the film also includes a thoughtful level of detail that aides in developing the story while still being very funny. Each character's self discovery becomes a surprisingly unique and sentimental experience in quaint Ocean View and viewers looking for a feel-good moment will be rightfully rewarded.Safety Not Guaranteed is not your everyday, forgettable comedy. It concludes with a satisfying and touching ending that equals any of cinema's great reveal moments. This movie is one of those rare full-length features with enough heart and humor to make even multiple viewings enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SNG takes the viewer on a quick vacation from work reality literally with the characters, and figuratively... with the characters. It seems to almost accidentally force the viewer to both have and question faith in people and the supernatural. Each rising action has us re-question the plausibility of whether there is actually a time machine. It's a fun look at the ordinary that allows us to see through the view of the world we might have lost with age. A fun comedy that is worth enjoying.It all starts with a group of reporters (a reporter and his interns) taking a "business trip" to nowhere to explore a story of a man who believes he can travel through time and is seeking a partner. The film explores a jaded male character who takes a vacation back to his old life that he starts to romanticize via his old girlfriend. It's everything he should have expected, but when he gets it wrong, he is both upset and excited at his new future. All of this is centered around the exploration of a man that these reported believe is crazy, but their faith is slowly rattled when it seems like he might not be as crazy as they all thought. This is ultimately romanticized by our leading lady who is the first to start to have faith. The characters show steady growth and the viewer is somewhat shaken to believe a little more in the miraculous.</fullReview>

How Darius changes, learning her love is more precious than peer pressure, was very well constructed. On the other hand, Kenneth, was his "problem" that he can really build a time machine? The answer is no. He was also an escapist, lying to his past. The motivation of him building a time machine was after all, a cover up for his weakness. Letting that ending happen means Kenneth being an only winner saying "reality sucks" to the others who decided to live in the real world. To conclude, subggenre killed the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was overall unsatisfying for me. The story was exciting at first, but the end was not quite what I expected. Three magazine employees head out for an interview they had seen in the newspaper. It was about a man who is seeking a partner to travel back in time. Darius is a young intern in Seattle and as she works with Jeff and another intern, she is deeply interested in Kenneth's plan to go back in time. Even though it was for their newspaper, as the interview becomes closer to the truth, the three find out the real truth about Kenneth. Darius and Kenneth become very close but are they really going to be able to travel back in time? The truth can be seen once you watch this film. However, I did not like how it ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of the name of this film before watching it, but I did not think that it sounds interesting probably because of the Japanese title. I thought that this is a story about a girl who can travel from present to future or past. However, my anticipation was totally wrong, and I think this film is a human drama rather than science fiction. I like the characters in this film, especially her boss, Jeff. I thought he was a jerk at first, but coming to the end, he looks like a good and kind boss. One thing that I do not understand is what they want to do when they go to the past. If they must not do something to make better future as Kenneth says, I think they have nothing to do in the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Back To The Future Light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should have been called Losers get Laid. The biggest problem with this movie is that none of the characters are physically or emotionally appealing. The second biggest problem is almost nothing happens until the last few minutes of the movie. I spent the whole movie thinking "Get on with it. Please, get to the point!" It is almost all filler.This is not Back to the Future Light. You spend no time in the past or the future lovingly recreated.The time machine is just too ridiculous for words, with spinning propellers and bursts of burning gas.The movie has one clever plot twist, but that is not enough to carry a movie.In a normal movie, everything is exaggerated to make it more exciting. In this movie they do the opposite, turn even a heist into something as mundane as going to the corner store for milk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarity guaranteed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delightful indie comedy, courtesy of newbie director Colin Trevorrow, is first and foremost an ode to all the outcasts that don't follow society's expected patterns of social integration but prefer to stick to being themselves. Aubrey Plaza stars as the witty intern Darius, a young woman who has always had a hard time fitting in or making friends, and as such is relegated to do all the dirty jobs at the magazine publisher she works for, until she jumps at the chance to show her employers she can do more than refilling toilet paper. As it happens, a most peculiar newspaper add surfaces, wherein an unknown person is looking for a companion to travel back in time with him ('safety not guaranteed', it says, along with the advice 'to bring your own weapons'). Together with the arrogant but lazy reporter Jeff and her fellow intern Arnau (an Indian guy who is suffering from virginity, or so the overly horny Jeff seems to think), Darius is dispatched to track down the one who posted the add to see if he's for real, in the hopes of getting an interesting story out of it. What they find is a seemingly completely nutty supermarket employee named Kenneth (the comedically underrated Mark Duplass) who proves rather paranoid and prone to violent selfdefense of his privacy, so he won't let anyone come too close to him. Deciding to let the interns do all the hard work so Jeff himself ? no so coincidentally ? can seek out an estranged girlfriend in the area, Darius soon infiltrates Kenneth's life in order to get to the bottom of it all. She gets more than she bargained for as she soon considers the oddball a kindred spirit, who is all too serious about his quest to jump back in time, making her go through a rigorous training course before deciding on whether she's time traveler material. This naturally causes the pair to bond, despite the both of them engaging in some convenient truth-altering to get closer to the other. Meanwhile, Jeff finds his lost love and gets stuffed with all sorts of delectable pies, while Arnau may or may not have his cherry popped. Instead of allowing the time travel element to drive the plot in an effort to have the protagonists reconnect with their pasts and set their status as outsiders straight, Trevorrow cleverly opts to have them connect to each other in the present for their own mutual emotional gain. The film's message: 'here's to the losers, bless them all'. If you go in focusing on the time travel aspect the movie seems to be built around, expecting a big FX show, you'll be disappointed in that regard ? the movie cost less than a million bucks for heaven's sake! ? but few will find it impossible not to be charmed by the true heart and soul that drives this film and its likable out-of-the-box characters. Not to mention the fact this flick contains its fair share of hilarious situations, including a night equipment raid at a science lab where the employees just so happen to be throwing a surprise birthday party. Mr. Trevorrow, Jurassic Park IV is all yours. If this appetizing film is any indication, an interesting result seems guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cannot praise this movie enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not rating it a 9 or 10 because it's not apocalypse now or the good the bad and the ugly.First of all if you're expecting a time travel epic don't look here, you should know better once checking out the cast and reading Aubrey plaza's name. It's a light hearted film, a comedy and a romance, but i wouldn't call it a romantic comedy (due to all the clichés that come to mind and that people tend to associate with the so called 'genre' which has been already run to the ground).If you're clear on what the genre of this movie is and still want to give it a go, i highly recommend it.The chemistry between all the characters is just superb as is their acting; Their journey is satisfying and their heartbreak is palpable, there are no dislikeable characters even if they start out being very annoying, which i think is one of the biggest strengths of this movie.It manages to take you from not caring at all to hanging on the edge of your seat surprisingly quickly.They say moviegoers gave a standing ovation at sundance and it doesn't surprise me one bit. the director of this film had a passion for telling a story and the low budget didn't get in the way of anything that it set out to accomplish, which is something to admire.Truly, an independent masterpiece and i'll definitely keep an eye out for the upcoming work of everyone who was involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The storyline caught my attention and I decided to see how the movie was. The thing is that usually it's not very easy for me to watch a movie whose cast i barely know. Not that I only prefer movies with film stars, but I guess you sort a just know what to count on.. I didn't know these cast, I mean I know Jake Johnson from New Girl and hardly knew more than that, but still decided to try and I couldn't have picked better. This movie is amazing!! It keeps things very simple and real: a couple of journalists/ interns who are looking for a story. At the same time the story is about the possibility of time traveling. I mean I know what you're thinking, at least what I thought, probably they're gonna find some crazy poor man who suffered with something. And it is sort of what happens, but the amazing thing is that during the movie you find yourself wanting that time travel exists and rotting for the crazy guy not to be crazy. At the end I just loved the message it passed me, trough the story that ended up evolving all the characters, even the ones who seemed emotionally off: sometimes we just have to blindly trust the people we love.It's a risk, it's different, unknown, weird... but a risk that can turn out to be great! I believe it's really worth seeing, Darius it's a very original character and it's only about an hour and a half so very easy to watch ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious genre mish-mash sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This indie time-travel flick is as outrageously funny as it is sincere and heartfelt. While the premise might have some movie-goers titillated by its sci-fi roots this isn't where the strength of the film lies. Or at least not where its emphasis is placed. It is the reason behind the characters motivation to time-travel into the past which really drags this film into brilliance. I know, I know ? we don't need another film that leads to romance to add to our already heaving shelves, but I assure you, this one is worth it. But hang on, I've jumped the gun and given quite a bit away in a short period. Let's backtrack? The film takes centre stage around an ad placed by Kenneth (played by Mark Duplass) seeking out a partner to time-travel back into the past with. The ad goes like this: WANTED: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before. As ads go its short, to-the-point and bloody well intriguing. As well as, of course, completely crazy. So if you're a journalist looking for another story to earn that monthly pay-check then this seems like a pretty good way to do it. Hey, you might even get a few laughs from it. This is what Jeff (Jake Johnson) thinks anyway ? though he has ulterior motives for wanting to visit the town in which the crackpot 'time- traveller' lives. But we'll get to that a little later. If you would like to read the rest of my thoughts on this film then please go to this site (filmrambler.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/safety-not- guaranteed.html)</fullReview>

My point is 8/10 for this film, because, I watched the film with pleasure, due to the fact that subject of the film was interesting for me. Also, cast of the film was chosen well. These were good characters, better written than what you would expect to find in a simple comedy. Each have their reasons for being there. The first point makes it a comedy but the second point, the main one, makes it a drama so be prepared for a more thoughtful journey than just a laugh riot. It is fairly original, especially with the much talked about ending. Namely, I like this film generally, so I can say that I can watch this film again and again.</fullReview>

I did not watch and like, science fiction movies but it was very different from other science fiction movies and I said it had other sense like drama, comedy. Actors and actresses are not very popular and famous but they were very successful. The story of Safety Not Guaranteed is time travel and everybody can have good idea while watching movie.

		<fullReview>If I could nominate 6 movies for my top 5 slots then this film (along with "The Sessions") would fill that 5th slot.This is one cool, hip, droll &amp; clever movie that revels in it independence without being arty-(youknowwhat). It is emphatically not a thriller but it stays one step ahead of you to the finish. Derek Connolly &amp; Colin Trevorrow work as writer &amp; director as seamlessly as DNA molecules.None of this works without winning performances by Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass (who is also in the year's best film, "Zero Dark Thirty"), Jake Johnson&amp; Karan Soni. Their characters could've so easily been stock rom-com types that are turned upside down, but Treverrow &amp; Connolly don't destroy the apple cart. They let quite a few of them loose. It's Twilight Zone conventional. If there is an antonym to "oxymoronic" this movie defines it.This is a really sweet movie for people who are sweetness-adverse. The sci-fi element is almost a con. It reminds me a lot of a great Nicholas Meyer movie released decades ago called "Time After Time". This movie is in that league. It's a movie for all but the dimmest of wits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Indie Movie with Awesome Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the classified ad that sets this movie in motion floating around the Internet a while ago. I suppose it was only a matter of time before someone took the premise and turned it into a film. Genius idea. I wish I'd thought of it. A simple classified advertisement for a man seeking a time travel companion could inspire a few different movie ideas, so I was surprised to see SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED approach it as a romantic comedy. It works, though. I really enjoyed this movie. It's funny, honest, and the chemistry feels real. I'm not a fan of romantic comedies because they usually feel forced and the humor usually fails, but writer Derek Connolly and director Colin Trevorrow have created one of the best in the genre (again, in my opinion). Aubrey Plaza is Darius, an antisocial girl whose life is in a rut. She seems friendless and spends most of her time as an intern at a local Seattle magazine. She volunteers for to work on a story investigating a local classified ad where an unknown man is in search of a companion to travel through time with. "Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once. Safety not guaranteed." Along with her writer boss and another intern, the three seek the man out and Darius is put forward as their contact. Darius and the man, Kenneth Calloway, hit it off and slowly she gains his trust to become his partner. As the time of his mission approaches, Darius and Kenneth grow closer while the question continues to loom: can he really travel through time or is he insane?SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED definitely feels like a hipster indie film. There's sharp dialogue and a cynical protagonist. As the movie progresses, of course, you find that there are reasons behind Darius's cynical world views and part of this movie is Darius coming out of her shell about it. It was the time travel premise that lured me in but the movie is, at its core, about relationships. Darius and Kenneth are two people who've closed themselves off from the world for personal reasons. There's a subplot of Jeff (Jake Johnson), the staff writer in charge of the story, with his own reasons for going on the trip; he hopes to reunite with a beautiful girl from his teenage years and charm his way into her bed again. And then there's Arnau (newcomer Karan Soni), the other intern. He's a soft-spoken nerd who's never so much as had a girlfriend. Whereas Jeff and Kenneth are obsessed with relationships of the past, Darius and Arnau are having trouble forming relationships of their own. It's a great story, with all of the relationship subplot material interwoven with the time travel premise. It's a pretty short movie. It's not quite an hour and a half long. So it's tight pace and the story keeps moving forward, never quite giving the chance for anything to grow stale or boring.This movie is one of the little surprises that pop up every year. It goes around the festival circuit, gets some great reviews, and might enjoy a limited release if it's lucky. It's a shame. I think this movie would've done really well if given a chance. I guess it's lack of a big name attached combined with unproven filmmakers Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow just didn't give enough confidence for wide distribution. At a budget at less than one million, it wouldn't have been that difficult for it to recoup its money and word of mouth would have given it some nice returns. The biggest name in the movie for general audiences would be Aubrey Plaza, who should hopefully see some more opportunities if this acts as her breakout performance. She's her usual sarcastic self but she's just so likable. Her character is incredibly vulnerable and she's put into a situation where she needs to come out of her quiet shell. Her chemistry with co-star Mark Duplass is perfect. I've seen some of Duplass's other work, behind the camera. He and his brother are responsible for CYRUS (good movie) and JEFF, WHO LIVES AT HOME (not so good a movie). In front of the camera, he's great as Kenneth. He's paranoid but earnest in his bizarre mission. You don't know whether to believe him or not.This movie is one of those easy to recommend to pretty much anyone. It's one of those movies that you walk away from feeling good. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED will hope bring new opportunities to all the talented people involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is such a touching oddball sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed is Derek Connolly's debut screenplay which gets the fantastic relationship between the unsociable Darius (Aubrey Plaza) and the mad genius (or not) Kenneth (Mark Duplass), both of which have had troubled pasts and despite his upcoming classified mission, their bond alone is funny and touching. To support the main theme of the central story, there is a nice subplot involving the sleazy Jeff (Jake M. Johnson), who just wants to drink and get laid, rekindles a former flame, which allows him to rethink about his life at the moment.With Connolly's smart and witty dialogue, as well as gags that humorously discuss Star Wars. Director Colin Trevorrow balances the piece from being too sentimental, whilst applying both fun and ambition towards his characters. Without giving anything away, the climax is quite the leap of faith and could've ruined the overall tone, but due to the fantastic relationship of the two leads, it's really uplifting. It is such a touching oddball sci-fi with great performances by Plaza,Duplass and Johnson.I can't wait to see what is next from Director Colin Trevorrow</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Safety' is NOT a futuristic sci-fi like 'Back To The Future', nor, thankfully, is it like the recent, and dire, 'Looper'. Female lead is a pretty little girl, unhappy with life, who works as an intern in a mag. In meeting to find stories, established reporter reads to the others, the ad requesting applicants interested in going back in time. Ad is true story, and is where the film gets it's title from. It is decided that this could be a story and established reporter says he will take two interns, hands go up, and he says he will take the lesbian and the Indian. The trio set off to get the story. Established reporter is played by actor from 'New Girl', and the role seems much the same in this. The Indian intern is, well, think 'Big Bang', think 'Raj'. I thought 'Big Bang' meets 'New Girl', and certainly the film had some of the same stock characters, but these were not crude two-dimensional figures, there was real depth to these characters too. What was so good about this film, was that you really did not have a clue what was going to happen next. The various sub-plots and twists made it interesting, whilst at the same time confused you, and made you unsure even what type of film it was. Entertaining and thoughtful like 'Back To', the frolicking in the forest reminded of the beach-frolicking in 'Spotless Mind'. Female lead is able to show her emotions and feelings, without speaking, and audience easily sees things from her point of view. There is romance, relationships, and raw, real-life. Sex eventually rears it's ugly head and there is even a bit of stuff about the time-travel plot. Nothing very new at all, some ideas are very old even, but all told with a freshness that make you believe in the characters and the plot. This is entertaining, without being a laugh-out-loud, joke a minute, comedy. Be prepared, to be surprised, to need that hanky, when the tears come. It should be stated, too, that the sub-plots are ESSENTIAL, as they link the characters to the central theme.I knew nothing about this film, before I saw it, except the briefest of a review on the cinema internet site. I like time-travel-themed films, so thought I would give it a go. Hoping for a decent film, I was blown away. It is on a par with 'Silverlinings'. Yes, really, it was THAT good. A MUST SEE! Hence, it has to be, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The small indie version of Back to the Future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨But at the end of the day do I need someone when I'm doubting myself and I'm insecure and my heart's failing me? Do I need someone who, when the heat gets hot, has my back?¨Safety Not Guaranteed may be a small independent film, but it has a huge heart. They may not have had a great budget to work with, but the movie felt more authentic than most big budget Hollywood movies. Safety Not Guaranteed has great comedic touches, some drama, sci-fi, and even romance. It is a complete film that connects with the audience from the very opening scene. This is director Colin Trevorrow's first feature film and he made a brilliant movie. He had a great screenplay to work with, also from a first time screenwriter, Derek Connolly, who happened to write the story specifically with Aubrey Plaza (from Parks and Recreation) in mind to play the lead character. She was amazing in this film as was her co-lead, Mark Duplass (Humpday). The chemistry between the two lead actors was really authentic, but the film also had a great story arch for the secondary characters as well. The film was really well written and the dialogue top notch. It's hard to come across a movie that connects with the audience so well in so many different levels. I felt this was the indie version of Back to the Future, not because the film actually takes us to the past or shows us how to get there, but because it explores the issue of why someone would want to go back. I think that is much more important in a time traveling movie than the actual adventure. The characters here had a lot of depth and there were so many things happening in such a short period of time that I really don't know how Treverrow accomplished all of this. This is a unique film that is hard to come across, an indie that actually feels like an indie, but that isn't afraid to explore new subject matters.Darius (Aubrey Plaza), who has a rather anti social behavior, lives in Seattle and is working as an intern for a magazine company. When her boss, Bridget (Mary Lynn Rajskub), asks the crew to come up with ideas for the next article, staff writer Jeff (Jake Johnson) mentions an unusual article that has been published in a classified ad in a small coastal town. The ad states the following ¨Wanted: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You will get paid when we get back. Safety not guaranteed.¨ Bridget gives the project the green light and sends Jeff to that town to investigate along with two interns: Darius and Arnau (Karan Soni). When the trio arrives at the town they begin investigating the man responsible for the ad: Kenneth (Mark Duplass). He acts all mysterious and is convinced that he is being followed. When Jeff tries to approach him and volunteer himself as the time travel companion Kenneth refuses and sends him away. Darius however manages to make a connection with Kenneth and wins his trust. The interns also discover that the real reason for Jeff wanting to write an article on Kenneth is because he wanted an excuse to reunite with his High School fling, Liz (Jenica Bergere), who lives in the same town. That relationship becomes the side story to the main idea that revolves on the relationship that Kenneth and Darius begin to form as they prepare for their time travel. The real question is whether Kenneth really is building a time machine or if he's just a messed up and crazy person.The connection that Darius and Kenneth make is the true heart of the story. The question isn't whether Kenneth can actually time travel or if he can really go back in time, but rather why he wants to go back and if he's crazy or not. He does act in a rather peculiar way, but he's also a very nice person who cares for others. That is what ultimately attracts Darius to him, his humane heart, although she isn't quite sure if this guy is totally nuts or a genius. The film deals with these issues in a very authentic and powerful way. I really connected with this small indie film and enjoyed every minute of it. It had me laughing really hard at times, despite it not being a laugh out loud comedy. It has a lot of heart and even mixes some sci-fi elements as well to please everyone. The performances were really special, but the screenplay helped a lot as well. There were several moments and dialogues that rang really true throughout the film. I really loved this film and recommend it if you have a chance to see it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie is surprisingly good. At first, i thought it's gonna be one of those films that would make you question yourself, "Did i really just wasted 2hrs of my life on this crap?". This is not of those movie though, the actors have portrayed their character so well and each of the actors really fits on their character. The script is well-written. Story is not just about traveling back in time, it's about getting closer to a complete stranger, learning to trust and eventually falling in LOVE in the most unconventional way. Although it's a completely cliffie movie, well, just imagine the two leads having their 'happily ever after', they both deserve it.So yeah! Go watch the movie! It's really underrated! Deserves to be appreciated!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously, He's Not Kidding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a conversation that takes place between the two main characters in Safety Not Guaranteed, Aubrey Plaza's Darius and Mark Duplass's Kenneth, in which Kenneth talks about his first girlfriend. He tells Darius that yes, technically he could go out and get another girlfriend like everyone always says, but he could never find a way to replicate the time and place. He could never capture that same ephemera and unhinged optimism again no matter what. I loved that conversation, and that feeling Kenneth mentions is one that struck me hard watching Safety Not Guaranteed; this is an inspired effort and one that I'm not going to forget.Safety Not Guaranteed is a movie with a premise involving time travel, though you're not going to mistake it for Looper or 12 Monkeys anytime soon. Darius is struggling through a rough time at her internship with a Seattle magazine when suddenly she finds herself attached to a project she finds very intriguing. Magazine writer Jeff (Jake Johnson) picks her and fellow intern Arnau (Karan Soni) to go along with him in an effort to research a man who placed a newspaper ad asking for someone willing to travel back in time with him. He advises potential participants in the ad that they'll need weapons and won't get paid until the journey is complete.(More)For the rest of the review, please visit IMDbrian.com.

		<shortDescription>Not sci-fi, but a very good independent romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked this up at Redbox yesterday, and I'd give it a 7.5. My wife saw that IMDb classified this movie as "sci-fi." she said she didn't want to watch it (*she has a huge aversion to sci-fi*). After I said "It is also classified as a romantic comedy, and how much sci-fi could there be in a romantic comedy. Also, remember how you enjoyed the Time Traveler's Wife (which for some reason is not pointed out as sci-fi on IMDb); well, I am sure it is similar, with the bulk of the movie being about the characters, and not about the time travel itself." That said, she said she would give the movie 10 minutes; but if she didn't like the first 10 minutes of it, she'd head off and read a book. Suffice to say she not only watched the entire movie, but she laughed out loud many times, and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.... as did I.Safety Not Guaranteed has all of the elements has the unique story, good acting, and witty lines that I find in all indy films that I enjoy. If you are into independent films in the realm of Adventureland, then I can virtually guarantee that you'll enjoy this movie. If you didn't enjoy Adventureland, then maybe you need to re-examine your life. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do we love movies? Why do we hate spoilers? Because we like stories and we like them to be told without compromises. That is the magic about this movie. It is a great story without the usual hullabaloo, keeps the interest alive till the end and does not disappoint. It's a surprising find for me since I connect with the characters who are not so normal but hey what do you expect from a sci-fi comedy. However its amazingly mature. Mix Napoleon Dynamite with Astronaut Farmer and add sincere intensity of love actually to it. I don't know about others but as a child I have been a bit of a lone wolf and till this day I find myself a little awkward. In short, this movie lifts my spirit which is a tough thing to do so it is good :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's one thing that's better than going to see a movie that you really really hope is going to be good, it's inviting someone along with you and getting that satisfaction ten times over because you got to share the experience. That's what happened to me when I went to see "Safety Not Guaranteed"; a movie I heard good things about, decided to check out with a friend and completely fell in love with. Once it gets going it will sweep you up and keep you entertained all the way through. The characters are rich and well written to the point that even the film's sub plots will have all of your attention. I found the main plot of the story to completely encompassing and I was eager to see what would happen next, when all of a sudden it would switch to another set of characters and instead of being disappointed that I wouldn't see more of Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass (at least not for a little while) I was delighted to see more of Jake Johnson or Karan Soni's stories. It's funny with just the right amount of bittersweet, and the premise of the film, is dynamite. I couldn't figure out if the ad that kicks this plot into action was for real, a cry for help, the real deal or something completely different. Simply seeing the ad again fills me with excitement. WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before, SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED. If you're not sold on the movie from those lines alone, let me convince you. "Safety Guaranteed" is a wonderful film. It's full of surprises and it wraps itself up so perfectly you'll leave in a terrific mood. It's one of those hidden gems that you can feel free to just pick up and watch anytime and it'll totally brighten up your day. (Theatrical version on the big screen, August 14, 2012)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three reporters track down the man behind a classified ad asking for a partner for a time travel adventure. It's a beautifully written story about our overwhelming desire to travel back in time - the compelling fantasy of building a real time machine, but also the time-travel fantasy we build in our heads, of the possibility of changing the past, or of bringing the past into the present, meeting old loves again and finding happiness. Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass are great leads with a convincing chemistry, but a fantastic supporting cast often outshine them in terms of depth of character and performance. The centre of the movie for me was Jake Johnson, the jaded reporter and likable sleaze who goes back to a small town to try and recapture the passion of a teenage romance he's been fantasizing about ever since.</fullReview>

Sadly the bite never materialises and we about half way through the film we get soppy silliness, virtually it turns into a romcom - made poorly, with a bit of potential time travel as a side story. The film meanders it's way along, going nowhere in particular and leaves the viewer unsure of what they are actually watching. I say a Romcom and a bit of very lighthearted fun at best. I am very surprised it has a (currently April 2013) 7.4 rating on IMDb, I can only imagine that in time this film will find it's true level of around 4.5 - 5.0 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed might seem just a run of the mill mumble core movie based on actors that are involved in this movie. But this really has an interesting time travel premise that really make this romantic comedy movie really interesting. And where most movies go on autopilot in the 3rd act this movie actually gets the most interesting in the 3rd act and that very end was probably the best part of the movie.Aubrey Plaza gave a fantastically enjoyable performance, granted she didn't show much range since she is doing the similar thin she is doing in Parks and Rec. as far as performance goes. And all other actors gave really good and funny performances.If there are any complaints I've had about this movie is that it starts out kinda slow and there are some parts that were neither funny nor interesting, but overall this is definitely a movie worth watching.</fullReview>

I definitely did not expect such a delightful and cute love story that was in no way gushy, shallow, or stupid. The acting and script was great and the low budget did not impact the quality of the film. It was definitely not your typical story but I think that many viewers would feel a connection to the characters and plot. There was something about it that was heartwarming and realistic.

		<fullReview>Though listed as a comedy, this movie is hard to categorize. It has some funny moments, but it steers towards possible sci-fi and a romantic drama at various parts. Aubrey Plaza is Darius an intern at a Seattle magazine, who gets an assignment to investigate the person who placed a classified ad looking for a partner for time travel. She is accompanied by a fellow intern and an editor to do the story. They manage to find the person, a guy named Kenneth, who works at a store stocking shelves and building a time travel machine in his spare time. Darius meets him and joins him in his quest. A side story with her editor rekindling an old romance is thrown into the mix. The story moves along briskly, and I was impressed with Plaza in the lead; she has a natural and easy going manner and is very likable. Safety Not Guaranteed is a solid 7/10.</fullReview>

The lead actor is even less appealing. Comic relief is provided by the now tired cliché of a hapless Indian computer student.Very little actually happens in this film. I suspect the actors made this to fill in a blank space on their resume.If you're a nerd who likes anything remotely connected to Time Travel, then you'll probably love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pleasant moments, adding up to nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is sometimes amusing, although never laugh-out-loud amusing, and generally makes for a pleasant hour or two, but by the end it adds up to nothing. The characters are all appealing. The warmed-up romance between the journalist and his ex-girlfriend is sweet and touching, yet just before the end of the movie it suddenly falls apart, and for no real reason that I could make out. So why did we follow that subplot at all? Just for its cuteness? I guess so. Not good. The romance between the girl and the time-machine man is touching, but to finish it off with their sailing off on a time-trip together is ... pretty lame. All his paranoia, which was presented as almost certainly a sign of his craziness, pretty much played for laughs, turns out to be maybe well founded when we learn that the government really does have agents after him, and he really has built a time machine. But it causes you to think back and realize that many of the comedic-paranoid bits don't make sense if they are to be taken seriously. He's a nutcase, but he's not after all. So what are we supposed to make of it all? There just isn't a proper explanation and I, for one, was left dangling and feeling rather cheated by a script that was ultimately quite hollow. I think you hve a lot better things to do with your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie from a team of Hacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie and I am hard to find words to review a "movie" which completely resembles something that a first year film student would put up as a test assignment. Wait, even that would be better than this effort put by a team of hacks which have absolutely no clue how to write anything original. The fact that this has over 90% rating on rotten tomatoes simply proves that even the critics have their blinders on when faced with any kind of cinema tooting anything unconventional.This movie is anything but overtly conventional and simply badly done in all departments be it acting, script writing, directing or comedy. Stock characters? One geeky Indian who by very virtue of being studious is uncool - Check, A girl with a hole in her soul - Check, A weirdo guy Check, A dude Check. Now that we have assembled our unique set of characters lets proceed.The first 30 minutes of the movie would rest any doubts that this is no Sci-fi flick as it attempts to be a kind of hipster-cutesy road movie with terrible writing. Not one joke is funny or is delivered right. The film meanders while setting up characters who are cardboard or worse thoroughly unlikable. There is a side story about the Jake Johnson playing "Jeff" and a blonde which has absolutely no relevance and has no bearing on the story as a whole. He comes to find her and talks to her, sleeps with her and leaves. What happens to them next, god knows. Sloppy writing.Then everything turns into a mysterious quest. What is Kenneths purpose? Who is he and is the time travel thing real? We constantly ask ourselves while we are subjected to a numerous cutesy scenes of learning shooting, or robbing a medical center (laughably staged like it's a pilot for a really shitty TV show) or sharing some heartfelt and silly reasons to travel back in time or kissing each other in front of the bonfire (wow).In the last 20 minutes the movie not only falls flat on its face but instead begins to dig a deep hole into the earth making its way to the Earths core with its lameness.Two agents pop up from somewhere which leds Darius to coo "Oh my god oh my god, this is REAL!!". When she actually gets to talk to them here is the lame hack explanation that the Agents give to her "We have been investigating him for two years (2 years!!), he constantly talks about the "accelerator at Berkeley". Okay. Did a kindergarten kid write that line? Following on when asked if they are sure that Kenneth stole the lasers from the medical compound, they say," Well.. we are positive". Hello? This guy walked out with 5 boxes worth of goods in front of 20 people in slow motion and you are in doubt? Who wrote this stinking piece of juvenile script? You are investigating him for 2 years and couldn't break into his creaky barn to see his instruments? This is what I am spending my 10 bucks on to see in a theater? The funny part is that this is not a spoof, this is real.Upon informing Kenneth that his dead girl friend is actually alive, he just wonders for a moment and then shrugs it off and runs away. What does it mean for his character? Upon knowing that Darius is part of the Magazine group and has betrayed him, he also totally doesn't mind this fact at all and just coolly invites her over to his time travel boat.Oh yeah a time travel boat with a car's rear view mirror attached to give out a lens flare which looks futuristic given the low budget the movie is working out of. Wow. Totally believable.The last 4 minutes has everybody running through the woods with the Agents following last. There is no sense of urgency or mystery. We were already shown the actual barn where Kenneth planned his machine. It had doodles drawn by 5 year olds on the wall, the lamest engineering plan ever to be committed on celluloid. Its hard not to let out a guffaw when you actually closely look at what are the diagrams.What a turd of a movie. Want to see a really good low budget concept movie? See Another Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie almost faultless. The script is excellent, the acting by Aubrey Plaza was absolutely pitch-perfect, just full of detail - even the way she moves and walks develops the character (congratulations Aubrey! This is a real achievement!), the whole story is quirky and entertaining. I didn't find the subplots, as one reviewer said, distracting: they are all connected with the theme of love and awakening. The characters develop with complexity: it's a sophisticated and realistic view of human nature. In fact this movie has a very powerful message about love and what creates love. I liked the way so many plot lines were still loose at the end. This is a wonderful example of how to make a meaningful yet approachable movie on a nothing budget. This movie joins 'Little Miss Sunshine' on my top twenty movies of all time. I will watch the future careers of Colin Trevorrow, Aubrey Plaza, Derek Connolly and Karan Soni with interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing about Colin Trevorrow's "Safety Not Guaranteed" when I started watching it. I was pleasantly surprised. The offbeat characters in this story of a disheartened college grad who looks into an ad for someone to time travel turn it into a deep, multidimensional movie. The fine scenery of the Washington coast setting adds to the enjoyability factor.Most of the modern movies that I've seen recently have been indies. Hollywood currently seems stuck in a rut of sequels and remakes, often disseminating press releases about superhero flicks before they even go into production. But "Safety Not Guaranteed" avoids clichés, focusing entirely on plot (with some quirky things added). I liked it, and you probably will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been pretty good.... shame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this review by saying I am a science fiction fan, but did not expect this movie to be science fiction. That is good, as there was no science in it. It was a light-hearted, mildly comedic, mildly dramatic romance. That's fine. Low budget, not-stellar acting? Fine. If it is a science fiction movie, or even just about time travel, I use a sliding scale, as these movies typically are under-funded and not so popular, therefore the director needs to work with a bit less and not completely realise the project. So it seems incredible to me that here we have a decent movie with an interesting script, with an at least average-grade plot and with a surprisingly capable cast, all but the lead female role. I will never forgive Andy McDowell for her performance in Four Weddings and a Funeral, but I have since watched that movie at least ten times again. Unfortunately, with SNG, I truly will not be able to watch this film again. The main character was just so poorly developed and acted that it just killed the movie for me. When I become aware of an actor's acting, it's over. The whole point of acting is that we are not aware of the acting. A good actor just breathes life into a character and that character becomes a real person. That's why we laugh and cry, love them or hate them. That's what I believe, at least.The female lead was just not believable. Her actions and expression just did not match her character. It became a sappy, dumb love story because of this. It's a complete shame, because this film, even with the plot holes, the not-so-good audio, etc., etc., could have been a 7-star movie. It just needed some actual heart. Pity. 5/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say that 'Safety Not Guaranteed' is shot with low budget. It is really humble movie. Limited places and techniques are used, and the actors and actresses are not popular. Therefore, the movie can not be so popular, too. I think this is sorrowful. The subject of the movie is interesting, but its style of narration is little bit deficient. Actually, this is related with its low budget. The scenario and the fiction is not wondered by audiences. The movie has few dilemmas, so it can not create question marks in audiences' minds, and its time is short. However, it is different despite everything which I said before. It is related with human relations, and the messages in the movie is simple and understandable. I like its end, actually.

Even the film seemed like a interesting topic, interesting topic lost by and by. Also, the film was romantic and science fiction. The film shows that two lover's feelings. Frankly, some part were curious and all parts were not boring. If you are interested such as this topic, you can watch. Actually, There are unexpected events in the film. So, I was shock at some events. For this reason, I liked some parts. You can watch family, friends, relatives. Also, final part finished in a unexpectedly way. If you have leisure time, you can watch the Safety not Guaranteed. But if you are busy, even you watch to the film because of advices, I think you can disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a low budget movie that would probably bore 95% of the population. That being said, I am not part of that grouping because I loved it. I mainly only watched the movie because I love Aubrey Plaza but I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was absolutely fantastic and the story was incredibly original. The movie was more about life and how we perceive ourselves in it that time travel and I think that's what the writer and director were going for so I think they did a great job. This film reminded me of a quote from the show Boston Legal where the character Alan Shore says, "I think we live our lives so afraid to be seen as weak that we die, perhaps, without ever having been seen at all." If you see the movie I think you'd see why. Most people will never watch this movie but they're definitely missing out. It was short, sweet, and heart felt. Great job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The indie comedy is an interesting subgenre. Sometimes they can be entertaining, deep, and funny pieces of cinema, such as Little Miss Sunshine or Jeff Who Lives at Home. Other times they can be depressing, wandery garbage with a few laughs if you're lucky, like all the Sunshine knock offs that have come out in the past few years. Safety Not Guaranteed is, thankfully, much more comedy than it is indie. Cleverly written, and entertainingly executed, this movie is a fun and sweet romance about a man who wants to travel back in time.The story is of a lonely girl named Darius, who works as an intern at a vain magazine. Her mom died when she was little, and she has been anti- social as long as she can remember. One day, her boss decides to take her and another intern on a trip to write a story about a man who placed an add in the paper: Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed. So Jeff, the shallow, self absorbed writer, takes Darius and the other intern to the small seaside town to find out about this guy. The man's name is Kenneth, and when Darius talks to him, she finds herself falling for him, and even believes he may be able to go back in time.Aubrey Plaza, of Parks and Recreation fame, plays Darius, which is essentially a more dramatic version of her TV show character. She is dark, brooding, and also very funny. Mark Duplass, who directed Jeff, Who Lives at Home earlier this year, plays the role of Kenneth. He is a strange character, that seems to really believe he can travel through time. After all, the add did say he's done it once before. Jake Johnson gives the role of Jeff, the sleazy boss, a funny and enjoyable quality, and he brings the unmiraculous subplot involving him and an old love to a higher level.The script by Derek Connolly is pretty good. The main plot is always funny, deep, and wildly entertaining. The subplot with Jeff and his old flame is really quite predictable and a bit silly, although it is fun to watch with Johnson's character really shining through. The relationship that develops between Kenneth and Darius is sweet and very funny to watch.Colin Trevorrow directs the film to give it a grainy, 1970s look. This really works for the movie, especially in the moments when it is clearly inspired by those independent films from that era. Trevorrow convincingly creates well rounded characters that we really grow to like and root for.Safety Not Guaranteed is a funny, meaningful, and fun movie. The humor is abundant, and even the boring subplot is funny. This film is one of the funniest movies of the year, and there have been a lot of them in 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Successful Indie Syfy-Comedy Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does a rather odd eccentric grocery clerk (Mark Duplass) possess the key to time travel? In "Safety Not Guaranteed" a cynical magazine intern (Aubrey Plaza) looking for a bizarre human interest story answers a want ad by Duplass who's seeking a companion for his next journey through the fourth dimension. Mark Duplass and Aubrey Plaza are excellent in this whimsical take on human relationships and the risks you have to endure to make them possible. Derek Connolly's screenplay is smart, fresh and funny. There's great support from Jake Johnson as Plaza's boss who's preoccupied with linking up with an old flame and isn't all that interested in hallucinations of time travel. Karan Soni is another intern whom Johnson is determined to educate about life. This picture best belongs to the genre of films that like Kevin Spacey's "K-Pax" and Vincent D'Onofrio's "Happy Endings" expose us to a character who arouses our curiosity by claiming to be some kind of alien and/or time traveler. If that sort of thing appeals to you I think you'll like "Safety Not Guaranteed". I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only lovers of quirk will ignore all the silliness and proclaim this a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1997, a classified ad appeared in a survivalist magazine which read: "Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before." The ad eventually became a sensation on the internet and the basis for the movie, 'Safety not Guaranteed'.If you're expecting this film to be a contribution to some dark world of brooding, noir-like sci-fi, you'll have to look elsewhere. Director Colin Tovorrow is a talented enough director but one wonders why he chose Derek Connolly's quirky comedy as his first feature film. On the surface, the concept appears to be a whole lot of fun, but for a number of reasons, it ultimately leaves one with both a dour and sour taste.I realize this film is supposed to be a fantasy of sorts, but there's no question that the film lacks verisimilitude. I'll skip around here for a moment in referring to the plot, just as an example. What exactly is up with those government agents? These bumbling fools arrive at the house to take down Kenneth, and it sure takes them a quite a bit of time to chase the paranoid 'time traveler', after he runs out of the back of the house. When they finally get to the lake, do they draw their guns and at least command Kenneth to get out of the boat and apprehend him? Or do they end up standing around like a bunch of schmucks and let him accomplish his nefarious goals? If the point is that they're just a bunch of buffoons, to my mind that's simply an example of weak, weak storytelling.The same goes for what happens after the inciting incident. The editor approves Jeff's idea to investigate the so-called 'time traveler' and sends him, along with the two interns, to find out who the nut job is. Fine enough. But after Kenneth rejects Jeff, then you must suspend your disbelief that Darius is allowed to gain Kenneth's trust, despite the fact that he's obviously paranoid and dangerous (imagine the kind of lawsuits the magazine would be subject to, if harm had come to Darius). Of course all you lovers of quirk will object by saying that it's supposed to be silly, and that's the whole charm of it! If there's any saving grace in 'Safety Not Guaranteed', it's in Ms. Plaza's performance, who acquits herself well as she handles the raving Kenneth with aplomb. An opportunity for some really cool time travel is lost however, when Darius admits that she lost her mother when she was young but there's no attempt later on to send her back and perhaps prevent the awful event from occurring.Where Mark Duplass manages to be charming under the direction of Lynn Shelton in 'Humpday' and 'Your Sister's Sister', as Kenneth, he's a complete, unlikeable loser. All respect for the character is lost when the film's scenarist allows him to actually commit a burglary, stealing lasers from a restricted facility. Why Darius plays along is mystifying.For awhile Jake Johnson as Jeff does well in conveying an overall noxious demeanor and imperious hold over the interns. Eventually, after looking up his long lost high school love, Liz, he turns into a love sick puppy dog, begging her to abandon her life in the small town and come back with him to the city. Wouldn't you know it that after being rejected by Liz, he plays mentor to Arnau, and encourages him to get laid with some local teenage girls they pick up in town. It seems to be a common requirement of films of this ilk, to depict the rite of passage as a young male finding the gumption to end his virginity once and for all.Much has been said of the 'clever' ending. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. Yes, crazy Kenneth turns out to have been telling the truth. The paranoid loser is actually a genius, outwits government agents and gets the girl. One problem is that we never get to see if he changes time (too bad dear reader, you expect too much!).For lovers of quirk, 'Safety Not Guaranteed' will prove the breakout comedy hit of 2012. Other more discerning critics I'm convinced will see this first feature effort as partly unpleasant, but really just far more silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an instant response to just finishing watching this film so please excuse any hyperbole, but I am keen not to under whelm this brilliantly made film.Its rare that I watch a film an instantly becomes a favourite but I believe this film has just reached such a mighty height. A really good concept with excellent characters delivered with equally good performances, especially Kenneth (Mark Duplass) played it pitch perfect with excellent comic timing. The story although offbeat never strays too far into the ridiculous and neither does the humour, at times indie films can almost become a parody of themselves. This is not no of those cases it is finely balanced just enough humour to counter emotion, while driving a compelling story.Hopefully this film will avoid the dreaded patronising pat on the head of "what a charming film" which would be a massive under sell, as the makers deserve a lot more credit.Like good films with your comedy, Safety not Guaranteed.</fullReview>

That's sarcasm by the way and when I saw a preview of this I had no idea it was a internet meme but I was still interested in it. I was expecting a funny comedy with jokes but yet some nice serious moments. What I got was a romance/drama. There was barely any comedy in this. You're hoping it's true that he can go back in time and you are interested in the main story line the little minor ones are interesting but with disappointing endings. Some say the ending of the movie is disappointing. I disagree but I did not like how they left so many unanswered questions. FAQ should have a field day with this one. Overall this movie was good but nothing special. I was hoping for something creative and fun but in reality it's your typical romance film but done in a unique way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But Not Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a quirky, kind of fun film. I am a fan of time travel related movies and TV shows, so the premise interested me. There are a few plot holes to overlook and the story kinds of goes off in tangents. The main character, the one who places an advertisement for someone to time travel with, is the most interesting person in the film. I've read a few reviews where there is some question about whether or not the main character did or did not go back in time. I believe the answer is obvious, but I can see where some confusion may exist. It is worth seeing as a matinée but not at nighttime price and frankly, seeing it as a rental is sufficient too. That being said, it is a worthwhile movie to see.The R rating is appropriate. There are sexual themes in a few scenes and the story is made for an older audience, so kids and teens should not watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming, Quirky, and Exceedingly Likable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination of high concept sci-fi and romance in film is nothing new. The Adjustment Bureau is the most recent example that comes to mind but there are countless entries into the mashed-up genre over the years, despite the seeming clash in ideas. As a sci-fi nerd, however, I find that more often than not this combination fails to impress or turns out downright awful, usually because the two elements fight for attention and end up smothering each other in the process. Safety Not Guaranteed, then, represents a real achievement, entering into a fraternity of select films that tell a worthwhile romantic story while displaying a healthy respect for the science fiction that brings the pair together.The classified ad read, "WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before." When her co-worker Jeff (Jake M. Johnson) pitches the ad's creator as a potential story for their magazine, Darius (Aubrey Plaza), an apathetic intern who has yet to find her passion, volunteers to come along for the ride. After arriving in the small town from which the ad originated, they soon track down Kenneth (Mark Duplass), the eccentric but harmless man who claims to have built a machine capable of taking people back in time. Posing as an interested partner, Darius inserts herself into Kenneth's life, working with him to prepare for the journey while simultaneously gathering information for the magazine expose, all the while believing that Kenneth is crazy. But as the date of their trip draws near, Darius finds herself smitten by Kenneth and is forced to decide once and for all whether she believes in his reality or not.Safety Not Guaranteed has a definitive quirky streak that runs through every aspect of the film and it could certainly find a place among Wes Anderson's stable of films. It is not, however, defined by its quirkiness the way many Anderson films (and their copycats) are. Instead, Safety uses the quirkiness to set the table for its assorted story lines and then proceeds onward with a fairly straightforward set of narratives. In essence, director Colin Trevorrow and screenwriter Derek Connolly use a taste of weirdness to lure the viewer in to the romantic relationships of each of the main characters as well as the sci-fi undercurrent. I can see how this could turn some viewers off but it worked for me, partly because the setup is excellent and partly because of the strength of the characters and the actors who play them.There are very few movies of late that feature characters with such high level of likability as what you'll find in Safety Not Guaranteed. Darius exhibits a gloriously apathetic approach to life that goes hand in hand with the dry, sarcastic sense of humor that Plaza specializes in. But from the outset it is apparent that she is capable of more if only she could find something to liven her up. This spark in her eye, as it were, makes her transition all the more satisfying and gives a little weight to Plaza's performance (for which she has already won an award or two). Duplass, on the other hand, is exceedingly earnest in the best way possible. Above all else, regardless of whether or not he turns out to be crazy, Kenneth is a believer and that quality is brought to life wonderfully. His wounds from the past drive the sci-fi portion of the film but it is presented in such a genuine, even simple way that I couldn't help but root for him. It is an odd dynamic that exists between Plaza and Duplass but that sort of mismatched weirdness works well within this film. Even Johnson's character, who is more than a little scuzzy, exhibits a vulnerable honesty that makes him much more likable than I expected in the early going.As the film progresses and the various side plots thicken, the sci-fi element of Safety Not Guaranteed becomes less visible but is never put aside entirely. For some sci-fi films it is important to believe in the science at its core in order to accept the film but Safety Not Guaranteed is structured in such a way that allows the viewer to appreciate the sci-fi without becoming overly burdened by reality. In this way, the question of whether or not the science for time travel will come through plays almost like a will-they-or-won't they from a sitcom, a facet of this film that I quite liked. All told, this is a charming, somewhat unique little film that I absolutely fell in love with. Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED (2012) ***1/2 Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass, Jake Johnson, Karan Doni, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Jeff Garlin, Kristen Bell. Whimsical sci-fi dramedy with a fantastic turn by deadpan hottie Plaza as a misanthropic intern for a Seattle based magazine who is recruited by her writer boss jerk Johnson to investigate a possible crack-pot ad from an apparently troubled young man (Duplass) who claims he's time travelled and is going to once more ?but with a partner. Based loosely on a true story (well the ad was a goof but true) with a smartly written screenplay by Derek Connolly and directed with a nice pace by newcomer Colin Trevorrow. Well-cast with Johnson rising above his could've been a one-note character but gives his louche/douche a heart of gold and surprisingly poignant tone throughout buoyed by the dead- on chemistry between sexy-as-hell Plaza and sad-sack Duplass. An indie sleeper gem you should seek or go back to the future for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This one showed promise to deliver the rare, offbeat, genuine indie genius that those of us who spend entirely too much time in dark theatres live for. How many romantic-dramadies combine caustic comedy, elements of sci-fi, and are inspired by a real life newspaper ad? Not very darn many.The set-up for the story is that Jeff (Jake Johnson), a Seattle magazine writer, suggests to his editor that the newspaper ad would make an interesting investigative report. To get a feel for the movie, reading the ad is essential: WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll be paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED.Jeff takes two interns on assignment with him: Darius (Aubrey Plaza) and Arneau (Karan Soni). Darius is a sarcastic loner and recent college grad. Arneau is a virgin nerd who skates ever so close to an Indian stereotype. He is actually quite funny and easy to root for. Unknown to the interns, Jeff has ulterior motives for taking this job, and the bulk of the work will fall to them.Darius quickly tracks down and connects with Kenneth (Mark Duplass). He seems quite committed to the time travel cause and is a bit skeptical of Darius. The Kenneth character can best be described as a NICE Dwight from "The Office". He veers from the "normal" line, but has a heart of gold. Once Kenneth and Darius confess their reasons for going back in time, it's clear to the viewers that these two share a rare DNA strand. Humor kicks in during their training sessions ... of course, you need martial arts skills and the ability to shoot straight if you plan to time travel.The comedy and romance elements are complimented by undertones of regret, paranoia, loneliness and the desire to connect. These same tones play right into Jeff's sub-plot. When he finds his high school crush (Jessica Bergere), she asks him about his life. His answer is limited to "Escalade and Condo". She soon has him considering what else life can offer. Kenneth and Darius discover that trust is not a four letter word. Even Arneau finds out that human interaction can be better than a blazing fast laptop.The results of the time travel plan aren't really important, though it does play a role in the final act. As with the best movies, what really matters are the people. These are people we can relate to because they come across as real ... not perfect, but real. As likable as the characters are, there still seemed to be something missing that prevented this film from reaching the next level. Maybe it has to do with first feature film director Colin Trevorrow or his writer Derek Connolly. The missing link is not easily identifiable, but it doesn't prevent enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>April from Parks &amp; Rec gets her own movie with a script trying way too hard for quirky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aubrey Plaza has this look about her. She is short with large eyeballs so she has this way of looking up at people and showing them non-verbally that she thinks they are morons and whatever situation she is in at the moment is stupid. If you are a fan of the TV show Parks &amp; Recreation, you have seen this character before in April Ludgate. The filmmakers of Safety Not Guaranteed most likely thought, "Well, we have this character straight from Parks &amp; Rec, I guess we'll hire the same actress." Darius (Plaza) is a direct rip-off of April Ludgate; however, instead of working for Amy Poehler in Pawnee, Indiana, she is an intern at Seattle Magazine.Darius and fellow intern Arnau (Karan Soni) volunteer to tag along with one of the magazine's journalists, Jeff (Jake M. Johnson), for a few days out to the cold Washington State coast to track down the guy who posted an abnormal classified ad. Kenneth (Mark Duplass) seeks a partner for time travelling, but the prospective partner must bring their own weapons and he warns them that their safety is not guaranteed. This is not a foundation for the hardest hitting journalism, but then again, the film does not make out Seattle Magazine to be the most informative periodical.Picking up where Jeff fails, Darius uses some of her feminine skills to convince Kenneth she is interested in being his time travelling partner and they embark on training. Training consists of target practice with a pistol, breaking and entering and grand larceny at a research lab, and sitting around a campfire playing the zither. Jeff, meanwhile, tracks down his old flame from 20 years ago. He has idealized a summer from his past and is convinced Liz (Jenica Bergere) is the one who got away. A simple example to explain just what kind of person Jeff is comes from this conversation with Liz, "So, tell me about your life Jeff. Well, I have an Escalade."There is something off about Safety Not Guaranteed and I believe it is the script; it tries way too hard to be the next quirky comedy. First of all, her name is Darius? Strike one. Three oddly matched and eccentric people go on a road trip, share a hotel room, and Jeff spends an inordinate amount of time trying to get Arnau laid. Strike two. The zither is strike three. Also, there is an undercurrent of mental illness only hinted at in the script but far more blatant on screen about Kenneth and his time travel ideas. Would a journalist really attempt to write an article mocking a guy who could have a serious mental issue all because he posted a newspaper ad?Mark Duplass, who is also this film's executive producer, might as well be channeling Zach Galifianakis and his character from the Hangover series. Everything he does is over the top, aimed at the cheap laugh, and leaves a million unasked questions about how he has gotten to this point in his life. Duplass directed both Jeff, Who Lives at Home and Cyrus so he should be well aware of the importance of three dimensional characters and how fast the mocking of a character that may or may not be all there can get old with the audience real quick. Perhaps he is not aware since Cyrus was pretty horrible.April from Parks &amp; Rec does not need her own spin-off story. Her character works best as a sidekick who shows up every now and then to roll her eyes, say something snarky, and move on. A full feature length film of that attitude wears thin. Jeff's subplot with his long lost love Liz is more promising and works out exactly how it would in real life, so here is a big kudos for first time screenwriter Derek Connolly. However, if Connolly had throttled back a bit on the overt attempt to be quirky ala Zooey Deschanel, Safety Not Guaranteed would have been far better for it.</fullReview>

By the way, I should mention that there is no obstacle to try watching that movie as I strongly believe that you will not realize immediately that the movie is about to finish. Through a little bit reality as well as the piquant side of science- fiction, you will not get bored while watching. No complicated story, performance or something else.

The movie was honest and genuine, which is hard to achieve these days, but some parts of the story made the movie boring for me. I would've loved to see more scenes of Jeff and Liz together and even though their story almost felt like a co-plot in the middle of the movie, I felt like they forgot about it in the end. We didn't get to see whether Jeff went back to Liz and quit his job or anything like that. There were some other technical plot holes in this movie, but I can't say that I really care about them since this is a feel good movie. I did feel good on some scenes, especially when Kenneth left all of his money to his co-worker, but moments like those were rare. I also couldn't make any sense of the ending but I'm giving the movie the benefit of the doubt on that.If you have a lot of free time, go see this movie. I think some shots of the town were amazing and like I said, the movie has its moments. But keep your expectations low.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good drama that will leave you wide-mouthed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give this film a higher rating, but I can't say I loved it. The film seems to not have a general purpose to it. It might be about time travel, it might be about friendship, or weird people. It might be about comedy (however I personally find little laughable issues in this film), or it might be about science fiction but I don't really see that theme getting integrated into the film really well. One thing for sure, this film is good drama. Not exciting drama, but probably appropriate to the audiences of conventional stage drama where there's lots of talking, little or no intense scenes and only a few characters. However, the film is really something that gets you to think, to guess if "Kenneth" is really nuts or otherwise. It plays with your mind by offering you a paranoid character that is completely delusional, but at the same time convincingly real. I personally came to the conclusion that the film would come to a disappointing ending when I found out that the time machine was a wooden boat. And when it actually worked, I was like "what the f___ just happened?" Anyways, verdict: This film is entertaining, awkward and will keep you watching. If you like drama, then this film is for you. But don't expect something really beautiful that will leave you crying on the way home. If you like comedy, get ready to smile at a few things and frown at others. If you like Sci-fi, you might find small aspects of this film entertaining (such as the discussion of time travel stuff in the beginning), but the magic realism will not be the best quality of the film Star Wars fans are looking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet and quirky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Safety Not Guaranteed is the quirky title of an endearing romance about an ad for time travel answered by three journalists who want to write about this eccentric man.The humor is deadpan, not quite as flat as Wes Anderson's (see Moonrise Kingdom). The hero is seriously into time travel but is so sweet as to convince Darius of his sincerity. But the two men (chief journalist and international student) are not so sure. The tension comes from this difference and the sub plots involving old and new loves. The binding tie is the time travel, a figurative way of emphasizing the temporal in all relationships.The investigation by feds into his internet activity lends a certain gravity, for the political ramifications are many.</fullReview>

There is no wonder why alcohol has no effect on me tonight. I guess I'm gonna go out and buy some booze then go back home to watch "Back to The Future(s)" again for the 100th time or more... Maybe I watch "The Butterfly Effect" or "The Time Traveler's Wife" if I want to be less vintage...Who knows! maybe I give "Gone with the Wind" a try...You wanna call me a grandpa? Be my guest...I highly recommend you to stay away from this movie if you have been born before 1990's or at least if you're man enough to distinguish between classic and today's style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to comment on the story plot so there are not spoilers here. The reason being is that I just can't concentrate and get into this movie with all of the home movie style of camera shake that occurs in this. It makes me nauseous to watch, which prevents me from writing any legitimate critique of the story, actors or general content of the movie. It is one thing to use camera shake for effect, as in the Normandy beach landing scene in the movie "Saving Private Ryan" which adds creative value to the movie, but to continue to use it throughout this movie just to conserve production costs does nothing more than produce a low quality movie and ensure the sale of Dramamine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyment not guaranteed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can generally tell within the first five or ten minutes if I'm going to dislike a movie. Sure, sometimes things get off to a shaky start and salvage themselves as a story is allowed to develop, but unfortunately it's often the opposite, and something that starts well falters later on. Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed, a film with a more unpleasant opening than anything I've seen recently, tried valiantly to win me back but was sadly only around halfway successful.The film stars Aubrey Plaza as Darius an interning magazine journalist sent with two colleagues to research a story about a bizarre and mysterious classified ad seeking a partner in a time travel mission. What follows is a fairly generic love story which is sweet enough, and the quirky time travel element provides a freshness lacking in many indie romances. Plaza is her usual moody self, yet is allowed to strip away some of her trademark cynicism as her character warms to Kenneth (Mark Duplass), the potentially damaged loner responsible for the classified ad, showing a tender side not seen from her before.Their relationship is a cute coming together of two social misfits, and works pretty well despite some questionable plot holes and an ending that doesn't quite add up. However, this is only half of Safety Not Guaranteed, and Darius and Kenneth's story is hampered by a brief runtime (86 minutes), too much of which is spent on the secondary story concerning Darius' fellow intern Arnau (Karan Soni) and boss Jeff (Jake Johnson).Any warmth Trevorrow generates in scenes of Darius and Kenneth is obliterated every time the film switches to the mean-spirited, creepy antics of Jeff, who is using the trip to rekindle a past romance with Liz (Jenica Bergere), dragging troubling ethnic stereotype Arnau along for the ride. Jeff is such a leering, off-putting character, uncomfortably dragging what could be a decent film down an irredeemable degree, and after the ham-fisted attempt at redemption following his encounter with Liz blows up in his face, he simply slips back into his obnoxious persona, giving gross macho advice to the meek Arnau.The jarring juxtaposition of the two narrative threads results in a film that is tonally all over the place, sending contradictory messages and wrapping up with little satisfaction. There is a charming if slight romance in Safety Not Guaranteed, it's just a pity it is surrounded with such a distasteful garnish.tinribs27.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film held much promise for me. I love films and Si-Fy in general that have a time travel element and can find good in average fare.This film's story held much promise and I was very disappointed.++ Extra Spoiler Alert ++ This film spent most of the time dithering with an 'is he a nut or can he do it?' scenario. The lead journalist was too much of a caricature to be taken seriously and I personally found him an unwelcome distraction. For the film to end as it did was a pure cop out that did not sufficiently explain if time travel was achieved. IMHO, up until the end, about 30% could have been cut and more time spend showing the couple on their travels.3/10 is generous and all I thought at the end was 'was that it?' instead of 'wow'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This COULD have been such a good movie! The concept and description sounded like something I'd REALLY enjoy!Normally, I mean almost always in the past I have been attracted to those obscure films that garnered praise by every day folks like us as opposed to those films that spend more money in advertising than some companies spend on their entire movies.After seeing films like Wrist cutters, The Garden State or The Way to name a few, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie last night? especially after reading the reviews here in IMDb. Unfortunately, I did not find this film nearly as good as the rest.(I will most likely be sharing spoilers here, so stop reading if you plan on seeing it)I found the film was incredibly depressing?every character was either sad or seriously screwed up. No one in the film was happy where they were in life?and no one finds the happiness they were looking for. With the possible exception of two?but the ending didn't even resolve that question!I (along with those I talked to after the film) found it poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed?all the characters were one dimensional?even the SOUND seemed like it was coming out of a single speaker behind the screen.This was not worth the price of admission and I would recommend it for rental?during the TV rerun season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One journalist and two interns head out to meet a guy who has placed a classified ad in the newspaper about finding willing partners to go back in time. The concept is new and the characters are etched out very vividly. there is Jeff who doesn't believe the story and is going because he wants to hook back with his school sweetheart. There is the Indian Arnau who is, predictably as there has to be such a character, is a virgin. And then there is Darius who is an introvert. The "time traveler" is played very well by Mark Duplass. Some of the scenes are hilarious and touching. The movie is good but does not offer many new things to a regular movie watcher. However, it has been the toast of the movie going audience and the critics alike and enjoys nearly 95% rating at Rotten Tomatoes and a healthy 7.6 on IMDb. I will go with 3 out of 5 for this. This soothes you and entertains you but does not blow you away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Addition to the Time Traveling Genre of Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of Time Travel is one of those collective, universal fascinations that never wanes. The idea seems to constantly be orbiting pop-culture from Orson Welles to countless TV series and movies. For most of us, The Back to the Future trilogy comes to mind when thinking going back in time.&nbsp; And more recently, Midnight in Paris was highly touted for it's imaginative premise of a present day writer meeting literary heroes of the past.&nbsp; I actually liked Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana in The Time Travelers Wife. Now joining the time travel movie galaxy is Safety Not Guaranteed, a quirky, romantic comedy, written by Derek Connolly, expressly for the deadpan, somberly funny Aubrey Plaza (Parks &amp; Recreations). It also stars one half of the movie-making Duplass Brothers (The Puffy Chair, Jeff Who Lives at Home) Mark Duplass, who along with brother Jeff act as executive producers, putting their improvised dialogue and casual filming stamp all over this movie.Darius (Plaza) is a lowly intern at a small, Seattle magazine. the position is typical of most internships, running errands, getting coffee, even changing toilet paper rolls, but it's not the job that makes Darius low key, sullen and borderline miserable. Or as her father puts it (cameo by Curb Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garland) she seems to be under a cloud.Despite her lack of enthusiasm, when one of the writers, Jeff (Jake M. Johnson) pitches a story idea to track down the person who placed an ad looking for a Time Traveling Companion "Must bring your own weapons". "Safety not guaranteed." Darius volunteers to work on the assignment. Also along for the ride, adding some rather predictable humorous moments, is a nerd intern from India, Arnau (Karan Soni), who has yet to get laid, making it Jeff's mission to not only make certain Arnau gets deflowered on this "field trip", but it's also revealed Jeff's real motive for suggesting the story, is to look up an old high school crush who lives in this area of the Pacific Northwest.The film has a few implausibilities that have nothing to do with whether or not time travel is possible. For instance: once they locate the would be scientist, Kenneth (Duplass), they find him to be secretive and paranoid about his invention, he worries that he's being watched and takes all sorts of precautions. Yet, after making contact with Darius he never thinks to follow her home? If he did, he'd see she was staying in a cheap motel with two guys, one of which already approached him about his ad.Kenneth &amp; Darius discover they both want to return to the same year in order to change a part of their respective past; but why did the writer choose the year 2001, with no mention of 9/11? Despite these minor issues - the odd, vulnerable romance that develops between Kenneth and Darius, as they start to trust one another and experience the possibilities and danger of the mission, is what makes the film noteworthy and engaging. Winning The Waldo Salt Screen writing Award at Sundance 2012.My screening of Safety Not Guaranteed, was back to back with Wes Anderson's new film Moonrise Kingdom, and although the latter is clearly the more superior film in terms of style, cast and creativity; I couldn't help but notice a few similarities between the two:both films are nutty, but not played for laughs, both are centered around the romance of characters who are out of the mainstream, on the fringe. Both couples go on a secret journey together and sit romantically by a campfire, both films take place by the ocean. And technically, since Moonrise Kingdom is set in 1965, you could say it also goes back in time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'd better like the actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I won't make friends with this review, but the ones I have will thank me. You'd better like the actors in this movie if you hope to enjoy it. I think Derek Connolly's script had much potential for a good story; the many reviews I read clearly indicate to me it did, because so many reviewers were touched by it, liked the characters and found meaning I failed to get. Reading back many of those reviews after watching the movie I get why they are so attached to it; I just couldn't.I'm sure I'd enjoy the story if it was in the form of a book, though; this way I would not have been influenced by the acting performances that left me apathetic, the cinematography which did not impress me in the least, or the direction that failed to spark some life I felt it lacked. I'm not usually so negative; my hundreds of reviews are testament to that. The reason I figured I felt this way when so many don't, is simple. I did not care for the actors to begin with. Yep, if one feels that way, then it takes one hell of a great story, with cinematography that makes you wish the screen was double the size and direction capable of accentuating the better features so that the lesser ones escape your thoughts, none of which applied here. Aubrey Plaza's looks remind me too much of Emma Stone, who I like, so I missed the sexy voice right from the start. I never cared for Jake Johnson that much; there's something annoying to me about his smug smile. I better stop while I'm behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just don't get movies like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of both sci-fi and good comedy, and I watched this flick last night. It was fairly highly-rated on the movie sites that I pay attention to (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Roger Ebert's site, etc). From what little I've read about this, I guess this is considered a mumblecore film, or at least similar to movies in whatever that genre is. I also saw "Cyrus" recently, another flick usually called mumblecore.I just don't get 'em. Maybe I'm too old, but they're definitely too hip for me. Nothing much happens in these movies. Cyrus had a few moments of genuine ha-ha humor, as did "Safety Not Guaranteed", but VERY few. Neither delivered what I expect in a movie, namely my involvement. And neither delivered what I thought it was supposed to: very much humor in "Cyrus" or very much humor OR sci-fi in "Safety Not Guaranteed". There's a moment of sorta sci-fi at the end of "Safety" and that's it. What they do deliver are oddball characters and conversations and I guess this is what fans of this genre find amusing. But they're not SUPER weird, which might be funny - just kinda weird, which ain't. These kind of movies seem to relish (for want of a better term) "everyday quirkiness" above all else. The camera hangs on boring conversations and slightly uncomfortable/awkward moments far too long, and there never seems to be a point to all this. Neither "Safety" nor "Cyrus" had anything resembling a payoff at the end and with both I felt cheated that I'd spent 100-odd minutes trying to make sense out of it.If you like movies with a traditional structure, a linear storyline or story arc and a denouement, "Safety Not Guaranteed" is not for you. I personally will avoid mumblecore films in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best movie I have seen this year...no it definitely is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so refreshing. This is why I love independent film.I won't really go into the plot, besides what you already know from the trailer, but basically Mark Duplass's character is a bit of nut-case who posts an ad seeking a partner to go back in time. Aubrey Plaza, Jake M. Johnson and Koran Soni are reporters who are following him in hopes of gaining an interesting story.The film brilliantly handles very complex themes involving the past and regret. But the film isn't just about going back and changing something in your past. It is mostly about the power of love to heal emotional wounds.All of the reasons why people on IMDb are pissing on this movie seem stupid to me.1. People say that Aubrey Plaza is trying too hard to be quirky and it brings the movie down. OK, admittedly, Plaza hasn't exactly shown herself to be a very diverse actress but her "stock character" works in this movie. She has to be different and a bit strange for her romance with Duplass to work.2. People say they don't buy the romance between Plaza and Duplass. Why not? They are two very different people who have few friends and no one seems to understand. Seems natural that they should be drawn to each other.3. People say that Jake M. Johnson's character gets too much screen time and it detracts from the main story. I don't see that at all. I think without Johnson's side story the film would be worse. Johnson's character, just like Duplass's, wants to go back to a time when things were different, a time when he had love. His story is an essential part of the films theme.4. People say the ending is weak. I initially thought this too but after some thought I changed my mind. I won't explain this too much so as not to spoil anything but I will just say that Duplass's motivation for doing what he does is the key to the ending making sense.The only real weakness the film has is some bad lighting in a few scenes, some spots with slightly weak or forced dialogue. Also perhaps not the sharpest editing job ever either. But these are really minor things.It is well worth seeing. Duplass and Johnson deliver truly incredible performances, even though they will undoubtedly be snubbed at all the major awards. And I'm just a sucker for Aubrey Plaza, she's just so darn cute. The movie is funny, emotional, sincere and very intelligent. See it!</fullReview>

Sure, it was a recycling of the character (along with the guy from The New Girl) but her and others had really clunky deliveries.And the scenes were terribly paced and executed. Nuiances were overlooked. I know it was just a comedy but was it a bet on how fast they could shoot this thing? Shaky and uninspired shots. And for those who saw it, what was the lighting about during the campfire scene? It looked like they were both beaten badly or had a bad rash on their faces.And I have one story question.

		<fullReview>This is a pretty good movie: good characters, good performances and an intriguing premise and story. I like the way the subplots parallel the main plot thematically. But for me, outside of some snappy visual effects, it had a very weak ending. It didn't quite make sense to me.Given revelations just prior to the climax, I was left wondering *why* this guy still wanted to go back in time, what was at stake, or why the insistence on bringing weapons? Was the State of Washington in 2006 particularly dangerous? This film missed many opportunities to crank up the level of suspense, but particularly at the end, which was just too slack-paced and leisurely in addition to not making sense. The cop characters are terrible, kind of moping around the story, waiting for the chance to blurt out a little exposition, but they're hardly a force in the plot.Also, I wouldn't go to this movie if you're expecting some kind of laugh riot. I found it mildly amusing in many places, but I would classify it as more of a science-fiction/drama.</fullReview>
