		<shortDescription>Wow!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never felt so compelled to write in on how I feel about a movie until I had experienced "The Sunset Limited" last night on HBO. I was really moved. I actually burst into tears at one point. Two men having a philosophical debate about life and death and the idea that knowledge is a burden, and the more we know, the more miserable we become is one point of debate in this powerful film. Some of the best writing and acting I've seen, anywhere.Multiple viewings may be required for most to fully absorb the impact. A real punch in the gut. I actually felt like dusting off my old Bible and thumbing through it for a while when the movie ended.I don't know what else to say about this movie except that if you have not seen it yet, you MUST. It makes so much sense and it is a real eye opener.McCarthy is genius. I love all is work and this is just an absolute masterpiece of writing. Tommy Lee Jones and my man Sammy L. are absolutely mesmerizing. I have not seen acting this good in a long time.There is so much I want to tell you about this film, but words just cannot do it justice. I loved every second of this film, and I hope you do to.P.S.- I NEVER give a movie 10 stars because I like to reserve that honor for something that is truly special. This is truly special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sunset is not Limited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men trapped in a room with their opposing beliefs. The words of Cormac McCarthy. The direction of Tommy Lee Jones. The powerhouse combination of Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. Two actors. One room. Big Ideas. Emotions run high. The essence of Drama is Conflict. This 90 minute look at two men's opposing beliefs is strong and will resonate with the viewer long after it is over. It's the story of a man who wants to end his life and another man who wants to save it. What rings true is the direction of Tommy Lee Jones. It gels so well with the words of Cormac McCarthy. These two actors gel even better making it all the richer. Jackson has the flashier role where Jones plays his complexly understated. If any actor could raise your heart rate by talking it's Sam Jackson. His character's belief in God is sincere and matched with Jones's dark, realistic view of the world.Speaking of realistic-Don't go looking for a neat ending. This film stays true to it's subject matter and these actors stay even truer to their characters. Jones, as a student of theater and literature, knows as a director to let the words live and breathe. Because he does Jackson and him make a monument out of two chairs and a table in a small room. This sunset is anything but limited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb, all-around...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat, this movie is a great watch for anyone, no matter what they believe about life, death, or what's next. This movie does an amazing job of addressing theological philosophy without alienating anybody. These are things we all think about, whether or not we've come to any conclusions.The acting and directing are terrific. Couldn't be better. The writing is good enough to make it worth reading the play by itself.In the same way that a really good "sports movie" can be deeply moving to people who aren't exactly sports fans, this movie will be deeply moving to people who aren't necessarily into thinking about God, death, or the afterlife.If you're wondering whether or not to watch, rent, or buy this movie; do it. It's worth it.</fullReview>

This is the first movie that have ever made me cry.My fantasy was running wild during the hole 1? hour, and I wish it would have never ended. I had thoughts and ideas about the outside world, the characters and I lived in the movie like never before. I wanted so many things to happen so badly like it was happening to me.

		<fullReview>It's a debate about the meaning of Life. a mind blowing movie for specific viewers. If you don't like films depending only on dialog .. Don't bother watching it! (I mean movies like "The Man from Earth").On the other hand, if you are interested in Philosophy, that maybe the movie of your dreams.This film is also a fight between two of my favorite actors ..the superb Tommy Lee Jones and the furious Samuel L. Jackson.I loved every second of the film, and I'm really looking forward to watch it again very soon.P.S: If you are going to watch it, please sit down and focus because the movie requires a lot of attention to every discussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Kubrick's 2001, this is a movie about content and... containers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a powerful and emerging film that depicts the two opposing sides of this universe. I was really surprised by the quality of this "little" film. This isn't a movie about two people talking in a room about random stuff. This isn't a film about two life-travelers that engage in an ongoing argument about the human condition. This is a film about the quality of life. Not the meaning of it but the quality. The details in it's design. The true valor's clockwork.The duality of belief, as a general term, is analyzed completely in this great approach of the Cormac McCarthy novel in which the two main protagonists, "named" simply Black (Samuel L. Jackson) and White (Tommy Lee Jones) are debating over a serious and dangerous issue. "White tried to jump in front of a train and Black came and saved his ass. He carries him in his apartment and tries to put some sense into this White dude." Right? Not really. "The movie also promotes religion and is an ongoing boredom that I completely despise." RIght? Not really again. This has a greater meaning than just that. We live in a world filled with pathetic lies, corny truths, raised flags over white buildings and big letters over or on the dark ones. We live in a world where prostitution is legalized even in the cultural state of the society. We live in a world where rejection, where pain, where slavery and failure are common attraction to the atrocious tourists. We are hoping to free the world from the hands of the manipulators and selfish dictators, we organize revolutions, we fight for freedom but in the end we all get trapped in the same positions as we were before. This is what this movie is about. It's about the ongoing fight carried to win our faith back. Faith, science, culture, logic, mathematics, metaphors, feelings, achievements... They are all the same. They are contents, ingredients and thoughts that the humankind must have in order to survive the greatest threat of them all. The threat which is not the monetary system, the threat which is not the harsh reality, the threat which is not the solely figurative place of the man in the world, but the threat that is represented in the lack of faith in ourselves. We are our own guides because we rule this world. This is why this movie has captured my attention completely. It's not a masterpiece, it's not a grand scale picture, it's not a studio banking option, it's not even part of the best films in the last years but... at the same time... it's simply great. I loved it because it really balances amazingly well the truth revealed along the film with the denouement. They are identical as both form and content.I also liked the little details like the black coffee, the text erased at the bottom of the Bible, the absence of TV and radio, the lockers on the door and not to mention the biggest detail of them all... the room. Just think about the room vs. everything else. Order vs. Chaos. Even in a messy world we could find order...Going further to the execution, the story is well structured, the dialogues are haunting, the clichés are gone because even if you find them they tend to leap by the end of the film, the acting is impeccable and the technical aspect of the movie was a comfortable surprise. It's exactly what the film needed. I can't talk too much about this film because I don't want to enter into the details... I just hope people could see what a good movie this really is. I'm pretty sure few movies captured my attention as this one did. Like Kubrick's 2001, this is a movie about content and... containers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is my deepest pleasure to review this movie. Have you ever wondered what would happened if god and the devil sat down and had a conversation about the true state of the world? This is a movie where exactly that happens, only instead of god you have Samuel L Jackson arguing for the side of faith, and Tommy Lee Jones arguing for the side of suicide, now heres how the movie goes, it takes place in one room where they go back and fourth discussing the merits on religion, the state of the world as a whole, the human condition, the future, and about a dozen other topic. At first glance this sounds like it would be a dull movie, trust me its not. If you like actual conversation and true dialog this is the movie for you. 10/10 for finally making a movie thats as real as real can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shining example of story telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie with Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones transcends us back to a time when movies relied on the deepness of story lines and not on special effects or loud soundtracks. This movie takes us to the extreme test of our faith, in what we believe about the seen and unseen. It also reminds us that at times we are so busy trying to save others we forget to save ourselves, and sometimes almost become lost in the process. The acting talent of Mr. Jones and Mr. Jackson makes for a powerful movie and leaves us evaluating what we ourselves believe. Tommy Lee Jones' directing style makes you feel as if you are a third person in the room being an observer to the debate that transpired between both characters. If you need to be amused by bells and whistles, this is not the film for you, but if you enjoy film making at its purest form, with deep plot lines and dialogue this movie is a must see as these characters will haunt you long after the lights come back on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that lingers, in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of this movie is almost impossible to sell (two dudes talking in a room) if that is an automatic switch off for you then give this a miss, have a good evening.It almost was for me but as the two dudes in question are Tommy Lee and Samuel L, I thought I would give it a shot; glad I did as I was instantly gripped and before I realised it the end credits were rolling.The two perform an elegant dance of dialogue, Samuel's character from the slant of a straight shooting, Southern ex-con who has found Jesus and Tommy as the depressed, over educated nihilist.There is nothing groundbreakingly new here. The discussion follows paths we have all considered, is there a god? could anyone bare living forever? But the two are masters at their trade.This is an excellent film, if you insist on car chases and explosions to enjoy a movie (nothing wrong with that) then steer well clear. Otherwise give this a go. It won't change your life but will definitely affect your week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Is Great In This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly good film. If you like thinking about life, death, suicide, God, the state of man - then this is a film for you. This film offers an intense dialogue between Mr.Black and Mr.White or two opposing sides of an argument. Tommy Lee Jones plays a cultured intellectual secularist and Samuel L. Jackson plays a violent uneducated ex-con who found salvation in God and Bible. I really just wrote this review to applaud the performance of Tommy Lee Jones. He is almost unrecognizable in the role. He seems to have totally assumed the character. Samuel L. Jackson plays to his strengths. Sometimes Jackson comes off as a bit cartoonish or like he is playing a caricature of himself but usually it works.Excellent. Like a stage play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting and powerful script ... but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire the acting skills of Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson. And Cormac McCarthy can write a powerful script that brings out these skills. All 5 stars go to the abilities of these 3 men.But...(SPOILER FOLLOWS)Ultimately, this film is a 90 minute sermon with which the preacher (Jackson) fails to redeem the sinner (Jones). Or, at least it seemed that way as Jones left the room. If I want to hear a 90 minute sermon, I'll go to church - not to cable TV.Still, the ending scene will stick to me ... with Jackson collapsing to the floor and, with a vacant look, asking God, "Is that OK? Is that OK?" Jackson had the look of someone who'd been "deprogrammed" from his faith, replacing it with Jones' sense of futility. And he had the look of someone who realized he'd just finished preaching more to himself than to Jones in a vain attempt to cling to his own beliefs.If that was going through Jackson's mind, it could be that the NEXT scene (after the film ended) might show Jackson waiting on that same platform for the Sunset Limited to come by (for the same reason as Jones).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances, unpersuasive thematic exploration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this, since I love Jones and Jackson and McCarthy. I enjoy Shakespeare and philosophy and movies like _My Dinner with Andre_ and _Mindwalk_.Alas, this movie left me feeling unsatisfied and annoyed. I'll admit right away that I don't have any sympathy for the humdrum bleak existentialist reasoning expressed by White in this movie. If (as he says) the hope of human civilization was extinguished in the gas chambers of Dachau, then it was resurrected in the revolt of Treblinka. If the horrors of the human slave trade and the Middle Passage obliterates the nobility of our species, then Harriet Tubman reorients us to the possibility of ourselves and shows us the true face of prophecy.Joseph Asagai answers White's pessimism in _A Raisin in the Sun_ by dismissing the notion that he and others like him are "realists". Trapped in a cycle of limited vision and despair, they refuse to see the good and progress of humanity as any kind of counterbalance to the evil, and yet they get to pretend that theirs is the one true honest understanding of who we are. Piffle! With blind Christian faith as the only response to White's solipsistic nihilism, we have a very articulate and entertaining straw man. Throughout the movie I kept imagining worthwhile responses to White's claims, and felt thoroughly discouraged by the inadequacy of Black's dialogue.I'm glad I saw this movie, but I cannot go along with the glowing perfect-score reviews dished out by my esteemed colleagues on this forum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely laid out Mr Black and Mr White</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film! Nothing new here but it is a nicely packaged discussion. Pessimism vs optimism. Cormac McCarthy seems to give pessimism the upper hand and the last word at the end which is refreshing (in the land of happy endings)and makes perfect sense to anyone familiar with his work. I do think an opportunity was missed by McCarthy during the scene when Mr White serves Mr Black a bowl of some tasty food. Mr Black agrees that it was good, he says it twice which should be a chink in the armor of his dark reasoning. If food can be good to Mr Black what else might be? Is rest good for the weary? Is a drink good for the thirsty? Might there not be reason to exist in life's small pleasures? But McCarthy does not explore this avenue which is a shame.</fullReview>

Two worlds collide in a 90 minute, non stop, breathtaking sequence. I don't remember again a film with so simple set and with only two actors playing keeping me breathless for one and a half hours! The two men play very natural and very convincing. The scenario at the other hand is powerful and immersive. At last, the ending, is not black. It is not white either. Its definitely gray! A 90 minute philosophical torrent through the "gray matter" of life... Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not just a movie... this is art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's it. I love it. I love movies that never depend on spending. I love movies that realize an idea with just words and expressions. Script and acting. That's what this movie is all about. Imagine someone you know told you "Hey, there is a movie where a couple of guys sit in a room for an hour and a half and talk about the world"... would you be interested? I certainly wasn't. Then I saw the cast. Jackson and Jones. I was hooked. So I saw it. At first I wasn't very enthusiastic with where this conversation was going. I'd already seen enough of an atheist and a Christian argue about that certain topic (seriously, who hasn't)... but after the first ten minutes I was surprised by the dept and color these two brought into this "black and white" conversation. This movie is a pure reminder of what a true movie should look like and what should its "primacy" be. The idea, the characters, the dialogue. The movie was made for this purpose only - bringing out THE ONLY THINGS that matter in a movie and art in general. A talented, soulful exhibition of a problem or an emotion we can all relate to. And the feelings both actors described - those were feelings I could surely relate to. All you need for this movie is attention. And once these two incredible actors gain it the audience sees two things: For those old enough or interested enough to have been on this kind of performance - they will see something they've been missing for a long time. For those that are new to cinema and/or may be too young to be introduced to this particular form of art - they will see something they would wish to see more of. And if someone doesn't like this movie - I'm pretty sure he or she probably wasn't paying any attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based on a theater play and is entirely shoot in a run down grotty apartment located near the subway. There are only two actors called black and white. And in fact the entire movie is a passionate and at time humorous chess game with no evident winners. White is a middle aged professor who earlier had tried to kill himself by jumping in front of the train and was saved by Black. White is an atheist ,cynical ,disillusioned and cerebral human being who has lost all his faith in his beliefs and see no other exit form his pain then death. Black is a street wise ex con who repented and became a pastor for hopeless people. He has faith in God and humane nature and try to make white see the light. Is an epic battle between the mind and the hearth between chance and destine,fear and love. The end is open and we don't really know what will happened But it does not matter because the movie is not about a specific story or character is about the divine which is in all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about the shades of gray?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's play has much to recommend it--two fine performances, some beautiful language, the exchange of some interesting ideas--I confess to finding the nine and ten star reviews excessively enthusiastic.This film intentionally limits its scope very severely, and is a success in its own terms, but is that enough to make it a great film? Consider an analogy: this film is like a great free throw shooter who is mediocre at every other aspect of basketball. It makes 96% of its attempts at the line but the limitations of its overall game means it cannot be considered a great all-around player.This film is a narrow specialist: it is a conversation and a debate between a suicidally depressed atheist and the Christian (a jail-house convert) who saved his life once and is trying to save it again. Similar to My Dinner With Andre, these men discuss Big Issues. Their central topic is whether life is worth living, and the central metaphor is in the title--to catch the Sunset Limited is to step in front of a speeding train.This focus on such a major question, and the religious and philosophical ramifications of that question, is probably the reason so many reviewers are so enthusiastic about the film. There is a genuine hunger, among many, to discuss and ponder these Big Issues--and the brave choice to have suicide, in effect, 'win', gives the finale a darkness which resonates. The problem is in boiling things down so starkly to White and Black (the names of the two characters.) As an atheist who is NOT suicidally depressed, I found both characters to be limited and repeatedly frustrating. (Limited by being in their Sunset years, perhaps? The title is nicely evocative, I will concede). I would be happier if there had been a third character that we might call "Shades of Gray": the world is not a black and white place, which tempers my appreciation for what ended up on screen. I applaud the writing and acting of the film, and Jones does good work as director as well. The film provokes thoughts and feelings, which is all to the good, but the limitations of the format, ideas and execution render this film a success, but only on its own, very narrow, terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>professorial debate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A professor (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to commit suicide by jumping in front of a train, "The Sunset Limited". Another man (Samuel L. Jackson) claims to be his guardian angel. The two men debate their beliefs in the professor's apartment. The professor insists on leaving the apartment and probably go to commit suicide. The other insists on following him and convince him to embrace God.It's a two person play in a confined space. These are two great actors. The debate is constant and unabated. It feels more academic than personal. These characters are not necessarily flesh and blood. The writing is not natural enough and always feels like a play. It has the power of sincerity but lacks the feel of reality. This has the potential of a reveal but the play doesn't take advantage. This is an academic play but it doesn't actually breathe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never has this cliché been more true: "It will make you think"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most impressive thing about this film is that it had me sitting and listening to two men talking to each other for a solid hour and a half.In keeping with the tag line?"Nothing is ever black or white"?there is no driving agenda to the film's overall message that I could discern. It's not trying to push Christianity, nor atheism. It simply presents two men's opposing beliefs. The preacher is no perfect Christian, nor the professor an all-knowing atheist, for neither such people exist.What it does do, however, is keep you rooted to your seat. The professor just tried to commit suicide?that's the premise of the film?and the preacher is doing everything in his power to convince him not to try again. So he tells him stories. He challenges his pessimism. He makes no secret of his own belief in God, and the professor makes no secret of what he thinks of that.There are some great points in their conversation, from both sides. You'll probably be compelled to examine your own beliefs and challenge your reasons for having them. And that's what this film succeeds at most of all: provoking a debate between polar opposite beliefs, and leaving no doubt as to the importance of that debate, because a man's life hangs in the balance.Hell, I've been writing this for 200 words and I'm already running out of things to say. But a 1.5-hour movie filled with near-constant dialogue will somehow keep you rooted to your seat. How? Go find out.</fullReview>

It is about who you are, who you could be and who you would like to become as a person. I hope this film would last double the time(90 minutes are not enough to give answers, not even to raise your truthfully questions). Superb acting, marvelous directing(simple, but meaningful). I hope for a sequel(a white-rich man saves from suicide a black-poor man). It would be a whole different film but with the same principals .

		<fullReview>While I did not expect a movie enacted as a play It was due to the skill of these veteran actors made it enjoyable. While understanding the two religious beliefs and point of view for each of the characters, I came away with the notion that it is the sane people who would commit suicide. Most of the people in the world follow a plan and stick their heads in the sand as sort of societal automatons. It also seems that Jackson was stunned by the reason that Lee wanted to commit suicide to the point he had to let him leave the apartment. That from where I was viewing. I have recommended this movie to a few people. I know people of both persuasions so it will be interesting what they get from the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of movies greatest team up films based on a play. And while I don't agree with all of how it was done, it was still a powerful performance between Tommy Lee Jones, a suicidal atheist professor, and Samuel L. Jackson, an ex-con who is a bible believer (but not a fundie) who saved Tommy from jumping in front of a train, The Sunset Limited. What follows is a two man dialogue taking a philosophical look at life, based upon God. Thankfully Tommy's character is not "mad" at god, but they do tread close to that rail. And while HIS character is nihilistic, there is no attempt to paint all atheists as such. The acting is superb, the dialogue is interesting and thoughtful. The bias to god is unbalanced, Samuel L spends 2/3rds of the movie with the weight on his side, even with Tommy's responses. Tommy's final nihilistic speech is given the last 15 minutes but boy does he deliver, and if as an atheist you accept this is HIS view as a personal position for his character, it does leave you thinking. This film is a great jumping off point for how a theistic discussion (not so much a debate) should be handled. Sam makes very pointed and thoughtful points and admits his areas of weakness without losing his position. I can NOT recommend this enough to theists, atheists, philosophy buffs and those who enjoy great acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two men in an apartment have their opposing beliefs in this film. The black guy, a former convict who has believes in God, just saved the white agnostic professor from jumping in front of the express train and killing himself. He won't leave the man alone, without allowing him; to stay with him in his apartment and feels he is in this circumstance or situation by god who has judged him. The Sunset Limited is an intense dialogue driven movie about believing or unbelieving, and a philosophical discussion breaks out between the two men about what's true and important in life, or not and a debate from each side tries to convince the other man into believing his views. The Sunset Limited is a dialogue-driven movie that involves heavily philosophical discussions in the context of trying to make the viewer a believer of their own individual views. The Sunset Limited is such a captivating and interesting film, even the conversation is so enlightening and profound. This movie is for anyone who wants to be intellectually stimulated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Glimpse into Cormac McCarthy's Brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sunset Limited, adapted by Cormac McCarthy from his play of the same name, is perhaps one of the most personal of his works. The lone two characters, played by Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, seem to represent an internal dialogue in the author's head about God, evil, and the human experience. The plot is extremely simple, Jackson's character (called Black in the credits) has just stopped Jones' character (White) from committing suicide in a subway. They then return to Black's apartment so that he can try and persuade White to not attempt suicide again. Black is a devout Christian, while White could best be characterized as a committed skeptic. The rest of the film is their discussion. Jackson and Jones' respective great performances keep viewers interested and make them care for the characters. I was especially impressed with Jones' ending monologue where he finally reveals his true beliefs, his embrace of the darkness, written beautifully in classic McCarthy nihilistic poetic prose. The film does make you think, since the discussion is not all that slanted towards the author's beliefs (which I imagine would be similar to White's).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes everyone irritated.... Sign of a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see how both camps, Atheist and God-people are irritated during the first 10-15 minutes of this movie. Atheist: "YAY, we're finally portrayed on-screen at-ALL, but heck, it's a completely depressed suicidal guy representing our viewpoint", and the god-people are ticked because all they get is a broke jail-house felon. What you have to understand is that this a movie about two PARTICULAR people. One is an atheist, one is a Christian, but neither of these people necessarily represent either party. They're just people. A specific person speaking to another specific person.There are a million things that I could pinpoint about this movie that make it a 9 instead of a 10. War and Peace? Best book ever? He could have said "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" or "Game of Thrones" or "Cryptonomicon" or "Count of Monte Cristo" or a million other amazing books, but War and Peace is genuinely NOT THAT WELL WRITTEN. Fear of knowledge is a really serious contemporary problem and I don't particularly like the way being informed is portrayed here. Most of all, not having read the entire Bible? Weird. Most of us read the whole thing just for the funny, if not also the Apocrypha and any other Klingon writings. That bit is pretty hard to swallow.After watching this three times, I feel like the biggest message that god-people can take home, is seeing how Tommy Lee Jones pretty much keeps his mouth shut for an hour, just doling out little interesting things, until he finally gets so entirely fed up that he just absolutely destroys the world-view of Sam Jackson. This is WHY we don't unload on people. I might not believe in your god or gods or whatever whackadoodle thing, but I'm a good person and I don't go around utterly destroying people for the fun of it. Watch his reluctance and shaky resistance to doing it. He's literally about to kill himself, knowing that he will not exist in any way and there ARE no judgments or aftermath... and he STILL won't humiliate another person, because there is no law above to tell him what to do - he just knows how to be a good person.It's a great play, as long as you understand that it's two very specific people talking, not two representatives of two very diverse groups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halfway through the second segment. Two guys both caught in the opposite polarities of the mutually indoctrinated, received, authoritarian, "Western" cultural paradigm. ("Believer" or "unbeliever.") "Either God is or He isn't" (Bill Wilson in Alcoholics Anonymous, 1939). But what if God is something entirely different from what one can construct from within the mutually indoctrinated, received, authoritarian, "Western" cultural paradigm? In the third segment, TLJ's character brings up the first of the extra- paradigmatic possibilities: that literature is designed to convey the principles of social organization... but then slips back into the conventional moral paradigms (check out Lawrence Kohlberg on this) of what is or isn't vs. what should be. After which SLJ's character begins to move into something the present-day pshrinques call "radical acceptance" or going beyond what is (socially or culturally) "reasonable," even if the reason is buttressed in something akin to existentialism. Then we get into whether or not anti-depressants work and why (and why not, which is that depression rooted in nihilistic core beliefs -- say, as opposed to grief or actual powerlessness -- is often not treatable with ADs).In the fourth segment, TLJ's character's enthusiasm about the meal leads him and SLJ's character into a brief treatise on the reality-driven demand for innovation (meaning precisely what Jiddu Krishnamurti meant by "creativity"). Later on SLJ's character transcends the paradigm of understanding God in favor of "being quiet" and listening for direction, even if that direction is still (herein) packaged in the form of heard words. TLJ's character looks at thinking one has come to know too much for one to be able to handle (or "more than you thought you should know," try Alanis Morissette on this one). And then there's the newspaper-triggered disquisition on the murderous (and suicidal) potency of nihilistic rectitude, including "world-class reasons."And from that very briefly into the cognitive therapist's insistence that "stinking thinking" leads to lousy feelings and self-destructive behavior (accompanied by a ringy musical tone to emphasize it, I guess). Shortly thereafter (in segment six), we get briefly into brotherly love (though not quite into Buddhist "oneness"). Then Rousseau, Marx and Durkheim show up in TLJ's character's dark portrait of the manipulations of the poor slobs by the power elite plutocrats.TLJ's character is caught up in his attachment to his (dark) ideas; his beliefs, his values, his policies, his doctrines, his dogmas, his instructions, his programming. He describes his own stuckness in his description of the "village atheist," of course. (More eerie musical tones.) He has not come to grips with what is. The world is, after all, the way it is: good, bad; better, worse; terrific, awful; and all the points in between. And it is, of course, the points in between that neither of them can see. At that point, both men are stuck in the.. words. Instead of experience of what is beyond the words: the cosmic joke that is revealed in each successive moment of now. If we let go of all the words, we'll get that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a deep and compelling movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this was a very deep and very moving movie. Like many others who have written reviews here, I am not one to write reviews, but this movie was so compelling not to.The story begins with Samuel L Jackson (Black) and Tommy Lee Jones (White) sitting in Black's apartment after Black saved White from an attempt to end his life (jumping in front of The Sunset Limited train). What begins is a very deep dialogue about the very profound mysteries of life. Is there is a God, what is the purpose of life (if there is even a purpose at all), what makes one truly happy, etc.Anyway, both have very interesting and profound arguments. Black is a devout man of faith who has found his happiness through God. He is the least likely character you would label as happy. He is an ex-con, uneducated, poor, living in the ghetto, lost the ones he loved the most; however, he has found peace in his life after a divine intervention in prison after a violent bout with some inmates. His happiness involves in him choosing to live in the ghetto with drug dealers and gang members that he chooses to reach out to and help. Very Christ-like - who chose to eat with the sinners and tax collectors and told the Pharisees "The sick need a doctor, not the well." White on the other hand is a non-believer, very educated, a successful professor, has all the things one would have to be happy based on "The World's" standards, but finds himself alone, resentful to humankind, and has the "life is a pointless and meaningless existence" point of view (which is why he chose to end his life in the first place). Basically an interesting parallel and actually in a sense, very symbolic.At the end of the movie, Cormac McCarthy paints a picture that there clearly is no winner, and maybe there isn't. However, I would have to side more on Samuel L. Jackson's side. I strongly believe that life has meaning, that everyone has a void in their hearts - that cannot be filled with drugs, sex, money, etc., but many have filled with God (including myself). True happiness comes from contributing to mankind and loving and helping your fellow man, and that is what I believe the meaning of life is. This is true for the believer and non-believer, but with enough of helping others naturally brings some spiritual satisfaction in one's life (why is there a need and strong urge to love and be loved?). Anyway, White was alone and in a sense, very selfish. He saw no reason to care because he believed that life had no purpose, and it is better to end then to go on. Yes, even David in the Bible all throughout Psalms talked about how life without God has no purpose. Life is but a puff of air and we are soon forgotten (along with all our works, materials, etc.), but God has always been and will always be (and I like to equate God with love).Anyway, everyone will have their different viewpoints, but overall, this is a great movie, with excellent acting, writing, directing, and dialogue that is a must-see for those who like to think about life's biggest questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Powerful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sunset Limited. What a powerful movie. There aren't many films that catch me in a grip I can't get out of...few that I don't craft at something while I'm watching when I bring a DVD home. This one was one of the few. I can't, won't, give anything away about how it comes to a conclusion, but the ending made me cry and I'm still crying. I will surely recommend this but I will do so with a caveat ....be prepared to be spellbound. I'm not even a fan of either of those actors, not especially, although both have had films I've enjoyed. But I can't imagine anyone, other than those two, as either character. Samual L Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones were superb in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sunset Limited Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sunset Limited.Once again the writing of Cormac McCarthy astounds me. The simplest of stories or origins of a story comes about often times from a conversation between two people and that is what this movie and screenplay entails. The dialogue comes off as authentic, profound, meaningful, etc. The scenery barely even matters, although it takes place in a crappy apartment slum. One could simply listen to the conversation unfold and be entertained. It just shows the masterful nature in Cormac's writing. If you think he can't write scenery or descriptively, read Blood Meredian or any other of his books for that matter and learn that he can do that as well and more likely than not better than most can or dare to dream in that respect as well. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel Jackson do the script justice and act very well together, as the good actors we all have known them to be. The End.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get HBO. It was offered free this weekend on my DirectTV dish. I stopped cold, seeing these two actors together, coming in after it had started. In my book, there's no better and more admirable actor than Jones, and Jackson is always world-class. It has enabled me to discover the writer. Being a writer, the dialogue was like a magnet. The principle argument is world-worthy. I felt like jumping for joy. Small wonder Jones and Jackson took on this movie. It will stand for all time.I haven't researched whether this is Jones' first time as director. I expect this movie will be well-known only in the fields of philosophy and theology. It reminds me of Sam Shepard. Nothing could have distracted me, listening and watching. Like a magnet.</fullReview>

I want to say about Samuel Jackson, I watched all he's movies. Is a great performer and he's acting always give credibility to the character. I like him more and more with every new film. I wish the best for him, from all my heart. And Tommy Lee Jones is the best choice to opposite Samuel L Jackson. They acting depth and contribution to give this result to the movie. so...nothings else to say. I hope we enjoying again, in future. with the same 10+ movies like this, best regarding to the all team to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two opposites to complete the balance of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sunset Limited shows how two opposites are used to create a complete balance of life. In the same way that there needs to be depression to realize happiness. Black and white, performed exceptionally well by the acting talents of Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, form the harmonious balance that is our life.Mr. Jones has contributed a masterpiece here. The message is the movie and it will make you think, perhaps a little further than siding with one or the other (meaning of life) but realize that without the other, there is nothing which is described by Samuel Jackson early on. There are no scenery changes, dress changes or special effects really (aside from well-lit scenes), which allows the viewer to truly focus on the words and not in a "this is way over my head" kind of way, as most of the words Tommy Lee Jones' character uses are rephrased to show meaning.Wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about alienation rather than atheism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good film, with great acting, provided you don't think it's going to be an atheist/theist discussion film. I see many people think that, but that's not what this really is about. The atheist is suicidal, so he isn't representing a typical scientific, optimistic outlook on life as we have grown accustomed to from argumentative professors lately. In fact, most atheists will feel quite uneasy with many of his arguments. To him, everything is futile. You need to see this in the context of the post WW2 era, since he's very much caught up in the holocaust which to him made everything pointless. This is interesting, but in a sense, this is also the film's weakness, that I get the feeling that they have made a film out of a 50 year old drama.(I haven't found out when it was written but it doesn't seem like it was staged before after 2000) You should think that this is a timeless subject, but things have changed.While the preacher, being a lay preacher with a prison background, uses 50 year old arguments, this is not so uncommon for this type. However, in the beginning, I got annoyed when the professor couldn't counter these fairly simple arguments. This may have been the whole point, that the professor was a bit out of it. However, in the end, the professor completely rips through the preacher's arguments as he unleashes all his inner darkness. His depression and bleak outlook of life is what makes the film good. Don't expect to find good arguments for a happy godless life, because there aren't anyone in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right up there with the greats like 12 angry men &amp; man from earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its often great to cut down all the glamor all Hollywood and just have a raw film with a couple of folks sitting down at the table discussing life and this sir just delivers that and up to the mark.A professor tries to kill himself and the gentleman who saves him takes him home and their sitting at the table discussing life , God , religion and everything in between.Unlike the above mentioned films (12 Angry Men, Man from Earth) it doesn't have the twists and turns or tries to run towards a conclusion it's a discussion leading to more discussions perhaps not as jumpy as coffee and cigarettes but more real to life and about life.One a man of God trying to explain his beliefs while exploring or narrating his life events along the way, the other a read man with his lost hope in humanity and finding the reason of existence explained without the existence of God. The acting is top notch and nothing less could be expected from the seasoned actors. The story does not force you to a conclusion nor does it state a right of wrong but leaves you just like it should thinking about the whole thing while you lay in bed that night. A must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Debate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only black and white in this movie and much debate. Two men with two totally opposite beliefs on life and the reasons for living. Not very many people online have commented on their opinion of this movie. The day I write this, Rotten Tomatoes has yet to unveil its rating. Single shot camera action is very difficult. Working with only one other person on one set is very difficult. Tommy Lee Jones wore three hats on this production as actor, director, and producer. I knew about 3 minutes into this film that they were never gonna leave the set. There's not very many actors that can pull off an hour and 30 minutes of just talking to each other in the same small space. This movie was neither fun, nor entertaining to watch, yet it took me much longer to finish because I kept going back to hear what the characters were saying to each other over and over again. I got an education about things I don't necessarily care about while watching this, but it was fascinating all the same. I had to stop half way through to put some pieces together, and think about my own life for a minute. It reminded me of Tape (2001) directed by Richard Linklater and starring Ethan Hawke, Sean Leonard Scott, and Uma Thurman. It was filmed in the same manner yet with 3 characters instead of 2. It was not without its fair share of critical acclaim. A feat I hope The Sunset Limited can one day day claim for itself. Reviewed by AN/NR 02-15-12</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Sunset Limited alone at home on a DVD loaned to me by a friend. I didn't read any reviews before watching it and so I had absolutely no idea what to expect. That was a good thing because, if I had read some of the negative reviews on IMDb, I may have even skipped watching it. That would have been a bad thing.This film is amazing! With a cast of two and only one scene (if you discount the opening generic footage), to me this seemed obviously a play written for live theatre. However, in live theatre, you don't get the chance to view facial expressions close-up or rewind and study details the same as you do in a movie at home. And that was certainly something I wanted to do. Every moment of this film is significant and one cursory glimpse simply doesn't do it justice. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L Jackson perform their roles with classic professional expertise. You feel like a fly on the wall almost to the point where you even want to breathe quietly so as not to disturb the atmosphere. That is the profundity of The Sunset Limited! The ending wasn't at all predictable - if, indeed it WAS the ending - were we supposed to make our own ending like in one of those early computer text story games?After watching the titles, I was left with two questions. One was, "How on earth did it need THAT many people to make this film???" Tommy Lee Jones directed it and yet there was only the closing scene that he wasn't in. If it weren't for the brilliance of two totally professional actors, this film could have been the work of my university screen production class (I wish it HAD been!). For example, how did it require five painters to prepare the set? These are, of course, somewhat rhetorical questions although, as I say, I'm pretty sure my uni class could have done this as an assignment with just two cameras and camerapersons, one lighting engineer, one sound engineer, a boom swinger, an editor and a sound designer. We would have done all the other stuff such as preparing the set ourselves. In fact, we DID do that except that the director, camera operators and lighting people were also the editors! Now, I don't say this to denigrate this film at all because, as I've already said, it is an excellent movie. All I'm saying is that, given talents like Jackson and Jones, we could have made this movie for not much more than the cost of tape and, if we had done it professionally, six people's time (about a month). So, when I see the crew list for The Sunset Limited, I cannot help wondering what it cost to make. (IMDb doesn't tell us that.)My second question was, "How many times will I need to watch this movie before I get every little nuance of it?"Having now read some of the other reviews, it is obvious to me that there are plenty of viewers out there with IQs well below average because some of them not only clearly missed the philosophical and psychological message of this masterpiece, but also lacked the ability to write something remotely intellectual about it - and an intellectual film it is. I guess they are the fans of in-your-face action or slapstick rubbish!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(I apologize for wordiness, grammar and tangents as it was very late, ahead of time.Yes, there is black, there is white.You can't have black without white, good without evil.The miracle of life is that each Generation has "thought" they had it better than the last, then so quickly the long for the Good olé day when in fact, we're there any, ever, "Good olé Days". People just got away with more, that's all. We had WW I and WW II, the Nazi's, further back, slavery, unbelievable.Not to long ago, as kids, there was no Facebook, linked IN, Internet, Playstation's with graphics getting close to CGI (they say that's coming in PS4 this summer)- studio's at home that would blow a producer's mind a mere 20 years ago, but why not a flood of great songwriters now that it;s affordable to almost everyone? Artist's didn't think about studio's, they thought about their songs, there days we have so many choices, we sometimes don't know what to do, but ask yourself, if there are so may studio's and even the cheapest, in the right hands, can be master ready without high end channel strips, so where are all the new . r "The Beatles", Led Zeppelin". Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Who? SPOILER ALERT This movie show's and shows that sometimes, there are no words, feelings, emotions, expressions to change a man or woman's heart, soul, mind. Back to the wonderment of the miracles and mysteries that without pain,there would be no PAINLESS, relief, joy, happiness. Without Love, there would be no hate or Loveless.Without Evil, there would be no need for good. We are a world of complex human beings that have a balance called FAITH.SPOILER ALERT I could not imagine what it would be to live life without HOPING that plan A will happen, or plan B, or plan C, D, E, F, G. Can you imagine hopelessness, knowing no matter what, there is no getting out of this, there is no hope, ever, never, ever, the "hope" inside us, that we may see a certain plan come to pass is a miracle/mystery in itself, otherwise, we would not bother.Opinion which I sometimes question and only typing 2. It rained for 40 days and 40 nights? That's a long time and to cover the earth, the rain would have to be falling at a rate so hard that it would sink a modern day USS Battleship, let alone a wooden boat smaller, perhaps, than the Mayflower.Your at a baseball game, standing in line, you find out that the person in front of you was born that day, as were you, you stand amazed, yet there are but 365 days in a year and some parks hold more than 50,000 people, so how many more have the same? 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125? No way. Mathematically, there could be at least 136 and don't be to surprised if it was the same year, If baseball fans range from 18-68, that is 50 years, That is a 1000 people that could have been born the same year too.Beliefs, for if we new there was nothing but darkness and nothingness, what would be the point in trying to leave a legacy for like the Egyptians, it will be gone in another 2000 years if not 200, or 20.SPOILER ALERT I believe in G-D, but that is me, how dark I felt watching this, a man who really had it together, (Mr Black) (SPOILER ALERT 2 spaces down). SPOILER ALERT Not have the answers for him, yet Mr. White, had them all - - - great play on words that Mr White was living in the Dark and My Black was living in light, SPOILER ALERT A MUST SEE, something you could watch again and pick up on things you missed the first time which I plan on doing later today - - I also find it interesting that this is how movies used to be made, no special FX, FOLEY, SOUND DESIGN (or that much anyway), just a room and dialog, a sure to be instant classic. This is truly a movie that we/they will study in film schools = = dialog, dialog, dialog. This is why some of the classics are classics, they are dialog, dialog and more dialog and I believe this movie should have been nominated for more -(SPOILER ALTER NEXT LINE) I have NEVER, EVER seen Tommy play a role so convincing and you were wondering the whole time, is there hope for this dude, what did he do, why did he fail to see his father, why would being with his mother be so terrible or was Mr. White sent to Mr Black as a test, similar to Job?(SPOILER ALTER NEXT LINE) double spaced.I wish I had known 2 things, what was said in the chow line and what it was Mr White did or did not do and why he could not be reach, even though he had some valid points, but that is also opinion, perspective and perception.Great, Great Movie, this should become a classic in time and prove that with the proper dialog a great film can be made without CGi, Car chases, Special FX. As a student of script writing, I and one other were asked to move on to the advanced class (one day, maybe I will as I have 3 films, 2 TV shows-ideas) and a good writer in my opinion will not write lines but rather be more like a reporter, taking notes on what they are talking about, now you know the characters have taken on a life of themselves and these writers did an excellent job.Frankii</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First movie in a while that actually got to me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is perhaps the greatest example of dialogue in a film that has been released in recent years. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L Jackson, show what great actors they are in this 90 minute conversation between the two.It's much harder then it looks to keep an audience intrigued for that long with just two men talking in a single room for the whole time. The film is based off the Cormac McCarthy play and with the exception of perhaps David Mamet, no one has ever written better dialogue then McCarthy.This film focuses on the problems with Black and White versions of both cultural worldly living and spiritual living. I don't think there was a single time during this film where I felt bored by what was happening.It raises perhaps some of the best questions regarding living in this world. The movie is smart enough to not take either side and give both men great arguments to support their side.In the times of films that focus on nothing more then grand explosions and car chases, its a nice change of pace to see this sort of film that's actually about something.I will admit that I actually teared up during this movie that's how good the dialogue really was. I really didn't want this movie to end and wished it would have lasted at least another hour. This is the kind of film that should be shown in Philosophy classes.</fullReview>

The plot of the movie is their discussion.Their discussion stays on course for most of the time. I think towards the end, occasionally they do stray away a bit but that's OK. The discussion itself is very interesting, although not as deep as I expected it to be. There's a dose of humor in some of their arguments which I liked a lot. It made me smile, even laugh a couple of times.If you want a nice intellectual experience without the burden of things too hard to understand then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

It's for people who are not lazy to meditate on matters we are too lazy to consider on everyday's rush.You can be sure that the content of this movie will reverberate in your mind for a while after the movie is over.Again, a 'must see' for opened minds willing to discuss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How good and yet not satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy movies that take me away into another world, lead me thru a joyful, sad or thrilling story and that enriches all that with amazing imaging and music.This movie did nothing like that for me, and yet it is a masterpiece. There is no story here captured on film, and yet there is one. Even though it is an uncut conversation between two men only, it reveals enough to make the story appear piece by piece. The acting is excellent, the set and details in it are amazing.However, to get people thinking about what these two are talking about, I don't think a movie is necessary. Reading it would do. But I do admit what a pleasure it was to have Tommy and Samuel give it intonation and mimic.In the end, as a movie in my today's entertainment world it did not take me away. It left me here in this world and had me wrap my head around the issues these men were conversing about. I have enough of that in my world already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't let a movie come to my deep mind for a very long time. Movies are movies; there are limited facts in them therefore limited lessons. I couldn't live without movies; but the reason is more like to add difference life experience through watching those stories. But from time to time, as we are lucky enough to have really great people who write and who act, there are some movies that would completely blow our mind, not because how fantasy they look, but the deep deep thinking they bring up. The Sunset Limited is definitely one of them. McCarthy is absolutely one of the best writers.The mood and atmosphere from the film is surrounding me since. I woke up with the deep disappointing yet also sympathy in my mind and they were actually, freaking scary; although likely because of other stuff happened yesterday? ? Anyway, it took me the whole morning to pick up the warmness. Was people good to begin with? My friend offered me this idea that people carry what from their previous life; if they were good before, they were good, and will continue; if there were bad before, then this life is going to punish them in a way, eventually; and the life on earth is like a long lesson where we need to develop our soul from it.This movie; it is a thoughtful flowing voice? ? It will, only if you listen, tell you so many things that matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bold Movie Making ? Masters at Work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bold Movie Making ? Masters at Work. This movie will absolutely not appeal to action junkies and comedy addicts. Does it leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end and will you want to bring your family together to watch it? Most definitely not. Is it a thriller or a drama? Well not really, but it was a thrill for me to watch it.This movie will interest people who watch an inordinate number of movies or people who regularly read good books. Anyone who can appreciate a product of either medium when that product makes you think throughout and till the end will likely enjoy this movie. It is challenging and will make you feel like you are investing time in art, an investment I believe pays off handsomely. It is deeply engaging. It is not entertaining in the traditional sense but it is an experience you will not soon forget and a spectacle you will not see again for a long long time if in fact you ever do. The author Cormac McCarthy, a hot novelist, whose projects appear to always have a line-up of producers wanting the movie property rights, wrote this play "The Sunset Limited". It's about two men having a discussion; the whole story takes place in a single barren apartment. Who would want to make a movie about that? I suppose the play would require superb dialogue, the likes of which keeps you interested early on and does not let off as time passes; it would also have to feature two actors who are masters at their craft and have theatrical and movie experience. The actors are Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L.Jackson. You see where I'm going! The topic of the discussion is God and the value of faith on the one side, as perceived by a very smart and likable evangelical; on the polar side is the well known existentialist's point of view and the usual despair and angst associated with that philosophy, as argued by an equally smart professor in full possession of the expected intellect. If that does not sound like a commercial hit, I don't know what?! Of course, I could argue that it takes a certain amount of self indulgence for an actor/director to make this movie, but I would not be sincere. I enjoyed the repartee between Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones way too much to do so, but I've read hints to that effect in other reviews and critics. If there was self indulgence on Jones part, I don't care. Tommy Lee Jones, well acquainted with that author's work as he starred in McCarthy's "No Country for Old Men", was fortunate to get a shot at this property and he had the fortitude to bring it onto the screen. The concept is not without merit. By making a movie, Jones can use all that this form of art has to offer to enhance the experience the play would have to offer to start with. Close-ups, calculated angles and visual perspectives, scene environment sound effects, all are used to bring us a performance the play in a theatre could not quite deliver as effectively. How many people have seen or will see the play? How many will get the chance to do so? How many will watch the movie? Because T.L. Jones made this movie, the number answered in the first two instances will be greater. As for the third question, whatever the number is, that is the number of people who can be thankful for Jones fortitude.Albert Camus and J.-P. Sartre would grin appreciatively at Jones delivery of McCarthy's words. All good and enthusiastic Christians would applaud Jackson's character's valiant effort to save the sinner. Jones and Jackson are the perfect choice for the two characters; they masterfully convey their respective character's feelings, never over doing it. No matter how often the following cliché has been heard before, it has never ringed as true for me as it does with these two actors and this movie: "It's as if the lines had been written just for them." I read some thirty reviews of the movie, the ones preceding mine, and I read many critics; I hope and trust I did not repeat anyone else's unique observations but am sure I am repeating in my own way that this movie is a brilliant film and that Jackson and Jones are at their best here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These few words I'm writing now are the reason I've registered here.You see. As soon as I've got the film with Jackson and Jones on the cover I understood it was worth watching. They are two old friends and no bad movies could have been produced with such a collaboration. I didn't know what was the plot or who the author was.So I've watched. Few minutes of the film I watched it in translation. After few twisty lines I turned translation off. I started to rewind a bit because of the Jackson's accent (I'm not too good of an English speaker), but it was absolutely necessary. I was eager to GET IT. I understood some points. I understood viewpoints of the heroes. I waited for resolution. And there it came - nothing.Actors did well, extremely well (which is predicable enough), the wording was great (some quotes could be borrowed i think) but i didn't get what had been the purpose for this piece of work to be done. I mean nothing changed. No sense in this dialog whatsoever. As I understood two men remained in their states of beliefs. Neither we see the author's attempt to have his own vision on the matter discussed in the dialog. So what's the point of that.I begun to think that i missed something. That brought me to IMDb and to reading some watchers reviews. I have to say that i have read them all (almost). I also need to say that they were all sound and stuck to the point. And I support them all. This movie was good. Fantastic as a piece of Art. But there was no philosophy whatsoever. This is pure entertainment. It makes You think. A lot. It drags you out of your comfort zone and slaps a few times with some twisty moments, but than drops you back in the end. Leaving you with your own concepts and giving you no advise on how to consider the seen at all. Which is fantastic. I think that those reviews with the votes less that 8 are just misapprehending that this is just an entertainment. And a very good one. It even made me write this down, which is a very unusual thing for me to do.Standing ovations to the people involved in creation of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems atheist hates the movie and believers don't, yet the movie does not choose either side. It tries to show both as hopeless cases of being converted to the other. Yet in the end, if you take the sum of their lives, who's live would you choose: The easy, rich, intellectual who only looks after himself and has no reason to live. Or the very dramatic, traumatic, poor person who spends all his time looking after other totally useless people, but enjoys every moment of being alive. From that point of view its easy to understand why atheist would hate this movie. But if an atheist ever wants to know why he can't convince a true believer, he should watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those few movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of movies nowadays have all those flashy effects, CGI, barely any storyline and one dimensional bad guys. Such movies usually don't age well since CGI and effects are constantly upgraded.I think this is one of those movies which that just doesn't get old.Its just two old men talking about life and god in a single worn down room. There is no need for special effects, punchy one liners or even names. This is done so minimalistic that it seems just perfectly balanced. The story arc within the discussion moves at a nice pace. Nearly every line can make you think...if you are into that kind of stuff.This one of those movies i recommend watching actively. Whereas in other movies you can walk away and get a pizza at the next market, come back and they are still running/shooting/screaming this movie needs your attention.Oh and you can be certain there wont be a sequel/prequel or any other kind of quel...which makes this even more powerful.After watching this i feel compelled to read the play....and i don't read often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a pure gem. A two-man show that delivers hope and despair at the same time, giving us two extremely opposite points of view, and even being an atheist I couldn't pick a side. Both of them had their convictions and believed their own truth. The movie shows us how can directors and producer make a wonderful movie without almost any resource, except by recruiting excellent actors like Samuel and Tommy. I've seen lots of their movies, but in my opinion this is their best acting so far. Marvelous dialogues within the most controversial discussion that there will ever be. Totally recommended for the both sides of debate, whether you are a Christian or an atheist.</fullReview>

This movie is just those two actors talking to each other, so I don't think that will appeal to everyone. This movie is based on on play and had that definite feel of one. The main reason to watch this movie is because of the acting. This is easily one of, if not the best acted movie of this year and of many years. The movie felt like it was all done in one take, and the way the acting was I wouldn't be surprised if it was. This is a rare movie that sucks you in with the acting and story and keeps you interested all the way until the end and keeps you thinking about it long after it's over. Overall, a movie that I really enjoyed but it's not for everyone. I think it's very much worth watching. I give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you discuss with someone who you're trying to prevent from committing suicide?That's pretty much the film. This HBO made, simplistic, interesting film really had me thinking about life and death and how easy it is for life to be taken away from you.I always viewed people who attempted suicide as cowards, afraid of life so they give up. Upon watching this it made me realise that there's generally more to it, yet Tommy Lee-Jones character stood up to my stereotype.Black (Jackson) symbolises a better life, a life that even though is worse than White's (Lee-Jones) is still worth living. He's found love in the little things, religion and a home and that's enough to get by day to day.White comes off as this arrogant person who listens but then just goes against what's said, refusing to see any other option.If you want a movie that you can sit down and thoroughly engage yourself in, then I'd recommend this. The actors were great, the whole play style to it fitted, and it's well written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I was truly mesmerized by this film. It did't go in any way I would have been able to predict - anywhere throughout the movie. As a fan of both TL and SL I was drawn to watch this movie just because they were both in it. I was KEPT glued to my seat watching it for both the acting ability, the storyline and overall, I have to admit, I wanted to see who would win....In my opinion, they both lost in the end, not saying the ending was bad, it was inspiring is what it was and left me thinking for days, if there WAS a final battle that played out like this, which side would i be on... Both sides had compelling arguments for their case, both sides did excellent jobs in laying out their arguments... was one side more compelling than the other? I would say that TL's side (if this was a debate) won hands down.. Does that make his side the winner? I am not sure...That said... on the movie itself... I don't think I have EVER watched a movie with only 2 characters in it... EVER.. no extras, no supporting cast, just two men. Heck, even in 12 angry men, there was supporting cast. Do NOT let this sway you from watching this movie. It will keep you enthralled for the entire duration of the movie and unlike most, you will leave the theater (or wherever you see it) COMPLETELY satisfied that your dollars were well spent.</fullReview>

It's amazing how movies can cost millions to make and this one was filmed in one room with two actors and was better than any "block buster" I can think of. The content is complex and not exactly entertaining, however its not really meant to be. The conversation between the two characters is philosophical and poetic, a movie where I had to focus and concentrate but for a great reason. This is one of those films that you will think about for days afterward.

		<shortDescription>Riveting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a stunning piece of work, period. It's Samuel L. Jackson's finest performance, complemented by a restrained intensity from Tommy Lee Jones; and McCarthy's script is insightful, dramatic, and structurally flawless- a work of art.A two-man-cast dialog between Athiest and Believer sounds like a cinematic recipe for disaster...but not in this case. "The Sunset Limited" establishes its dramatic impact from its opening lines, and never relents. It's confrontational where "My Dinner with Andre" was passive; it engages the audience, involves them in the debate almost as an active participant...it cajoles, it patronizes, it preaches.Each character makes a convincing case for their respective belief. One almost wonders how the Athiest White has survived as long as he has with such icy cynicism and despair, while Black makes the case for the Believer with inspired, pragmatic eloquence.Athiest or Believer, Jew or Gentile, Black or White...we come away from this film realizing that we escape damnation not necessarily by the embrace of prophets, but by recognizing the precariousness of our mortality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is only my second review of a movie on IMDb. I see a lot of movies but am compelled to take time out of my life to impose my opinion on very few of them. THE SUNSET LIMITED, however, is deserving enough for me to spend such time to write this review. What seems simple turns out not to be so simple at all. Two men sitting and talking around a small dining room table pretty much all throughout the film doesn't sound all that appealing, now does it? But the things they discuss... well that's some powerful stuff!Samuel L. Jackson plays a God fearing (but far from perfect) man with a violently checkered (and criminally plagued) history who longs more than anything to save a man who just tried to hurl himself in front of a NYC commuter train. It is clear that he has had a very hard life, full of suffering and pain. For him EVERYTHING was a struggle. Despite that, he genuinely believes that if he lives out the remainder of his life right, he will get to see all those he has loved so dearly again. He also admits his flaws and does not come across as a 'holy roller' type at all. His words are riveting. They are authentic.Tommy Lee Jones, on the other hand, plays a man who seemingly has walked the straight and narrow. From how he speaks, he has had every advantage in life... but he has gained no spirituality, no 'guiding light' whatsoever. He holds no emotion, not even a microscopy of love, for those that brought him into this world. Instead, he seems more bitter towards them (and everyone, in general) for his very existence. His worldly view of things have brought him to a platform in a 155th street subway station where he honestly seeks to end his misery. He simply wants the peace that nothingness can bring him. Oddly enough, though he seeks death, he does talk of taking great care to assure no one is able to witness this grisly event. He, therefore, has no idea how anyone was able to save him since no one was there... He checked.BOTH men have buried everyone they have known in their lives. But clearly their experiences have brought them to very different places... not in the way you'd expect. They have ironically opposing vantage points in terms of their takes on the 'afterlife.'All through the movie, neither man mentions the other's name. Henceforth they are known simply as 'black' (Jackson) and 'white' (Jones)... Not even an insignia of a proper name is shown on Jackson's work uniform, which he wears through the entirety of the film.The first part of the movie, it's Jackson who pretty much runs the show. We get to learn, bit by bit, more and more about each man (we also learn that the term 'taking the Sunset Limited' refers to those who take their life by throwing themselves in front of a train). The last half of the movie, it's Jones at the helm... and WOW! His views sure puts everything in a major tailspin. Once he gets to talking (I mean REALLY talking) things begin to look a whole lot different... In the beginning of the movie he seemed somewhat restrained, revealing very little. But once he get's to rolling no one can argue with his angle, no matter how dismal it may be!Jones' character's conclusion that only the ignorant (or 'dummied down') people chose to keep living because they are still lost in their hopes and dreams of a better tomorrow... whereas the smartest (or 'most educated') people would be welcoming death with open arms (to the point of actually seeking it out) because they have come to terms with the ugly truths of life via their advanced knowledge is certainly a perspective that most I am sure have never thought of... Yet it makes perfect sense--especially when he argues the point of the tree of life as mentioned in the bible, which basically insinuates the very same reasoning.To be honest, this film has scripted a lot of the things that have laid keep in my mind at one point or another as I get up there in years. I imagine this is part of the 'wisdom' of aging we all hear so much about... For me this was an eerily ironic yet enlightening experience. I guess I'm glad to know that my developing thought pattern is pretty much normal, though it may still be a bit abstract. I certainly never expected someone to put these things to paper, much less on script.To say this movie is 'deep' is an understatement. The story needs to unfurl before your eyes so the viewer can savor it as if it were a fine wine. The scripting, acting and pacing are all perfect. There are even a few comical moments as the chemistry between the two men becomes more resolute. Though they have widely differing opinions, each seems to respect the views of the other... and Jackson's character appears to welcome the intellectual stimulation, as well as the challenge to prove his faith in God. This movie should be (and probably will be) watched many times over, even though the first viewing will leave a residual marinade in your brain for a long time to come. There is something for everyone in this film, believers and non-believers alike. There will be no ultimate answer... no right or wrong. We just get a crystal clear view of each man's conclusions and how they came to have them.I really don't want to spoil this movie for anyone by revealing too much more. I feel I've said too much already. A full 10-star movie indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Movie: One That Makes You Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Limited, The (2011) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Thought-provoking drama about a black religious man (Samuel L. Jackson) who stops a white atheist (Tommy Lee Jones) from killing himself. Later that day the two men find themselves inside the black man's ghetto apartment where they share stories about their past as well as their different views on religion, life and death. This film is based on the Cormac McCarthy play of the same name but I had no idea what the film was about. I basically went into this thing based on the reputations of Jackson and Jones and the end results was a movie that makes you think and that's pretty rare these days. The film runs just under 90-minutes and we only have two different characters who are trying to figure out the other. The only thing that brought these men together was Jones' attempted suicide and Jackson being there to save him. I must admit that the film was extremely deep and it's probably going to be hard for most to gather everything with just one viewing but the opinions brought up from both characters will probably stay with most for a very long time. The screenplay by McCarthy does a terrific job at bouncing back and forth between various subjects. Throughout the dialogue we learn about both men and we get various bits and pieces as the film moves along. We learn that Jackson was in prison where he nearly beat a man into becoming a deformed cripple but this wasn't the worst thing he has done in his life. We learn that Jones hated his parents and doesn't have a single friend. The film takes basic set-ups like these and takes them into so many directions that you can't help but hang onto every word that's spoken and can't wait to see where it leads. The discussion of religion is one of the most frank conversations I've ever heard. Jackson's very passionate about God and his reasons make sense. Jones, on the other hand, is very passionate that there isn't anything out there and his reasons also make sense. The film doesn't try to say which person is right or why the other is wrong. Instead we're given two characters with different opinions and that's what makes the story work so well. Both Jackson and Jones do splendid work and there's no question that both give some of the best performances we're going to see in 2011. Jackson has the louder role and there's no one better when it comes to giving passionate line reading. Jones has mostly a quiet part but he says so much with that wonderful face of his that you can feel his pain even when he isn't saying anything. Both men do a terrific job together and what I enjoyed most is how their acting towards one another changed as the film moved along and as their characters became more familiar and comfortable with the other. The film asks a lot of questions and if you're looking for answers then you might be disappointed. The movie makes the right choice of not trying to answer everything but instead it just throws ideas out there and forces the viewer to make up their own mind. This is a complicated little movie but it's a real gem and Jones does a very good job bringing it to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect film ensemble theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps the perfect casting of fine, fine ensemble theater onto film.The Sunset Limited is a timely thing to be injecting into the dialog as the "new atheist" pressure ratchets up. I'm not saying that it captures all sides of the debate in an all-encompassing way: The overtly Manichean staging sees to that. But the voices of Black and White are refreshing and overdue for consumption by a thinking, feeling public. Not since Duvall's The Apostle have I felt such a sense that someone, somewhere is trying to comb out the noise and get the dialog on the right track.Add to all that the fine technical work; the set, costuming, blocking, direction, and editing; and this is more than a winner.A friend warned me that the ending would be bleak. I'm not sure that's altogether true. The creation of this artifact is itself the sounding of a clarion call to look with new eyes at life, death, and the possible role of a sturdy, heartfelt faith in redeeming a fallen planet. Who gets the last word in this show? I don't think it's a decided thing. And I feel that's the strength of this production. It may sound hackneyed, but this has always been the measure of great dramatic art; that, like the ultimate fate of Cabiria, the possibility of redemption (or absence thereof) is left solidly in the hands of the spectator.If you like good-and-properly written stage drama, you'll get the best of all worlds: A fine drama in the hands of a capable, sturdy, focused screen rendering.I hope you like it as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I must say wow. This is really something you won't expect. Picture this, two guys sitting in an apartment and are having a discussion. They are talking about life and death, believing and unbelieving. And they go on for an hour and a half. What's your first thought? Not so interesting? Well, I suggest you think again. Because this one is a winner here. It totally delivers. If you are focused and you think along, you'll get the point and believe me, you are surprised in the end and maybe even you say wow. The movie has a power to open some eyes.Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson are mesmerizing together. Very good performances by those great actors. Text is impressive. I mean, all this stuff just works man. There are no limits whether to see or when to see it. I just say it may make some good to someone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think HBO has done it again. I believed that Tom Hanks and Spielberg were unbeatable, but this one just got me. Wonderful performances by both the actors. Gave me a feeling that i was watching a theatrical performance. The camera placements were amazing and captured every inch of their expressions. Display of faith of Mr. black and the visualization of the darker side by Mr. white were so vivid. This is a concept (film with a bunch of people in a room) that has to backed by brilliant performance and I believe that they were. This movie reminded me of 12 angry men and man from earth, which I thought were the best in their category, but I think The Sunset Limited deserves to be put on that wall. I hope that everyone will enjoy their wonderful performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God is Black and the Devil is White. That's not true. There's no such analogy in the movie. It's just a contrast between different souls.This masterpiece is the most honest and objective film i've seen in years. It fits perfectly in the gender of an essay - not sure if this is close to be a correct designation, but here it is.At the beginning it seems that Black is controlling the argument, but hopefully White uses stronger arguments to justify is tormented soul. The dialogs are always intense, from the beginning till the end, and there are no shallow words, every single one has weight and density.Said so, i'm not a believer in the common semantics of "soul". Soul is just a result of electric impulses with our body. When we die, our soul ends. I'm not a believer in God either. Therefore this film was brilliant.But its brilliance does not come only from the fact that it has appeal to atheists. It is always measuring both sides. God/no God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Atheist Waits To Pounce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a major disappointment given the talent. However, knowing much of McCarthy's atheistic writing, it was obvious to me from the start that the religious advocate would be: a) non-intellectual; and b) defeated by his own doubt at the end. Yawn. McCarthy let's the Jackson character do most of the talking throughout the piece, so "stupid" people of faith can be duped into hoping that perhaps the Jackson character is making some headway in his quest to save Jones. But, of course, McCarthy is really only saving his "brilliant" atheistic diatribe to be inserted into Jones' mouth, in rapid "wow, that's said so fast, it must be true" grand finale fashion, at the end.It's a dirty pool trick on any viewer unfamiliar with McCarthy's personal bent, who's hoping for an honest and consistent resolution of the discussion between the characters. Instead, we get what amounts to a political rant designed to blow faith out of the water.Bravo, not.The dishonesty of the "dramatic" structure ruins the entire film. Although, I'm sure know-it- all atheists like McCarthy and the Jones character will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a note I posted on Facebook.... I LOVE THIS MOVIE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW!!! "The Sunset Limited" is a movie on HBO that has a two-star cast, Samuel L. Jackson as "Black" and Tommy Lee Jones as "White". That's right; the characters are called Black and White and it's not a movie about race.I must say that I had seen the title "The Sunset Limited" many times while channel-surfing and not once did it catch my interest. I wouldn't even highlight the title to see what this movie was about or to see who starred in it.But this morning after I saw a small trailer and some commentary from other actors about how wonderful this movie is and the fact that it stars 2 of Hollywood's best actors around, I decided to do a search to see when it was coming on again. Well there it was listed in the ON DEMAND menu and I could watch it right now. So I did.And what I saw was absolutely brilliant. So much so that I made myself some breakfast and watched it again.So I'm not going to tell you what the movie is about BUT I will tell you that I think that if you have cable that you should make and take the time to watch this movie. It's on "ON DEMAND", so you can't say that you missed it because you had to work or it comes on at the same time as your favorite show. No excuses will be appropriate. For those of you, who don't have cable; go to a friend or family member's house to watch it. You would if it were the Super Bowl.I would be very interested in your thoughts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally enjoy this type of movie... almost as if you're watching a stage play, but I couldn't get into this one because the dialogue was so unrealistic. The arguments the Christian's character was giving was so shallow and circular that I was getting too frustrated watching it!!And I kept watching because I thought there may be some kind of twist to it where in the end, the atheist realises he's the maker of his own destiny and the Christian realises he's living life with a crutch and that's a poor excuse for a life... but no... Nothing was to be learned from this movie. It was a waste of time and what a shame because with those two great actors it could have been something special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the proof that you don't need millions of dollars to create a really good movie. Two fantastic acting performances open up a room that you want to be in. Yes, you want to sit next to them, you want to get that Whine and talk with them throughout the night. Jones with his always slightly saddened and limited facial expression fits perfect in the role of the life frustrated man. While on the other hand there could be no one more convincing than Jackson. With his Facial expressions Stunts (which never are to much, but make it so real) he is in fact the exact opposite(Black-&gt;White). The directing was in my opinion very good. The switching of positions (Table-&gt;Couch...) where always placed very well and made this actually tine room so big and full of life. So sad, another fantastic Art movie which will pass by the masses unseen...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without that door with 5 locks the movie wouldn't have that sense that it has. The door is very strange - so many locks. If the Black is so secure in his believes, in his environment - why would he need the door like that. He brings home junkies. In my view it represents the breach in his bible... If he is the man full of energy, with a firm point of view, dominant in conversation with White, and White in his turn looks like a "Death Row Prisoner", an old man who wants and lingers to die, at the end they rotate the roles, now he talks, now he makes you believe, now Black is an old man, who's world crumbles, falls apart. How the story's gonna end, here the omission puzzles us. Is White going to commit suicide? Is he gonna read the bible out of curiosity first? Then another thought comes, that lies beneath the first one - what's going to happen with Black? Is He going to live? And how? Overall it's an excellent movie, true dialog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is about to men in an apartment talking about religion basically. just them. tommy lee Jones character white and Samuel l Jackson's character black. in the whole hour and a half its just them talking. i was looking forward to seeing this film because of the stars and because tommy lee Jones was not only the star but executive producer and director. when i found that Jones and Jackson were the only two men in the film i got even more excited. there are two sides to everything. for religion particularly Christianity which is whats discussed, we have people who believe and who don't believe. Jones character does not believe in god and Jackson's character does. Jackson's character black saved Jones character white from killing himself. in the movie they discuss why they believe what they believe and why believe it. tommy lee Jones made a very convincing non believer. both of them are telling each other why they should believe what the other person believes. black is trying to show white why to believe in god and trying to save him from committing suicide again. this movie is not only genius but thought provoking and debatable. not in a bad way. it makes you see the two sides to religion and make you wonder about your beliefs. i was afraid with only Jones and Jackson in the film it would get boring and there would be nothing interesting to talk about. it didn't. they both brought up interesting topics to think about through the whole film. the writing of this film is genius. the acting of this film is genius. and this is defidently award winning for sure. tommy lee Jones is both a brilliant actor and director and whats more amazing is he has never been to one acting class in his 40 years career. these two actors made there characters interesting and made them great. its currently airing on HBO. defidently see it.</fullReview>

Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel Jackson are so wonderful at showing raw human feelings and questions. Samuel Jackson character black had me longing to grow into the person he had become loving people and having a great responsibility to others. While Tommy Lee Jones character white had me feeling sorry for so many people that may not have found meaning in their lives.

		<fullReview>I have no idea why Tommy Lee Jones thought this would be good for video. I can understand that as a live play it may hold water, but as a film it is just ridiculous. Some of the acting is fine, some of it is really strained - the script was badly written in many parts, and ultimately it sounded like both actors were just rehearsing for a live show. I found the ending lacking to say the least. I mean, I get it, but it certainly wasn't profound in any way. You could really do this complete movie in a matter of six lines, and finish it in under five minutes.I recommend watching this if you don't get a chance to eavesdrop on strangers taking public transport for a two hour trip. It's about as entertaining.</fullReview>

Raw and powerful. It reminds me of an earlier teleplay named "'Night Mother" with Sissy Spacak and Anne Bancroft in it's brilliance and power. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson are matched perfectly in their respective roles of "White" and "Black", however, all is not what it seems on the surface. Is "White" good, and "Black" bad? or is it something else? Each character has a compelling and powerful argument. Is it enough to influence the other's perception and understanding of just who they are? Will it change your own perceptions? Watch it..a definite "10".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read about 20 or more reviews about this film, I am in my early 60s, I consider myself intelligent, I am a "thinker", I am a philosopher,I am involved in politics, but I found this film just hard work.In a way the film leaves the viewer hanging in the air, there were no conclusions, just a lot of aimless talking.Tommy Lee Jones wants to end his life, Samual L. Jackson wants to try and save him, and that's it.If I had been in this room with the two of them I would have injected some dialogue of my own, like as follows.The world is an impartial place, it is up to everybody to make their own place in this world, nobody can do that for any of us, but because we are spiritual beings we do need each other, this is called society, community.Tommy Lee Jones' character has become depressed by his surroundings, Samuel L. Jackson believes in God, and the Bible.The Western World has turned it's back on Christianity, in favour of "self", this ensures an end to society, and community.And maybe Tommy Lee Jones wanted to end his life because he felt so alone, ?.We will never know.I give this movie 2 stars for effort. Incidentally I am a fan of Tommy Lee Jones. I like both actors very much, but their dialogue could have been more substatial, fuller, richer, these are the only words I can think of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still cannot fathom this movie. Despite the cheerful, compelling trailer, this movie is quite different than that. It's both philosophical and deep. Regardless of your faith or lack of faith, this movie challenges you to think, not only about religion, but about mankind itself.Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel Jackson star in this fantastic film filled with much camera work (not too overdone), and powerful scripting. Of course, the credit must go to Cormac McCarthy for first creating the play which was turned into this adaptation. However, never before in my life have I felt so driven to finish this movieThis truly is, out of thousands of movies I've watched in my 59 years, one of the most epic masterpieces I have ever seen.Go see it right now.

		<fullReview>After "stumbling" across this masterpiece the only word that comes to my mind is WOW. Thank you Tommy Lee Jones for bringing together the collective genius of McCarthy, Jackson and Jones. The "webmaster" wants ten lines. I had the same debate with an former student visiting my library last evening. He is a Muslum/Christian/Diest/Atheist and he was questioning my belief in the existence of God. My Inadequate attempt to answer was "Jonas, look at all the books around you, especially those about Science, Philosophy, Politics and Literature. In every book, by every author, this theme is found to recur....in fact, look at the Sagan section...he was an avowed atheist for the majority of his life, yet, there is his novel, "Contact"....his final words, were '....there is an intelligence that antedates the universe', he wrote an entire book about the subject, his final, I believe...'The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God', pick Jefferson and his 'Bible' and why he wrote it, pick....." there, I have written at least ten lines. This HBO Movie was the best summary of that transcendent debate this inadequate reviewer has ever seen or read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very depressing film. With 2 characters limited to one room for 90 minutes, what else do you expect.Is this a conflict over right and wrong or virtue versus non-virtue? What is the author of this trite trying to address here?Samuel L. Jackson represents good despite the fact that he has been imprisoned for murder. Tommy Lee Jones, as "the Professor" is the most depressed, negative person ever to be on this earth. Apparently, Jackson saved Jones earlier in the day from leaping to an on coming train. The play takes place in Jackson's home where the two have gone. A detailed philosophy of life ensues. It isn't really interesting. I thought we were on to something when the characters speak about the number of books read and the professor speaks about society ending at Dachau.The constant subject changes and mood swings do little to enhance this film. You're so depressed that your waiting for the movie to end.At last, the doors open when Jones leaves. Is this Camus's "No Exit?" Thank the Lord it came fast enough.</fullReview>
